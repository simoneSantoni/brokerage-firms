Wells Fargo directors faced the biggest shareholder protest vote in the US banking sector in at least a decade as investors on Tuesday turned on the board over thesham account scandal.

Stephen Sanger, the chairman who has been handling the crisis at Wells after thousands of employees set up bogus customer accounts, was among the biggest targets of investor ire. Only 56 per cent of votes were cast in his favour, based on preliminary results, at a stormy annual meeting.

Three other directors   Enrique Hernandez, Federico Pea and Cynthia Milligan   also received less than 60 per cent backing.

It is the first time since at least 2007 that four directors in an S&P 500 bank received such low levels of shareholder support, according to ISS Analytics. Board members typically receive backing in the high 90s.

McDonald s chairman Mr Hernandez, who has been a director of the bank since 2003, sustained the largest protest with only 53 per cent backing.

Speaking after the results, Mr Sanger said he had no immediate plans to stand down but suggested he could go next year after he turns 72, the board s standard retirement age. He added that the bank would not replace directors as a direct result of the protest, even as he pledged a longer-term  refresh .

Mr Sanger said shareholders had told him  we don t want to see people kicked off the board  but he recognised they had sent directors a  clear message of dissatisfaction .

 We are committed to refreshing the board   over time.  Over the next four years at least six directors were in any case due to leave.

Mr Sanger came under fire from aggrieved investors who made the journey to the meeting venue, a hotel on the outskirts of Jacksonville, Florida. Security was heavy as attendees called on individual directors to explain to shareholders what they knew about the scandal, and when.

At one point the meeting was suspended as one man was dragged out. Two other attendees, surrounded by guards, left of their own volition to avoid also being forcibly removed. At least 16 security guards and two armed police officers were present to supervise fewer than 300 meeting attendees.

 You re saying we re out of order but Wells Fargo has been out of order for years,  said Bruce Marks, of the activist group Neighbourhood Assistance Corporation of America.

Attendees peppered Mr Sanger and chief executive Tim Sloan with a series of questions and grievances, ranging from conditions for workers toexecutive pay.

One Wells worker likened the system of sales targets to a  constant treadmill . When she complained that the bank pushed products on to customers who did not need them, her manager told her she was free to leave. Another said the pressure at the bank had been  intense . He said he suffered migraine headaches and went on to develop a brain tumour.

A mortgage customer who spoke came close to tears as she described her plight. A woman whose mother had Alzheimer s disease said she had not fully understood the loan that she had taken on.

Protesters called for the directors to face the audience. Apart from Mr Sloan and Mr Sanger, all were seated facing the stage and remained silent.

Mr Sloan told shareholders he was  deeply sorry  for the bank s behaviour.  You expect and deserve much more from us,  he said. But he said protesters were being  disrespectful  to board members.

Capital One Financial Corp. reported a 20% drop in first-quarter net income from a year earlier as losses jumped for U.S. credit cards and the bank took a bigger provision charge for credit losses.

The firm, known for its big presence in the subprime credit-card market, reported net income of $810 million for the first quarter, or earnings per share of $1.54. Excluding an item pertaining to a U.K. insurance customer refund reserve, the bank reported net profit of $910 million and earnings per share of $1.75.

Even so, the result badly missed Wall Street forecasts. Analysts had expected $937.5 million in net income and earnings per share of $1.92. Revenue of $6.5 billion also fell short of expectations.

Capital One shares fell nearly 6% at one point in aftermarket trading.

The bank, often looked at by analysts as a gauge of consumers' ability to pay back their debts, reported that domestic credit-card net charge-offs reached 5.14% in the first quarter. The was up from 4.16% a year prior. The companywide provision for credit losses jumped 30% from a year earlier to $1.9 billion.

Chief Executive Richard Fairbank said the bank raised its outlook for full-year, domestic card charge-off rates to the high end of a 4%-to-around 5% range. That was up from the bank's prior expectation of the mid-4% range. Mr. Fairbank said this revision is "based on portfolio dynamics and industry conditions [the bank] observed in the first quarter."

* "https://www.wsj.com/articles/credit-card-competition-is-running-too-hot-1485370135"

Mr. Fairbank voiced concerns about growing consumer indebtedness, saying the first quarter marked the seventh consecutive one in which card loans industrywide are growing faster than household income.

"Against this backdrop, we have been tightening our underwriting," he added. "We still see growth opportunities in our domestic card business, but our growth window is gradually getting smaller."

In one other area of concern, auto-loan performance, Mr. Fairbank also struck a cautious note. Used-car values have been declining, based on some indexes, resulting in higher losses for some auto lenders.

Mr. Fairbank said that Capital One's underwriting assumes declines in these prices and the firm is closely monitoring how these develop. Net charge-offs for Capital One's auto loans increased slightly from a year earlier to 1.64% in the first quarter.

Venture-Capital Firms Use Big Data  to Seek Out the Next Big Thing; A small group of firms hope to use analytics  to gain an advantage over mere humans

Computers are on the rise as Wall Street's brave new stock pickers. Now some Silicon Valley startup investors are giving big-data analytics a prominent role in the venture-capital arena.

In recent years a small group of emerging venture firms have been testing ways to remake the art of venture capital and turn it into more of a science. They're relying to varying degrees on what are, for their industry, radical new uses of software and data to help guide their investments.

Early-stage firm SignalFire, launched in San Francisco in 2015, mines vast troves of proprietary databases in real time to identify investment targets and support their development. Correlation Ventures brings proprietary data analytics and predictive computing into its decision-making on joining deals as a co-investor. NFX Guild, an investment firm that also has an accelerator for startups, runs software in the cloud that can help its startups find new investors.

Using the latest technology to find the best deals and help startups grow can make venture investors stand out from the crowd.

"A few days of advantage can mean the difference between winning and losing a deal," says SignalFire Chief Executive Chris Farmer. Compared with this new computer-driven approach, he says, operating the traditional way "is playing a game of telephone with tin cans and a string."

Helping the humans

In some ways this urge to automate key parts of venture investing mirrors Wall Street's recognition that computers do some things not only faster but also better than people when it comes to crunching gigantic sets of data.

BlackRock Inc., the world's largest asset manager, recently showed some of its stock pickers the door, having watched algorithmic and other computerized trading revolutionize the securities industry. Computer models are now doing more of the work that had been done exclusively by human asset managers who have long created sophisticated trading strategies.

In Silicon Valley, SignalFire uses software, data science and analytics in an effort to capture superior returns for its investors by both picking the right companies to invest in and helping them thrive. The firm's $53 million first fund aims to make 35 investments, and is about halfway there.

With former Google and Yahoomachine-learning experts on its staff, SignalFire says it finds investment opportunities by tracking millions of data sources in real time, such as monitoring capital flows into startups and movements of key employees. To gain useful insights, SignalFire has amassed its own vast sets of data on things like how companies react to competition, how satisfied their employees are and how their performance stacks up against that of their peers.

Ultimately, says Mr. Farmer, spotting a unique investment opportunity is still a human talent but the data analysis his firm does helps the best candidates stand out more. "We're using our technology to weaponize people with superhuman anomaly-detection powers," he says.

Talent search

SignalFire also uses a similar approach to helping its startups solve an ever-present problem for Silicon Valley founders: finding and attracting talent. The firm monitors and analyzes data about potential employees, such as their career moves and accomplishments, to help its portfolio companies with recruitment of rising stars.

Partners at Correlation Ventures have enlisted computer models to help them make speedy investment decisions so the firm can position itself as the ideal co-investor.

Financing rounds for startups can drag on for many months as the companies' founders search for investors that can provide the funding they need but won't ask for too much influence in return. For many startup founders, as much as one-third of their time is spent on fundraising and investor relations.

Correlation, which closed its first fund in 2012, guarantees an investment decision within two weeks, and never takes a board seat. The firm's approach is designed to achieve solid returns and mitigate risk by making dozens of investments each year across all sectors and investment stages, says David Coats, managing director. The firm has offices in Palo Alto, Calif., San Diego and New York.

Mr. Coats says Correlation's data-heavy approach uses proprietary analytics and predictive modeling to glean positive or negative investment signals for an ocean of investment options a promising market opportunity for a startup, for instance, or worrisome signs of excessive cash burn.

Correlation's approach is similar to the deep, broad statistical analysis of baseball players and game situations that has become de rigueur for professional teams. The investing signals that Correlation weighs in making its decisions are akin to analyzing in exhaustive detail how particular pitchers and hitters will perform against each other in specific game situations, or even certain weather conditions, Mr. Coats says, and the firm has a vast amount of data to produce those signals.

"The database contains details for tens of thousands of historical financings with associated outcomes," Mr. Coats says. "These volumes provide a more than sufficient learning corpus for our predictive analytics-based models."

Looking ahead

"If our thesis holds," says Mr. Coats, "our portfolio will be tilted to the more favorable outcomes."

It's still early, though, for Correlation, which recently raised $200 million for its second fund, to say how well the formula works. Of the 121 companies that the firm's first fund invested in, most are still in the early stages of development; a handful have produced returns for investors because they were acquired or went public, and about a dozen have gone bankrupt or out of business.

And what if the venture firms embracing computer analytics succeed?

Automation by definition takes the human out of the process. So is Silicon Valley's venture-capital corridor along Sand Hill Road in danger of becoming a ghost town? Even Mr. Coats says he hopes not. Predictive modeling can be powerful, he says, but for lead investors, "internal" human judgment is irreplaceable.

New Tools Give Better Picture, Literally, of Financial-System Risk; Researchers are using network analytics  and advanced data modeling to identify weak spots in the system that otherwise might go unnoticed

Kimmo Soramki has seen something strange happening in U.S. house prices. The math behind his findings is fiendishly complex, but he can show the results to anyone in seconds.

Mr. Soramki is a specialist in a kind of financial mapmaking: He takes a complex analysis of the relations between financial institutions or markets, and by weeding out some information and focusing on the most significant links, he can create simple treelike images that reveal something in this case, that housing prices have become increasingly correlated that might otherwise go unnoticed.

This type of analysis is part of a growing area of research that is changing how regulators and banks manage financial risk. Network analytics such as that used by Mr. Soramki, as well as new modeling approaches, allow researchers to show how thousands or millions of iterations of apparently simple financial exchanges or actions together can create a far more complex and at times unstable financial system than traditional economic theory might suggest.

A surprising finding

Already, such approaches are being used in bank stress-testing and to spot weaknesses in global markets. Some envision the technology eventually could be used to build a dashboard of the global financial system that regulators could monitor to spot crises before they hit.

Andy Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, fantasized in a 2014 speech about sitting in the financial equivalent of the bridge of the Starship Enterprise, from which regulators could test and watch for impending disasters, then intervene when necessary. The world isn't there yet and some argue it might not be desirable even if it were possible but the theories and computer models behind this vision already are being tested.

Mr. Soramki's company, Financial Network Analytics, is helping the Colombian central bank build a systemic-risk tool using data on payments that flow through the financial system. Institutions such as the Bank of England and the U.S. Office of Financial Research, meanwhile, have been working to build their own network models of banks, money managers and clearinghouses to study how shocks such as a bank failure or the Swiss central bank's abandoning its currency link to the dollar propagate through the financial system. In recent years, they have begun publishing the results of "https://www.financialresearch.gov/annual-research-reviews/files/2016-annual-research-review.pdf".

Mr. Soramki created the map of home prices to demonstrate his technology. On the map, which shifts and changes over the period from 2000 to the present, U.S. states are depicted as dots, linked to one another by lines. The shorter the line, the greater the similarity in house-price movements in those two states.

On a map showing the data for 2000, the dots are small and mostly far apart, and the "tree" appears very spread out. From roughly 2004 to 2008, as the housing bubble builds and then enters the crisis, the dots grow in size and turn from green to red, moving closer together and forming clusters, as price changes across the country become larger and more similar. As the links get shorter, so does the tree, signifying greater correlation. But what is really surprising is what has happened since the 2008 crisis: Changes in home values across states are more alike today than ever before.

"In the U.S. housing market, correlations have continued to rise even after the collapse of the bubble: The tree span has continued to shrink," says Mr. Soramki, who worked at the Bank of Finland and the New York Federal Reserve before starting his company in 2013.

"Visual network analysis improves our answer to existing questions, but can also expose questions we didn't know we had," he says. His work can't explain why this is happening; it can simply show that it is, highlighting an unexpected risk in this case that everyone could start losing money on real estate at the same time that would likely otherwise go unnoticed.

Other researchers are working on models that could someday be used to monitor financial markets. J. Doyne Farmer, an American scientist now at Oxford University's Institute for New Economic Thinking, is helping the Bank of England develop agent-based models to better understand how markets and other complex financial systems behave.

The models simulate how agents people, companies, institutional investors, etc. act and interact in markets and financial systems. Such programs have produced outcomes that more closely resemble what happens in the real world than do the predictions of classical economics.

Prof. Farmer thinks that in five to 10 years' time, such models could be used to make market and economic forecasts in much the same way we can now predict the weather. "The economy is more difficult we don't know the laws of physics for the economy but on first principles we don't really understand clouds either," he says.

Yet with enough data from the past, meteorologists can make reliable forecasts. Similarly, enough historical data about activity in financial markets could help make better models of the future. The problem is, people can adapt and change their behavior in a way that water molecules can't. "Clouds don't think," Prof. Farmer says.

Still, he believes that a lot of what happens in markets or economics comes down to accounting rules and legal contracts that are quite mechanical, so much of it is predictable and stable.

A moral hazard?

Many of the techniques and ideas in this field have come from other disciplines, including biology and engineering. Mr. Soramki's correlation trees, for example, are adapted from a method for mapping genomes. This cross-fertilization began in New Mexico at the Santa Fe Institute in the late 1980s, and it has led to an entire field of study known as complexity economics.

Even before the financial crisis, regulators were starting to take note. Now, private companies are investing in this research, aiming to develop products for the finance industry.

Alexander Denev, the head of quantitative research at data company IHS Markit, says there is still uncertainty about the answers such tools produce. One problem is that there isn't enough high-quality data. Another issue is selecting which model to use and even how to define what constitutes systemic risk. In stress-testing, U.S. and U.K. regulators require banks to use more than one model as a cross-check. But Mr. Denev says they ought to be using multiple models, even thousands, to show the variety of potential outcomes under different starting assumptions.

"This is where computing power and machine learning come in," he says, and the private sector tends to have more of that than regulators and central banks.

All of this could feed into a futuristic dashboard, but that leads to questions about how much influence regulators should have. "Dashboards lead to human insights, human insights lead to decisions, but no automatic rules should be used to circumvent the human part," Mr. Denev says.

Mark Flood, a research principal at the Office of Financial Research, says regulators shouldn't be in control of the financial system. "We need a gap between the regulator and the free market," he says. "You don't want the police driving everyone's car. You want them setting the speed limits and checking for drunken drivers."

Such regulatory interference could be a moral hazard for banks or investors, who would then expect to be saved from their own excesses. But as with the weather, or earthquakes, this kind of technology could help identify the kinds of crises that an ever-changing financial world can produce and to minimize the economic damage done when they hit.

The Future of Finance (A Special Report) --- British Banking Sector Braces for Difficult Times: The good news: Brexit may not hurt London's financial sector as much as people think; The bad news: Other things will hurt it a lot more

Brexit isn't the toughest challenge facing the City of London.

Banks in Britain are still languishing in the doldrums brought on by the financial crisis of 2008. Weak banking activity and low investment returns have caused revenue to shrink, leading to widespread cost-cutting and automation.

While Britain's planned departure from the European Union threatens London's position as the "investment banker to Europe," in the words of Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney, the impact that will have on London itself will likely be smaller than people think. EU clients provide only one-fifth to one-quarter of revenue for the City's finance sector.

Other, continuing pressures look more significant -- in particular, low investment returns and pressure from clients to cut costs. In a low-return world, everyone from fund managers to small individual investors wants to pay lower fees.

"Trading [is] a commodity business, it's about who can do it most efficiently," says Andrew Formica, chief executive of fund manager Henderson Group. "It's becoming a bit of an arms race in terms of technology investment."

Pressure to cut costs is fueling a move to passive investing, in which fund managers do much less trading and research. Where active managers remain, they have to cut costs, too, to stay competitive. This all feeds into less revenue for investment banks, forcing them to cut more costs.

And the same trends that are hurting banks in Britain are affecting big banks everywhere.

"The continued uncertainty makes it a lot harder to invest in the future," says Hakan Enver, operations director at Morgan McKinley Financial Services, a recruitment company. "It's a lot of things, not just Brexit," Mr. Enver says. "But that is good cover" for layoffs as well, he says.

The total number of people employed by all kinds of banking in the U.K. has fallen 22% from its precrisis peak in 2008, or by about 120,000 jobs, according to data from Britain's statistics office.

Technology is replacing people on trading floors and in the middle and back offices where trades are checked, confirmed and settled. Some of this is to give investors an edge in markets with computer-driven tools such as algorithmic and high-frequency trading.

But technology also means more work can be moved offshore or to cheaper locations. More reliable internet links with India, for example, mean people can work together on the same documents or files in real time.

One U.K. firm, Frontline Analysts, runs teams of equity and credit analysts based in India on behalf of investment banks in London. The bank can cut back its more expensive big-city staff to just those who interact with clients directly, but still have access to a cheaper team to do much of the number crunching and report writing.

Frontline's senior people can work from anywhere. One managing director, Daniel Davies, spent more than a decade as a bank-stock analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse and elsewhere, but now trains and oversees teams of India-based analysts from his home in Exeter in southwest England.

"Investment banks can't shift the front office and they can't shift the brand, but as time has gone on and margin pressure has been brought to bear, they've realized they need to cut costs per head," Mr. Davies says.

Investment-bank executives don't want all their research to be run from elsewhere because it is harder to monitor, while their most important analysts have to spend time selling ideas to clients rather than training and checking faraway number crunchers.

"We in Frontline stand in between and do the quality assurance," Mr. Davies says. "I can do that from a cafe or from my home office."

In Europe, new regulations will soon force all banks to charge clients for research. That is going to put even more focus on costs because investors won't be willing to pay for many research teams. Henderson's Mr. Formica says banks could set up joint ventures just for research to reduce and share the output. But for some, cutting more people is the more likely outcome -- either by outsourcing or no longer doing research.

Another big cost for banks everywhere is satisfying all of the extra reporting and compliance demands from regulators since the crisis. This involves a lot of repetitive, data-processing activity that is labor intensive, which has kept staff and real-estate costs high in banks' middle and back offices, particularly in the City, where office space is among Europe's most expensive.

How big banks are handling their compliance and other back-office work is something being looked at by Accenture, the global consulting and services firm.

Accenture cut 17,000 of its own back-office processing jobs, it says, by adopting what it calls artificial-intelligence tools. The company says it is now promoting the same kind of technology to banks, while also talking up the importance of retraining those who are displaced, as it did itself.

"No question, AI will lead to substantial job displacements over time," says Richard Lumb, Accenture's global head of financial services. "But the technology is still young . . . .The real power of AI is in how it augments workforces and makes it possible for people to do higher-value work."

Ultimately, Brexit is just one symptom of the growing desire in the U.S., the U.K., and across Europe to put up more borders between international trade and finance to protect unhappy voters at home. When it comes to banking, this protectionist theme was at work long before the Brexit campaign began. It is a theme that has led regulators increasingly to put up barriers between global banks' operations and capital bases in different countries, making them less efficient.

Kinner Lakhani, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, believes that the postcrisis crunch in financial activity has passed. But to stay profitable, he says, investment banks will need to cut costs further to substitute for economies lost through increased regulation. "Subsidiarization and Balkanization will challenge business models that don't have scale," he says. "Investment banks have adjusted significantly, but the process is not complete."

Former M&A banker Macron close to sealing deal of his life

It was supposed to be a career-ending move, but nearly a decade ago an ambitious civil servant chose to give up politics and enter finance. Fast-forward to the present day andEmmanuel Macronis expected to become the president ofFrancein two weeks  time, at theage of39.

So what exactly did Macron learn during his four-year stint at investment bank Rothschild, at the heart of French business? That was the subject of an article by the FT s Anne-Sylvaine Chassany and Arash Massoudi last month, which you can readhere.

Choice excerpt from the 1,300-wordpiece:

Former Rothschild colleagues and clients who worked with Mr Macron describe a hard-working, ambitious beginner who learnt fast and had a  gift for empathy  with clients. The graduate ofENA, the elite school that breeds France s future leaders, came recommended by powerful alumni of the institution, includingFranois Henrot, a longtime Rothschild partner. But young bankers were not so impressed.

 He was the guy who would constantly say  thank you ,  a former colleague said.  He didn t know what ebitda [earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation] was.

That may leave you green with envy, but Macron parlayed his early experience in politics to help clients such asNestlandAtosstrike important deals during his time at Rothschild.

So what does Macron s time as a banker and as economy minister under President Franois Hollande tell us about French M&A in the years to come?

That s the subject of a smart Lex notehere, which points out that the French state retains interests in62 listed companies. Lex concludes Macron is a  capitalist with distinctly French characteristics .Heallowed takeovers ofAlstom,LafargeandAlcatelduring his time in government, but angered executives atRenaultby raising the state s holding.

Should Macron defeatMarine Le Penin the second round of the vote in just under a fortnight, it sounds as though dealmaking will remain robust in France. That will be music to investment bankers  ears, especially given the strong start to dealmaking in 2017. Thomson Reuters reports that IB fees in France total $1.1bn, so far this year, which is the best annual start in a decade.

Whole Foods: Bidder on aisle 4?

Albertsonsis searching the M&A aisles of America for a high-quality (ideally organic) grocer to walk away with. Having failed to reach a deal withSprouts Farmers Market,Cerberus Capital Management,the private equity backer of the US supermarket operator,is now exploring a takeover approach forWhole Foods, theFT revealedon Monday night.

It s all very early. No bids have been made, but Albertsons is looking foradvisers to help it construct an offer. The Idaho-based company needs a deal as much as Whole Foods, which is under pressure fromJana Partners, the activist investor, to improve its performance.

Whole Foods is working withEvercoreto figure out what is in their best interest. The  strategic review  being conducted by the New York-based boutique advisercould lead to internal changes as well as sale (or nothing at all).

Exchanges M&A in flux

The global exchanges industry is still working out what will happen next after the failed mergerof theLondon Stock Exchange GroupandDeutsche Brse.

The issue inevitably surfaced last Friday at aWorld Federation of Exchangesderivatives conference, hosted   by some coincidence   by Deutsche Brse in Frankfurt, writes the FT s Philip Stafford.

DB deputy chief executiveAndreas Preussdeftly sidestepped the issue of dealmaking as it related to his company. Perhaps he was taking his cue from his bossCarsten Kengeter,who conceded to Handelsblatt last week that: I don t see any large mergers that would be attractive for us now. 

Far better pointers came fromCaroline Silver, a seasoned M&A banker atMoelis.  There could be some nice chunky deals in this sector but not in the old model,  she noted.

Few have missed the sign that there are huge political obstacles in trying to buy another exchange. Hence diversification through data and analytics isnow a key part of exchanges' operating models.  If you have a data company, it feels like now [is the time]that I should be selling to an exchange,  she commented.

But she left with some intriguing comments.  There s a slight return of the activist investor,  she noted.  They see an industry with a lot of cash pools and can get a lot of leverage. It s below the radar at the moment,  she said, noting that their presence may not be wholly beneficial for the industry.

Even so, right now  there s still a class of investor that thinks this is an asset class of quite easy pickings .

Blavatnik s alchemy

Wall Street banks keep delivering for the mega-billionaire investor,Len Blavatnik. Late on Friday, Blavatnik wascleared of fraud chargesrelated to hisill-fated $19bn buyoutof Lyondell Chemical. Blavatnik believed enough in Lyondell to contribute his $6bn petrochemical business, Basell, to the transaction. But the brutality of the financial crisis and its debt load of over $23bn forcedLyondellBasell(LBI) into Chapter 11 in early 2009, wiping out all shareholders.

Since it came out of bankruptcy in 2010, creditors have gone after the Ukraine-born businessman, arguing that Lyondell's management juiced financial projections (and that he was aware of it) to render LBI insolvent when the merger closed. Following Friday s decision, Blavatnik will only owe $7.5m on a minor charge. For his good fortune, he can, in part, thank fivebig banks.

The firms involved in funding the deal  Goldman Sachs,Merrill Lynch,Citigroup,ABN AmroandUBS  were savvy investors who committed billions off their own balance sheets. Such a vote of confidence must be taken seriously, wrote US bankruptcyJudge Martin Glennin his decision:

 . . . the Court finds the views and analyses of the financing banks to be of great value in this case 	. 	. 	. 	The financing banks risked billions of dollars of their own money on the future of LBI. When the merger eventually came to fruition, the banks supplemented their institutional knowledge of the companies and the industry with non-public information, and each bank employed masses of analysts to scrutinize the merits of the deal. Ultimately, each bank found the merger to be worthy of investment, and received approval from the requisite management and investment higher-ups. The views of these sophisticated investors provided perhaps the clearest indication that the combined company was left with sufficient capital upon the merger closing. 

But while fraud was not evident to the judge, the business judgment of Blavatnik and the banks remains questionable for piling $23bn of debt on a hyper-cyclical business that recorded just $4bn of trailing annual cash flow at the time of the deal.

The broader LBI saga also shows the weaknesses of the lumbering big bank model. Read Nathan Vardi s comprehensive"http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2014/07/30/the-greatest-deal-of-all-time/#320224f2503a"about how Blavatnik and Apollo made several billion dollars financing the 2010 reorganisation of LBI.

British Banking Braces for Hard Times; The good news: Brexit may not hurt London's finance sector as much as people think. The bad news: Other factors will hurt it a lot more.

Brexit isn't the toughest challenge facing the City of London.

Banks in Britain are still languishing in the doldrums brought on by the financial crisis of 2008. Weak banking activity and low investment returns have caused revenue to shrink, leading to widespread cost-cutting and automation.

While Britain's planned departure from the European Union threatens London's position as the "investment banker to Europe," in the words of Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney, the impact that will have on London itself will likely be smaller than people think. EU clients provide only one-fifth to one-quarter of revenue for the City's finance sector.

Other, continuing pressures look more significant in particular, low investment returns and pressure from clients to cut costs. In a low-return world, everyone from fund managers to small individual investors wants to pay lower fees.

"Trading [is] a commodity business, it's about who can do it most efficiently," says Andrew Formica, chief executive of fund manager Henderson Group. "It's becoming a bit of an arms race in terms of technology investment."

Passive investing

Pressure to cut costs is fueling a move to passive investing, in which fund managers do much less trading and research. Where active managers remain, they have to cut costs, too, to stay competitive. This all feeds into less revenue for investment banks, forcing them to cut more costs.

And the same trends that are hurting banks in Britain are affecting big banks everywhere.

"The continued uncertainty makes it a lot harder to invest in the future," says Hakan Enver, operations director at Morgan McKinley Financial Services, a recruitment company. "It's a lot of things, not just Brexit," Mr. Enver says. "But that is good cover" for layoffs as well, he says.

The total number of people employed by all kinds of banking in the U.K. has fallen 22% from its precrisis peak in 2008, or by about 120,000 jobs, according to data from Britain's statistics office.

Technology is replacing people on trading floors and in the middle and back offices where trades are checked, confirmed and settled. Some of this is to give investors an edge in markets with computer-driven tools such as algorithmic and high-frequency trading.

But technology also means more work can be moved offshore or to cheaper locations. More reliable internet links with India, for example, mean people can work together on the same documents or files in real time.

Remote employees

One U.K. firm, Frontline Analysts, runs teams of equity and credit analysts based in India on behalf of investment banks in London. The bank can cut back its more expensive big-city staff to just those who interact with clients directly, but still have access to a cheaper team to do much of the number crunching and report writing.

Frontline's senior people can work from anywhere. One managing director, Daniel Davies, spent more than a decade as a bank-stock analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse and elsewhere, but now trains and oversees teams of India-based analysts from his home in Exeter in southwest England.

"Investment banks can't shift the front office and they can't shift the brand, but as time has gone on and margin pressure has been brought to bear, they've realized they need to cut costs per head," Mr. Davies says.

Investment-bank executives don't want all their research to be run from elsewhere because it is harder to monitor, while their most important analysts have to spend time selling ideas to clients rather than training and checking faraway number crunchers.

"We in Frontline stand in between and do the quality assurance," Mr. Davies says. "I can do that from a cafe or from my home office."

In Europe, new regulations will soon force all banks to charge clients for research. That is going to put even more focus on costs because investors won't be willing to pay for many research teams. Henderson's Mr. Formica says banks could set up joint ventures just for research to reduce and share the output. But for some, cutting more people is the more likely outcome either by outsourcing or no longer doing research.

Another big cost for banks everywhere is satisfying all of the extra reporting and compliance demands from regulators since the crisis. This involves a lot of repetitive, data-processing activity that is labor intensive, which has kept staff and real-estate costs high in banks' middle and back offices, particularly in the City, where office space is among Europe's most expensive.

How big banks are handling their compliance and other back-office work is something being looked at by Accenture, the global consulting and services firm.

The impact of AI

Accenture cut 17,000 of its own back-office processing jobs, it says, by adopting what it calls artificial-intelligence tools. The company says it is now promoting the same kind of technology to banks, while also talking up the importance of retraining those who are displaced, as it did itself.

"No question, AI will lead to substantial job displacements over time," says Richard Lumb, Accenture's global head of financial services. "But the technology is still young. &The real power of AI is in how it augments workforces and makes it possible for people to do higher-value work."

Ultimately, Brexit is just one symptom of the growing desire in the U.S., the U.K., and across Europe to put up more borders between international trade and finance to protect unhappy voters at home. When it comes to banking, this protectionist theme was at work long before the Brexit campaign began. It is a theme that has led regulators increasingly to put up barriers between global banks' operations and capital bases in different countries, making them less efficient.

Kinner Lakhani, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, believes that the postcrisis crunch in financial activity has passed. But to stay profitable, he says, investment banks will need to cut costs further to substitute for economies lost through increased regulation. "Subsidiarization and Balkanization will challenge business models that don't have scale," he says. "Investment banks have adjusted significantly, but the process is not complete."

Banks Get Personal in Their Marketing; Financial institutions are tapping customer data to make pitches, aiming to make them useful and effective without being creepy

Banks know more about their customers than ever, and increasingly are trying to get more use out of that information.

The results can be convenient, or just creepy.

Banks can look at customers' debit-card and credit-card transactions, online-bill payments and account activity to see what they're buying, who they're working for and other information. Now, from the largest Wall Street behemoths to small community lenders, the banks are looking to use that data in new ways, investing in more-advanced technology to better target prospective customers and sell more services to existing ones.

Such moves have been a long time coming in an industry not known for embracing technological change. But banks are under increasing pressure from well-funded startups that make snap lending decisions based on such unorthodox metrics as a customer's online-shopping record.

Developments in artificial intelligence and machine learning are giving the banks more firepower to spot patterns in financial or personal issues a consumer might be having. Online bill payments, call-center interactions and online chats with customer-service representatives have given the banks more data to play with than ever before.

But access by banks to so much personal information raises concerns about privacy and consumers' rights in this era of big data and the Internet of Everything. Richard Cordray, head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, said at a recent industry conference that banks need to be careful about how they use and store customer data. "We see the market moving quickly, with high stakes for all involved," Mr. Cordray says. New rules regarding data privacy are also "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-european-union-financial-rules-to-give-u-s-consumers-protection-as-well-1493085780".

Some big players are already being careful as a result of what they know. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. is using customer data to determine when not to bug its customers. For instance, the bank doesn't want to pitch a new credit card to a customer who has recently been the victim of card-related fraud.

Generally speaking, though, banks, including Chase, know they are sitting on a large deposit of gold and they intend to mine it.

Chase, the largest U.S. bank by assets, tailors offers based on what it knows about customers' wealth, family size and recent spending and borrowing patterns, bank executives say.

"The last thing we want to do is sell somebody a product they don't want, or don't qualify for," says Kristin Lemkau, chief marketing officer at Chase. "We want to strengthen the relationship, not cheapen" it.

That means connecting the dots in ways customers feel comfortable with.

"If someone is buying a lot of things at the home-improvement store &maybe we should call them up and ask if they need a home-equity line, versus the old days, where everyone who walked into the branch, we would say, 'Hey, do you need a home-equity line?' " says Bob Hedges, a partner at consulting firm A.T. Kearney.

Fifth Third Bancorp plans to experiment with cellphone location technology that will allow the bank to send customers a text message when they are close to a branch and encourage them to stop by.

Melissa Stevens, Fifth Third's chief digital officer, says her bank will move cautiously. "There's that balance," she says. "You want to show that you're utilizing and embracing new technologies, but you also don't want to freak people out and accidentally alienate customers."

Contacts that make consumers look over their shoulders may still be welcome as long as the messages are appropriate or useful, bankers say. Rob Lee, chief product officer for banking and payments at financial-technology company FIS, says his company is helping banks with just-in-time marketing. If a bank notices a customer eating lunch at different college campuses all week, it might send offers or news about student loans, he says. Or customers who keep spending money on car repairs might be receptive to messages about how to qualify for a car loan.

Other pressures, besides competition from startups, are pushing banks to mine their data for more opportunities. For decades, they were more interested in buying other banks to become bigger, then integrating the target bank's technology to cut costs. The financial crisis largely put an end to such deals; now banks are looking inward to their relationships with customers.

When Wells Fargo & Co. customers have their paycheck deposited by a different employer, these days they might get asked if they need help switching their 401(k) over from the previous employer, says Charles Thomas, the bank's chief data officer. A spokeswoman for Wells Fargo, which in September settled with regulators over charges that it opened accounts using fictitious or unauthorized customer information, says that data is helping it prevent fraud, process speedier transactions and make basic recommendations. The bank also hopes to use newer tools including artificial intelligence to do things like send customers text alerts about unusual transactions or offer virtual financial advisers.

At Citigroup Inc., the bank knows when customers have redeemed credit-card points for travel rewards, and in response it highlights travel options like flights and hotels when reminding those customers to redeem more points.

Some banks are hiring data-analytics firms to help them find out more about their customers, using data they already have. When First Financial Bancorp, a community lender based in Cincinnati, discovered that many of its customers weren't tapping the home-equity lines of credit they opened at the bank, it asked Segmint Inc., a data-driven marketing firm based in Akron, Ohio, to analyze those customers' credit-card transactions, online bill payments and other information. Then it started targeting those customers with messages based on what it thought would interest them. To some the bank sent messages noting that the money from a home-equity line would be a great way to help with home repairs. To others, it encouraged using the money to travel.

The project so far has increased the usage rate on the home-equity loans, says Lynda Crossan, vice president of marketing.

A data-analytics company in San Francisco, Motista LLC, helps banks tailor their marketing messages based on psychology and emotions. It will start by surveying a subset of customers with questions like, how important is it to you that your bank understands your lifestyle? Or, do you want your bank to help you attain freedom and independence in life? Respondents are divided into groups based on their answers. Then Motista looks at all of the bank's customers and groups them based on key data points such as account balances and frequency of card swipes. Different marketing messages are then tailored for each group.

Not every profitable use of customer data requires an analytical or technological approach.

In 2014, Wells Fargo started sending birthday notes to customers via its mobile app. The following year, tellers in branches started offering birthday wishes as well. A Wells Fargo spokeswoman says customers "love the personal touch."

The Future of Finance (A Special Report) --- Regulators Get a Better Picture of Risk, Literally: Researchers can now draw simple images that reveal much about systemic weak spots

Kimmo Soramaki has seen something strange happening in U.S. house prices. The math behind his findings is fiendishly complex, but he can show the results to anyone in seconds.

Mr. Soramaki is a specialist in a kind of financial mapmaking: He takes a complex analysis of the relations between financial institutions or markets, and by weeding out some information and focusing on the most significant links, he can create simple treelike images that reveal something -- in this case, that housing prices have become increasingly correlated -- that might otherwise go unnoticed.

This type of analysis is part of a growing area of research that is changing how regulators and banks manage financial risk. Network analytics such as that used by Mr. Soramaki, as well as new modeling approaches, allow researchers to show how thousands or millions of iterations of apparently simple financial exchanges or actions together can create a far more complex and at times unstable financial system than traditional economic theory might suggest.

Already, such approaches are being used in bank stress-testing and to spot weaknesses in global markets. Some envision the technology eventually could be used to build a dashboard of the global financial system that regulators could monitor to spot crises before they hit.

Andy Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, fantasized in a 2014 speech about sitting in the financial equivalent of the bridge of the Starship Enterprise, from which regulators could test and watch for impending disasters, then intervene when necessary. The world isn't there yet -- and some argue it might not be desirable even if it were possible -- but the theories and computer models behind this vision already are being tested.

Mr. Soramaki's company, Financial Network Analytics, is helping the Colombian central bank build a systemic-risk tool using data on payments that flow through the financial system. Institutions such as the Bank of England and the U.S. Office of Financial Research, meanwhile, have been working to build their own network models of banks, money managers and clearinghouses to study how shocks such as a bank failure or the Swiss central bank's abandoning its currency link to the dollar propagate through the financial system. In recent years, they have begun publishing the results of this work.

Mr. Soramaki created the map of home prices to demonstrate his technology. On the map, which shifts and changes over the period from 2000 to the present, U.S. states are depicted as dots, linked to one another by lines. The shorter the line, the greater the similarity in house-price movements in those two states.

On a map showing the data for 2000, the dots are small and mostly far apart, and the "tree" appears very spread out. From roughly 2004 to 2008, as the housing bubble builds and then enters the crisis, the dots grow in size and turn from green to red, moving closer together and forming clusters, as price changes across the country become larger and more similar. As the links get shorter, so does the tree, signifying greater correlation. But what is really surprising is what has happened since the 2008 crisis: Changes in home values across states are more alike today than ever before.

"In the U.S. housing market, correlations have continued to rise even after the collapse of the bubble: The tree span has continued to shrink," says Mr. Soramaki, who worked at the Bank of Finland and the New York Federal Reserve before starting his company in 2013.

"Visual network analysis improves our answer to existing questions, but can also expose questions we didn't know we had," he says. His work can't explain why this is happening; it can simply show that it is, highlighting an unexpected risk -- in this case that everyone could start losing money on real estate at the same time -- that would likely otherwise go unnoticed.

Other researchers are working on models that could someday be used to monitor financial markets. J. Doyne Farmer, an American scientist now at Oxford University's Institute for New Economic Thinking, is helping the Bank of England develop agent-based models to better understand how markets and other complex financial systems behave.

The models simulate how agents -- people, companies, institutional investors, etc. -- act and interact in markets and financial systems. Such programs have produced outcomes that more closely resemble what happens in the real world than do the predictions of classical economics.

Prof. Farmer thinks that in five to 10 years' time, such models could be used to make market and economic forecasts in much the same way we can now predict the weather. "The economy is more difficult -- we don't know the laws of physics for the economy -- but on first principles we don't really understand clouds either," he says.

Yet with enough data from the past, meteorologists can make reliable forecasts. Similarly, enough historical data about activity in financial markets could help make better models of the future. The problem is, people can adapt and change their behavior in a way that water molecules can't. "Clouds don't think," Prof. Farmer says.

Still, he believes that a lot of what happens in markets or economics comes down to accounting rules and legal contracts that are quite mechanical, so much of it is predictable and stable.

Many of the techniques and ideas in this field have come from other disciplines, including biology and engineering. Mr. Soramaki's correlation trees, for example, are adapted from a method for mapping genomes. This cross-fertilization began in New Mexico at the Santa Fe Institute in the late 1980s, and it has led to an entire field of study known as complexity economics.

Even before the financial crisis, regulators were starting to take note. Now, private companies are investing in this research, aiming to develop products for the finance industry.

Alexander Denev, the head of quantitative research at data company IHS Markit, says there is still uncertainty about the answers that such tools produce. One problem is that there isn't enough high-quality data. Another issue is selecting which model to use and even how to define what constitutes systemic risk. In stress-testing, U.S. and U.K. regulators require banks to use more than one model as a cross-check. But Mr. Denev says they ought to be using multiple models, even thousands, to show the variety of potential outcomes under different starting assumptions.

"This is where computing power and machine learning come in," he says, and the private sector tends to have more of that than regulators and central banks.

All of this could feed into a futuristic dashboard, but that leads to questions about how much influence regulators should have. "Dashboards lead to human insights, human insights lead to decisions, but no automatic rules should be used to circumvent the human part," Mr. Denev says.

Mark Flood, a research principal at the Office of Financial Research, says regulators shouldn't be in control of the financial system. "We need a gap between the regulator and the free market," he says. "You don't want the police driving everyone's car. You want them setting the speed limits and checking for drunken drivers."

The Future of Finance (A Special Report) --- British Banking Braces For Hard Times: The good news: Brexit may not hurt London's financial sector as much as people think; The bad news: Other things will hurt it a lot more

Brexit isn't the toughest challenge facing the City of London.

Banks in Britain are still languishing in the doldrums brought on by the financial crisis of 2008. Weak banking activity and low investment returns have caused revenue to shrink, leading to widespread cost-cutting and automation.

While Britain's planned departure from the European Union threatens London's position as the "investment banker to Europe," in the words of Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney, the impact that will have on London itself will likely be smaller than people think. EU clients provide only one-fifth to one-quarter of revenue for the City's finance sector.

Other, continuing pressures look more significant -- in particular, low investment returns and pressure from clients to cut costs. In a low-return world, everyone from fund managers to small individual investors wants to pay lower fees.

"Trading [is] a commodity business, it's about who can do it most efficiently," says Andrew Formica, chief executive of fund manager Henderson Group. "It's becoming a bit of an arms race in terms of technology investment."

Pressure to cut costs is fueling a move to passive investing, in which fund managers do much less trading and research. Where active managers remain, they have to cut costs, too, to stay competitive. This all feeds into less revenue for investment banks, forcing them to cut more costs.

And the same trends that are hurting banks in Britain are affecting big banks everywhere.

"The continued uncertainty makes it a lot harder to invest in the future," says Hakan Enver, operations director at Morgan McKinley Financial Services, a recruitment company. "It's a lot of things, not just Brexit," Mr. Enver says. "But that is good cover" for layoffs as well, he says.

The total number of people employed by all kinds of banking in the U.K. has fallen 22% from its precrisis peak in 2008, or by about 120,000 jobs, according to data from Britain's statistics office.

Technology is replacing people on trading floors and in the middle and back offices where trades are checked, confirmed and settled. Some of this is to give investors an edge in markets with computer-driven tools such as algorithmic and high-frequency trading.

But technology also means more work can be moved offshore or to cheaper locations. More reliable internet links with India, for example, mean people can work together on the same documents or files in real time.

One U.K. firm, Frontline Analysts, runs teams of equity and credit analysts based in India on behalf of investment banks in London. The bank can cut back its more expensive big-city staff to just those who interact with clients directly, but still have access to a cheaper team to do much of the number crunching and report writing.

Frontline's senior people can work from anywhere. One managing director, Daniel Davies, spent more than a decade as a bank-stock analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, Credit Suisse and elsewhere, but now trains and oversees teams of India-based analysts from his home in Exeter in southwest England.

"Investment banks can't shift the front office and they can't shift the brand, but as time has gone on and margin pressure has been brought to bear, they've realized they need to cut costs per head," Mr. Davies says.

Investment-bank executives don't want all their research to be run from elsewhere because it is harder to monitor, while their most important analysts have to spend time selling ideas to clients rather than training and checking faraway number crunchers.

"We in Frontline stand in between and do the quality assurance," Mr. Davies says. "I can do that from a cafe or from my home office."

In Europe, new regulations will soon force all banks to charge clients for research. That is going to put even more focus on costs because investors won't be willing to pay for many research teams. Henderson's Mr. Formica says banks could set up joint ventures just for research to reduce and share the output. But for some, cutting more people is the more likely outcome -- either by outsourcing or no longer doing research.

Another big cost for banks everywhere is satisfying all of the extra reporting and compliance demands from regulators since the crisis. This involves a lot of repetitive, data-processing activity that is labor intensive, which has kept staff and real-estate costs high in banks' middle and back offices, particularly in the City, where office space is among Europe's most expensive.

How big banks are handling their compliance and other back-office work is something being looked at by Accenture, the global consulting and services firm.

Accenture cut 17,000 of its own back-office processing jobs, it says, by adopting what it calls artificial-intelligence tools. The company says it is now promoting the same kind of technology to banks, while also talking up the importance of retraining those who are displaced, as it did itself.

"No question, AI will lead to substantial job displacements over time," says Richard Lumb, Accenture's global head of financial services. "But the technology is still young.. . .The real power of AI is in how it augments workforces and makes it possible for people to do higher-value work."

Ultimately, Brexit is just one symptom of the growing desire in the U.S., the U.K., and across Europe to put up more borders between international trade and finance to protect unhappy voters at home. When it comes to banking, this protectionist theme was at work long before the Brexit campaign began. It is a theme that has led regulators increasingly to put up barriers between global banks' operations and capital bases in different countries, making them less efficient.

Kinner Lakhani, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, believes that the postcrisis crunch in financial activity has passed. But to stay profitable, he says, investment banks will need to cut costs further to substitute for economies lost through increased regulation. "Subsidiarization and Balkanization will challenge business models that don't have scale," he says. "Investment banks have adjusted significantly, but the process is not complete."

Man Group has appointed an industry veteran to head machine learning for GLG, its discretionary trading unit, as hedge funds bet that the future is in computer algorithms and big data.

William Ferreira , who previously worked at Man's AHL unit, which trades using computer algorithms, rejoined the company in the new role this month after a stint at another quant fund.

Discretionary hedge fund managers, especially those who trade equities, are increasingly turning to quantitative analysis to help them predict market moves, a technique that had once been left to the systematic trading funds. It has been dubbed "quantamental" trading by some.

" Machine learning " is a step beyond quant trading. A branch of artificial intelligence, it is a sophisticated computing technique that allows hedge funds to find patterns in data using algorithms that can improve and learn over time as the data sets expand.

BlackRock and State Street are among asset managers investing in machine learning, while the giants of hedge fund quantitative trading - Renaissance Technologies, DE Shaw and Two Sigma - have experimented with the technique for years.

Man GLG is one of the first discretionary funds to have established a head of machine learning.

"We are continually seeking to develop our offering for our clients and, as the amount of data available continues to expand, these techniques can supplement existing rigorous quantitative and qualitative analysis," said Teun Johnston , chief executive of Man GLG.

Data available for hedge funds to utilise has exploded in the past few years, from credit card data that can give traders an insight into where people are spending their money ahead of companies announcing their earnings, to analysing GPS tracking or satellite surveillance to determine whether foot traffic in stores is up or down.

Using machine learning at GLG also allows Man to capitalise on clients who want most of their money managed by humans, while still using the same techniques to analyse the ever-expanding amounts of data available.

IBM Tests Watson Technology to Keep Eye on Traders; Watson Financial Services is being piloted at a handful of clients, IBM executive says

NEW YORK International Business Machines Corp. is piloting its Jeopardy-winning Watson technology as a tool for catching rogue traders at large financial institutions, executives said in an interview Monday.

The company's Watson Financial Services product looks for patterns in traders' chats and emails while also analyzing numerical trading data. The surveillance tool is being piloted with a handful, or fewer than 10, financial-industry clients, said Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president of IBM Industry Platforms.

The company is also developing other capabilities for the technology, Ms. van Kralingen said. One analyzes regulatory text to identify obligations that companies might face and to help assess whether the company's compliance programs are sufficient to comply with the rules. Another would assist banks in detecting suspicious customers or transactions.

The services are a new foray for IBM as it seeks to win a larger slice of the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/stress-test-inc-billions-of-dollars-consultants-to-manage-other-consultants-1467139620". The project is one of many efforts to make the Watson artificial intelligence computer program bear fruit six years after its debut besting human contestants on the Jeopardy game show.

In September, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-plans-to-buy-promontory-financial-group-1475161201", a move executives said was designed to help train Watson in the Byzantine business of bank rules.

When it went on Jeopardy, Watson was a generalist, answering trivia questions about a range of topics. IBM has since been working to beef up its expertise in specific fields, such as treating cancer.

The trader-surveillance capability is Watson's most advanced in the financial-services realm, said Ms. Van Kralingen and Eugene Ludwig, who founded Promontory and continues to run it as part of IBM, in a joint interview Monday.

They likened their effort to Watson's application for medical diagnoses. In that context, Watson will read medical literature and consider patient histories and symptoms before offering a potential diagnosis. At a financial firm, Watson might analyze trader chats, emails, trading data, market data and other inputs to flag cases where a bank employee might be engaging in insider trading or market manipulation.

The pitch is that banks need Watson because compliance officers alone can't analyze all that information, and because other technology relies on more rudimentary tools such as searching emails for words that might raise red flags. Watson, IBM says, analyzes more data and is more sophisticated in identifying patterns.

"I think about it like a detective that can do problem solving, rather than just a search. And that is the difference that many risk and compliance officers are desperate for," said Ms. Van Kralingen.

She said Watson is learning how to move beyond its ability to process language, which was the basis for its competition on Jeopardy, to work with numerical financial data.

The capability for Watson to analyze regulatory text and banks' own compliance systems is still under construction, she said. That project is relying both on Promontory's stable of expert former regulators and on data that Promontory has created identifying individual obligations for banks among thousands of pages of federal rules, the executives said.

In the anti-money-laundering arena, IBM is trying to create a tool that would be better than existing technology at identifying suspicious transactions, they said. The goal is for the technology to generate fewer "false positives" transaction alerts that banks spend time investigating, only to find out later that they are innocuous.

Mr. Ludwig said that "the enthusiasm is unbelievable" among potential clients for the anti-money-laundering tool.

To be sure, the learning process for Watson can be a long road. Previous projects have "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-struggles-to-turn-watson-computer-into-big-business-1389142136". One attempt to use it in cancer treatment at a Texas hospital stalled due in part to challenges of "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hospital-stumbles-in-bid-to-teach-a-computer-to-treat-cancer-1488969011", even though IBM said Watson itself was working effectively in that context.

Equities: The Rise of Indexing Powers S&P Global --- Rating firm criticized during financial crisis now rides high, helped by passive investing

Once vilified for its role in the financial crisis, S&P Global Inc. is emerging as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the rise of passive investing.

The New York-based financial-information giant collects a tiny fee from every investor that buys an exchange-traded fund tied to one of its market indexes.

Total assets in those products topped $1 trillion in December, the firm said, doubling from just three years earlier. S&P is now roughly twice as large an indexer as its next biggest rival, MSCI Inc., according to data from ETFGI, a London-based research and consultancy firm on ETF trends.

Just seven years ago, S&P was in the hot seat. Former executives were grilled on Capitol Hill over why the firm gave top-notch AAA ratings to toxic mortgage-backed securities.

Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, partly in a bid to dislodge the big debt-rating firms from their position at the heart of the U.S. financial system.

Those efforts failed. S&P still doles out nearly half of the debt ratings issued in the U.S., according to the latest Securities and Exchange Commission data. A boom in corporate-debt issuance has helped power S&P Global's stock up 27% over the past year, to $131.52 on Friday, including a 22% rise so far in 2017 that has topped the benchmark S&P 500 index that bears the company's name. In October 2008, the stock traded as low as $17.15.

Critics fault regulators for failing to do more to shake up the clubby ratings industry, where the Big Three firms of S&P, Moody's Corp. and Fitch Ratings Inc. are paid by the companies whose debt they rate. Rating fees have helped underpin S&P's expansion in recent years.

"For the SEC to have let it sit there for all these years is beyond disgraceful," said Alan Blinder, who was vice chairman of the Federal Reserve in the 1990s.

S&P Global says that the "issuer pays" model allows them to make ratings available for public scrutiny free of charge, and that conflicts are addressed by separating analysis from business activities. An SEC report from December cites improved processes for firms' oversight of credit ratings, such as increased documentation.

The company has also restructured and rebranded itself, spinning off its education unit in 2012 and shedding its old name, McGraw Hill Financial Inc., in April 2016.

Ratings, along with commodities, data and analytics, account for the lion's share of S&P Global's revenue. But indexing has grown the fastest since 2012.

The unit, known as S&P Dow Jones Indices, and owned in part by CME Group Inc., boasted adjusted operating margins of 65% last year. The firm is scheduled to report earnings for the first three months of the year on April 25.

Indexes have been around since 1896, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average, now an S&P-owned index, was introduced. But S&P Global wasn't predestined to be an index giant.

In 2011, when Jana Partners LLC and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan called for changes at the company, then named McGraw-Hill Cos., the activist investors proposed turning the index unit into a stand-alone company. S&P held on to the business.

Dow Jones & Co., a unit of Wall Street Journal parent company News Corp, completed a sale of its stake in S&P's index business in 2013. Two representatives of the Journal still help determine the composition of the Dow industrials, one of S&P's indexes.

Indexes have gained a higher profile in the past few years as ETFs have surged in popularity. The world's largest ETF, the S&P 500 tracking SPDR fund, now has more than $230 billion in assets. S&P Dow Jones Indices collects a licensing fee that averages out to 0.0303% of the assets that an investor holds in the fund each year, which is around a third of the fund's net expenses, according to its prospectus.

S&P Dow Jones Indices collects licensing fees from exchanges such as CME and CBOE Holdings Inc. that offer futures and options based on S&P indexes. It also makes money by calculating the value of indexes and developing custom benchmarks.

Competition is heating up as upstart index providers offer cheaper alternatives for ETF issuers that don't need a highly recognizable brand like S&P's.

Solactive AG, for example, has a flat rate for its indexes, typically seeking to charge smaller fees than its larger competitors.

"Globally you have, let's say 20 big, massive, branded indices that are really hard to replace," such as the S&P 500, said Steffen Scheuble, chief executive at Solactive. "We don't go after them. Nevertheless, everything beyond that, of course we are trying to get that business."

Finance & Markets: AIG Nears Choice of Successor To Chief

Former American International Group Inc. executive Brian Duperreault is a leading candidate to succeed departing AIG Chief Executive Officer Peter Hancock, according to people familiar with the matter.

The onetime lieutenant of Maurice "Hank" Greenberg spent roughly two decades at AIG before leaving to run three other companies. He is now chairman and chief executive of Bermuda-based Hamilton Insurance Group Ltd.

AIG's board is seriously considering Mr. Duperreault "along with one or two other guys," one of these people said. AIG's board hasn't made a final decision, this person said.

An AIG spokesman declined to comment, as did a Hamilton spokeswoman. She said Mr. Duperreault wasn't available for comment.

Bloomberg News earlier reported that Mr. Duperreault was under consideration.

The choice of Mr. Duperreault would bring back a figure well known within AIG. He started work there in 1973 in the actuarial department and became one of the company's top executives during the reign of Mr. Greenberg, who as CEO built AIG into a global powerhouse before being pushed out in 2005.

While at AIG, Mr. Duperreault was long considered a potential successor to Mr. Greenberg. But he left in 1994 to runthen-Bermuda-based specialty insurer ACE Ltd., which he expanded into a diversified insurance firm that eventually acquired Chubb Corp. He later became CEO ofconsulting and insurance brokerageMarsh & McLennan Cos.

His career path has intersected with members of the Greenberg family multiple times. At ACE, he was eventually succeeded as CEO by Evan Greenberg, the son of the former AIG chief executive. Mr. Duperreault had been a mentor to the younger Mr. Greenberg at AIG and hired him for a senior job at ACE.

At Marsh, Mr. Duperreault took over a post held at one time by Evan Greenberg's brother, Jeffrey.

The new CEO of AIG will have to re-establish leadership for a company that received a$185billion government bailout during the financial crisis and is now under pressure from activist investors over lackluster financial results.

In March, AIG said Mr. Hancock would resign after less than three years at the helm. Many board members were unhappy about recent setbacks in the company's plan for boosting profitability, said people familiar with the matter, while several also feared a potential fight with activist investor Carl Icahn. Mr. Hancock agreed to stay until a successor was found.

Mr. Duperreault, who turns 70 years old in May, has been asked before to fix troubled companies. Before he arrived at Marsh & McLennan in 2008, the company was under pressure to consider a breakup by shareholders who were frustrated with its performance. He is widely credited with a turnaround of that firm.

In 2013, he founded Hamilton withprincipals of the hedge fund Two Sigma.Last year, AIG teamed with Hamilton and Two Sigma on a joint venture tosell insurance online to small businesses, using advanced data analytics.

"Mr. Duperreault would be able to form a workable strategy for AIG and also attract top industry talent," Barclays PLC said in a research note Thursday.

Rise of Indexing Lifts S&P --- Rating firm criticized during financial crisis now rides high, helped by passive investing

Once vilified for its role in the financial crisis, S&P Global Inc. is emerging as one of the biggest beneficiaries of the rise of passive investing.

The New York financial-information giant collects a tiny fee from every investor that buys an exchange-traded fund tied to one of its market indexes. Total assets in those products topped $1 trillion in December, the firm said, doubling from three years earlier. S&P is roughly twice as large an indexer as its next biggest rival, MSCI Inc., according to data from ETFGI, a London-based research and consultancy firm on ETF trends.

Just seven years ago, S&P was in the hot seat. Former executives were grilled on Capitol Hill over why the firm gave top-notch AAA ratings to toxic mortgage-backed securities. Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, partly in a bid to dislodge the big debt-rating firms from the heart of the U.S. financial system.

Those efforts failed. S&P still doles out nearly half of the debt ratings issued in the U.S., according to the latest Securities and Exchange Commission data. A boom in corporate-debt issuance has helped power S&P Global's stock up 27% over the past year, to $131.52 on Friday, including a 22% rise so far in 2017 that has topped the benchmark S&P 500 index that bears the company's name. In October 2008, the stock traded as low as $17.15.

Critics fault regulators for failing to do more to shake up the ratings industry, where the Big Three firms of S&P, Moody's Corp. and Fitch Ratings Inc. are paid by the companies whose debt they rate. Rating fees have helped underpin S&P's expansion in recent years.

"For the SEC to have let it sit there for all these years is beyond disgraceful," said Alan Blinder, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve in the 1990s.

S&P Global says that the "issuer pays" model allows them to make ratings available for public scrutiny free of charge, and that conflicts are addressed by separating analysis from business activities. An SEC report from December cites improved processes for firms' oversight of credit ratings, such as increased documentation.

The company has also restructured and rebranded itself, spinning off its education unit in 2012 and shedding its old name, McGraw Hill Financial Inc., in April 2016.

Ratings, along with commodities, data and analytics, account for the lion's share of S&P Global's revenue. But indexing has grown the fastest since 2012. The unit, known as S&P Dow Jones Indices, and owned in part by CME Group Inc., boasted adjusted operating margins of 65% last year. The firm is scheduled to report earnings on April 25.

Indexes have been around since 1896, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average, now an S&P-owned index, was introduced. But S&P Global wasn't predestined to be an index giant.

In 2011, when Jana Partners LLC and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan called for changes at the company, then named McGraw-Hill Cos., the activist investors proposed turning the index unit into a stand-alone company. S&P held on to the business.

Dow Jones & Co., a unit of Wall Street Journal parent company News Corp, completed a sale of its stake in S&P's index business in 2013. Two representatives of the Journal still help determine the composition of the Dow industrials, one of S&P's indexes.

Indexes have gained a higher profile in the past few years as ETFs have surged in popularity. The world's largest ETF, the S&P 500 tracking SPDR fund, now has more than $230 billion in assets. S&P Dow Jones Indices collects a licensing fee that averages out to 0.0303% of the assets that an investor holds in the fund each year.

S&P Dow Jones Indices collects licensing fees from exchanges such as CME and CBOE Holdings Inc. that offer futures and options based on S&P indexes. It also makes money by calculating the value of indexes and developing custom benchmarks.

Competition is heating up as upstart index providers offer cheaper alternatives for ETF issuers that don't need a highly recognizable brand like S&P's. Solactive AG, for example, has a flat rate for its indexes, typically seeking to charge smaller fees than its larger competitors.

"Globally you have, let's say 20 big, massive, branded indices that are really hard to replace," such as the S&P 500, said Steffen Scheuble, chief executive at Solactive. "We don't go after them. Nevertheless, everything beyond that, of course we are trying to get that business."

Wells Fargo Directors Face Uncertain Prospects; Some on board are at risk of losing re-election; shareholder meeting is Tuesday

The battle over Wells Fargo & Co.'s board is going down to the last possible moment, with uncertainty hanging over the re-election prospects of several directors at Tuesday's annual shareholder meeting, according to people familiar with the matter.

Some large institutional shareholders have yet to weigh in and are expected to place their votes Monday, just ahead of the conclave. But as of Sunday, votes already placed had left several directors at risk of losing re-election, the people familiar with the matter said.

Nonexecutive Chairman Stephen Sanger isn't among those directors, but Enrique Hernandez, head of the bank's board risk committee, is vulnerable, one of the people said.

While it is unclear whether any directors will be voted out, the bank needs decisive victories especially because directors are running unopposed. If directors get less than 80% of the vote for re-election, it would send a clear message to the San Francisco bank that shareholders are seeking bigger changes after its sales-practices scandal, said Charles Elson, director of the University of Delaware's John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance.

And shareholders, in meetings with the bank in recent weeks, already have been sending the message that more needs to be done to address systemic problems at the bank, according to people familiar with the meetings.

Employees over a five-year period opened as many as 2.1 million accounts using fictitious or unauthorized customer information, leading to a $185 million settlement with regulators last fall. A $142 million settlement over customer class-action lawsuits is also pending.

The bank has said it is cooperating with state and federal investigations into the sales-practices scandal.

In an interview last Wednesday, Chief Executive Timothy Sloan said he doesn't think the bank needs to make any changes to its board risk committee, which comprises chairs from its other board committees. He also said a recent report from the bank's board about the scandal showed that Mr. Hernandez had raised questions with management about aggressive sales tactics.

The independent board report largely placed blame on two executives who are no longer with the bank. The bank named two new directors to the board earlier this year, yet there have been no other significant changes to the way it operates.

Some institutional investors briefed in recent days by Wells Fargo executives and directors said the bank tried to reassure them that the board's makeup will change in coming years because of mandatory retirements. Some investors said they were told that six members will hit the maximum age of 72 and will leave over the next four years.

While bank officials also made no promises to rotate committee memberships or chairmen, an official from an institutional shareholder said "there needs to be a thoughtful but accelerated response to constitute a new board."

Meanwhile, influential proxy-advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. has recommended that shareholders vote against Mr. Sanger and 11 of his colleagues on Wells Fargo's 15-member board. It is unusual for the firm to recommend against so many directors and the move drew the ire of Wells Fargo management, including Mr. Sloan. The second-largest proxy-advisory firm, Glass Lewis & Co., recommended investors vote for Mr. Sanger, but against six directors.

The average support level for 4,934 S&P 500 director elections in 2016 was 97.4%, with just two failing to get majority support, according to ISS Analytics, the data arm of the influential proxy adviser.

The bank already has at least 10% of the vote for director re-election from top shareholder Berkshire Hathaway Inc., run by Warren Buffett.

But just days ahead of what is shaping up to be a contentious shareholder meeting, a number of public pension funds collectively holding about 0.75% of the bank's shares outstanding came out against the majority of directors on Wells Fargo's board. These included the Office of the New York City Comptroller, California State Teachers' Retirement System and the California Public Employees' Retirement System.

Smaller shareholders want change, too. Jonas Kron, from Boston-based Trillium Asset Management LLC, said his firm is voting against re-electing 12 of Wells Fargo's 15 board directors. "In order for the company to move forward, it's really going to take more than just a change in CEO," said Mr. Kron, Trillium's director of shareholder advocacy.

Trillium's clients hold about 14,000 shares, or nearly $750,000, of Wells Fargo stock.

Indexing Pivotal in S&P Global's Rebound From Crisis Scandal; Financial-information firm, once vilified in Congress and targeted by Dodd-Frank, now benefiting from passive investing

S&P executives say one of the main areas of S&P's growth will be in international markets. In Latin American and other regions, the firm believes that brand-name indexes will be key to helping build trust in the markets.

"Being global for us is really important," Douglas Peterson, S&P Global's chief executive, said in an interview last month.

AIG Considers Greenberg Acolyte as Next CEO; Brian Duperreault had spent nearly two decades at the insurance company before leaving to run three other companies

Former American International Group Inc. executive Brian Duperreault is a leading candidate to replace departing AIG Chief Executive Officer Peter Hancock, according to people familiar with the matter.

The onetime lieutenant of Maurice 'Hank" Greenberg spent roughly two decades at AIG before leaving to run three other companies. He is currently chairman and chief executive of Bermuda-based Hamilton Insurance Group Ltd.

AIG's board is seriously considering Mr. Duperreault "along with one or two other guys," one of these people said. AIG's board hasn't yet made a final decision, this person said. The CEO search may be completed by the end of the second quarter, people familiar with the matter said.

An AIG spokesman declined to comment, as did a Hamilton spokeswoman. She said Mr. Duperreault wasn't available for comment.

Bloomberg earlier reported that Mr. Duperreault was under consideration for the CEO job.

The choice of Mr. Duperreault would bring back a figure well known within AIG. He started work there in 1973 in the actuarial department and became one of the company's top executives during the reign of Mr. Greenberg, who as CEO built AIG into a global powerhouse before being pushed out in 2005.

While at AIG Mr. Duperreault was long considered a potential successor to Mr. Greenberg. But he left in 1994 to run then-Bermuda-based specialty insurer ACE Ltd., which he expanded into a diversified insurance firm that eventually acquired Chubb Corp. He later became CEO of consulting and insurance brokerage Marsh & McLennan Cos.

His career path has intersected with members of the Greenberg family multiple times. At ACE he was eventually succeeded as CEO by Evan Greenberg, the son of the former AIG chief executive. Mr. Duperreault had been a mentor to the younger Evan Greenberg at AIG and hired him for a senior job at ACE.

At Marsh Mr. Duperreault took over a post held at one time by Evan Greenberg's brother, Jeffrey.

The new CEO of AIG will have to re-establish leadership for a company that received a $185 billion government bailout during the last financial crisis and is now under pressure from activist investors for lackluster financial results.

In March, AIG announced Mr. Hancock would resign after less than three years at the helm. Many board members were unhappy about recent setbacks in the company's plan for boosting profitability, said people familiar with the matter, while several also feared a potential fight with activist investor Carl Icahn. Mr. Hancock agreed to stay until a successor was found.

Mr. Duperreault, who turns 70 years old in early May, has been asked before to fix troubled companies. Before he arrived at Marsh & McLennan in 2008, the company was under pressure to consider a breakup by shareholders who were frustrated with Marsh & McLennan's performance. He is widely credited with a turnaround of that firm.

In late 2013, he founded Hamilton with principals of hedge fund Two Sigma. Last year, AIG teamed with Hamilton and Two Sigma on a joint venture to sell insurance online to small businesses, using advanced data analytics.

"Mr. Duperreault would be able to form a workable strategy for AIG and also attract top industry talent," Barclays said in a research note released Thursday.

Trump Puts Two Dodd-Frank Powers on Hold in Symbolic Move; The powers put on the shelf during a 180-day review

WASHINGTON President Donald Trump signed three executive actions directing a review of tax and financial-regulatory policies, including a symbolic move shelving two major powers the executive branch holds under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law.

The Wall Street oversight powers one allowing the government to take over a failing financial firm and another empowering it to designate risky firms for stricter regulation will be put on the shelf during a pair of 180-day reviews, officials said. Mr. Trump signed two memos Friday asking the Treasury Department to review the powers and to not to invoke them in the meantime.

A third executive action orders the Treasury secretary to identify regulations that "impose an undue financial burden on United States taxpayers, add undue complexity to the Federal tax laws, or exceed the statutory authority of the Internal Revenue Service." It also directs the secretary to take "appropriate steps" to delay, suspend, or modify the rules.

The specific wording of the actions weren't immediately available.

The memos regarding Dodd-Frank allow for the Treasury to use the powers in case of a financial emergency, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said, making Mr. Trump's directive not to use them largely a symbolic one. But the move still represents a significant policy shift from the previous administration, which said the powers from the 2010 law were essential to protect the financial system.

Mr. Trump, invoking a language often used by conservative Republican critics of Dodd Frank, said the powers "enshrine too big to fail and encourage risky behavior." Financial firms are considered "too big to fail" when investors believe they wouldn't be allowed to fail without a taxpayer bailout.

The actions target "damaging Dodd-Frank regulations that fail to hold the Wall Street firms accountable," Mr. Trump said. "They have done really in many cases the opposite of what they were supposed to."

"We will do an analysis to make sure that this doesn't encourage excessive risk-taking, moral hazard, and exposure to taxpayers," Mr. Mnuchin said of the review of the takeover power, known as orderly liquidation authority. The president "will direct us not to use OLA unless required by law and in consultation with him."

Dodd-Frank supporters in the U.S. and regulators in other countries have expressed concerns that repealing the liquidation authority would leave the U.S. government without tools to handle a financial crisis. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which would administer use of the liquidation authority in the U.S., issued a statement Friday calling it "an important backstop for managing the failure of a large financial firm to avoid the taxpayer bailouts and financial system breakdowns we saw during the financial crisis."

"We welcome the opportunity to work with the Treasury Department as it conducts its review," the statement said.

The policy analysis firm Federal Financial Analytics, Inc. issued a note saying Friday's action "will make market participants and foreign regulators far less certain that the U.S. will quickly act to stabilize its financial market in the event of a large institution's &imminent collapse."

That "will make global cooperation far less likely" on financial rules and could put pressure on European officials to impose stricter rules on U.S. institutions operating within their borders, the firm said.

Bankruptcy is a possible alternative for handling a failing firm, for instance, but using the current bankruptcy code might lead to a chaotic failure like that of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008.

"If entities were going to go through bankruptcy, I think it is important that we have necessary changes to the bankruptcy code," Mr. Mnuchin said. "But, on the other hand, there is a reason why we have the bankruptcy code, so this is something that we will be looking at very carefully as to what the right solution is."

Mr. Trump said the tax executive action would "begin the process of tax simplification," and said many people find their tax returns "too complicated". The White House didn't specify which regulations would be targeted as part of a 150-day review by the Treasury.

Mr. Mnuchin said rules on so-called corporate-tax inversions are "obviously one of the significant things" adopted during that time. The review "is not targeted at just those. It is targeted at those that are significant and create complexity and undue burdensome situations," he said.

"We're not going to do anything under this administration that inadvertently makes U.S. businesses less competitive or encourages U.S. business to go abroad," Mr. Mnuchin said.

The executive action precluding the designation of nonbank financial firms as "systemically important" probably won't have much practical effect in the near term, since the Trump administration wasn't expected to pursue any designations. But the review could lead the administration to adopt new procedures that would raise the bar for designating firms in the future.

Two firms, American International Group Inc. and Prudential Financial Inc., are currently considered "systemic." The administration hasn't said whether it will try to rescind those designations.

Elon Musk Lays Out Plans to Meld Brains and Computers; Startup Neuralink aims to treat disabled and ultimately create a new language of 'consensual telepathy'

Billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk on Thursday confirmed plans for his newest company, called Neuralink Corp., revealing he will be the chief executive of a startup that aims to merge computers with brains so humans could one day engage in "consensual telepathy."

Speaking to writer Tim Urban on the explainer website Wait But Why, Mr. Musk confirmed a Wall Street Journal"https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-launches-neuralink-to-connect-brains-with-computers-1490642652"that Neuralink aims to implant tiny brain electrodes that first would be used to fight brain conditions but later help humanity avoid subjugation at the hands of intelligent machines.

A Neuralink spokesman said Mr. Musk plans to serve as the chief executive, adding another CEO role to his already busy schedule running electric-car maker Tesla Inc. and rocket company Space Exploration Technologies Corp. Mr. Musk couldn't be reached for comment through the spokesman.

Neuralink's goals are arguably bolder than Tesla's plans of mass-market electric vehicles or SpaceX's ambitions to send humans to Mars. As Mr. Musk describes it, Neuralink wants to develop brain interfaces that would effectively replace human language as we know it.

"There are a bunch of concepts in your head that then your brain has to try to compress into this incredibly low data rate called speech or typing," Mr. Musk told Mr. Urban in his 36,000-word blog post, which at times reads like a neuroscience textbook. "That's what language is, your brain has executed a compression algorithm on thought, "http://waitbutwhy.com/2017/04/neuralink.html"

"If you have two brain interfaces, you could actually do an uncompressed direct conceptual communication with another person," Mr. Musk said. He explained how it would be easier if people could beam a picture into the heads of others instead of trying to describe it with words.

But first Mr. Musk is looking for more realistic applications of Neuralink's technology. He said that in about four years Neuralink hopes to market a device that would help treat severe brain injuries, including strokes, cancer lesions, paralysis and memory problems. The strategy is similar to SpaceX and Tesla, where Mr. Musk developed new rocket and electric-car technologies, proved they work, and is now using them to pursue more ambitious projects.

"I think we are about eight to 10 years away from this being usable by people with no disability," Mr. Musk said in the post. "It is important to note that this depends heavily on regulatory approval timing and how well our devices work on people with disabilities."

Mr. Musk has spoken out about the dangers of being left behind by the advancements of artificial intelligence. "The pace of progress in this direction matters a lot," Mr. Musk said in Thursday's post. "We don't want to develop digital superintelligence too far before being able to do a merged brain-computer interface."

There are several challenges to developing the technology miniaturizing electrodes, making them much more technically sophisticated as well as compatible with and implantable in brain matter. Neuralink wants its interface to operate wirelessly of course, so it will have to find a way to convert brain signals to digital signals, and send huge amounts of data into and out of the brain.

Mr. Musk's comments come a day after "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-aims-to-connect-directly-to-your-brain-1492642672". "What if you could type directly from your brain?" asked Regina Dugan, who runs Facebook's secretive hardware division Building 8, during a keynote address at the company's F8 developer conference Wednesday. Facebook job postings show the company is looking to hire engineers to work on "brain-computer interface" technology.

"https://neuralink.com/" is in hiring mode, too. Its new website is essentially a list of open positions in San Francisco, mostly for a range of engineers. First on the list is a "microfabrication engineer" to lead development of a new class of "biological probes."

Deutsche Bank Tries

Artificial Intelligence

Deutsche Bank AG, facing a vast body of financial regulations, is turning to artificial intelligence as it sorts through volumes of voice and video recordings to make sure its professionals are complying with the rules.

The move is designed in part to reduce costs as well as to improve accuracy, when analyzing, say, employees' interactions with clients, said Elly Hardwick, head of innovation at the bank.

The technology can search for terms, in context, that auditors monitor, she said. "In the old days, you'd go through tape and listen to hours of audio," she said.

CORPORATE DEBT

IMF Warns Over

Leverage in U.S.

U.S. corporate debt has ballooned to levels exceeding those prevailing before the 2008 crisis, a potential threat to financial stability, the International Monetary Fund warned in a review of threats to markets and banks.

High leverage could become problematic as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, the IMF warned, since higher borrowing costs could hinder the ability of firms to service debts.

Companies added $7.8 trillion of debt and other liabilities since 2010, issuing $3 trillion of equity, net of buybacks, the IMF said.

The fearless market; FT BIG READ: VOLATILITY

The Vix index was designed to measure investor anxiety about the future. But with political and economic risks mounting, it has instead become a platform for high-risk trading strategies. By Robin Wigglesworth

In 1992, a Bob Dylan-loving finance professor called Robert Whaley uprooted his family from the US and moved to a tiny hamlet in bucolic Burgundy. There he spent six months laying the groundwork for the finance industry's most popular representation of stress.

Its formal name is the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index , or Vix for short. But for thousands of traders, investors and financiers it eventually became known as Wall Street's "fear gauge", a clean numeric representation of how relaxed or horrified financial markets are.

Volatility was once merely a mathematical measure for investors of how sharply markets moved. Today, volatility is a complex multibillion-dollar market in its own right, played by everyone from sophisticated hedge funds to gum-chewing day traders. And Vix has become a rock star index, even inspiring a best-selling thriller about an artificial intelligence-powered hedge fund called Vixal-4 that runs amok.

But Vix is also one of the finance industry's biggest enigmas. This should be a moment of potential peril for markets, with US interest rates rising, heightened geopolitical tension and a populist outsider in the White House. Yet Vix has remained largely tranquil . Despite nudging higher last week , if the current performance is sustained, the gauge's average level this year would be the lowest in its 24-year history.

"The big mystery of the year has been the disconnect between the chaos in Washington and the calmness in markets," says Adam Sender, head of Sender Company and Partners, a hedge fund.

In part, Vix has been becalmed because the US stock market has been remarkably placid. The S&P 500 recently enjoyed its longest run of avoiding big drops of more than 1 per cent in over two decades. But the evaporation of volatility also reflects profound structural changes that have taken place since the financial crisis, such as the primacy of central banks and the big shift into exchange traded funds .

Yet this tranquillity is unnerving some analysts, who fear it has nurtured a panoply of trading strategies that could unravel if volatility returns to normal. Some analysts even fret that Vix, supposedly a helpful canary in the coal mine for investors, could contribute to market turmoil given an unfortunate confluence of circumstances .

"There is one thing that Wall Street does with uncanny frequency - it turns a good and profitable product into something dangerous as its life cycle goes on," said Peter Tchir, an analyst at Brean Capital, in a recent note. "I think selling volatility is becoming more commonplace and that poses a potential danger."

Turning chaos positive

Christopher Cole was toiling away deep inside Merrill Lynch's New York office, arranging complicated debt structures for pension funds and insurers, when he fell in love with volatility.

When he first started trading on the side of his day job, the chartered financial analyst naturally gravitated towards the approach of "value" investors such as Warren Buffett. But when Mr Cole started dabbling with Vix derivatives in 2006 he knew he had found his calling. "Volatility is the rawest form of playing market psychology," he says.

His timing was fortuitous. In 2007 the US housing downturn began rattling markets, and by 2008 a financial crisis had erupted. For Mr Cole, astute bets on volatility paid off handsomely, allowing him in 2009 to quit his job to set up Artemis Capital Management , a volatility-focused hedge fund that says it manages $150m of assets.

"We were literally born out of the crisis," he says. "It felt very good at a period like that to take chaos and turn it into something positive."

Mr Cole's exploits show how volatility has blossomed into a tradable asset. The derivatives he began trading in 2006 had only been around since 2004, and the first ETFs linked to Vix were introduced only in 2009-10. Today, volatility is a vibrant, complex asset class in its own right. "It is a pretty amazing ecosystem," says Edward Tilly, chairman and chief executive of CBOE.

CBOE's volatility index reflects the weighted average prices of "options" on the S&P 500 index, the biggest US equity gauge. Options are a type of derivative, which can either give buyers the right but not the obligation to buy an underlying index or individual stock at a certain price (a call), or to sell the asset at the pre-agreed price (a put).

Vix is calculated using the prices of S&P 500 puts and calls that mature in roughly the next 30 days. It is structured so that if investors expect S&P 500 fluctuations to average 1 per cent a day for the next month, the Vix level is about 20 - roughly its long-run average - while 40 implies 2 per cent moves. This year it has averaged a depressed 11.7.

No one can actually trade the "spot" or current level of Vix, as it merely reflects a bundle of underlying derivatives. But CBOE has nurtured a derivatives market based on the index itself. From 2004 investors could trade Vix "futures" - another popular derivative instrument - and from 2006 they could trade Vix options.

Profiting from tranquillity

In practice, a futures contract is one of the oldest contracts in civilisation. It is merely an agreement between two parties to sell an asset at a pre-agreed price and time, whether it is a cow, a bale of hay or a financial instrument. Vix futures allow investors to bet on volatility with contracts that should rocket in value when the stock market tumbles.

Financial engineers have used Vix futures to develop a cornucopia of "exchange traded products" that allow investors to bet on or against the Vix. Their popularity has exploded in recent years. In fact, the VXX ETP was the fifth-most actively traded security in the US stock markets last year, and an even more leveraged cousin, the UVXY, was the 10th-most traded security, according to Credit Suisse.

But this is the development the index's inventor is unhappy about, given structural flaws that make these products ill-suited for retail investors. Constantly buying new futures is costly, and Vix futures are typically in "contango", when longer-term contracts are more expensive than near-term ones. In practice this means that Vix ETPs are most of the time slowly bleeding to death.

"The idea is a good one, but the issue I'm concerned about is the packaging of Vix derivatives into retail products. It's a market integrity issue," Prof Whaley says. "I worry about the social purpose of it. We're just giving people something volatile to gamble on."

Since 2010 about $16bn - mostly from retail investors - has flowed into various ETPs that bet on increases in Vix, according to Deutsche Bank. Only $2bn remains, the balance vapourised by the products' complex structure. If you had invested $1m in the first one when it launched in 2009 you'd have less than $600 left today, says Pravit Chintawongvanich, a strategist at Macro Risk Advisors.

However, betting on falling volatility has trounced the returns of pretty much everything since the crisis. Hedge funds typically do this by selling longer-term Vix futures on the expectation that the spot price will usually end up being lower, allowing them to pocket the difference. The biggest "short" Vix ETP that mimics this has handed investors gains of almost 900 per cent since the end of 2011. Known by its ticker XIV, it is the world's 34th most traded equity with a daily volume of $818m, according to Bloomberg, making it more actively traded than the stock of market stalwarts such as Chevron or Pfizer.

But why is Vix so calm, and how can betting on tranquillity have been such a money-spinner in the turbulent post-crisis era? The reality is that Vix has not been out of kilter with actual, realised volatility, which has also been remarkably subdued since 2009 - for a series of reasons.

Most analysts attribute this to central banks spraying markets with monetary stimulus whenever turbulence threatens to return, backstopping investors and encouraging them to see every tumble as a buying opportunity .

"There is an entire generation of traders that have only known the 'buy the dip' era," Mr Cole says. "This then becomes a self-reinforcing prophecy that we even embed into markets with automated trading algorithms."

There have also been the torrential outflows from traditional fund managers into passive investment vehicles like index-trackers and ETFs, which means that the entire US stock market waxes and wanes in unison, subduing individual stock volatility. Indeed, this year's somnolence has come as ETF inflows have kicked up another notch.

The post-crisis explosion of corporate buybacks has also damped volatility. Companies have repurchased more than $2tn of their own shares in the past five years, providing a vital pillar of support to the broader stock market. Finally, Vix is also subdued by technical factors. Hedge funds and, increasingly, institutional investors keen to juice up returns are consistently betting on the index staying somnolent over the long run. This becomes self-fulfilling, as their selling of Vix futures and options drives down the price of the contracts.

"Vix isn't broken, it's the market that's broken," says Mr Cole. "Vix is like a guy who's getting divorced and losing his job, but is still coming in to work. He's sitting there seemingly calmly, doing his job, but beneath the surface the stress is there."

Fears of genuine turbulence

Many analysts are worried that markets are too sanguine about the prospect of renewed turbulence, and the damage that could wreak on complacent investors who have been betting on continued calmness.

Mr Cole compares the temptation of lucrative low-volatility bets with the sirens of Greek mythology, whose irresistible song lured sailors to their doom. "The siren call of risk is at its most powerful when we are at the point of maximum danger," he says.

"We can probably get a little closer, but we're a lot closer to that point than before."

For people betting on tranquillity, the pain can be intense when turmoil erupts. For example, the XIV ETP may have been a money machine over the past five years, but it dived almost 50 per cent in just three torrid trading days in late August 2015. It lost almost 10 per cent last week, when volatility flickered back. Post-crisis bursts of turbulence have typically been shortlived. But if the pacific period ends, some analysts are concerned it could cause wider carnage .

Investors who bet on low volatility would suffer damaging losses and be forced to cover their exposure by shorting the broader market. That would in turn push stocks even lower and volatility higher again, sparking a negative feedback loop . This is beginning to unnerve some big investors, who might suffer collateral damage.

"It's inevitable, we just don't know the timing," says Michael Roberge, the co-chief executive and chief investment officer of MFS, a $450bn investment group that invented the mutual fund nearly a century ago. "There are so many people selling volatility that when it turns, they will be hurt. Volatility is like a spring, the more compressed it becomes, the more energy it has when released."

Vix alternatives

New gauges aim to price in uncertainty

The tranquillity of Wall Street's pre-eminent fear gauge has led to a surge in interest in alternative measures of nervousness.

One that has gained some currency is the Chicago Board Options Exchange's "Skew" Index. Like the Vix index, it is based on the prices of options on the S&P 500, but Skew measures the difference between the cost of buying insurance against a market crash and the cost of buying the right to participate in a rally. It is therefore another reasonable approximation for the amount of fear in the financial system.

Some banks have also devised their own measures that capture some of the same sentiment. Credit Suisse's "Fear Barometer" uses equity options, like Vix and Skew, while Bank of America's Global Financial Stress Index includes bond yields, investment flows and other measures of risk. One of the more intriguing indicators is being developed by Menachem Brenner and Yehuda Izhakian of New York University's Stern School and Baruch College respectively. They are working on an "ambiguity index" that captures not just volatility, but uncertainty.

"Risk in equity markets means that future returns are realised with known probabilities, while ambiguity refers to situations where the probabilities associated with these realisations are not known or not uniquely assigned," the professors said in a recent paper.

Mr Brenner, who did some of the foundational academic work on volatility and first proposed a volatility index in the 1980s, says the difference between measuring fear and uncertainty can be understood by flipping a manipulated coin.

"A simple coin flip might be a 50-50 probability," he says. "But what if you know the coin is weighted to have a bias on one side, but you don't know which one? That's uncertainty."

PetSmart is champing at the e-bit, clinching a deal for pet products site Chewy.com.

Chewy's co-founder and Chief Executive Ryan Cohen will remain in charge of the startup, which will operate largely as an independent unit of PetSmart, the companies said.

Financial terms weren't disclosed. The deal is expected to close by the end of the second fiscal quarter.

PetSmart was taken private in 2015 by a group led by private-equity firm BC Partners"https://www.wsj.com/articles/petsmart-to-be-acquired-by-investor-group-led-by-bc-partners-1418591002". The company has been trying to expand its online market share, including a roughly $130 million deal for Pet360 in 2014.

Chewy.com, with about $900 million in sales last year, is the No. 1 online pet retailer, ahead of Amazon.com, according to analytics firm 1010data.

Founded in 2011, Chewy.com attracted investments from the likes of Mark Vadon, whose previous ventures include internet retailer Zulily Inc. and online jeweler Blue Nile, and Kevin Hoffman, Home Depot Inc.'s chief marketing officer and president of online operations, along with Volition Capital, formerly the Fidelity Ventures unit of Fidelity Investments.

Chewy, which bills itself as "your neighborhood pet store, but better," is based in Dania Beach, Fla., and has more than 5,000 employees with operations in Boston, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Texas and Nevada.

Meanwhile, PetSmart has more than 1,500 stores and some 55,000 workers.

Bots given female names and window seats after winning over workmates

Workers are starting to project personalities on to software programs by giving them female names, talking to them and even giving up the window seat as flesh-and-blood employees adjust to sharing the office with bots.

As artificial intelligence invades the workplace, people are learning to live with their new robot counterparts, even though their own jobs might be next for the chopping block.

Staff at back-office operations for ANZ bank in Bangalore have given their new colleagues softer female names such as Lakshmi, while employees at Nippon Life Insurance Company in Japan call them robomi-chan , or "pretty little robot". In London, workers at insurance processing company Xchanging have named one of their bots Poppy.

"I've heard Danis and Lakshmis," said Pankajam Sridevi, a managing director at ANZ. "They talk to them, they're like humans. Sometimes people are so fond of them they give them a window seat."

Using technology to take over information processing tasks is nothing new. But the latest manifestation of office automation - where software robots carry out tasks that a human worker would once have done on their PC - comes in a form that makes it ripe for anthropomorphisation.

Robots such as these work 24 hours a day and do not make mistakes, and their developers credit them with doing the work of two or three people.

Giving names and personalities to the new robots has become common among people who find themselves working alongside the new programs, said Alastair Bathgate, chief executive of Blue Prism, one of the companies that develops the software. Ms Sridevi said that naming robots had helped workers accept the software and lessened the risk it would be seen as a job-destroyer.

The urge to name the robots has borne out at least one familiar pattern: the projection of female personalities on to new "intelligent" software assistants such as Amazon's Alexa and Microsoft's Cortana. Only Apple's Siri offers a male voice as an alternative to the female-dominated line-up.

Entrepreneurs such as Chrissie Lightfoot, co-founder of Robot Lawyer Lisa, are in little doubt about why a female personality is the way to go.

"People do feel more comfortable dealing with females than males in tricky matters," she said.

Pro Private Markets
Chernova's Take: The Darker Side of the Limelight; Let's not forget how damaging venture's herd mentality can be

More eyes are following venture capital.

Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research has launched a new series called Venture Capital Horizons. Goldman analysts say they will watch the space for competitive threats, M&A targets, and emerging business trends that matter to public companies and investors. These things are ever more relevant for the public markets as venture-backed companies stay private longer.

"Developments in venture are an increasingly important part of the investment process across every industry, geography, and asset class," Goldman says in its newest report on the issue. "As new technologies, business models, and capital structures develop, venture's share of public-market funds and corporate capital grows, and existing industries and companies are disrupted."

So congratulations, VCs! You are being recognized as the harbingers of big business trends. Goldman cites, for example, a spike in venture investment in artificial intelligence startups at the end of 2014 as a precursor to acquisitions in the sector by public companies that followed.

But let's not fool ourselves. The venture market is known not only as a window into the prosperous future, but also for its bubbles and herd mentality. Spikes in attention to a sector often have led investors astray.

VCs surely can have some overcapitalized sectors. Remember bitcoin, wearable electronics, flash-sale e-commerce sites, Uber for fill-in-the-blank, and, of course, clean tech, just to name a few.

Do we really want public investors to follow venture capital down rabbit holes? It would be risky for public investors, but it could also easily exacerbate some of the biggest VC miscalculations.

Fed Officials Make Their Mark in Deregulatory Debate

Federal Reserve officials can see that the regulatory pendulum is swinging toward a reassessment of postcrisis rules, and they are assiduously trying to shape the debate in their carefully calibrated public statements.

Reading the Fed tea leaves holds significantly less importance for regulatory matters than for monetary policy (given that Congress ultimately must decide on most major changes to regulation, as opposed to the Federal Open Market Committee acting unilaterally). Still, the blessing of Fed officials could grease the wheels for bipartisan, piecemeal changes.

Perhaps the most important endorsement for regulatory changes "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-tarullo-opens-door-to-changes-in-stress-tests-volcker-rule-1491337896", who stepped down as a Fed governor earlier this month and used his farewell address to signal his support for altering the Volcker rule speculative-trading ban and the Fed's "stress tests" of bank health.

Mr. Tarullo's credibility is unshakable even with the loudest advocates for strong regulation, making his proposed changes a plausible starting point for bipartisan action. His calendars suggest that he may have been priming the pump even as he prepared to leave office on the day he announced his retirement, he called two lawmakers: Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio), populist liberals who zealously protect the postcrisis regulatory regime.

Though Mr. Tarullo could be expected to deliver a wish list as he left his post, other senior Fed officials have hastened to add their voices to the regulatory-overhaul debate as well.

The day after Mr. Tarullo retired, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley gave a speech at the Princeton Club in New York "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-dudley-open-to-changes-in-financial-regulation-1491581706" to the ones his colleague had outlined. Stress testing, though "vital," could be modified to lessen banks' compliance burdens, he said, adding he would also welcome broader changes to lighten the load on smaller financial institutions.

The Volcker rule, Mr. Dudley argued, could also be worth revising. He said that "the line between market-making and proprietary trading is not always clear-cut, which makes regulation in this space difficult," adding that "it may be worth considering giving greater discretion to trading desks that facilitate client business to intervene when markets are illiquid and volatile."

Along with Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen , who has long said that she would support relief for community banks and other smaller financial institutions, senior Fed officials are telegraphing a clear message about postcrisis regulation: reassessing the rules isn't heresy, and making certain changes won't threaten financial stability while it could be beneficial for credit conditions and economic growth.

The Senate Banking Committee under new Chairman Mike Crapo (R., Idaho) has gotten off to bipartisan start, passing a series of "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-banking-panel-advances-series-of-deregulatory-bills-1489079983" last month with only two Democrats (including Ms. Warren) voicing opposition. With high-ranking Fed officials' imprimatur, the committee may be able to build on that success to pass other changes.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Randal Quarles Set to Be Named to Bank-Supervision Post at Fed

By Nick Timiraos and Peter Nicholas

WASHINGTON A former top Treasury Department official in the George W. Bush administration is expected to be President Donald Trump 's pick for a top financial regulatory post at the Federal Reserve , a senior official familiar with the matter said Sunday.

Randal Quarles, who now runs the Cynosure Group, a Salt Lake City-based investment firm he co-founded, is expected to be selected as the Fed's vice chairman for bank supervision. The position requires Senate confirmation.

Mr. Quarles couldn't immediately be reached for comment. A White House spokeswoman declined to comment.

The position was created by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law to oversee the largest U.S. banks. Former President Barack Obama never nominated anyone to the job. Former Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo , who stepped down in April, served as the de facto vice chairman for supervision. The position is one of three vacancies on the Fed board.

Filling the position will give the Trump administration a significant opportunity to shape its financial regulation agenda.

Mr. Quarles said in a 2015 interview with Bloomberg TV that repealing the Dodd-Frank law altogether is "politically very difficult," but that significant changes to the law were worth considering. In some respects, he said, the regulatory overhaul was "not ambitious enough," while in other ways "it was overly ambitious."

Mr. Quarles is seen as less ideological than other candidates the Trump administration had considered for the job. That suggests the White House could take a more considered approach to overhauling the regulatory architecture put in place by the Obama administration and Mr. Tarullo.

In the same interview, Mr. Quarles said he supported efforts to create more predictable monetary policy by having the Fed follow a simple rule, or formula, to set interest rates that uses measures of inflation and economic slack. At the time, he said the Fed's approach to monetary policy was increasing uncertainty in the markets. "An important element of Republican thinking about monetary policy currently is that it ought to be more rules based," he said in the 2015 interview.

Officials in the Trump administration have said filling the vice chairman's job is a priority and broadened their search for the job in recent weeks. A leading contender for the position, GE Capital executive David Nason , took himself out of the running last month.

Mr. Quarles served at Treasury from 2001 to 2006, including as undersecretary for domestic finance in his final two years at the department. He was a partner of the Carlyle Group , one of the world's largest private equity firms. He also served at the Treasury in the administration of George H.W. Bush.

At least at the outset, Mr. Trump's nominee probably won't be able to exercise significant influence over the largest U.S. financial firms in the same fashion as Mr. Tarullo. Major regulatory decisions will have to be approved by Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen , a defender of the Fed's new regulatory regime. She has said she intends to serve out her term through February 2018, and Mr. Trump hasn't ruled out reappointing her.

Fired KPMG Audit Head: How Did Scott Marcello Fall From Grace?

By Michael Rapoport and Dave Michaels

Scott Marcello was supposed to be the man to redeem KPMG LLP 's audit business. Instead, he and other top partners became the center of a scandal that tarnished the firm's reputation.

The accounting world was stunned last week when Mr. Marcello, KPMG 's top audit official, was fired over a leak of confidential information. The firm said Mr. Marcello, who turns 54 this month, and four other partners were let go over the mishandling of a tip that gave the firm improper advance word about which of its audits its regulator planned to scrutinize in its annual inspections.

Mr. Marcello, a three-decade veteran at the firm, was a highly regarded and technically accomplished auditor, specializing in the intricate financial statements of banks and insurers. He climbed the ladder at KPMG to become the Big Four accounting firm's vice chair of audit, managing a workforce of thousands of auditors. After his 2015 promotion from national leader of the firm's financial-services practice, he faced the challenge of satisfying KPMG 's regulator, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which in recent years had scored KPMG 'S auditing performance below that of other big firms.

People who know Mr. Marcello said they were surprised such an experienced, knowledgeable auditor someone who volunteered as a mission hospital consultant in Africa, and has chaired a Christian school in Connecticut is accused of having gotten into such a fix.

"It's a huge and disappointing thing to happen to such a fine individual," said Dennis Beresford, former chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the U.S. accounting rule-writing panel, who knows Mr. Marcello from common ties to a professional organization. He called Mr. Marcello "personable and extremely competent."

Mr. Marcello declined to comment to a Wall Street Journal reporter at his Connecticut home. KPMG and the accounting board declined to comment.

Details of the leak to KPMG are still unclear, as are the precise roles that Mr. Marcello and his deputy David Middendorf, who also was fired, are alleged to have played in the process. But they were aware that others at KPMG had received leaked information and "failed to report the situation in a timely manner," KPMG said in a statement Tuesday.

Lynne Doughtie , the firm's chairman and CEO, said KPMG has "zero tolerance for such unethical behavior," and KPMG has said it told the accounting board about the matter as soon as top management learned of it.

The leaked information could have given KPMG a leg up in preparing for the PCAOB's inspection, widely seen as a key report card on the quality of the firm's audits. Among the Big Four accounting firms, KPMG has had the highest number of deficiencies cited by the accounting board in each of the past two years.

The leak reflects the tension between the Big Four accounting firms and the rigorous demands of the accounting board, which was created in the wake of the Enron Corp . scandal.

Some auditors have long felt stressed by the board's inspections, feeling their careers could be set back if the regulator finds problems with too many of their audits. "They are all feeling the pain and the frustration," said Bob Conway, a former KPMG partner who later ran the accounting board's Southern California office.

Mr. Marcello took over as KPMG's vice chair of audit after several years in which the firm's inspection results had steadily worsened. The rate of deficient audits found by the PCAOB had risen from 22% for 2010 to 54% for 2014.

Several months before Mr. Marcello's appointment, the accounting board unsealed previously confidential criticisms that the firm had failed to sufficiently evaluate information that could have contradicted its audit conclusions a public rebuke of the firm, similar to what the regulator had done with other Big Four firms.

Mr. Marcello cast the image of an auditor well prepared for the job: He had deep knowledge of accounting practices through his auditing of complex financial companies as well as a two-year fellowship at the FASB, which also gave him experience as a rule maker and in dealing with the Securities and Exchange Commission .

He was "straight out of central casting," said a person who had worked with him. He was an everyman, "the exact opposite of flashy," the person said.

Mr. Marcello wanted to find a way to provide more timely services to companies and investors than an auditor's typical annual audit opinion on a company. "We've got to get to this place where we are really dealing in the real time with the things that people use to make important decisions," he told an industry conference last August.

Outside the accounting world, Mr. Marcello has volunteered as a consultant for missionary hospitals in Africa and contributed to the construction of a clinic for HIV-infected Kenyans, said Jon Fielder, president of the African Mission Healthcare Foundation.

He also has been chairman of the Christian Heritage School, a private, 450-student school in Trumbull, Conn. Mr. Marcello designed a system to track the school's financial health, creating spreadsheets and slides showing whether it was exceeding or falling short of its financial goals, according to Bob Boronski, vice chairman of the school's board when Mr. Marcello served on it.

Mr. Middendorf, Mr. Marcello's deputy at KPMG, also was a star at the firm. He was a top auditor of KPMG clients such as Home Depot Inc ., J.C. Penney Co . and Macy's Inc . before becoming national managing partner of audit quality, where he was directly responsible for dealing with the PCAOB and making sure the firm's audits were in good shape. He also sat on a PCAOB advisory panel that counsels the board on its development of new auditing rules.

Mr. Middendorf himself has voiced concerns about the accounting board's inspections, calling them "an area for stress" for audit partners. "It is a reason some people leave our profession, because they just don't like that stress," Mr. Middendorf said at a May 2016 meeting of the advisory panel, according to a transcript of the meeting.

Ultimately, though, inspections do "drive the right behavior," he said. Auditors "want to learn from it and get better."

Mr. Middendorf didn't respond to repeated requests for comment.

SEC Targets Illicit Options Trades Made Ahead of Telecom Deal

By Chris Dieterich

If you're trading on inside information, maybe be a bit more discreet?

The Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday announced a court order to freeze assets in brokerage accounts that made suspicious, windfall-reaping options trades ahead of an acquisition announced last week.

At issue are short-dated, out-out-of-the-money calls bought days before Liberty Interactive announced its acquisition of General Communication, a telecom provider. The deal news on April 4 caused GCI's stock price to soar 62%, yielding a $1 million profit for the options buyers. Buyers of call options can earn lottery-ticket-like profits when the underlying stock shoots higher.

The SEC says that unknown traders with accounts in the U.K. and Lebanon bought nearly 1,300 GCI calls that expire in April and May, paying a bit more than $48,000. This buying spree took place from March 20 to March 31, the period during which GDI and Liberty were in talks about the acquisition, according to the SEC's complaint.

Only traders wagering on a big stock move in a short period of time could have made money on these options. Another dead giveaway is the fact that suspicious call buying represented a "significant" amount of GCI's total options volume, the SEC says. Only 27 GCI call options traded daily on average in the year before before the illicit activity, Trade Alert data show. Ten times that number traded during the days before the deal.

The traders allegedly sold the bulk of the contracts after the announcement.

"The timing, size, and profitability of the trades as well as the absence of any recent trading by the accounts in these particular securities make the transactions highly suspicious," said Michele Wein Layne, director of the SEC's Los Angeles Regional Office. "We don't hesitate to act quickly and proactively to freeze accounts and prevent proceeds from dissipating while we continue to investigate dubious transactions and identify the traders behind them."

Informal Lending in China Ramped Up in March

BEIJING Chinese borrowers rushed to tap informal credit in March as Beijing's efforts to rein in financial risk drove them away from traditional bank lending.

The trend highlights the challenge for policy makers, worried about high debt levels but unable to allow growth to slow too much. Government spending ramped up last month, which economists say will keep the economy going for now.

"The overall appetite for credit is still quite good," said Yan Ling, an economist with China Merchants Securities. "It's just that the banks are turning the lending activities off the balance sheet."

Chinese financial institutions issued 1.02 trillion yuan ($148 billion) in new loans in March, down from 1.17 trillion yuan in February, the People's Bank of China said Friday. The lending came in below a median forecast of 1.225 trillion yuan in a Wall Street Journal poll of 13 economists.

Chinese banks normally rush to lend at the end of each quarter, but the central bank's risk-control efforts, known as its macroprudential assessment, have curbed lending activities on banks' balance sheet, said Ms. Yan.

Overall lending rose, however. Total social financing, a measure that includes nonbank credit, stood at 2.12 trillion yuan in March, up sharply from 1.15 trillion yuan in February. The proportions of bank loans in total new credit dropped to 54% in March from nearly 89% in February.

As Beijing tries to reduce companies' debt levels, it is counting more on accelerating fiscal spending on infrastructure and other public projects to support economic growth this year, said Jianguang Shen, an economist at Mizuho Securities .

National fiscal expenditure central and local governments included rose 25.4% last month, compared with a year earlier, accelerating from a rise of 17.4% over first two months of the year, the Finance Ministry said Friday.

On Monday, China is expected to post first-quarter growth of 6.8% from a year earlier, mirroring the relatively strong expansion in the previous quarter.

China's broadest measure of money supply, M2, was up 10.6% at the end of March from a year earlier, consistent with the decline in new yuan loans. The M2's rise compared with an 11.1% increase the month before and a median forecast for 11% in March.

Regulators have vowed to include some off-balance-sheet lending activity in its risk assessment, which means that total social financing could drop in the future, said Mizuho's Shen.

Policy makers have made it clear that they need to reduce leverage ratios, said Mr. Shen. "The credit binge cannot last forever," he added. "It's going to hurt economic growth in the long run."

Hacker Group Says U.S. Tried to Breach Money-Transfer System

By Robert McMillan

A shadowy hacking group, which says it stole files from the U.S. National Security Agency , released documents and hacking tools that allegedly describe a U.S. effort to compromise users of the major international money-transfer system.

The documents, released Friday by a group that calls itself Shadow Brokers, includes PowerPoint slides and other documents that describe an alleged effort by the NSA to target two "service bureaus" connected to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication , or Swift. The documents say the NSA broke into one of the bureaus, which are companies that facilitate funds transfers for smaller banks, as recently as in 2013.

The documents' authenticity couldn't be independently verified by The Wall Street Journal. Several computer-security specialists said that data in them appeared to be legitimate but one of the two bureaus denied it had been hacked. The NSA didn't respond to messages seeking comment Friday.

A spokeswoman for Swift said it is aware of the allegations. "There is no impact on SWIFT's infrastructure or data, however we understand that communications between these service bureaus and their customers may previously have been accessed by unauthorized third parties," she said in an email.

The data dump is the latest in a string of leaks that appear designed to undermine U.S. intelligence efforts. In August 2013, the Shadow Brokers leaked another trove of alleged NSA attack tools and last month the WikiLeaks website released details on alleged Central Intelligence Agency attack tools. Neither the CIA nor the NSA have ever confirmed the authenticity of those documents. On Thursday, CIA Director Mike Pompeo called WikiLeaks a "a nonstate hostile intelligence service often abetted by state actors like Russia."

Little is known about Shadow Brokers, which presents itself as anarchic vendors of government hacking secrets. While no individual involved has been identified as a member of the group, one man, former NSA contractor Harold "Hal" Martin III, was charged last October with stealing classified information from the NSA following an investigation into an August release of documents by The Shadow Brokers. It isn't clear if there is any connection between Mr. Martin and the hacking group, and the Shadow Brokers have continued to operate following Mr. Martin's arrest. Mr. Martin maintains his innocence.

Swift lists about 70 service bureaus world-wide on its website. Of the two financial-services technology firms listed in the Shadow Brokers documents, one is Eastern Networks (IT) Solution Provider Corp., known as EastNets, which has a large Middle East presence. The second is Business Computer Group, which operates in Panama, Venezuela, and the U.S., according to its website.

The Shadow Brokers documents allegedly show the NSA targeted, but didn't manage to compromise, Business Computer Group, and that it did compromise EastNets a claim that company disputed.

The information disclosed about the hack appears obsolete and generated from a "low-level internal server" that the company retired in 2013, EastNets Chief Executive Hazem Mulhim said in an email. "The EastNets Network internal Security Unit has ran a complete check of its servers and found no hacker compromise or any vulnerabilities," he said.

Business Computer Group didn't respond to messages seeking comment.

Shadow Brokers has provided data in the past that security experts said seemed to be legitimate. Last August, for example, the group released a number of previously undisclosed attack tools that forced networking makers to patch their products.

And executives at several computer-security firms contacted Friday said the new data appeared to also be legitimate. Matt Suiche, founder of Comae Technologies FZE, a company that investigates computer intrusions, said the documents include Excel files supposedly containing employee login credentials as well as information allegedly about EastNets customers, and that the Windows attack tools appear to work as indicated.

Despite the EastNets denial, "a lot of the information indicates that this is a legit hack," said Andrei Barysevich, director of advanced collection at the threat-intelligence firm Recorded Future Inc .

A dozen of the hacking tools released on Friday target older versions of Microsoft Corp . products such as the Windows operating system, but in a blog post Microsoft said that users of up-to-date versions of the company's products are not at risk.

If the new information is legitimate, publicly disclosing it will cause problems for any organization that is using the attack tools, said Thomas Rid, a professor in security studies at King's College London. "The Shadow Brokers are burning the exploits, and that's a serious operational setback," he said.

Fed Puts Together Plan to Unwind Securities Portfolio

By Nick Timiraos

The Federal Reserve is moving quickly to fill in the details of how it will wind down its securities holdings in the years ahead, a process that could start this year and become the next big challenge for investors grown accustomed to easy money from the world's most important central bank.

The Fed wants to move toward a smaller portfolio for several reasons. The economy is on stronger footing, leaving less need for support from a large bond portfolio. The large holdings have become a political liability, unpopular in Congress. Moreover, getting started now could relieve pressure on possible new leadership in 2018, when Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen 's term ends. Finally, officials want room to ramp it back up in a crisis if needed.

The Fed moved closer to agreement on the outlines of a plan at their March 14-15 meeting, according to an official account released this month and interviews with officials.

Officials want their benchmark federal-funds rate to remain the primary tool for managing monetary policy, which means once they start shrinking the balance sheet, they want that process to run in the background with little ripple in markets.

If the economy performs in line with the Fed's forecasts, the bank could begin allowing its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage bonds to mature without reinvesting all of the proceeds into new securities later this year or early in 2018.

Officials have penciled in two more quarter-point rate increases this year. After that, the Fed could pause rate increases, set into motion its plan to shrink the balance sheet, and then return to its normal practice of raising short-term rates.

Among the issues the Fed is working to resolve: How large should the balance sheet be when the Fed ends the process? The Fed's holdings swelled to $4.5 trillion from less than $900 billion before the financial crisis in 2008 through asset-purchase programs aimed at lowering long-term interest rates and boosting economic growth.

Already, the Fed's portfolio is providing less support to the economy than before because it is holding fewer bonds with long maturities. Holding long-maturity bonds is stimulative because these are especially risky assets. Constraining the supply of these risky assets sends investors in search of other risky assets, pushing up the values of stocks, corporate bonds and other private holdings.

At the end of 2013, the Fed owned nearly $750 billion in U.S. Treasuries with maturities between seven and 10 years. That total had fallen to $200 billion at the end of last year and is on track to reach $100 billion at the end of this year, according to FTN Financial.

Even though the Fed will shrink its holdings from current levels, it will end up with more assets than it did before the crisis because its liabilities have grown there's more currency in circulation and the U.S. Treasury has increased its cash balance.

Changes in how it sets interest rates will also make the portfolio larger than before. Before 2008, banks held relatively low levels of deposits known as reserves at the Fed. The central bank managed the federal funds rate by making small adjustments in the amount of these reserves through routine purchases and sales of Treasury securities.

Now, with a large portfolio of securities, the Fed has left the banking system flush with trillions of dollars in reserves. It manages rates now by paying interest on these reserves. New York Fed President William Dudley said this month he prefers keeping some level of excess reserves in the banking system perhaps $500 billion to $1 trillion which will mean keeping a larger portfolio of securities than prevailed before the crisis.

Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc . estimate the balance sheet could shrink to $2 trillion if the Fed chooses to minimize reserves, and hover near $2.9 trillion if the central bank wants a higher level of reserves.

Another question is how fast the Fed should get there. Officials leaned at their March meeting toward reducing holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds simultaneously. They could reduce these holdings gradually by tapering the reinvestments of principal payments, or they could stop the reinvestments cold turkey, which would be easier to communicate to markets but could also create more market volatility. Significant shares of the Fed's Treasury holdings are scheduled to mature in 2018 and 2019.

Officials at the March meeting seemed inclined to phase out the holdings gradually instead. That would add only around a year to an already drawn-out process of shrinking the portfolio, and officials may conclude it's a small price to avoid a re-run of the 2013 "taper tantrum" on Wall Street, when the Fed signaled an end to its asset purchases and roiled emerging stock and bond markets and sent up interest rates.

Finally, the Fed needs to manage the composition of its holdings.

Officials have said once they get the balance sheet to its steady state, they want almost all central bank holdings in Treasurys, not mortgages. But because their mortgage bonds have longer durations than Treasuries, the Fed could hold a much larger share of mortgage bonds once their balance sheet stabilizes. This could prompt the Fed to remix its portfolio down the road, perhaps by reinvesting principal from maturing mortgages into Treasuries.

To avoid roiling markets, officials aren't inclined to engage in large-scale sales of their mortgage holdings.

More details about the strategy are likely to emerge in the months ahead.

Wells Fargo Board Faces High-Stakes Vote

By Emily Glazer and Joann S. Lublin

Wells Fargo & Co . faces something few other big banks have dealt with since the financial crisis: a serious effort to vote out most of its directors.

As the bank's April 25 annual shareholder meeting approaches, bank executives and directors are scrambling to meet with key investors and deal with the possibility that they could see one or more fail to win re-election, people familiar with the process said.

"A number of those directors will be vulnerable," an official at one large Wells Fargo investor said this past week.

It is rare for shareholders to vote a director off a big company's board. In the past five years, just nine directors have left boards of companies in the S&P 500 after they failed to receive majority support, according to ISS Analytics, the proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc .'s data arm.

The top Wells Fargo official at risk: Chairman Stephen Sanger , who took over last October when the former Wells Fargo chairman and chief executive officer, John Stumpf , resigned after a sales-practices scandal resulted in a $185 million settlement and two congressional grillings.

Mr. Sanger, the former chief of General Mills Inc., has handled the board's response to the sales problems, culminating in a 113-page report April 10 that largely blamed Mr. Stumpf and one of his key lieutenants, who has also left the bank.

Though Wells Fargo typically reaches out to investors around this time, shareholders have responded with many questions about the board's role, especially after the investigation results. For instance, some want to know why the board didn't act sooner to shake up the retail-banking unit despite concerns in 2014 and 2015 about improper employee practices that included signing customers up for fake accounts to meet sales goals.

"The fraud at Wells Fargo is ultimately an oversight failure. That's why accountability and real, meaningful change needs to start at the top," said New York City Comptroller Scott M. Stringer. "The only question is which directors, and that is what investors are now assessing." As of Dec. 30, the city's pension funds had about $594 million in Wells Fargo stock.

Earlier this month, the influential firm ISS recommended shareholders vote against Mr. Sanger and 11 of his colleagues on Wells Fargo 's 15-member board.

The second-largest proxy advisory firm, Glass Lewis & Co ., recommended investors vote for Mr. Sanger, but against six directors.

Seeing so many directors lose re-election from a major corporate board without any replacements in store would be unusual, raising potentially serious issues for Wells Fargo and its current CEO, Timothy Sloan .

Mr. Sloan, who was named chief executive after Mr. Stumpf abruptly retired, used to run the firm's corporate and wholesale business. He has so far avoided shouldering much of the blame for the sales problems because they occurred in the retail consumer business, which he didn't oversee.

Mr. Sloan said in an interview that he recently spoke with Warren Buffett , head of Wells Fargo 's largest shareholder, Berkshire Hathaway Inc ., who expressed his support for management and the board. "We value his input and engagement &at a very important time for the company," Mr. Sloan said.

Messrs. Sloan and Sanger and other Wells Fargo officials are to meet or talk with more than 20 of the largest Wells Fargo investors including in New York, Boston and San Francisco this week, people involved with the meetings said.

Management and board members plan to argue that the board has taken the fallout from the scandal seriously, clawing back $183 million in pay from current and former executives.

The board has also overhauled four of its committees risk, audit, human resources and corporate responsibility to further strengthen their oversight of the company. The heads of those committees, along with Mr. Sanger, "probably have more to worry about than the others," the official from one of Wells Fargo 's largest shareholders said.

Mr. Sanger has said recently, in response to a reporter's question whether he should resign, that the recent "investigation showed the board took the appropriate actions with the information it had."

Large shareholders often follow ISS's recommendation, but with Wells Fargo , there are no known alternatives for the board if some of them get voted out.

Wells Fargo 's corporate governance guidelines are fairly similar to most large companies that give the board latitude about what to do with "no" votes against directors. Wells Fargo 's rules require directors to win a majority of votes cast, but the board can also reject offers to resign, even from directors who fail to gain a majority vote.

The bank would risk shareholder consternation and a possibly a hit to its stock price if the board decided to keep a director who didn't receive the majority vote. Wells Fargo 's board has 90 days to publicly disclose its decision regarding a director's resignation, according to the bank's corporate governance guidelines.

So far, a number of Wells Fargo 's largest shareholders said they haven't decided how they will vote. If next week's investor meetings indicate that shareholders are leaning against certain directors, Wells Fargo could decide that those directors should retire soon in an effort to stem concern and preserve majorities for other key directors.

After J.P. Morgan Chase & Co . suffered a $6 billion trading loss known as the "London Whale" several years ago, the bank's board shook up membership of its risk committee amid a contentious shareholder vote.

Analysis: The Expensive Ingredient of Cheap ETFs

By Jason Zweig

The costs of trading are one of the worst destroyers of investment returns. That's a fact of life in the markets, although it's easy to overlook in exchange-traded funds, in which commissions and management fees have shrunk almost to zero.

And during placid markets like today's, when buying or selling tends to become cheaper, investors can form a bad habit of ignoring the costs of trading. That can come back to haunt you when turbulence resumes and trading becomes more expensive.

Often dirt-cheap to own, ETFs can still be costly to buy and sell. In a study just published in the Financial Analysts Journal, portfolio manager Antti Petajisto of LMR Partners, a London-based hedge fund, looked at about 1,800 ETFs from 2007 to 2014. He wanted to see how often, and how much, their market prices differed from the value of their underlying assets.

The average difference between price and value among all U.S.-traded ETFs was only 0.06% from 2007 to 2014. The harder the underlying securities are to trade, however, the bigger that gap gets.

Market prices exceeded net asset values by an average of 0.18% among precious-metal funds, 0.29% in short-term bond funds, 0.31% in corporate, high-yield and emerging-market bond funds, and up to 0.37% in foreign funds investing in small stocks. At individual funds, they can be much wider.

"I was surprised both by how large and how common these differences are," says Mr. Petajisto. Even if you trade only a few times a year, "your ETF portfolio could easily be costing you 1% or 2% and you might not even know it." He estimates that the hidden costs of trading ETFs exceed $18 billion annually, a trifle in the trillions of dollars of combined trading in these funds, but real money to those who leave it on the table.

These costs lurk in the normally tiny space between the market price of an ETF and the per-share value of the stocks, bonds and other assets it holds. The market price is the number most commonly quoted, including by most brokers; the value of the underlying assets is much less widely available. So the gap between the two numbers is hard for most investors to see.

A broker making a market in an ETF will buy up a fixed amount of the portfolio's underlying assets in proportions matching their weights within the fund. The ETF's manager then creates new shares in exchange for that equal amount of its holdings. Normally, the fund's new shares and the basket of its assets will be almost identical in price. But fees and transaction costs aren't zero, and it can take time to round up securities that rarely trade, so the prices seldom match to the penny. Think of all this as a single grain of sand in the gears that manufacture an ETF.

During turbulent markets or in thinly traded securities like municipal bonds or stocks in developing nations, that swap may come off at widely divergent prices. That's a cost of putting illiquid assets into a liquid fund.

When enthusiasm pushes an ETF's share price above the value of its holdings, that's called a premium; when the fund's shares trade for less than its underlying assets are worth, that's a discount.

Before trading, check the fund's "intraday indicative value," a real-time estimate of what its holdings are worth. You can do that on Yahoo Finance by entering the fund's ticker followed by "-IV" or view it on Morningstar.com's quote page for each ETF.

Right now, with markets extraordinarily calm, these costs are minimal. Only about two dozen out of nearly 2,000 ETFs in the U.S. have traded at average premiums or discounts of 1% or more in the past month, according to data from ETF.com. But that's unusual and probably unsustainable.

Big, popular funds such as iShares Core U.S. Aggregate Bond, SPDR S&P 500 and Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF normally trade within a few hundredths of a percentage point of their underlying value.

To trade, set a limit order a price above which you will not buy or below which you won't sell within a penny or two of indicative value.

If you invest through a financial adviser, make sure he or she uses limit orders and always checks indicative value before trading, urges Samuel Lee of SVRN Asset Management in Chicago.

Avoid volatile days, says Mr. Petajisto, when premiums and discounts can shoot from fractions of a percentage point to 5% or more.

Typically, several ETFs from different managers invest in similar or identical assets. Track them over time so you don't end up buying one at a big premium.

Finally, favor widely traded ETFs that invest in big, broad markets. The narrower the fund, the wider those hidden costs tend to be. If you must buy a specialized fund, monitor the gap between price and value to see if you can grab it at a discount.

China Securities Punished for Triggering Flash Crash of Two Stocks

China Securities Co . caused the flash crash of Industrial Bank Co. (601166.SH) and Ping An Insurance (Group) Co. (601318.SH) on Wednesday by dumping shares through its special accounts, the Shanghai Stock Exchange said Friday. China Fund Management Co., an asset-management unit under China Securities , has been suspended from trading for one month due to lax risk management, the SSE said. A selloff by China Fund Management around 2:48 p.m. local time Wednesday caused a plunge in the share prices of the two stocks. (yifan.xie@wsj.com)

China Securities Regulator Levies Fines for Illegal Securities Activity

China's securities regulator announced a slew of penalties and fines late Friday, as it steps up scrutiny of the domestic stock market. It announced fines totaling 1.5 million yuan ($218 million) on imports and exports trader Jilin Cheng Cheng Group Co. Ltd. for false and untimely information disclosure as well as other illegal activities, according to a statement on the regulator's website. The regulator banned Cheng Cheng's controlling person and chairman from the securities market for 10 and five years, respectively. In a separate case, the regulator announced a 24.98 million yuan fine on a trader who pumped up stocks of Ningbo Shuanglin Auto Parts Co. Ltd . and five other firms, via six trading accounts. It also confiscated 12.49 million yuan in illegal income from the man. (chao.deng@wsj.com)

China Banks Turn Lending Off-Balance Sheet

Lower-than-expected March loans came as total social financing, a broader measure of lending, almost doubled from February. Economists say it's normal to see a more-rapid growth of banks' off-balance-sheet activities as regulators rein in and have the lenders subject to the central bank's Macro Prudential Assessment. "The overall appetite for credit is still quite good; it's just that they are turning the lending activities off the balance sheet," said Yan Ling, an economist with China Merchants Securities. Under the MPA, banks will have to squeeze lending on the balance sheet, she adds. Meanwhile, medium- and long-term loans to nonfinancial corporations, a gauge of corporate-sector demand, is still high. Yan says that indicates there is still strong confidence. "There is no need to read too much into the drop of new yuan loan this month." (pei.li@wsj.com)

March's Credit Data Consistent With Tightening

Chinese banks scaled back lending in March, when they normally rush out to lend in recent years. That's a result of Beijing's efforts to curb lending, says Mizuho's Jianguang Shen. "Policy makers have made it clear that they need to reduce leverage ratios, but they also have realized that it is not an easy thing to do." He notes that a strong rebound in total social financing last month shows that some borrowers have shifted to non-bank sources for credit. "Deleveraging takes time." (liyan.qi@wsj.com)

The thinking behind a new Glass-Steagall Act is appealing, they write: "The basic idea is to narrow the scope of financial activities that taxpayers support through deposit insurance and emergency loans from the Federal Reserve ." But they say that that goal can better be accomplished by having financial institutions that accept deposits or issue other kinds of short-term debt pledge assets to the Federal Reserve "in return for guaranteed access to emergency loans if they're needed." This approach, advocated by former head of the Bank of England Mervyn King, "would stop bank runs before they start and there'd be no need for deposit insurance or the current panoply of liquidity and other rules."

Fed Officials Make Their Mark in Deregulatory Debate

Federal Reserve officials can see that the regulatory pendulum is swinging toward a reassessment of postcrisis rules, and they are assiduously trying to shape the debate in their carefully calibrated public statements.

Reading the Fed tea leaves holds significantly less importance for regulatory matters than for monetary policy (given that Congress ultimately must decide on most major changes to regulation, as opposed to the Federal Open Market Committee acting unilaterally). Still, the blessing of Fed officials could grease the wheels for bipartisan, piecemeal changes.

Perhaps the most important endorsement for regulatory changes "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-tarullo-opens-door-to-changes-in-stress-tests-volcker-rule-1491337896", who stepped down as a Fed governor earlier this month and used his farewell address to signal his support for altering the Volcker rule speculative-trading ban and the Fed's "stress tests" of bank health.

Mr. Tarullo's credibility is unshakable even with the loudest advocates for strong regulation, making his proposed changes a plausible starting point for bipartisan action. His calendars suggest that he may have been priming the pump even as he prepared to leave office on the day he announced his retirement, he called two lawmakers: Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio), populist liberals who zealously protect the postcrisis regulatory regime.

Though Mr. Tarullo could be expected to deliver a wish list as he left his post, other senior Fed officials have hastened to add their voices to the regulatory-overhaul debate as well.

The day after Mr. Tarullo retired, Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley gave a speech at the Princeton Club in New York "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-dudley-open-to-changes-in-financial-regulation-1491581706" to the ones his colleague had outlined. Stress testing, though "vital," could be modified to lessen banks' compliance burdens, he said, adding he would also welcome broader changes to lighten the load on smaller financial institutions.

The Volcker rule, Mr. Dudley argued, could also be worth revising. He said that "the line between market-making and proprietary trading is not always clear-cut, which makes regulation in this space difficult," adding that "it may be worth considering giving greater discretion to trading desks that facilitate client business to intervene when markets are illiquid and volatile."

Along with Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen , who has long said that she would support relief for community banks and other smaller financial institutions, senior Fed officials are telegraphing a clear message about postcrisis regulation: reassessing the rules isn't heresy, and making certain changes won't threaten financial stability while it could be beneficial for credit conditions and economic growth.

The Senate Banking Committee under new Chairman Mike Crapo (R., Idaho) has gotten off to bipartisan start, passing a series of "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-banking-panel-advances-series-of-deregulatory-bills-1489079983" last month with only two Democrats (including Ms. Warren) voicing opposition. With high-ranking Fed officials' imprimatur, the committee may be able to build on that success to pass other changes.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Randal Quarles Set to Be Named to Bank-Supervision Post at Fed

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/randal-quarles-set-to-be-named-to-bank-supervision-post-at-fed-1492399212" in the George W. Bush administration is expected to be President Donald Trump 's pick for a top financial regulatory post at the Federal Reserve , a senior official familiar with the matter said Sunday.

Randal Quarles , who now runs the Cynosure Group, a Salt Lake City-based investment firm he co-founded, is expected to be selected as the Fed's vice chairman for bank supervision. The position requires Senate confirmation.

Fired KPMG Audit Head: How Did Scott Marcello Fall From Grace?

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fired-kpmg-audit-head-how-did-scott-marcello-fall-from-grace-1492371198" the man to redeem KPMG LLP 's audit business. Instead, he and other top partners became the center of a scandal that tarnished the firm's reputation.

The accounting world was stunned last week when Mr. Marcello, KPMG 's top audit official, was fired over a leak of confidential information. The firm said Mr. Marcello, who turns 54 this month, and four other partners were let go over the mishandling of a tip that gave the firm improper advance word about which of its audits its regulator planned to scrutinize in its annual inspections. People who know Mr. Marcello said they were surprised such an experienced, knowledgeable auditor someone who volunteered as a mission hospital consultant in Africa, and has chaired a Christian school in Connecticut is accused of having gotten into such a fix.

SEC Targets Illicit Options Trades Made Ahead of Telecom Deal

"https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/04/14/sec-targets-illicit-options-trades-made-ahead-of-telecom-deal/"on Friday announced a court order to freeze assets in brokerage accounts that made suspicious, windfall-reaping options trades ahead of an acquisition announced last week.

At issue are short-dated, out-out-of-the-money calls bought days before Liberty Interactive announced its acquisition of General Communication , a telecom provider. The deal news on April 4 caused GCI's stock price to soar 62%, yielding a $1 million profit for the options buyers. Buyers of call options can earn lottery-ticket-like profits when the underlying stock shoots higher.

Informal Lending in China Ramped Up in March

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/informal-lending-in-china-ramped-up-in-march-1492173429" informal credit in March as Beijing's efforts to rein in financial risk drove them away from traditional bank lending.

The trend highlights the challenge for policy makers, worried about high debt levels but unable to allow growth to slow too much. Government spending ramped up last month, which economists say will keep the economy going for now.

Hacker Group Says U.S. Tried to Breach Money-Transfer System

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/hacker-group-says-u-s-tried-to-breach-money-transfer-system-1492213619" from the U.S. National Security Agency released documents and hacking tools that allegedly describe a U.S. effort to compromise users of the major international money-transfer system.

The documents, released Friday by a group that calls itself Shadow Brokers, includes PowerPoint slides and other documents that describe an alleged effort by the NSA to target two "service bureaus" connected to the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication , or Swift. The documents say the NSA broke into one of the bureaus, which are companies that facilitate funds transfers for smaller banks, as recently as in 2013. The documents' authenticity couldn't be independently verified by The Wall Street Journal. Several computer-security specialists said that data in them appeared to be legitimate but one of the two bureaus denied it had been hacked.

Fed Puts Together Plan to Unwind Securities Portfolio

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-puts-together-plan-to-unwind-securities-portfolio-1492340401" to fill in the details of how it will wind down its securities holdings in the years ahead, a process that could start this year and become the next big challenge for investors grown accustomed to easy money from the world's most important central bank.

The Fed wants to move toward a smaller portfolio for several reasons. The economy is on stronger footing, leaving less need for support from a large bond portfolio. The large holdings have become a political liability, unpopular in Congress. Moreover, getting started now could relieve pressure on possible new leadership in 2018, when Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen 's term ends. Finally, officials want room to ramp it back up in a crisis if needed.

Wells Fargo Board Faces High-Stakes Vote

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-board-faces-high-stakes-vote-1492254001" few other big banks have dealt with since the financial crisis: a serious effort to vote out most of its directors.

As the bank's annual shareholder meeting approaches April 25, bank executives and directors are scrambling to meet with key investors and deal with the possibility that they could see one or more fail to win reelection, people familiar with the process said. "A number of those directors will be vulnerable," an official at one large Wells Fargo investor said.

Analysis: The Expensive Ingredient of Cheap ETFs

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-expensive-ingredient-of-cheap-etfs-1492201605" are one of the worst destroyers of investment returns. That's a fact of life in the markets, although it's easy to overlook in exchange-traded funds, in which commissions and management fees have shrunk almost to zero.

And during placid markets like today's, when buying or selling tends to become cheaper, investors can form a bad habit of ignoring the costs of trading. That can come back to haunt you when turbulence resumes and trading becomes more expensive. Often dirt-cheap to own, ETFs can still be costly to buy and sell. In a study just published in the Financial Analysts Journal, portfolio manager Antti Petajisto of LMR Partners, a London-based hedge fund, looked at about 1,800 ETFs from 2007 to 2014.

Valley of the buyouts; FT BIG READ: US FINANCE

Private equity firms have been cautious about the technology sector because of uncertain revenues. But a new generation of funds thinks it can succeed with aggressive investments in software businesses. By Tom Braithwaite

For someone who prefers a low profile, Robert Smith has a knack for attracting attention.

Mr Smith, who rarely gives interviews, held his wedding in 2015 at an inaccessible Italian villa, in theory far from the gazing eye. But given that his bride Hope Dworaczyk was a former Playboy Playmate of the Year and the entertainment was provided by John Legend and Seal, photos of the ceremony made the tabloids anyway.

While many finance executives in Silicon Valley try to blend in by driving Tesla electric cars and wearing jeans to work, the employees at the San Francisco office of Mr Smith's Vista Equity Partners opt for sports cars and three-piece suits - a reflection of the tastes of their Texas-based boss.

And for the past couple of years, Vista has been making a splash through a series of eye-catching deals in the software industry - an area that private equity firms have long been wary of.

A former Goldman Sachs banker, Mr Smith set up Vista in 2000. Its record of buying, improving and selling software companies recently allowed it to raise $10.6bn for the biggest ever technology-focused private equity fund. The money is going out the door just as fast: in the past 12 months, Vista has bought four companies for more than $1bn each.

"We are very disciplined buyers," says Mr Smith, who complains that he, a rare black man at the helm of a large financial institution, is often unfairly targeted by the police when he is at the wheel of his McLaren car. "We manage money for teachers and firemen and municipal workers. We have never lost money on any buyout investment. The last thing they want us to do is be irresponsible with capital and we take our fiduciary responsibilities very seriously."

Glitzy consumer internet companies, such as Snap , Uber and Airbnb, have monopolised attention in the tech industry , stoking a debate over whether Silicon Valley is inflating a new bubble.

Along with groups such as San Francisco-based Thoma Bravo, Vista is at the forefront of a parallel trend of aggressive private equity investments that has the capacity to reshape the software industry. Many of the recent rapidly negotiated deals have been concluded with less due diligence than is typical, and have involved companies with higher growth but lower profits than those normally targeted by private equity firms.

The flurry of private equity investments raises important questions for the tech sector. On the one hand, it could indicate that this new brand of specialist firms has developed a secret sauce that allows it to generate reliable returns from software. Vista's funds have typically made returns of more than 20 per cent , according to investment data provider PitchBook. However, the investments could simply be contributing to a new bubble that will inevitably lead to a lot of bad debt and failed companies.

Anthony Armstrong, head of technology mergers at Morgan Stanley who has helped sell a number of companies to the young private equity groups, believes they are blazing a new trail.

"It's like the Golden State Warriors," he says, comparing them to the highly successful Bay Area basketball team, which has revolutionised the sport with its mixture of pace and aggressive shot-taking. "Smaller players, moving quickly, making three-pointers."

Vista is by no means alone. Indeed, it will soon relinquish its record as the biggest tech-focused fund. Silver Lake, the Silicon Valley-based private equity firm responsible for the largest ever tech deals such as the buyout of Dell in 2013 and Dell's $67bn acquisition of EMC in 2015, is raising a $15bn fund. And the Japanese telecoms group SoftBank, primed with money from Saudi Arabia and Apple, is raising the Vision tech fund whose $100bn target size would trump anything that has come before.

A bid backed by Silver Lake is the frontrunner in an $18bn-plus auction for Toshiba's flash memory business .

Thoma Bravo, which specialises in enterprise software, is also on a buying spree, paying $3bn for Qlik Technologies last year, a company that made just $13m in core earnings and recorded a net loss in the 12 months before the deal.

"There is a lot of capital in the category and more will come," says Orlando Bravo, 46, the managing partner, who took the reins at the then Chicago-based firm and reoriented it geographically and philosophically to the west coast. Working from the Transamerica Pyramid, San Francisco's tallest building, he last year raised a $7.6bn fund.

"When we were raising our fund, investors were asking, 'Are there enough targets for all the money?', and that's when [SoftBank's fund] was announced and my answer to that was, 'There is way enough'," Mr Bravo says. "We are, in hindsight, conservative because this is the first time that you have the large-scale tech software assets available to private equity."

Mixed fortunes

When the private equity industry was in its infancy in the 1980s, the tech sector was barely on its radar. Gradually, this changed. First hardware assets became tolerable for debt providers. Then came the realisation that software, although lacking hard assets to lend against, could offer reliable recurring revenues.

"The lenders originally were sceptical of the sector because the assets walk out the door every night and there was nothing that they felt they could lend against," says an asset manager who invests in Thoma Bravo's funds. "What has been proven is the stickiness of the sales in software. The renewal rates in the best businesses are well above 98 per cent."

Tech is now attracting all types of private equity firms, with the sector representing almost 40.1 per cent of US buyouts last year, according to Dealogic data. That is the highest proportion on record and up from around 10 per cent in 2010. Established generalists such as KKR and Carlyle have been joined by tech-focused firms such as Golden Gate Capital and the newer Siris Capital.

The old guard has had a mixed record in the sector. In 2006, Freescale Semiconductor was taken private by a consortium of Blackstone, Carlyle, Permira and Texas Pacific Group for $17.6bn , just before its orders plummeted. Stephen Schwarzman, Blackstone chief executive, described it as a deal "where literally everything goes wrong". More recently, Carlyle ended up cutting from $8bn to $7.4bn the price paid to Symantec for Veritas, a data storage provider, after banks struggled to finance the deal. Avaya, a networking company, bought for $8.3bn in 2007 by Silver Lake and TPG, filed for bankruptcy in January. In a sign of its changeable approach to the sector, Carlyle has opened, closed and reopened a Silicon Valley operation all within the past 10 years.

Perhaps their experience plays a part, but the larger firms are raising eyebrows at the prices and aggression of the younger pretenders such as Vista and Thoma Bravo. "They are prepared to pay an ebitda multiple that is almost ridiculous," says a partner at a rival firm, referring to the standard valuation that considers the price paid as a multiple of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.

But Mr Smith is critical of some of the other funds for failing to understand the software market. "The world is awash with capital and ambition which has led more PE tourists to invest in the highly specialised area of software," he says. "Many have already lost money in the space. I expect to see a few more lose money in their software investments in years to come."

Ensuring returns

Vista believes that it can make money, even at these high multiples, by exerting an unusual amount of control on its acquired companies. It expects them to follow 100 best practices it has developed. It also requires an unusual amount of sharing between its portfolio. At monthly meetings, the top 300 managers across the companies gather to swap experiences. Everything is done to eke out revenue and margin gain.

"They can produce more code faster with fewer bugs, expand their markets more effectively and frankly enhance the customer experience," says Mr Smith of companies that have submitted themselves to the programme.

Thoma Bravo does not impose as much control but Mr Bravo says there are always straightforward margin gains to be made because tech companies are reliably inefficient. "Silicon Valley thinks the same way they have since inception - singularly focused on top-line revenue growth," he says.

This does not mean that the private equity model of slashing costs would work. Margins need to be improved but if that is achieved by cutting too many salespeople or too far into research spending, then growth will lag.

Vista can also be ruthless in the selection of managers. In some cases, it will decide to replace a newly acquired company's executives. But Mr Smith will also go to extreme lengths to keep executives he values. Vista sold P2 Energy Solutions, which makes software for the oil industry, to its rival Advent International in 2013. Advent, understandably, assumed the management would be part of the deal. But after signing, Vista rehired the chief executive and chief financial officer and installed them at other companies.

Given the target companies often have little in the way of cash flows, the amount of debt used in the deals can seem worryingly large. Yet from another perspective, it can seem too small. Private equity firms like to use as little of their investors' money as possible, typically borrowing three-quarters of a deal's price. That allows them to capture more profit when they sell. But lenders will not write a blank cheque to buy companies with such meagre cash flows, forcing the funds to use more equity, which reduces risk but limits the potential returns.

Even Mr Bravo concedes the boom could still blow up - he just does not think his firm would suffer. "The thing I don't like about the whole asset class is I haven't seen other groups sell that much," says Mr Bravo. "Where is the money on the table, guys? I'd like to see how much is stuck." In the past few months, Thoma Bravo has sold three of its bigger bets, including Deltek, which it bought for $1bn in 2012 and sold on to Roper Technologies for $2.8bn.

Vista did get stuck on one recent deal, abandoning a planned initial public offering of Misys, the UK-based software company, after being unimpressed with what fund managers in London were prepared to pay. Mr Smith's reaction was, true to form, aggressive. He pulled the listing and doubled down, buying Canada's DH Corp , a financial technology group, for C$4.8bn ($3.6bn) last month, to combine it with Misys.

The market for selling such companies may evaporate altogether. The Nasdaq Composite surpassed its dotcom bubble peak in 2015 and valuations have kept rising. Another tech sector crash is not inconceivable. On the face of it, that might not seem to matter to the likes of Vista, which has never sold a company through an IPO. But with private equity firms commonly buying and selling the companies between each other, the music could stop at any time.

The McLarens of Silicon Valley would then really start to stand out.

Elliott

Activist investor lays path for tech deals

At 4:30am Lars Bjrk was disturbed by the ping of a text message. He was more disturbed when he saw the sender. Jesse Cohn of Elliott Management, the activist New York hedge fund, was writing to say he had bought shares in Mr Bjrk's company .

For Elliott, which once impounded an Argentine ship during a dispute with the Buenos Aires government, the pre-dawn text sent in March last year counts as a token of affection. "I don't take it personally," says Mr Bjrk, a Swede who runs Qlik Technologies, a maker of data analytics software.

Technology used to be regarded as too complex for activist investors, but Mr Cohn was a trailblazer. He began taking on Silicon Valley companies in 2006 aged just 26, earning a reputation for a thorough understanding of the industry and a bracingly foul mouth. "He's hard work but he's not trying to be an asshole," says one banker who advises the companies that Mr Cohn targets.

Less than three months after his rude awakening, Mr Bjrk and Qlik were in private equity hands. Thoma Bravo had agreed to pay $3bn. That was 73 per cent higher than Qlik's value during a sudden dip in February, though only in line with where it was trading at the start of the year. It was a rich price for such an acquisition. A normal buyout might be done at 10 times a target's core earnings. Qlik was done at 200 times.

Thoma Bravo has spent billions of dollars scooping up software companies. Three of the biggest - Qlik, Compuware at $2.4bn and Riverbed Technology for $3.6bn - were first smoked out by Elliott. Boards do not like to give in too easily to a potential bidder - and private equity firms tend to avoid hostile bids - but when an activist turns up, threatening to oust the board, deals can get done. Orlando Bravo (left), managing partner of Thoma Bravo, says that wooing companies will get easier: "Many are choosing to partner with private equity before the activists even show up."

If public company boards do start waving the white flag without activists having to fire a shot, that might be bad news for Elliott. But the firm has a hedge: it has set up its own Silicon Valley private equity firm. And whether he is phoning to rattle a cage or launch a takeover bid, Mr Cohn has everyone's number.

Data scientists and mathematicians: inside Goldman's new back offices; Banking: Offshore services

India is associated with call centres. Now banks and others are hiring sought-after experts, writes Andrew Hill

When Goldman Sachs opened its wholly owned Bangalore operation in 2004, it was a typical back office. Just under 300 full-time staff supported a front line of revenue-generating bankers worldwide. They worked in limited areas such as information technology, finance and accounting.

The group put no cap on Bangalore's ambitions, says Bunty Bohra, who heads the office, but "we didn't envisage anything like the scale and complexity" of the current operation - let alone what is now planned for the group.

Goldman now employs about 5,000 staff in Bangalore, 4,000 of them full-time, across almost every division of the bank, including revenue-generating "front office" roles.In 2019, it expects to open a $250m campus on Bangalore's traffic-clogged outer ring road that will be able to accommodate 9,000 people in two buildings, across 1m sq ft.

The evolution of Goldman's presence in Bangalore is one example of how economics, technology and politics have shaped the back office over the past 15 years. Companies have started to look at back offices not just as low-cost support centres, but sources of skills for the rest of the organisation. At the same time, they have learnt to flex the mixture and location of their own staff, and of outsourced teams, to meet customer needs.

In the mid-1990s, multinationals strove to cut the cost of support functions such as handling payroll, or dealing with customer queries. Moving them to cheaper countries such as India was the obvious solution. Since then, however, the response to the question of how, where and with whom to carry out back-office functions has become more complex, and more strategic.

Goldman is a case in point. Its Bangalore-based staff now represent 14 activities - from compliance and legal services to investment banking, though the most senior client-handling vice-presidents still operate out of Mumbai. "It really is a talent story, not 'Where are there people and office space that's inexpensive?'" says Mr Bohra. Last year, for instance, the bank hired 150 "quants" in Bangalore. These mathematicians and scientists work on the bank's quantitative investment strategies , but also analyse big data in areas such as risk management or human resources.

The bank's plans for its new campus would allow it to expand to become the biggest office outside New York. But at the same time, the bank does not have to take up the option to lease the second of two buildings. At the moment, it expects headcount to remain flat. Mr Bohra uses an analogy with a potentially uncontrollable family pet: "We don't want to have a 'golden retriever' problem. We want the intellect, maturity and seasoning to exist at the same time."

This is only one way in which companies are reviewing their back-office strategy. For instance, growth in the use of "captive" centres, serving the whole company, has accelerated. Ilan Oshri of Loughborough University found that between 1990 and 2009, the world's largest 250 companies established 367 captive centres worldwide. There are now an estimated 2,000 such hubs.

Outsourcing companies have also become more agile. Susir Kumar, chairman of Intelenet Global Services, says outsourcers have moved from carrying out processes to making more judgments for clients. Intelenet's agents have long had the responsibility for deciding, say, whether to grant a loan or approve an insurance claim. "The ability to manage change in a fast-changing environment is the key," he says. Often, contract workers are used in a blend with in-house back-office staff.

Even Goldman's Bangalore operation, which prides itself on propagating a "Goldman culture", now outsources certain functions - such as accounting - to multiple contractors.

Prof Oshri says the trend of companies moving their offshored back offices to the next cheapest location as labour costs increase has also changed.

One factor for large companies that have expanded overseas is political pressure to "bring jobs home". That could be a particular issue for US retail banks . They are potentially in President Donald Trump's line of fire, although they argue they need to support front offices round the clock, and therefore round the world.

Other sectors have, over the past five years, also started to trim earlier policies to offshore customer service operations. In the UK, Santander, the bank, United Utilities, the water company, and BT all "reshored" call-centre work from India in 2011. Vodafone UK recently announced it would create 2,100 jobs across the UK, essentially by relocating customer service roles currently carried out, via an external agency, in South Africa. Last year's Brexit vote could accelerate the trend, as outsourcers and insourcers adapt to a more nationalistic popular tone.

In the case of call centres, location is highly dependent on customers' perception of quality - bluntly, whether they can understand the call-centre staff. But there are other advantages to having support staff closer to headquarters, including control over recruitment, rewards and training. Strategic support functions, like risk management, may be better handled by a "middle office", based closer to the main revenue-generating activities.

The cost and skills combination needed for back offices still tilts the choices heavily towards emerging markets, though. Vodafone UK's IT shared services are still in Bangalore and Pune in India, where it uses a blend of captive operations and third parties, often dealing with enterprise customers.

Campbell Harvey of Duke University's Fuqua School of Business says cost is still companies' main motivation and technology will be a more important influence than politics on future back-office decisions. "People traditionally doing back-office functions in New York and London were disrupted by offshoring and that's a sideshow compared with what's coming," he says.

That said, while the rise of machine learning sounds like a threat to back-office jobs, when Prof Oshri asked 150 corporate buyers of outsourced services how much they had spent on cognitive computing, the answer averaged out at 350,000 per enterprise over the past five years - barely enough to cover a pilot project.

Leslie Willcocks of London School of Economics says he is "staggered how slow" big organisations are to introduce basic automation, let alone artificial intelligence .

Intelenet's Mr Kumar is equally sanguine, both about the US political pressure, to which he thinks the industry will adapt, and the rise of the robots. He believes the same number of employees will work with machines to do more sophisticated jobs for clients. But Prof Harvey has a warning for institutions that do not plan ahead. "It's a race to the bottom and the bottom is not a human, it's a machine."

Zetta Venture Partners Extends Second Fund to $125 Million; Firm was early backer of Domo Inc. and InsideSales.com

Zetta Venture Partners has extended its second fund to $125 million from $100 million, according to a regulatory filing on Monday.

Zetta is an early backer of companies including Domo Inc. and InsideSales.com Inc. and focuses on machine learning and artificial intelligence for enterprise software companies. The firm initially raised "https://www.wsj.com/articles/zetta-venture-partners-closes-100m-second-fund-1475612678"in October.

The second fund was oversubscribed due to strong interest in a fund that focuses exclusively on business-to-business enterprise machine intelligence, said Ash Fontana, a managing director at Zetta.

Some existing investors, as well as endowments and foundations participated in the extension of the fund.

Another reason behind the extension of the fund is the hiring of a new managing director - Jocelyn Goldfein - in January, Mr. Fontana said. Raising a completely new fund would have been excessive, Mr. Fontana said.

Zetta has invested into three companies so far out of the new fund. One is Marketing Evolution Inc., which provides real-time marketing insights, for which Zetta has signed a $4 million check. Another one is Falkonry Inc., a developer of automatic pattern recognition software for industrial monitoring.

Key Vote Tests Wells Fargo's Directors

Wells Fargo & Co. faces something few other big banks have dealt with since the financial crisis:a serious effort to vote out most of its directors.

As the bank's April 25 annual shareholder meeting approaches, bank executives and directors are scrambling to meet with key investors and deal with the possibility that they could see one or more fail to win re-election, people familiar with the process said.

"A number of those directors will be vulnerable," an official at one large Wells Fargo investor said this past week.

It is rare for shareholders to vote a director off a big company's board.

In the past five years, just nine directors have left boards of companies in the S&P 500 after they failed to receive majority support, according to ISS Analytics, the proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.'s data arm.

The top Wells Fargo official at risk: Chairman Stephen Sanger, who took over last October when the former Wells Fargo chairman and chief executive officer, John Stumpf, resigned after a sales-practices scandal resulted in a $185 million settlement and two congressional grillings.

Mr. Sanger, the former chief of General Mills Inc., has handled the board's response to the sales problems, culminating in a 113-page report April 10 that largely blamed Mr. Stumpf and one of his key lieutenants, who has also left the bank.

Though Wells Fargo typically reaches out to investors around this time, shareholders have responded with many questions about the board's role, especially after the investigation results. For instance, some want to know why the board didn't act sooner to shake up the retail-banking unit despite concerns in 2014 and 2015 about improper employee practices that included signing customers up for fake accounts to meet sales goals.

"The fraud at Wells Fargo is ultimately an oversight failure. That's why accountability -- and real, meaningful change -- needs to start at the top," said New York City Comptroller Scott M. Stringer. "The only question is which directors, and that is what investors are now assessing." As of Dec. 30, the city's pension funds had about $594 million in Wells Fargo stock.

Earlier this month, the influential firm ISS recommended shareholders vote against Mr. Sanger and 11 of his colleagues on Wells Fargo's 15-member board.

The second-largest proxy advisory firm, Glass Lewis & Co., recommended investors vote for Mr. Sanger, but against six directors.

Seeing so many directors lose re-election froma major corporate board without any replacements in store would be unusual, raising potentially serious issues for Wells Fargo and its current CEO, Timothy Sloan.

Mr. Sloan has so far avoided shouldering much of the blame for the sales problems because they occurred in the retail consumer business, which he didn't oversee.

Mr. Sloan said in an interview that he recently spoke with Warren Buffett, head of Wells Fargo's largest shareholder,

Berkshire Hathaway Inc., who expressed his support for management and the board. "We value his input and engagement. . .at a very important time for the company," Mr. Sloan said.

Messrs. Sloan and Sanger and other Wells Fargo officials are to meet or talk with more than 20 of the largest Wells Fargo investors this week, people involved with the meetings said.

Management and board members plan to argue that the board has taken the fallout from the scandal seriously, clawing back $183 million in pay from current and former executives.

The board has also overhauled four of its committees -- risk, audit, human resources and corporate responsibility -- to further strengthen their oversight of the company.

Oak HC/FT Closes $600 Million Second Fund; Firm seeks new health-care, fintech investments after short fundraising

Oak HC/FT has secured $600 million for a second fund devoted mostly to later-stage companies in health care and fintech, a jump from the $500 million raised for its debut fund in 2014.

The firm secured an exit in March when Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. acquired Core Informatics LLC, whose cloud-based platform supports scientific data management.

Oak HC/FT aims to deliver venture returns while keeping its loss ratio low. It focuses mostly on growth-stage businesses that can make the firm three to seven times its money. It also selectively funds earlier-stage companies, according to Managing Partner Annie Lamont.

The firm, which has offices in Greenwich, Conn., looks for opportunities in the U.S. and Europe. Other health-care holdings include Aspire Health Inc., a provider of outpatient-based palliative care, and Axial Healthcare Inc., whose cloud-based decision support platform is used for pain treatment.

Another is in LDI, a pharmacy benefit management company that helps manage drug spending for midsize employers. Oak, with its second fund, expects to consider other companies that help bring drug costs down for employers and consumers, according to General Partner Andrew Adams. The firm's leadership also includes General Partner Patricia Kemp.

The firm's fintech investments include Feedzai Inc., which uses machine learning to reduce financial fraud. Another fintech opportunity is technology used in the regulatory and compliance sectors. In these markets, technology can automate processes that are now labor-intensive, according to Ms. Lamont.

Oak HC/FT began raising Oak HC/FT Partners II LP in January and closed it in March, she said. Limited partners include funds of funds, endowments, family offices and insurance companies. Terms of the fund are undisclosed.

Oak HC/FT has a couple more investments to make from its first fund before beginning to deploy the second fund, Ms. Lamont said.

The board has also overhauled four of its committees risk, audit, human resources and corporate responsibility to further strengthen their oversight of the company. The heads of those committees, along with Mr. Sanger, "probably have more to worry about than the others," the official from one of Wells Fargo's largest shareholders said.

Mr. Sanger has said recently, in response to a reporter's question whether he should resign, that the recent "investigation showed the board took the appropriate actions with the information it had."

Large shareholders often follow ISS's recommendation, but with Wells Fargo, there are no known alternatives for the board if some of them get voted out.

Wells Fargo's corporate governance guidelines are fairly similar to most large companies that give the board latitude about what to do with "no" votes against directors. Wells Fargo's rules require directors to win a majority of votes cast, but the board can also reject offers to resign, even from directors who fail to gain a majority vote.

Wells Fargo's board has 90 days to publicly disclose its decision regarding a director's resignation, according to the bank's corporate governance guidelines.

So far, a number of Wells Fargo's largest shareholders said they haven't decided how they will vote. If next week's investor meetings indicate that shareholders are leaning against certain directors, Wells Fargo could decide that those directors should retire soon in an effort to stem concern and preserve majorities for other key directors.

Cloudera Inc. would be valued at up to $1.79 billion under proposed terms for its initial public offering, well below the price given by investors in its last private financing round.

The big-data software company said it planned to sell 15 million shares at a price between $12 and $14 a share.

At the low end of the proposed price range, Cloudera would be valued at $1.54 billion. The company received a "http://www.wsj.com/pro/venturecapital/graphics/billion-dollar-club/?co=Cloudera" in 2014 during a private financing.

Cloudera is one of several large venture-backed companies registered to go public, following a particularly slow period for new offerings.

The company's major investors include Intel Corp., which is set to hold a 19% stake worth up to $348 million after the IPO. The chip maker paid $740 million for its stake in Cloudera's 2014 financing round.

Accel Partners will hold a 14% stake post-IPO that would be valued at up to $257.7 million. Greylock Partners' 11% post-IPO stake would be worth up to $198.8 million.

Cloudera plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "CLDR." Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan and Allen & Co. are leading the offering.

Hardware Backer Lemnos Gives Founders a Hand and a Home; Six years after starting in garage, the firm still runs in a lab setting

Inside a warehouse in the Dogpatch neighborhood of San Francisco, a company using automation to fabricate carbon-fiber parts is prototyping next to a company creating robots that can inspect water pipes.

In stark contrast to the stylishly decorated offices of investors around Silicon Valley, venture-capital firm Lemnos has all the trappings of a genuine laboratory in testament to its origins in a garage. Its new offices are filled with sensors, building materials and power tools. The firm has staked out a competitive advantage for itself by offering office space and tools to preseed and seed-stage startups.

Lemnos invests in hardware and in some software that enables hardware. The scrappy firm first raised a $1.85 million fund six years ago, when founders Helen Zelman Boniske and Jeremy Conrad were in their 20s.

"That was a startup," Ms. Boniske said. "They picked us like they would pick a startup. It just happened to be a fund."

Lemnos

The Firm

Lemnos, previously known as Lemnos Labs, began as a hardware incubator with a $1.85 million fund in San Francisco's SoMa district.

The Strategy

Lemnos invests in hardware and in software that enables hardware. With investments ranging from consumer-grade machines that brew tea to satellites that track global trade, the firm invests at a very early stage, often before a company raises a formal seed round.

The Fund

Lemnos recently collected $50 million for its third fund, backed by institutional limited partners.

From its early days, Lemnos was able to spot companies like drone company Airware Inc. and transportation startup Local Motion Inc. that would go on to raise large rounds of funding. Lemnos initially opened in a garage in San Francisco's South of Market neighborhood, where the firm began to foster hardware startups ranging from satellite companies to a maker of tea-brewing machines.

Local Motion was later acquired by Zipcar Inc. in one of the firm's two exits. Sproutling Inc., which First Round Capital also backed, was acquired by Mattel Inc.

Ms. Boniske and Mr. Conrad say they are often the youngest VCs in the room, but that didn't stop them in March from announcing they closed their third fund at $50 million.

With the new fund, Lemnos has set out to position itself formally as a venture firm, not an incubator. It previously did business under the name Lemnos Labs, but Mr. Conrad said that no longer made sense, especially because the firm stopped running entrepreneur training like other programs. In Greek mythology, the island of Lemnos is where Hephaestus's forge made items like Zeus's thunderbolt and Helios's magical chariot.

"We found for hardware everything was just a little bit different and trying to put all of these companies on these cookie-cutter time frames never made any sense," Mr. Conrad said.

Like so many fixtures around Silicon Valley's startup community, Lemnos wouldn't exist without a fateful meeting in a college dorm. Ms. Boniske and Mr. Conrad got acquainted when they were assigned temporary dorm rooms next to each other at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. They then lived on the same floor for four years and also crossed paths with several others who would later end up prominent technology executives, such as Cruise Automation Inc. Chief Executive Kyle Vogt and Stripe Inc. founder Patrick Collison.

After school, Mr. Conrad and Ms. Boniske didn't take traditional paths to Silicon Valley. Mr. Conrad, who was in ROTC during school, served in the Air Force. Ms. Boniske went into baseball, joining the Arizona Diamondbacks to work as a scout.

She said it was difficult for her to prove her credibility as a person who hadn't played baseball professionally. It took watching hundreds of games to determine what patterns to look for.

"We basically do the same thing here," Ms. Boniske said. "These are founders, these are their skillsets, these are their behaviors and these are the things we think they're going to do really well."

Mr. Conrad and Ms. Boniske decided to focus on the earliest stage of investment, often backing companies before they have even raised a seed round. One of the early companies to join the Lemnos incubator program was Spire Global Inc., which uses satellites for big data applications ranging from weather to trade applications. The company uses satellite technology to track shipping vessels, and it recently rolled out plane-tracking software.

Spire Chief Executive Peter Platzer said Spire worked at Lemnos alongside one startup building a robot that made hamburgers, and another was making a coffee machine. All three founders collaborated and were using the same sensors.

"Having this community of people solving really hard problems with physical hardware was creatively inspiring," Mr. Platzer said. "We can now tell the archetypical San Francisco story that we started in a garage."

Key Vote For Wells Fargo's Board

Wells Fargo & Co. faces something few other big banks have dealt with since the financial crisis: a serious effort to vote out most of its directors.

As the bank's April 25 annual shareholder meeting approaches, bank executives and directors are scrambling to meet with key investors and deal with the possibility that one or more directors could fail to win reelection, people familiar with the process said.

"A number of those directors will be vulnerable," an official at one large Wells Fargo investor said this past week.

It is rare for shareholders to vote a director off a big company's board. In the past five years, just nine directors have left boards of companies in the S&P 500 after they failed to receive majority support, according to ISS Analytics, the data arm of the proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc.

The top Wells Fargo official at risk is Chairman Stephen Sanger, who took over last October when the former Wells Fargo chairman and chief executive officer, John Stumpf, resigned after a sales-practices scandal resulted in a $185 million settlement and two congressional grillings.

Mr. Sanger, the former chief of General Mills Inc., has handled the board's response to the sales problems, culminating in a 113-page report, made public on April 10, that largely blamed Mr. Stumpf and one of his key lieutenants, who also has left the bank.

Though Wells Fargo typically reaches out to investors around this time, shareholders have responded with many questions about the board's role, especially after the investigation results.

For instance, some want to know why the board didn't act sooner to shake up the retail-banking unit despite concerns in 2014 and 2015 about improper employee practices that included signing customers up for fake accounts to meet sales goals.

Earlier this month, the influential firm ISS recommended shareholders vote against Mr. Sanger and 11 of his colleagues on Wells Fargo's 15-member board.

The second-largest proxy advisory firm, Glass Lewis & Co., recommended investors vote for Mr. Sanger, but against six directors.

Seeing so many directors lose reelection from a major corporate board without any replacements in store would be unusual, raising potentially serious issues for Wells Fargo and its current CEO, Timothy Sloan.

Mr. Sloan, who was named chief executive after Mr. Stumpf abruptly retired, used to run the firm's corporate and wholesale business. He has so far avoided shouldering much of the blame for the sales problems because they occurred in the retail consumer business, which he didn't oversee.

Mr. Sloan said in an interview thathe recently spoke with Warren Buffett, head of Wells Fargo's largest shareholder, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., who expressed his support for management and the board.

"We value his input and engagement. . .at a very important time for the company," Mr. Sloan said.

Messrs. Sloan and Sanger and other Wells Fargo officials are to meet or talk with more than 20 of the largest Wells Fargo investors -- including in New York, Boston and San Francisco -- people involved with the meetings said.

Management and board members plan to argue that the board has taken the fallout from the scandal seriously, clawing back $183 million in pay from current and former executives. The board has also overhauled four of its committees -- risk, audit, human resources and corporate responsibility -- to further strengthen their oversight of the company. The heads of those committees, along with Mr. Sanger, "probably have more to worry about than the others," the official from one of Wells Fargo's largest shareholders said.

Mr. Sanger has said recently in response to a reporter's question whether he should resign that the recent "investigation showed the board took the appropriate actions with the information it had."

Large shareholders often follow ISS's recommendation, but with Wells Fargo, there are no known alternatives for the board if some of them get voted out.

Wells Fargo's corporate governance guidelines are fairly similar to those of most large companies that give the board latitude about what to do with "no" votes against directors. Wells Fargo's rules require directors to win a majority of votes cast, but the board can also reject offers to resign, even from directors who fail to gain a majority vote.

The bank would risk shareholder consternation and a possibly a hit to its stock price if the board decides to keep a director who doesn't receive the majority vote. Wells Fargo's board has 90 days to publicly disclose its decision regarding a director's resignation, according to the bank's corporate governance guidelines.

So far, a number of Wells Fargo's largest shareholders said they haven't decided how they will vote. If the planned investor meetings indicate that shareholders are leaning against certain directors, Wells Fargo could decide that those directors should retire soon in an effort to stem concern and preserve majorities for other key directors.

After J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. suffered a $6 billion trading loss known as the "London Whale" several years ago, the bank's board shook up membership of its risk committee amid a contentious shareholder vote.

FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - MONEY
FCA updates robo guidelines to make advice available to more

New rules aimed at "robo advisers" have been set out by the Treasury and the City watchdog as part of their efforts to make financial advice more widely available.

The guidelines are intended to free online providers from the heavier regulation associated with traditional financial advice, making it easier for them to offer low-cost help for less wealthy investors.

Last year, the authorities carried out a review of the financial advice market following concerns over the high cost and accessibility of advice.

The regulator said it wanted to encourage the growth of " robo-advisers " - websites that suggest investment portfolios to investors based on online questionnaires - as a way to offer investment help to a greater number of people.

As part of its proposals, the FCA suggested developing clearer rules to allow companies to give "streamlined advice", a form of financial advice for consumers with simple needs.

In its new guidance released today, the watchdog made clear it expected any funds offered to investors by robo-advisers offering streamlined advice to be suitable for customers' risk tolerance and investment objectives.

It also set out examples of information it expected companies to collect about investors, and warned on the importance of forming "clearly worded" risk questionnaires that did not assume "a high level of financial capability".

In a nod to the digital age, the FCA suggested robo-advisers could pay attention to the design of their websites, suggesting companies use consumer testing and web analytics to monitor how long customers spent on each page.

Traditional regulations typically require independent financial advisers (IFAs) to spend several hours in face-to-face meetings with clients so they can understand the customer's financial circumstances in detail.

IFAs typically charge 150 an hour, according to unbiased.co.uk, which many consumers regarded as too expensive for their needs. If a client had less than 100,000 to invest, many IFAs do not want to compete for their business.

The proposed shake-up of the financial advice industry comes after the introduction of new rules changing the way advisers are paid.

The regulations - introduced in 2012 - banned asset managers from paying commission to anyone selling their funds. As a result, many advisers stopped offering advice to people with smaller amounts of cash to invest, focusing on wealthier clients who could pay a higher sum for services.

According to the FCA, two-thirds of retail financial products are currently purchased without advice, while many people with less than 100,000 to invest are going it alone when choosing pensions, investments and retirement income products.

While several start-up companies have launched "robo-advice" sites over the past five years, high street banks have recently joined those offering digital advice.

Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds and Santander UK are developing special online sites to offer investment advice for all their customers.

The new back office: inside Goldman Sachs  Bangalore hub

When Goldman Sachs opened its wholly owned Bangalore operation in 2004, it was a typical back office. Just under 300 full-time staff supported a front line of revenue-generating bankers worldwide. They worked in limited areas such as information technology, finance and accounting.

The group put no cap on Bangalore s ambitions, says Bunty Bohra, who heads the office, but  we didn t envisage anything like the scale and complexity  of the current operation   let alone what is now planned for the group.

Goldman now employs about 5,000 staff in Bangalore, 4,000 of them full-time, across almost every division of the bank, including revenue-generating  front office  roles. In 2019, it expects to open a $250m campus on Bangalore s traffic-clogged outer ring road that will be able to accommodate 9,000 people in two buildings, across 1m sq ft.

The evolution of Goldman s presence in Bangalore is one example of how economics, technology and politics have shaped the back office over the past 15 years. Companies have started to look at back offices not just as low-cost support centres, but sources of skills for the rest of the organisation. At the same time, they have learnt to flex the mixture and location of their own staff, and of outsourced teams, to meet customer needs.

In the mid-1990s, multinationals strove to cut the cost of support functions such as handling payroll, or dealing with customer queries. Moving them to cheaper countries such as India was the obvious solution. Since then, however, the response to the question of how, where and with whom to carry out back-office functions has become more complex, and more strategic.

Goldman is a case in point. Its Bangalore-based staff now represent 14 activities   from compliance and legal services to investment banking, though the most senior client-handling vice-presidents still operate out of Mumbai.  It really is a talent story, not  Where are there people and office space that s inexpensive?   says Mr Bohra. Last year, for instance, the bank hired 150  quants  in Bangalore. These mathematicians and scientists work on the bank s quantitative investment strategies, but also analyse big data in areas such as risk management or human resources.

The bank s plans for its new campus would allow it to expand to become the biggest office outside New York. But at the same time, the bank does not have to take up the option to lease the second of two buildings. At the moment, it expects headcount to remain flat. Mr Bohra uses an analogy with a potentially uncontrollable family pet:  We don t want to have a  golden retriever  problem. We want the intellect, maturity and seasoning to exist at the same time. 

This is only one way in which companies are reviewing their back-office strategy. For instance, growth in the use of  captive  centres, serving the whole company, has accelerated. Ilan Oshri of Loughborough University found that between 1990 and 2009, the world s largest 250 companies established "https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5Bdu9b4_W9EC&pg=PA74&lpg=PA74&dq=siemens+captive+centre&source=bl&ots=4sYd4Thj68&sig=toQ9Q2sOkrht37yYbEt1KYe6r24&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiT1LKr8orTAhUkIsAKHWC6Bt0Q6AEIODAG#v=onepage&q=siemens%20captive%20centre&f=false" worldwide. There are now an estimated 2,000 such hubs.

Outsourcing companies have also become more agile. Susir Kumar, chairman of Intelenet Global Services, says outsourcers have moved from carrying out processes to making more judgments for clients. Intelenet s agents have long had the responsibility for deciding, say, whether to grant a loan or approve an insurance claim.  The ability to manage change in a fast-changing environment is the key,  he says. Often, contract workers are used in a blend with in-house back-office staff.

Even Goldman s Bangalore operation, which prides itself on propagating a  Goldman culture , now outsources certain functions   such as accounting   to multiple contractors.

Prof Oshri says the trend of companies moving their offshored back offices to the next cheapest location as labour costs increase has also changed.

One factor for large companies that have expanded overseas is political pressure to  bring jobs home . That could be a particular issue for US retail banks. They are potentially in president Donald Trump s line of fire, although they argue they need to support front offices round the clock, and therefore round the world.

Other sectors have, over the past five years, also started to trim earlier policies to offshore customer service operations. In the UK, Santander, the bank, United Utilities, the water company, and BT all "https://www.ft.com/content/f08f6bf6-a996-11e0-a04a-00144feabdc0" from India in 2011. Vodafone UK recently announced it would create 2,100 jobs across the UK, essentially by relocating customer service roles currently carried out, via an external agency, in South Africa. Last year s Brexit vote could accelerate the trend, as outsourcers and insourcers adapt to a more nationalistic popular tone.

In the case of call centres, location is highly dependent on customers  perception of quality   bluntly, whether they can understand the call-centre staff. But there are other advantages to having support staff closer to headquarters, including control over recruitment, rewards and training. Strategic support functions, like risk management, may be better handled by a  middle office , based closer to the main revenue-generating activities.

The cost and skills combination needed for back offices still tilts the choices heavily towards emerging markets, though. Vodafone UK s IT shared services are still in Bangalore and Pune in India, where it uses a blend of captive operations and third parties, often dealing with enterprise customers.

Campbell Harvey of Duke University s Fuqua School of Business says cost is still companies  main motivation and technology will be a more important influence than politics on future back-office decisions.  People traditionally doing back-office functions in New York and London were disrupted by offshoring and that s a sideshow compared with what s coming,  he says.

That said, while the rise of machine learning sounds like a threat to back-office jobs, when Prof Oshri asked 150 corporate buyers of outsourced services how much they had spent on cognitive computing, the answer averaged out at 350,000 per enterprise over the past five years   barely enough to cover a pilot project.

Leslie Willcocks of London School of Economics says he is  staggered how slow  big organisations are to introduce basic automation, let alone "https://www.ft.com/artificial-intelligence-robotics".

Intelenet s Mr Kumar is equally sanguine, both about the US political pressure, to which he thinks the industry will adapt, and the rise of the robots. He believes the same number of employees will work with machines to do more sophisticated jobs for clients. But Prof Harvey has a warning for institutions that do not plan ahead.  It s a race to the bottom and the bottom is not a human, it s a machine.

Sansoro Health wants to be the technological catalyst that enables a digital-health revolution.

Doctors and hospitals now routinely use electronic-medical records and are also looking to adopt digital-health applications for things like data analytics and population health. But it can take months to connect these software tools into their electronic-medical record systems, which were originally designed as billing and documentation platforms.

Consequently, hospital chief information officers often have a two- to three-year backlog of systems to integrate, according to Yumin Choi, managing director of Bain Capital Ventures.

That's why Bain is leading a $5.2 million Series A investment in Sansoro, whose software is designed to make it easy to exchange data between electronic-medical records and digital-health applications. As a result, months-long implementation processes can be whittled down to days, according to Mr. Choi.

Minneapolis-based Sansoro last year raised $1.2 million in seed financing led by Healthy Ventures, with additional funds from Treehouse Health and angels.

Sansoro has nearly 20 customers, including hospitals, health systems and companies, said co-founder and Chief Executive Jeremy Edes Pierotti. He declined to discuss revenue but said he expects significant growth this year now that Sansoro has additional funds to ramp up its sales and marketing.

With 125 Ph.D.s in 15 Countries, a Quant  Alpha Factory' Hunts for Investing Edge; Igor Tulchinsky's WorldQuant is part of the forefront of a new quantitative renaissance in investing

Corrections & Amplifications

Gen. Stanley McChrystal is a retired general. An earlier version of this article incorrectly called him a former general in a Business & Finance article April 7 about WorldQuant LLC. (April 13, 2017)

As a 20-something computer engineer looking for a job in the 1990s, Igor Tulchinsky hit on an idea: Mail thousands of flattering letters to CEOs of companies believing one of them would land on the right desk. The tactic paid off when he scored a job as a trading strategist that set him on track to a successful career on Wall Street.

At WorldQuant LLC, a quantitative investment firm Mr. Tulchinsky founded in 2007, the same formula is at the core of the firm's DNA. In searching for patterns in torrents of data coming out of an increasingly connected world, WorldQuant aims to get the maximum number of minds working on problems at any moment. The firm is part of the forefront of a new quantitative renaissance in investing, where the ability to make sense of billions of bits of data in real time is more sought after than old-school financial analysis.

"Brilliance is very equally distributed across the world, but opportunity is not," said Mr. Tulchinsky, a 50-year-old Belarusian. "We provide the opportunity."

To do this, WorldQuant developed a model where it employs hundreds of scientists, including 125 Ph.D.s, around the world and hundreds more part-time workers to scour the noise of the economy and markets for hidden patterns. This is the heart of the firm. Mr. Tulchinsky calls it the "Alpha Factory."

That's why his Old Greenwich, Conn., firm built a web of international offices unlike any other investment firm. Apart from five offices in the U.S., WorldQuant has 15 foreign outposts in places such as Moscow, Sofia, Bangkok, Beijing, Mumbai, Hanoi, Seoul, and Ramat Gan in Israel where researchers develop code to trade the markets.

It manages more than $5 billion and has over 500 employees. By comparison, its competitor Two Sigma Investments LLC manages more than $45 billion and has more than 1100 employees.

Quantitative hedge funds have been around for decades but they are becoming dominant players in the markets for their ability to parse massive data sets and trade rapidly. Amid huge outflows, traditional hedge funds are bringing aboard chief data scientists and trying to mimic quant techniques to keep up, fund executives say.

Some critics of quants believe their strategies are overhyped and are highly susceptible to finding false patterns in the noise of data. David Leinweber, a data scientist, famously found that the data set with the highest correlation with the S&P 500 over a 10-year period in the 1990s was butter production in Bangladesh.

WorldQuant has stayed below the radar, because it has always exclusively managed money for one client, Israel Englander's $34.6 billion hedge fund Millennium Management LLC. It has never published performance numbers, but people briefed on the matter say the firm has never had a down year.

The firm began as a handful of traders within Millennium that Mr. Tulchinsky spun out in 2007. It is exploring handling money from other investors but hasn't finalized any products, he said.

Global outposts are just one part of the operation.

WorldQuant also draws in amateur quantitative traders through a platform called WebSim, which gives people access to data and a system to test out ideas. From there, it found more than 450 paid consultants to WorldQuant whose algorithms are added into the company's central database and often used in trading. That approach lets engineers, computer scientists and mathematicians working in any field work on quantitative investing on the side.

The "Alpha Factory" breaks up the process of investing into a quantitative trading assembly line. The inputs are data acquired by a special group that scours the globe for interesting and new data sets, including everything from detailed market pricing data to shipping statistics to footfall in stores captured by apps on smartphones.

Researchers around the world attack the data with computing power and mathematical techniques to find patterns. They write algorithms that purport to predict similar patterns in the future, test them extensively and then add them into a central repository.

Mr. Tulchinsky said the company has four million "alphas" to date and is aiming for 100 million. Each alpha at WorldQuant is an algorithm that seeks to profit by predicting some future change in the price of a stock, futures contract or other asset.

Other groups combine alphas into strategies and strategies into bigger portfolios. The "Uber" team then works on perhaps the most crucial system of allocating funds between them and balancing the whole company's trading to weigh risk and avoid strategies cannibalizing each other. WorldQuant largely focuses on stocks.

"It comes down to turning data into ideas into investments," Mr. Tulchinsky said. "When we started out with very few alphas, we were concerned with secrecy, but now that we have millions, no one alpha is important. Our edge is putting things together, it's the implementation."

The idea is that with so many "alphas," even weak signals can be useful. If counting cars in parking lots next to big box retailers has only a tiny predictive power for those retailers' stock prices, it can still be used to enhance a bigger prediction if combined with other weak signals.

For example, an uptick in cars at Wal-Mart parking lots itself a relatively weak signal could combine with similar trends captured by mobile phone apps and credit-card receipts harvested by companies that scan emails to create a more reliable prediction.

To help keep such a global operation in sync, WorldQuant brought in the consulting company of retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal for ideas. Now, every two weeks the entire firm logs in to a companywide videoconference called the "Keystone Forum" where research is discussed among the entire research staff.

"We're like a combination between a university, the military and a trading organization," Mr. Tulchinsky said.

"There is race to find some meaning from all this noise and gain an advantage," said Chalee Asavathiratham, deputy chief research manager of WorldQuant and general manager of the Bangkok office, of the opportunities provided by oceans of new data coming out of global business and economics.

Perhaps surprisingly, Mr. Tulchinsky does not see a future of trading where computers completely unseat humans because of innovations in artificial intelligence. "AI will always be a tool," he said. "What it does is abstracts the job of a human, so instead of trying every combination by hand you can search a million possibilities more efficiently."

In hiring, WorldQuant is looking for the usual signs of past accomplishment and intelligence, but also "somebody who can take a problem and think all the time," Mr. Tulchinsky said, a lesson he said he learned from the CEO who opened one of the several thousand letters he wrote back in the 1990s, Thomas Peterffy.

Mr. Peterffy is the Hungarian-born billionaire who pioneered electronic trading of securities in the early 1980s and founded the discount brokerage Interactive Brokers Group Inc. The men remain friends.

One year at the firm, Mr. Tulchinsky asked colleagues what the dress code was for the annual holiday party, Mr. Peterffy recalled. Mr. Tulchinsky took the answer, "casual," literally and showed up in a black sweatshirt while others were wearing suits and blazers.

"Igor is a convincing example that people who are extremely talented in certain areas of life can be uniquely strange in others," Mr. Peterffy said.

Economy
Bank of Korea Keeps Base Rate Unchanged at 1.25%; The central bank now expects South Korea's gross domestic product to expand 2.6% in 2017

SEOUL The Bank of Korea nudged up its growth and inflation forecasts for this year amid signs of an improvement in the economy but left interest rates unchanged for a ninth straight meeting Thursday.

The decision to hold the main policy rate at a record-low 1.25% highlights the central bank's intention to keep policy accommodative to support the economy, despite a recent uptick in exports and inflation, and policy tightening in the U.S. The bank last cut the rate in June last year.

"The need to lower the base rate has diminished," Bank of Korea Governor Lee Ju-yeol said shortly after BOK policy makers unanimously decided to hold interest rates steady.

The central bank now expects South Korea's gross domestic product to expand 2.6% in 2017, slightly faster than its January estimate of 2.5% growth, Mr. Lee said. The bank projects 2.9% growth in 2018.

The bank also expects consumer prices will rise 1.9% this year, compared with its previous estimate for a 1.8% gain, Mr. Lee said. The bank says inflation will likely average 1.9% next year.

All 19 economists polled by The Wall Street Journal ahead of the rate decision had forecast the bank would stand pat.

The U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to raise rates in March and stay on course for further rate increases has weakened the case for further rate cuts in South Korea. Higher U.S. rates could trigger capital outflows from emerging economies such as South Korea's.

The urgency for the bank to offer additional monetary support has also decreased due to upbeat economic data. Consumer inflation hit a near five-year high in March. Exports grew for a fifth straight month in March and will likely continue to grow in April.

The bank is also wary of high levels of household debt, for which cheaper loans have been blamed.

As the scope for further monetary easing narrows, analysts are wondering if the economy still needs an additional fiscal stimulus from a new administration after the May 9 presidential election. The economy still faces headwinds from corporate restructuring and a cooling housing market.

Economists see an increasing risk of the Bank of Korea raising interest rates going forward.

"The [Bank of Korea] statement was mildly optimistic, indicating that monetary tightening is on the cards if conditions continue to improve as expected," said Emily Dabbs, an economist of Moody's Analytics Australia.

Ms. Dabbs expects the Bank of Korea to stand pat through to the final quarter of this year, where it may start raising interest rates as inflation creeps higher.

'Paradox of skill' tightens screw for active investors; Trading room

The evolution of financial markets is quickening thanks to the rise of automated trading algorithms, which range from the relatively simple, such as exchange traded funds, to artificial-intelligence powered hedge funds .

It is a shift that is most apparent in the world of investing.

Traditional active managers have recorded big outflows while cheaper passive investment vehicles such as ETFs and index-tracking funds have benefited.

Vanguard alone, with $4tn of assets under management, dwarfs the entire hedge fund industry. And as the chart from Citi shows below, passive investment inflows are accelerating.

Passive funds make up a sizeable chunk of overall assets under management in Asian and US equities, and a smaller - but rising - proportion in areas such as US bonds.

In addition to the usual arguments for passive funds, such as their cheapness, strategists say it is growing harder for fund managers to beat their benchmarks.

Robert Buckland, Citigroup strategist, calls this development the "paradox of skill".

The number of chartered financial analysts relative to that of listed companies has exploded in the past two decades, Mr Buckland says.

"That's a lot of well-trained buyside and sellside analysts for every stock. No wonder it has got so tough to beat the market."

In the world of quantitative investing, the picture is now a little brighter.

The prevailing view can be summarised by saying that the future of active investing will not be human fund managers judging a company by the firmness of the chief executive's handshake but computer scientists tinkering with trading algorithms.

This is clearly bad news for active managers.

The trend has led to an explosion of jobs for financial engineers while demand for traditional analysts has stagnated.

The number of investment factors that are used by investment groups has risen sincethe financial crisis, as financial scientists unearth more and more tradable signals from big data, such as credit card transactions, app downloads and even satellite imagery.

High-octane algorithmic trading is also in the ascendant, with high-frequency trading volumes picking up from the post-crisis fall.

Meanwhile, the volume of trading by traditional active asset managers has flatlined as the share of trading by passive investment vehicles has grown.

The shift is also affecting the structure of the stock market with the most actively traded shares growing even more liquid, while those of smaller companies become correspondingly more expensive to trade.

Also, with algorithms making, cancelling and adjusting quotes at a staggering pace compared with the past, so-called flash crashes have become more common.

The rise of ETFs is also reshaping the traditional trading day.

Passive investment funds typically do most of their trading at the end of the session so that their holdings match their benchmarks.

A resulting herding effect towards the final half-hour of the day produces a pattern that analysts call a "liquidity smile".

Despite the roaring inflows into ETFs and quant funds so far, this is still the early stages of the revolution - with the vast majority of money still managed traditionally by human fund managers.

There will undoubtedly be potholes along the way but markets are increasingly going to be shaped by machines rather than man. Robin Wigglesworth

U.S. Commercial Property Loans Fall

Commercial real-estate lending by banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions is declining as sales activity slows and regulators voice concern about the sector.

Lenders closed roughly $491 billion of mortgage loans backed by U.S. property in 2016, down 3% from 2015, according to new statistics from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Most of the decline occurred in the fourth quarter, when volume was 7% lower than the 2015 quarter, according to Jamie Woodwell, the trade group's head of commercial-property research.

Despite the decrease, the new-volume number was the third highest since the association began doing the survey, behind 2015 and the record year of 2007.

The decline from 2015 to 2016 was due partly to a slowing of property sales, meaning fewer buyers needed financing. "There's a very tight correlation" between the two, Mr. Woodwell said.

Buyers, for their part, are getting jittery because values have been rising for eight years and are near records. In all, investors purchased $493.7 billion of U.S. commercial property in 2016, down 10% from 2015, according to Real Capital Analytics.

Activity has slowed further this year. Investors purchased just $50.3 billion worth of U.S. commercial property in the first two months of 2017, compared with $80.1 billion during the period in 2016, according to Real Capital Analytics.

Regulators have been expressing concern about overheated commercial real-estate lending. At the end of 2016's third quarter there were 521 institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. with potentially worrisome concentrations of risk, according to an FDIC report this year. That is up from 474 institutions in the 2015 third quarter, the report said.

Yet banks and insurers are getting more aggressive over deals as investment in the sector declines. New lenders also are emerging on the scene, including investment funds formed by private-equity firms that are focused on real-estate debt.

"It's tougher right now," said Craig Bender, who heads up ING Groep NV's U.S. real-estate lending business. "The banks are hungry. The life-insurance companies are hungry."

Many bank executives view the commercial-property market as healthy, given rising rents and occupancies. Wells Fargo & Co., the country's largest commercial-property market lender, expects to lend about $30 billion this year, about the same as in 2016 and 2015, according to Mark Myers, the bank's head of commercial real estate. Those amounts are "high-water marks" for the bank, he said.

Still, the bank recognizes that property values are at record levels after rising for eight years. "I'd say, if I could look back one year ago, we're probably more cautious" now, Mr. Myers said.

Teamable Turns Employees' Social Networks Into Recruitment Tool; Software helps tap into referrals with better outcomes

Some advocates for diversity in the technology industry say hiring referrals have contributed to the homogenous staff seen at many companies.

But Teamable Inc. thinks that its "social referral" software could help companies become more diverse. Since Lyft Inc. began using the service, it has doubled the number of women on its engineering staff, according to Teamable.

Teamable has raised $5 million led by True Ventures. The company aims to help its clients to identify potential job candidates by tapping into their employees' social networks and email contacts.

Teamable Chief Executive Laura Bilazarian said employees have incentives to share their social networks and contacts with Teamable because they want to make sure key roles are being filled in a timely manner and they may receive a referral bonus.

"I saw where the world was going in terms of social networking, big data, AI," she said. "I wanted to fix some of those inefficiencies in recruiting."

Employees are invited to log into Teamable through a recruiter or team lead at their company. Teamable then draws data from Outlook, Gmail, Facebook, Github, LinkedIn and other social networks. Employees control which social networks they connect to Teamable.

Teamable's algorithms can suggest candidates for an open job from employee networks. Company recruiters then ask the employees to review the matches and choose which ones they want to reach out to. Employees can email their contacts directly and introduce them to company recruiters.

Ms. Bilazarian said she is aware of the criticism of employee referrals, but she believes using social networks allows people to refer people that may not immediately come to mind in an informal setting.

She said the average person is connected to about 1,000 people across their networks.

The company has algorithms that are able to detect publicly available information about potential candidates that could help companies hire candidates that would make their workforce more diverse.

Teamable is already working with companies including Stripe Inc., Oracle Corp., and Quantcast Corp.

True Ventures partner Tony Conrad said referrals are currently used across the corporate world, and he doesn't think the company's business will be limited to the tech industry.

"The idea is so simple and really powerful," he said.

U.S. Investor Wagers on Greek Malls --- Varde Partners last week paid $65 million for stakes in a pair of Greek shopping malls

As risky bets go, Greece ranks right up there. When you add shopping malls to the mix, only the hardiest investors need apply.

That is the wager that U.S. private-equity firm Varde Partners LP made last week when it paid 61.3 million euros ($65 million) for a stake in two of Greece's biggest shopping malls.

The deal stands out because there have been few commercial real-estate transactions over the last eight years in Greece, once the epicenter of Europe's financial crisis. Of the 255 billion euros ($270 billion) of commercial property traded in Europe last year, only $650 million of deals took place in Greece, mainly in the hotel sector, according to real-estate research firm Real Capital Analytics.

"There are some big question marks hanging over Greece," said Walter Boettcher, director of research at Colliers International, a real-estate broker.

At the same time, the rise of online shopping and changing consumer preferences around the world have led to massive retail bankruptcies and store closures in the U.S., the U.K. and around the world.

Yet Minneapolis-based Varde, a value investor on the hunt for discounted assets, sees opportunity.

"The risk is about the politics," said Tim Mooney, global co-head of real estate at Varde. "The gutsy part of the trade is not at the asset level."

The Greek economy has only started to recover after shrinking by more than 25% during the financial crisis.

The government is finalizing details of a deal struck on Friday with creditors to keep its economic bailout program going.

A final agreement will pave the way for discussions between European creditors -- led by Germany -- and the International Monetary Fund on debt relief.

Prolonged bailout negotiations revived uncertainty in Greece. The country's economy shrank faster than expected in the last quarter of the year, and while the Greek government expects growth to clock in at 2.7% this year, several economists believe it will be more modest.

Varde paid the 61.3 million euros for a 31.7% stake in Lamda Malls SA, a unit recently spun out of Lamda Development SA, one of Greece's biggest real-estate companies.

Lamda has two assets: Golden Hall in Athens and Mediterranean Cosmos in Thessaloniki, a major city in the north of the country.

Even at the worst point of Greece's recession, occupancy at Lamda Malls never fell below 96%, "and you had no significant decline in tenant sales," said Anthony Iannazzo, a managing director at Varde.

"It is rare as a value investor that you have the opportunity to observe how an asset will perform under a Great Depression-level economic crisis, but that is exactly the case here," he said.

While malls in the U.S., U.K. and elsewhere have suffered from consumers shifting online, the Greeks have been slower to change.

Last year, less than 70% of Greeks used the internet, while around 35% made a purchase online, according to a report from Deutsche Asset Management. Both figures put Greece with having among the lowest internet penetration in Europe.

Shopping malls like Golden Hall, with air conditioning, restaurants and play areas for children, also aren't as common in Greece as they are in the U.S. or other parts of Europe, giving Varde confidence it will remain a popular shopping destination, Mr. Mooney said.

The potential returns also were attractive to Varde. Because the Greek property market is so illiquid, nailing down an average yield in Greece is difficult, analysts said.

"You're not getting paid yields that you would see in Ukraine. But you're getting paid more than Romania or Turkey," said Mr. Iannazzo at Varde, which manages $12 billion of assets.

This isn't new ground for Varde, which aims to buy assets or take control of companies at a discount to their potential value and then list them on a stock exchange or sell them.

The firm in 2011 bought U.K. home builder Crest Nicholson Holdings PLC, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2013.

Varde in March bought Spanish housing developer Via Celere for 90 million euros. The company will be merged with a Spanish developer it already owns and is being considered for an initial public offering or sale, Mr. Mooney said.

Last year, Varde bought a stake in Trastor, a Greek real-estate investment trust, from Greece's largest lender Piraeus Bank. It now owns 54% of the group, which is focused on office and retail sectors.

"We like housing in Spain. We like retail in Greece," Mr. Mooney said. "As a value investor, we think it's the right time."

Retail Landlords Are Finding It Is Harder to Get a Loan

The retail malaise hasn't stopped shopping-center landlords from getting loans -- it is just getting harder.

With an oversupply of malls, changing consumer habits and increasing competition from e-commerce, property owners frequently have to spruce up their assets to make them trendier and draw more foot traffic.

But the process of getting the financing for this reinvestment has gotten more complicated, said analysts, lenders and landlords. Lenders now grill landlords repeatedly about tenants' creditworthiness and exposure to competition from neighboring developments and e-commerce.

On top of that, borrowers may have to pay higher interest rates than they are used to, as the perception of risk increases and the Federal Reserve boosts short-term interest rates.

"There is a sea change in attitudes over the last eight months," said Joseph Miller, co-founder of Runyon Group, a real-estate company with offices in Los Angeles and New York. "Everyone is more cautious."

A broad swath of banks, private-equity funds and insurance companies "have a risk-off approach and are more selective," he said.

Loan terms have become more conservative. The average size of a retail real-estate loan was $8.3 million in 2016, down from $12.2 million in 2015, according to data from Real Capital Analytics. The average loan-to-value ratio fell to 66% in 2016 from 70% in 2015, while the average occupancy rate of the underlying properties rose to 98% in 2016 from 92% in 2015.

A steady drumbeat of store closures is escalating concerns about the fate of retail shopping centers, especially lower-tier malls and strip centers. Major retailers such as Macy's Inc., Sears Holdings Corp. and J.C. Penney Co. have said in recent months they plan to close as many as 290 stores, while Payless ShoeSource Inc. last week filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and said it would close 400 stores.

Real-estate executives and financiers said it is more difficult these days to value shopping centers amid the shift in shopping habits.

"Lenders are more forward-looking this time, and question what the property is going to look like five years from now," said Eric Wolf, managing director at Katz Properties LLC, a property investment, development and management firm. "There is more face time with lenders, and you go over things, and go over again," said Mr. Wolf, whose firm owns 27 shopping centers in the U.S.

Mall values can drop more sharply than residential and office properties if anchor tenants close and surrounding tenants then peter out. J.C. Penney and Macy's closed stores at Hudson Valley Mall in Kingston, N.Y., in 2015 and 2016, respectively, and the value of the mall plummeted 90%. The mall was valued at $87 million in 2010. Last December, Kroll Bond Rating Agency said it was valued at $8.1 million.

Not all malls are struggling. Some better-quality properties in affluent coastal cities with a steady stream of tourists continue to boost rents.

Larger mall operators still make hefty investments in their best properties to keep them competitive.

Mr. Miller's Runyon Group recently secured a $47 million, 10-year securitized loan from Wells Fargo & Co. to refinance a mixed-use, open-air retail and office property in Los Angeles.

"Generally in two to three years, interest rates will be higher," said Mr. Miller. "We're stress-testing our business plans to be successful in an environment like that."

The Fed Could Use Less Book Learning and More Street Smarts

I'll bet pundits and pollsters will forever ponder how Donald Trump got elected. For me, it's straightforward: The American people -- or at least enough of them to propel Mr. Trump into office -- wanted to infuse practical business experience into the government. To borrow a phrase from my friend, the economist Larry Lindsey, voters rejected the political ruling class in favor of real-world experience.

Which brings me to the Federal Reserve. In 2012 Jim Grant, the longtime financial journalist, delivered a speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. "In the not quite 100 years since the founding of your institution," he said, "America has exchanged central banking for a kind of central planning and the gold standard for what I will call the Ph.D. standard."

Central banking, in other words, is now dominated by academics. And while I don't blame them for it, academics by their nature come to decision making with a distinctly academic perspective.

The shift described by Mr. Grant has had consequences. Simplicity based on age-old practice has been replaced by complexity based on econometric theory. Big Data has played an increasingly prominent role in how the Fed operates, even as the Fed's role in the economy has deepened and widened.

Rather than enlisting business leaders and bankers to fulfill the Fed's increasingly complex mission, America's political and monetary authorities turned primarily to the world's most brilliant economists, who can be thought of more and more as monetary scientists.

"Central bankers have invited politicians to abdicate leadership authority to an inbred society of PhD academics who are infected to their core with groupthink, or as I prefer to think of it: 'groupstink,'" argues former Dallas Fed analyst Danielle DiMartino Booth in a new book.

Ten of the 17 current Fed governors and regional bank presidents have doctorates in economics. Few have much experience in the private economy. Most have spent the bulk of their careers at the classroom lectern or in Washington. This is a sea change. In past decades, Fed members and governors frequently had experience in banking, industry and agriculture.

Do the results indicate that the pursuit of intellectual horsepower has produced a stronger economy? Today's labor-force participation rate is lower than at any time since the late 1970s; an oven from Sears that cost $160 in 1975 would cost more than $400 today; and despite unprecedented intervention in the economy, America has experienced its worst recovery since the Great Depression.

Given the cumulative genius of the leaders of the Federal Reserve System, and the highly sophisticated quantitative tools and policies the Fed has developed under their direction, why aren't we doing better?

Here's one businessman's answer: Academic genius is great, but it often comes up short when divorced from the practical experience of people who have expanded America's economy with new companies, new jobs and new ideas. That's not taking anything away from college professors. The U.S. economy is complicated, but there's a place for practical business experience in the Fed decision-making process.

Those who have actually taken risks in the market -- as entrepreneurs, business executives or bank chiefs -- have unique perspectives on the effects of monetary policy that economists necessarily lack. These individuals can tell you how a particular policy might affect their decisions, as well as the decisions of those in related industries, and all the knock-on effects it would produce across the economy.

Intellect is important, but it's not enough. Practical knowledge, experience and wisdom are needed to produce good policy, and good policy is essential for a free-market economy to prosper.

So I humbly suggest that political leaders increase the intellectual diversity of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors by considering candidates with real-world business experience. Academics have my respect, but when their insights are balanced by the lessons of the free market, the Federal Reserve will better fulfill its mission.

The Property Report: Banks Wary of Retail Landlords

The retail malaise hasn't stopped shopping-center landlords from getting loans -- it is just getting harder.

With an oversupply of malls, changing consumer habits and increasing competition from e-commerce, property owners frequently have to spruce up their assets to make them trendier and draw more foot traffic.

But the process of getting the financing for this reinvestment has gotten more complicated, said analysts, lenders and landlords. Lenders now grill landlords repeatedly about tenants' creditworthiness and exposure to competition from neighboring developments and e-commerce. On top of that, borrowers may have to pay higher interest rates than they are used to, as the perception of risk increases and the Federal Reserve boosts short-term interest rates.

"There is a sea change in attitudes over the last eight months," said Joseph Miller, co-founder of Runyon Group, a real-estate company with offices in Los Angeles and New York. "Everyone is more cautious."

A broad swath of banks, private-equity funds and insurance companies "have a risk-off approach and are more selective," he said.

Loan terms have become more conservative. The average size of a retail real-estate loan was $8.3 million in 2016, down from $12.2 million in 2015, according to data from Real Capital Analytics. The average loan-to-value ratio fell to 66% in 2016 from 70% in 2015, while the average occupancy rate of the underlying properties rose to 98% in 2016 from 92% in 2015.

A steady drumbeat of store closures is escalating concerns about the fate of retail shopping centers, especially lower-tier malls and strip centers. Major retailers such as Macy's Inc., Sears Holdings Corp. and J.C. Penney Co. have said in recent months they plan to close as many as 290 stores, while Payless ShoeSource Inc. last week filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and said it would close 400 stores.

Real-estate executives and financiers said it is more difficult these days to value shopping centers amid the shift in shopping habits.

"Lenders are more forward-looking this time, and question what the property is going to look like five years from now," said Eric Wolf, managing director at Katz Properties LLC, a property investment, development and management firm. "There is more face time with lenders, and you go over things, and go over again," said Mr. Wolf, whose firm owns 27 shopping centers in the U.S.

Mall values can drop more sharply than residential and office properties if anchor tenants close and surrounding tenants then peter out. J.C. Penney and Macy's closed stores at Hudson Valley Mall in Kingston, N.Y., in 2015 and 2016, respectively, and the value of the mall plummeted 90%. The mall was valued at $87 million in 2010. Last December, Kroll Bond Rating Agency said it was valued at $8.1 million.

Not all malls are struggling. Some better-quality properties in affluent coastal cities with a steady stream of tourists continue to boost rents. Larger mall operators still make hefty investments in their best properties to keep them competitive.

"The stronger centers are getting stronger and the weaker centers are getting weaker," said Bill O'Connor, chief executive of O'Connor Capital Partners, a real-estate investment and development firm. "All this is happening faster than the previous cycles. It's a game of musical chairs; when the music stops, you'll find out who has a seat."

But capital for retail real estate isn't drying up. In addition to banks, insurance companies also are extending loans to real-estate owners, and private-equity and hedge funds are on the lookout for deals for their debt funds.

Mr. Miller's Runyon Group recently secured a $47 million, 10-year securitized loan from Wells Fargo & Co. to refinance a mixed-use, open-air retail and office property in Los Angeles. It started negotiations in October, and over the next two months the 10-year Treasury rate jumped to 2.5% from 1.6%.

"Generally in two to three years, interest rates will be higher," said Mr. Miller. "We're stress-testing our business plans to be successful in an environment like that."

The Property Report: U.S. Commercial-Property Lending Falls --- Sales activity has declined after eight years of price gains; 'the banks are hungry'

Commercial real-estate lending by banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions is declining as sales activity slows and regulators voice concern about the sector.

Lenders closed roughly $491 billion of mortgage loans backed by U.S. property in 2016, down 3% from 2015, according to new statistics from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Most of the decline occurred in the fourth quarter, when volume was 7% lower than the 2015 quarter, according to Jamie Woodwell, the trade group's head of commercial-property research.

Despite the decrease, the new-volume number was the third highest since the association began doing the survey, behind 2015 and the record year of 2007.

The decline from 2015 to 2016 was due partly to a slowing of property sales, meaning fewer buyers needed financing. "There's a very tight correlation" between the two, Mr. Woodwell said.

Buyers, for their part, are getting jittery because values have been rising for eight years and are near records. In all, investors purchased $493.7 billion of U.S. commercial property in 2016, down 10% from 2015, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics.

Activity has slowed further this year. Investors purchased just $50.3 billion worth of U.S. commercial property in the first two months of 2017, compared with $80.1 billion during the period in 2016, according to Real Capital Analytics.

Regulators have been expressing concern about overheated commercial real-estate lending. At the end of the 2016 third quarter there were 521 institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. with potentially worrisome concentrations of risk, according to an FDIC report this year. That is up from 474 institutions in the 2015 third quarter, the report said.

Yet banks and insurers are getting more aggressive over deals as investment in the sector declines. New lenders also are emerging on the scene, including investment funds formed by private-equity firms that are focused on real-estate debt.

"It's tougher right now," said Craig Bender, who heads up ING Groep NV's U.S. real-estate lending business. "The banks are hungry. The life-insurance companies are hungry."

ING Groep two years ago relaunched its real-estate business after shutting it down following the global financial crisis. Last year, it made a $570 million refinance loan for the Sony Building, an iconic mixed-use skyscraper at 550 Madison Ave. in New York.

Many bank executives view the commercial-property market as healthy, given rising rents and occupancies. Wells Fargo & Co., the country's largest commercial-property market lender, expects to lend about $30 billion this year, about the same as in 2016 and 2015, according to Mark Myers, the bank's head of commercial real estate. Those amounts are "high-water marks" for the bank, he said.

Still, the bank recognizes that property values are at record levels after rising for eight years. "I'd say, if I could look back one year ago, we're probably more cautious [now]," Mr. Myers said.

Some lenders are competing by making riskier loans such as those that finance construction or occupy a "mezzanine" position between first mortgages and equity. In the first quarter of 2017, construction and land loans on bank balance sheets were up 12.8% to $306.1 billion compared with the year-earlier period, according to loan tracker Trepp LLC.

Lenders and developers have gotten especially aggressive in building rental apartments. More units are under way today than in any period since the mid-1970s, experts said.

"There's no current looming event that regulators are looking to say we foresee a problem," said Matthew Anderson, managing director of Trepp. "It's just the sheer volume and pace of activity and the length of how long it's gone on."

Lenders also have been emboldened because loan performance is doing well. Just 0.59% of commercial mortgages held on balance sheets of banks and thrifts today are more than 90 days delinquent, the lowest rate in more than a decade, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. By comparison, the delinquency rate was 4.21% at the end of 2010.

The improving loan quality reflects steadily rising prices. A property value index compiled by Green Street Advisors has more than doubled since 2009, when it hit its postcrash low point. But lately that index plateaued. In March, it declined 0.5%.

For EU Countries, Brexit Brings Opportunities and Headaches

BRUSSELS Brexit provides an opportunity for European Union countries to attract business as investment banks, insurers and asset managers seek to secure access to the continent. For the bloc's national regulators, the influx could bring added prestige as well as some headaches.

As the U.K. negotiates the details of its exit from the EU, both global financial firms with a London presence and big British firms are looking into how to keep a finger in the pie by opening offices across the channel. In the absence of a single EU-wide financial supervisory authority akin to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the U.S., the task of regulating these new entities will fall to national regulators and supervisors, supporting authorities such as the European Central Bank 's supervisory arm and the European Banking Authority .

Regulators will have to bolster operations and infrastructure to process new firms and licenses. They will also have to ensure financial firms don't play them off against each other as they seek the lightest-touch oversight possible, despite some harmonization of supervisory culture and processes in much of the eurozone.

National governments have been lobbying behind closed doors to attract key industry players, pointing to their niche expertise. Luxembourg and Ireland have experience in regulating investment funds, making them a natural destination for asset managers.

Lloyd's of London Ltd ., a specialist insurance market, said in late March that it would "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lloyds-of-london-to-set-up-eu-subsidiary-in-brussels-1490895996", opening the door for the city to become the continent's insurance hub. Lloyd's had also considered Germany, Ireland, Luxembourg and the Netherlands.

A Lloyd's spokeswoman said Brussels provided a strong regulatory framework in a central location. Belgium's national supervisor oversees Brussels-based Euroclear, which handles clearing and settlement for securities across Europe. Belgian authorities also have experience overseeing local operations of large banks such as BNP Paribas SA and insurance giant AXA, another point in their favor.

But EU officials are concerned about so-called regulatory arbitrage as financial institutions decide where to locate branches and main subsidiaries. Sabine Lautenschlger , who sits on the ECB 's six-member executive board and is second-in-command on its supervisory board, said a key question arising with Brexit is how banking groups might use the differences between national regimes and European regimes "to get the best deal."

Another question is whether national authorities will have the capacity to deal with the influx of new businesses relocating from the U.K.

In a "https://www.afme.eu/en/reports/publications/afme-implementing-brexit/" last week, the Association for Financial Markets in Europe , a trade group, outlined the challenges ahead for banks. One issue is whether supervisors in the EU can keep up with changes in banking business models and markets.

"Expertise in markets supervision is in relatively short supply," AFME said in the report. "There will be a major challenge for the Single Supervisory Mechanism [the ECB 's supervisory arm] and national authorities to ensure that sufficient resources and expertise are in the right place to provide timely delivery of license and model approvals."

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co . said in March it was evaluating up to eight cities including Paris, Frankfurt, Luxembourg and Dublin where it could move operations and staff. Frankfurt or Paris are considered the destination of choice for investment banks given the German and French regulators' experience with wholesale banks, according to EU officials.

While Morgan Stanley favors Dublin, according to people familiar with the bank's plan, the Irish authorities have to take into account whether they will have the bandwidth to deal with a large global bank. Luxembourg's regulator, according to a person familiar with the matter, said it could turn down some firms seeking to open offices there so as to not constrain resources.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Secret Recordings Play Role in SEC Probe of Insurer AmTrust

By Mark Maremont, Leslie Scism and Michael Rapoport

The auditor at accounting firm BDO USA LLP tried to act casually while wandering around the firm's New York offices, striking up conversations with colleagues about the firm's audit of the large insurer AmTrust Financial Services Inc. AFSI -0.05%

Unknown to the colleagues, a tiny recording device disguised as an ordinary Starbucks gift card was capturing every word. The auditor was taping on behalf of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and cooperating as a whistleblower with the Securities and Exchange Commission .

The clandestine recordings in 2014, described to The Wall Street Journal by the whistleblower, were part of a continuing federal investigation being led by the SEC, according to people familiar with the matter. The focus of the probe includes accounting practices of AmTrust, a fast-growing, New York-based insurance company that in recent years has attracted skepticism about its results from investors betting against its stock.

The SEC's Fort Worth, Texas, office is leading the probe, and it isn't clear how far along the investigation is. The agency sometimes closes probes without taking action.

The auditor, who was directly assigned to AmTrust audits for at least three years but has since left the firm, has been working since 2013 with a larger group that includes Harry Markopolos, a forensic accountant who warned the SEC about the Bernard Madoff Ponzi scheme before it became public in late 2008.

The group hopes to profit by collecting a reward under the SEC's Whistleblower Program, if the agency ever successfully brings legal action in the matter.

An AmTrust spokeswoman declined to comment on whether the company knows of any SEC probe, saying the company didn't speak for the agency. It said questions about its accounting practices are "fantasies concocted and intentionally publicized by parties who clearly have a self-serving agenda and appear to be trying to profit from misinformation about AmTrust."

On Monday, AmTrust disclosed it has recently beefed up its financial-accounting team with the hiring of a chief accounting officer and other moves.

BDO declined to comment on AmTrust, saying it is "bound by professional standards which prohibit discussing confidential client matters."

The New York Department of Financial Services , one of AmTrust's lead state regulators, also is conducting a special, non-routine examination of AmTrust's New York unit, according to a person familiar with the matter. AmTrust said it doesn't comment on any state examinations.

Since its founding 19 years ago, AmTrust has grown, mostly through acquisitions, into the nation's third-largest workers' compensation insurer by market share. It protects millions of U.S. workers by bearing responsibility for their medical care and lost wages from job-related injuries. Its revenue in 2016 totaled $5.45 billion.

In early April, the company restated its financial results downward back to 2014 over a range of accounting issues. The restatements, which came after BDO was replaced as AmTrust's outside auditor by KPMG LLP , sliced more than 9% off AmTrust's previously reported net income for the past three years.

Even so, investors were encouraged when AmTrust finally filed its annual report, which had twice been delayed, and that the restatements weren't more significant. After slumping in recent weeks, the company's shares rebounded after the restatements were announced, though they later gave back much of those gains.

The Markopolos group claims that AmTrust has overstated its profits and financial health by understating what it may need to pay policyholders in the future. To mask this, they contend, the company has used complicated financial maneuvers, some involving related offshore companies.

In a 2013 submission to the SEC, which has been reviewed by the Journal, the group claimed it used internal documents gathered by the whistleblower to calculate that $277 million in losses had been shifted to an offshore affiliate from 2009 to 2012, bolstering AmTrust's operating income by that amount. This accounted for 38% of net income in 2012 alone, the group calculates.

In a presentation that the group says it gave to the FBI and federal prosecutors in 2014, Mr. Markopolos's team called one set of alleged accounting moves "The Washing Machine" for its purported cleansing effect on the bottom line, and another "The Loss Cemetery," for its alleged effectiveness in burying losses in offshore affiliated entities.

The recent accounting restatement, with KPMG 's approval, "does not change our fundamental view of AmTrust's shoddy accounting," says Mr. Markopolos, who says his group is not betting against AmTrust's stock.

AmTrust said it received clean audit opinions from BDO every year and has since received the same opinion from KPMG .

"KPMG 's audit included in its scope an audit of the allegations made by short sellers since 2013, including the baseless allegation that AmTrust shifted losses off of its books through reinsurance transactions."

KPMG declined to comment.

AmTrust has skirmished with critics before. In 2015, a New York federal judge dismissed a shareholder lawsuit against AmTrust based on some of its critics' allegations, ruling that the complaint failed to support its claims.

The judge cited correspondence between AmTrust and the SEC in which the insurer sought to work out "a difference of opinion" about some reinsurance accounting matters, and noted that AmTrust had changed its accounting approach in one area and "clarified and improved its disclosures." A federal appeals court upheld the dismissal in 2016.

The Markopolos group's submissions rely, in part, on emails, AmTrust bank statements and internal documents gathered by the BDO whistleblower. The whistleblower who had only a partial view into AmTrust's accounting practices claims to have witnessed seemingly unsupported adjustments to financial schedules by a senior AmTrust executive, and AmTrust's reliance on "plugs," or undocumented adjustments, in completing some financial schedules.

The Markopolos submissions also include detailed analyses of AmTrust's accounting produced by John McPherson , a forensic accountant and insurance consultant who is part of the group.

Many of the claims by the Markopolos group focus on alleged flaws in the audits of AmTrust by BDO, which ranks in the next tier down from the Big Four accounting firms. AmTrust had been among its largest U.S. clients until it was replaced by KPMG a year ago.

The whistleblower alleges that BDO often was rushed during its audits, partly because AmTrust was late or inconsistent in providing figures, or lacked documentation.

At least twice, BDO formally signed off on its AmTrust audit before completing some important checks, the internal whistleblower claims. The whistleblower claims that BDO staffers allegedly covered for their lapse by loading unfinished documents into an internal software system to show the right time stamp, then returned later to complete some of the work.

BDO said such allegations "are not consistent with our firm's values and the expectations we have for our professionals."

AmTrust said it relied on BDO's integrity, and "if there are allegations regarding BDO's internal procedures, those are the responsibility of BDO and AmTrust would not have visibility into them."

Bank of England 's Libor Role Under Scrutiny After Release of Recording

By Jason Douglas

LONDON A recording of an 8-year-old phone call threatens to reopen a question that has dogged the Bank of England for years: How much did the central bank know about efforts to manipulate a key interest rate at the height of the financial crisis?

The U.K.'s main opposition Labour Party on Monday called for a fresh investigation into the BOE's possible role in the rigging of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, in 2008, after the British Broadcasting Corp . published a recording online of what it said was a private telephone call between bankers at Barclays PLC in which they discussed lowering their firm's Libor submissions in response to "serious pressure" from U.K. government and central-bank officials.

A spokeswoman for Barclays declined to comment, adding that the bank doesn't know whether the recording is genuine or not. The Wall Street Journal wasn't able to confirm its authenticity.

The emergence of the October 2008 call represents the latest twist in a long-running saga that has resulted in billions of dollars of fines for big global banks in the U.K. and the U.S., landed some bankers in jail and hurt the reputation of regulators who oversaw the financial system.

At its heart is Libor, an interest rate at the time calculated from banks' own estimates of their cost of borrowing that was used as a benchmark for pricing everything from mortgages to corporate loans. Barclays paid $450 million in fines in 2012 to U.S. and U.K. regulators after admitting traders and managers had manipulated the Libor rate.

In the 2008 recording published online by the BBC's Panorama program, two bankers at Barclays are heard to discuss reporting borrowing rates to the Libor-setting panel that are lower than the bank's true cost of borrowing. One says that "we have some serious pressure from the U.K. government and the Bank of England about pushing our Libors lower."

The rate became a closely watched gauge of financial-market stress as the crisis that ultimately sank the world economy into recession unfolded. The lower the Libor rate, the healthier individual banks and the broader system were perceived to be.

The BOE denies any wrongdoing. In a statement Monday, the central bank said that Libor and similar benchmarks weren't officially regulated in the U.K. or elsewhere in 2008 and that it continues to assist fraud investigators who are still probing the scandal. It said it plans to make public material related to the manipulation of financial market benchmarks once these investigations are concluded.

Nevertheless, John McDonnell , economy spokesman for the Labour Party, said the call obtained by the BBC represents "an extremely serious revelation" that requires the U.K. Treasury to sanction "an immediate high-level investigation."

The U.K. Treasury said in a statement that the government "is absolutely clear that we must learn from the lessons of the past," citing reforms in 2012 that have made manipulating Libor a criminal offense.

"We will continue work with the U.K.'s independent regulators to ensure that the our financial sector operates to the highest possible standards," said a spokesman.

The details of the call published by the BBC echo closely evidence heard in an earlier probe into the Libor scandal by the British parliament's treasury committee, which scrutinizes economic policy.

In a 2012 investigation, lawmakers on the panel heard evidence that Barclays 's Libor submissions had been discussed by former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond and former BOE deputy governor Paul Tucker in October 2008. Both Mr. Diamond and Mr. Tucker denied the BOE instructed Barclays to lower its Libor submissions.

But the panel heard that junior executives at Barclays  including Mark Dearlove, one of the bankers on the 2008 call obtained by the BBC got the impression that it had, which resulted in Barclays lowering its submissions to the Libor-setting panel, the committee said in a report.

Lawmakers said the episode represented "an extraordinary, but conceivably plausible, series of misunderstandings and miscommunications." They said that Barclays had demonstrated a "pattern of repeated dishonesty in Libor submissions" earlier in 2008.

They cleared the BOE of any wrongdoing, saying that although officials had been "naive" they weren't responsible for policing Libor. The now-defunct Financial Services Authority, which supervised banks at the time, came in for sharper criticism.

Subsequent reforms have put the BOE back in charge of supervising banks and the financial system more broadly. The U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority now has oversight of Libor and other benchmarks.

Wells Fargo Claws Back $75 Million More From John Stumpf and Former Retail Bank Head

By Emily Glazer

A new report on the sales scandal at Wells Fargo & Co . portrayed its former chief executive as a tone-deaf leader who protected an irresponsible lieutenant and worked for board members who didn't keep the pair in check.

The report, a long-awaited investigation of a scandal that ensnared the bank with regulators and politicians this past September, also said Wells Fargo 's board will claw back an additional $75 million in pay from former Chief Executive John Stumpf and the lieutenant, former retail-bank chief Carrie Tolstedt .

The latest decisions on pay brought the total money clawed back from current and former Wells Fargo executives to $182.8 million, an amount that rivals the fine the bank paid last year and that its board described as the largest clawback ever for any financial-services firm.

The 113-page report, released Monday, is likely to be the board's final deep dive into the questionable conduct that dated back to 2002 and ultimately resulted in a $185 million penalty last year. It likely won't be the final discussion, however, of the high-pressure sales strategy that led to as many as 2.1 million accounts being created using fictitious or unauthorized customer information.

"The Board's report is a necessary examination of what went wrong in our culture, operations, and governance," Wells Fargo CEO Timothy Sloan said in a statement Monday.

"I wish we would've taken more action and done things more quickly," Mr. Sloan said later on a call with reporters.

The San Francisco-based bank continues to face federal and state investigations about its sales practices. And last week, proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc . suggested Wells Fargo investors vote against 12 of the bank's 15 directors at the firm's annual meeting April 25.

In Monday's report, prepared by a board committee of independent directors and law firm Shearman & Sterling LLP , much of the blame fell on Mr. Stumpf and his protg, Ms. Tolstedt.

A lawyer for Ms. Tolstedt, Enu Mainigi of Williams & Connolly LLP , said: "We strongly disagree with the report and its attempt to lay blame with Ms. Tolstedt. A full and fair examination of the facts will produce a different conclusion." Mr. Stumpf's lawyer declined to comment. Mr. Stumpf last fall apologized and in congressional hearings took responsibility for the scandal.

The report also highlighted how the bank's push to boost revenue and profit trickled down to thousands of employees who felt pressured to meet unrealistic sales goals. One Wells Fargo branch manager, for example, had a teenage daughter with 24 accounts, an adult daughter with 18, a husband with 21, a brother with 14 and a father with four.

Ms. Tolstedt, an executive whose rise once paralleled Wells Fargo 's own success, was singled out 142 times in the report for setting the tone in the troubled retail-banking unit. At one point, she is described as being "scared to death" of hurting her unit's sales figures. There's "no evidence that Tolstedt showed serious concern about the effects of improper sales practices on Wells Fargo 's customers," the report added.

Compounding the issue, Ms. Tolstedt gave presentations that directors later felt "minimized and understated problems" at her unit. At a May 2015 meeting, the report said, she told some board members 230 people had been terminated over sales-practice issues, a number far short of the aggregate total. Board members didn't find out until the September 2016 regulatory settlement that 5,300 employees had been fired over five years related to sales practices.

In response to the investigation findings, the board decided last week to claw back Ms. Tolstedt's outstanding stock options valued at about $47.3 million, in addition to $19 million in earlier clawback activity. It also is taking away through scheduled retirement benefits an additional $28 million of incentive compensation paid to Mr. Stumpf in March 2016 on top of $41 million in earlier clawbacks.

The board's review caps a six-month investigation that not only has rocked Wells Fargo but the broader banking industry, with dozens of firms examining their own sales practices at the behest of regulators.

Years of aggressive sales tactics in pockets around the country led to Wells Fargo 's September settlement. Since then politicians, regulators and customers among others, have criticized the bank. In February, it reached a preliminary settlement for $110 million over a customer class action case. Other state and federal investigations are continuing and the bank has said it is cooperating.

Improper sales issues began to escalate within Wells Fargo as far back as 2002, the report noted, years earlier than the bank has agreed to check for consumer harm. The bank has said it is going back an additional two years beyond the 2011-to-2016 time frame regulators called for in last year's consent orders.

Mr. Sloan said Monday Wells Fargo will make things "right" with customers who reach out to the bank with problems related to the sales practices, regardless of the timing.

By 2004, a Wells Fargo 's internal investigations employee wrote to executives in that group about sales issues, according to the report. As early as 2012, some top Wells Fargo retail banking and risk executives knew the firm had a problem with its strategy of "cross selling" multiple products to the same customers. The issue gained more exposure with a Los Angeles Times story on the topic and a 2015 lawsuit by the Los Angeles City Attorney.

But the company was slow to stamp out the issues, the report said, in part because its decentralized structure gave Ms. Tolstedt too much power and officials from other units, such as risk management, human resources and legal, either couldn't connect the dots on problems or weren't powerful enough to do anything about it.

Meanwhile, the board's efforts to understand the scope of the issues were hampered by the "insular and defensive" way in which Ms. Tolstedt ran her division, as well as Mr. Stumpf's loyalty to her, the report said.

Mr. Stumpf "was by nature an optimistic executive who refused to believe that the sales model was seriously impaired," the report said. "He was too late and too slow to call for inspection of or critical challenge to the basic business model."

In late 2015, key board members including lead independent director Stephen Sanger pushed Mr. Stumpf to remove Ms. Tolstedt from her role. But Mr. Stumpf declined, saying that Ms. Tolstedt, while at times controlling, was "the best banker in America," the report said.

Ms. Tolstedt ultimately left her role in July 2016. The board "should have been more forceful in pushing Stumpf to change leadership," the committee concluded. Mr. Stumpf abruptly retired in October.

Mr. Stumpf's successor as CEO, Mr. Sloan, was among seven other executives, in addition to Mr. Stumpf and Ms. Tolstedt, who didn't receive 2016 cash bonuses, and who were subjected to certain equity clawbacks. Mr. Sloan hasn't had other pay clawed back, in part because he wasn't closely involved in overseeing the retail unit until recently.

Wells Fargo & Co .'s board said it has clawed back an additional $75 million of pay from two former executives. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the bank clawed back $72 million.

Swift Releases New Security Mandates for Users

By Katy Burne

Swift, the dominant carrier of cross-border payment instructions between banks, has finalized a new set of security standards its customers must follow by the end of this year or risk being reported to regulators.

The message carrier, known officially as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication , released the final rules last week, said spokeswoman Natasha de Teran. The move sets a formal time frame for customers to comply with the additional requirements now that they have been vetted by consulting with users. The company announced in September that it would be raising its security standards.

The stepped-up controls are a key plank in Swift's response to a spate of cyberattacks on banks in recent months that have drawn heightened scrutiny from the company's regulators, which include central banks. The attacks included an $81 million theft from the Bangladesh central bank 's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York last February and other heists in Ecuador, Vietnam and India over the past couple of years.

The perpetrators of the Bangladesh heist remain unidentified and only $15 million has been turned over to authorities, but U.S. prosecutors are building cases that would link North Korea to the attack. North Korea's mission to the United Nations didn't respond to requests seeking comment.

There are 27 new Swift controls, of which 16 are mandatory and the rest are advised. Users must demonstrate their compliance annually, and the results can be shared with regulators and correspondent banks, financial institutions that provide services on behalf of other banks. A randomized group each year also will have to show that their internal and external auditors agree. Customers' compliance status will be made available to their trading partners within the Swift network.

The new controls include detailed requirements about how users need to physically isolate local Swift-related equipment in a designated zone; protect access to tokens that contain Swift credentials; conduct annual security training for all staff; and have cyber-incident-response plans.

With these controls, users will be able to price in each other's risk to the costs they charge each other; require improvements of each other; choose to cease doing business with each other; or put in extra controls when doing business.

It isn't clear whether meeting all of Swift's new security controls would diminish the legal liability of a user in the event of a cyberbreach. In the case of the Bangladesh heist, Swift reiterated a corporate policy that customers are responsible for their own security, but the Asian central bank initially blamed the Fed and its correspondent-banking partners in New York for not spotting the fraud before executing the payments.

A committee of central banks now is looking to draft international guidelines covering the cybersecurity responsibilities of Swift and correspondent banks, aiming to provide a framework that doesn't currently exist across borders.

New York Fed President William Dudley told an audience of students in New York last month that central banks wanted a framework to define the roles of each institution in the process.

"The thing that we're trying to work on internationally is to try to make sure that everyone understands their responsibility in that [payments] chain," he said. "So it's really important that the person executing the payment, that their &facilities are secure." He added, "In the Bangladesh situation, their facilities were not secure."

China Regulator Warns Banks Away From Speculative Activity

By Shen Hong

SHANGHAI China is taking another step to contain the growing risk in its financial system, warning banks against engaging in speculative activity that has created unhealthy asset bubbles and prevented money from flowing into a weak real economy.

In a document titled Directive 46 circulated to banks Monday and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, the China Banking Regulatory Commission asked them to conduct self-checks of certain actions it described as "irregularities," including making leveraged investments via wealth management products and the use of new financial instruments such as negotiable certificates of deposits. The regulator said its local branches would also launch spot checks of banks under their jurisdiction.

Without offering details, the regulator warned of "severe penalties" for banks found to have committed serious violations of the new guidelines. The CBRC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Since last year, Beijing has grown increasingly wary of a fast-rising debt pile among companies and local governments, as well as periodic investment booms in markets ranging from bonds to sugar. Making the prevention of financial risk and reduction of leverage top priorities this year, authorities have stepped up their efforts in recent months, especially in the money market where the central bank has raised key short-term interest rates twice since late January.

In its latest directive, which runs seven pages, and a nine-page list of guidelines, the CBRC warned banks against using regulatory loopholes, idle funds and insider trading to profit from various forms of arbitrage.

In addition to voicing longstanding concerns about banks using financial products to remove bad loans from their balance sheets, the CRBC specifically defined the use of wealth management products to make leveraged bets in financial markets as an irregular activity.

Over the past decade, wealth management products have become prevalent in China's shadow banking sector, which includes nonbank lenders. These short-term products traditionally offer investment returns much higher than bank deposits. Because the products are typically invested in long-term assets such as bonds, the issuers are faced with periodic needs to secure funds to repay investors. This has contributed to increasingly frequent cash crunches in China's financial system, such as one late last month when short-term interbank funding costs rose to two-year highs.

In the directive, the CBRC also asked banks to conduct self-checks of whether they have asked nonbank institutions such as brokerages and private-equity firms to "add further leverage, duration and risk" in their investments. It also warned banks against investing their own wealth management products in those issued by others.

The latest clampdown also focuses on negotiable certificates of deposits, a popular new financial tool Chinese banks use to replenish capital but also add leverage. These bondlike instruments allow banks to borrow money typically for less than a year.

The CBRC instructed banks to disclose whether they have used large issuances of NCDs to finance various forms of speculative investment that intensify "latent liquidity risk."

The regulator said its campaign was aimed at "guiding the banking sector back to its roots" and ensuring that funds are "invested into the real economy." It warned against behavior it described as "working without bending down" and "sitting there collecting free money."

The CBRC asked banks to submit a report on their self-checks by June 12 and to complete them by the end of November.

WSJ Pro: Fight Breaks Out Over $15 Million Left Over From CFPB Settlement

By Yuka Hayash

WASHINGTON What should regulators do if money is left over from a settlement fund after affected consumers are made whole?

That is the conundrum a federal judge ordered financial regulators to address on Monday as he questioned a recent attempt by state attorneys general to redirect such funds to their own coffers.

The order from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York is the latest development in an unusual case in which several state attorneys general have sought to modify the settlement terms of an enforcement action.

In June 2015, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Sprint Corp. reached a settlement under which the company agreed to refund consumers $50 million to settle charges that it had allowed customers to be illegally billed by third-party merchants.

Sprint made refunds to consumers who filed claims but was left with $15.14 million that wasn't distributed. The settlement had called for the company to send any leftover funds to the CFPB. Unless the agency found other ways to use the fund for purposes "reasonably related to the allegations," it was to deposit the funds with the U.S. Treasury Department , according to the terms of the settlement.

However, the state officials stepped in, arguing the undistributed funds should be used to train and support state attorneys charged with consumer protection. State attorneys general, particularly Democrats, are flexing their muscles to step up their activities amid expectations that the Trump administration will curb the work of the CFPB and other financial regulators.

Sprint itself had an idea of what to do with the money, and later reached an agreement with the state officials to redirect $1.1 million of the leftover funds to a community organization that provides internet access to underprivileged high-school students. The agreement called for the remaining $14 million to go to the states, not the Treasury.

The CFPB itself didn't express its position on the matter at the time.

Calling the motion from the state attorneys general a "peculiar posture," District Judge William Pauley on Monday ordered the CFPB to state its view on the move. He also ordered the Justice Department, which will be representing the Treasury Department, to weigh in. Furthermore, the judge said the proposed arrangement might raise an issue with a law that provides that government officials "receiving money for the government from any source shall deposit that money with the Treasury."

A CFPB spokesman declined to comment Monday. Justice Department and Sprint officials couldn't immediately be reached.

The proposal to modify the settlement terms was filed by the Connecticut attorney general's office on behalf of its counterparts in Indiana, Kansas and Vermont. Specifically, they proposed redirecting the undistributed funds to the National Association of Attorneys General for the purpose of developing a training and research center for consumer protection.

A spokeswoman for the Connecticut attorney general's office declined to comment Monday.

The CFPB and the Justice Department have until May 10 to file their respective opinions.

Lending for Commercial Property Falls as Investors Pull Back; Regulators Concerned

By Peter Grant

Commercial real estate lending by banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions is declining as sales activity slows and regulators voice concern about the sector.

Lenders closed roughly $491 billion of mortgage loans in 2016, down 3% from 2015, according to new statistics from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Most of the decline occurred in the fourth quarter, when volume was 7% lower than the same quarter in 2015, according to Jamie Woodwell, the trade group's head of commercial property research.

Despite the decrease, the new volume number was the third highest since the association began doing the survey, behind 2015 and the record year of 2007.

The decline between 2015 and 2016 was due partly to a slowing of property sales, meaning fewer buyers needed financing. "There's a very tight correlation" between the two, Mr. Woodwell said.

Buyers, for their part, are getting jittery because values have been rising for eight years and are near record highs. In all, investors purchased $493.7 billion worth of U.S. commercial property in 2016, down 10% from 2015, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics .

The slowdown is accelerating this year. Investors have purchased just $50.3 billion worth of U.S. commercial property in the first two months of 2017, compared with $80.1 billion during the same period in 2016, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics .

Regulators have been expressing concern about overheated commercial real estate lending. At the end of the third quarter of 2016 there were 521 institutions insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . with potentially worrisome concentrations of risk, according to a FDIC report earlier this year. That's up from 474 institutions in the third quarter of 2015, the report said.

Yet banks and insurers are getting more aggressive over deals as investment in the sector declines. A flock of new lenders also are emerging on the scene, including investment funds formed by private-equity firms that are focused on real estate debt.

"It's tougher right now," said Craig Bender, who heads up ING Groep NV 's U.S. real estate lending business. "The banks are hungry. The life insurance companies are hungry."

ING Groep two years ago relaunched its real-estate business after shutting it down following the global financial crisis. Last year, it made a $570 million refinance loan for the Sony Building , an iconic mixed-use skyscraper at 550 Madison Ave. in New York City.

Many bank executives view the commercial property market as healthy, given rising rents and occupancies. Wells Fargo & Co ., the country's largest commercial property market lender, expects to lend about $30 billion this year, about the same as in 2016 and 2015, according to Mark Myers, the bank's head of commercial real estate. Those amounts are "high water marks" for the bank, he said.

Still, the bank recognizes that property values are at record levels after rising for eight years. "I'd say, if I could look back one year ago, we're probably more cautious [now]," Mr. Myers said.

Some lenders are competing by making riskier loans such as those that finance construction or occupy a "mezzanine" position between first mortgages and equity. In the first quarter of 2017, construction and land loans on bank balance sheets were up 12.8% to $306.1 billion compared with the same period a year earlier, according to loan tracker Trepp LLC .

Lenders and developers have gotten especially aggressive in building rental apartments. More units are under way today than in any period since the mid-1970s, experts said.

"There's no current looming event that regulators are looking to say we foresee a problem," said Matthew Anderson , managing director of Trepp. "It's just the sheer volume and pace of activity and the length of how long it's gone on."

Lenders also have been emboldened because loan performance is doing well. Just 0.59% of commercial mortgages held on balance sheets of banks and thrifts today are more than 90 days delinquent, the lowest rate in more than a decade, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. By comparison the delinquency rate was 4.21% at the end of 2010.

The improving loan quality reflects steadily rising prices. A property value index compiled by Green Street Advisors more than doubled between 2009 when it hit its post-crash low point. But lately that index plateaued. In March, it declined by 0.5%.

Analysis: If Everyone Is So Confident, Why Aren't They Borrowing?

By Aaron Back

One of the great mysteries and biggest concerns in the economy right now is the slowing growth in bank lending. Economists are searching for answers but none are entirely satisfying.

Total loans and leases extended by commercial banks in the U.S. this year were up just 3.8% from a year earlier as of March 29, according to the latest Federal Reserve data. That compares with 6.4% growth in all of last year, and a 7.6% pace as of late October.

The slowdown is more surprising given the rise in business and consumer confidence since the election. And it is worrisome because the lack of business investment is considered an important reason why economic growth has remained weak.

Loans to businesses have slowed most sharply, with the latest data showing commercial and industrial loans up just 2.8% from a year earlier, compared with 8.9% growth in late October. Economists at Goldman Sachs estimate the slowdown in commercial and industrial lending alone equates to a $100 billion shortfall in loans.

Investors may start to get more clarity on what is causing the slowdown when banks start reporting first-quarter earnings on Thursday.

One explanation is that many companies have been tapping corporate bond markets to lock in low rates, and in some cases to pay down more expensive bank debt. In the first quarter of this year, corporate bond issuance rose by 18% from a year earlier, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association . But one reason for the increase is that the first quarter of 2016 was dismal because of market turmoil. The rise isn't enough to explain the entire shortfall in lending.

Goldman's economists also point to dynamics in the oil-and-gas industry. When oil prices were falling sharply in the first quarter of 2016, many energy companies couldn't tap capital markets for financing. Instead they drew on bank lines of credit. Now that oil prices have rebounded, many of these companies are paying down their bank lines, Goldman says.

As the Goldman economists admit, this hypothesis is hard to verify since the Federal Reserve lending data aren't broken down by industry. Using data from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency on the total size of credit facilities, they assume commodities companies borrowed around one-third of loan commitments available to them by March last year, then paid down around 35% of that balance over the rest of the year. They figure this would account for roughly the entire $100 billion shortfall in C&I lending.

But Goldman's figures are very rough estimates, and others are skeptical. Paul Ashworth , an economist at research firm Capital Economics , says the oil-industry thesis doesn't explain why there was such a sudden deceleration starting in November. Moreover, he notes that lending has slowed across the board, not just in C&I but also in mortgages, consumer loans and commercial real estate. Strikingly, loans by U.S. branches of foreign banks have fallen by $85 billion since the end of October, and now account for $871 billion of loans outstanding.

Political uncertainty seems partly to blame. Consumers and businesses may express greater confidence since the election, but many might still hesitate to take out big-ticket loans to fund new projects until they have greater clarity on the outlook for tax, trade and health-care policy.

Such caution would only be rational. It also suggests the growth surge many investors are expecting may not materialize until the policy picture out of Washington becomes clearer.

WSJ Pro: Ukraine's Central Bank Governor Resigns

By James Marson

MOSCOW Ukrainian Central Bank Governor Valeria Gontareva submitted her resignation Monday, heralding the end of a nearly three-year tenure that helped Ukraine stave off a financial meltdown and clean up its notoriously murky banking system.

Ms. Gontareva will leave her post on May 10, according a statement posted on the National Bank of Ukraine 's website. She said she resigned as she felt her mission to turn the central bank into "a powerful modern institution" had been accomplished. Her resignation needs to be approved by Ukraine's parliament and President Petro Poroshenko , who will then select a new central bank chief.

Ms. Gontareva said that there would be no further changes to the central bank's board in the near future.

"Neither will there be changes in the central bank's policy," she told reporters, according to the statement. "Continuing the chosen path is the key to the success of our country and support of international partners."

Ms. Gontareva, 52 years old, took charge of the central bank in June 2014, with the country's coffers nearly empty after the corrupt previous President Viktor Yanukovych fled amid street protests, and separatists backed by Russia battling government forces in Ukraine's east. Ms. Gontareva, a former investment banker, introduced a flexible exchange rate for the country's currency, the hryvnia, and closed down around half of Ukraine's 180 banks, which for years had been run opaquely by rich tycoons.

Those successes helped stabilize the banking system and made Ms. Gontareva a rare bright spot for the Ukrainian government, which critics have accused of making slow progress on rapid overhauls to its economy and administration pledged after the 2014 revolution.

But it also provoked anger among some Ukrainians and populist politicians who blamed her for the sharp devaluation of the hryvnia and losses of deposits as the central bank closed down failing banks. Some protesters staged a mock funeral with a coffin outside the National Bank of Ukraine in March.

The International Monetary Fund , which Ukraine is relying on for financing, disbursed a further $1 billion last week as part of a $17.5 billion package, but warned that the government needed to accelerate structural and governance reforms to build a modern market economy.

SEC Targets Fraud on Stock Tip-Sheet Websites

By Chris Dieterich

That bullish stock tip you found on the Internet?

Turns out it might have been paid for by the company itself.

The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday announced fraud charges against a raft of publicly traded companies, executives, writers and promotion firms, alleging that hundreds of articles published on tip-sheet websites including Seeking Alpha touted stocks without properly disclosing that authors were compensated to write them.

Companies that pay writers or publicists to hype stocks must disclose this relationship.

The SEC alleges that former executives at public companies including small-cap companies ImmunoCellular Therapeutics and Galena Biopharma , paid promotions firms to commission bullish articles.

A spokeswoman for ImmunoCellular, which settled charges with the SEC, said that the matter related to an investigation into a former CEO and that the company "cooperated fully with the SEC and is looking forward to putting this matter behind us."

A spokesperson for Galena did not immediately return a call seeking comment.

None of the websites were charged. A spokesperson for Seeking Alpha said that it takes stock promotions "very seriously." The company said that it "documents all authors' claims to not having been compensated by third parties, and we maintain accurate records of all Seeking Alpha authors' real-life identities. We don't have the ability to investigate claims by the SEC or other regulators. However, we do cooperate with their inquiries, and our policies act as a strong deterrent against potential promotions."

The SEC alleges in its enforcement action that more than 250 articles, mostly written under pseudonyms, falsely stated that authors had not been compensated by the companies they were writing about.

Some 17 parties have settled the charges for sums ranging from $2,200 to $3 million, the SEC said, while litigation continues against 10 others.

"These companies, promoters, and writers allegedly misled investors by disguising paid promotions as objective and independent analyses," said Stephanie Avakian, acting director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement.

The SEC's orders, as well as a pair of complaints filed in federal district court, allege that deceptive measures were often used to mask the true sources of the articles from investors.

Articles were ghost-written under pseudonyms including The Swiss Trader, Trading Maven, Mel Daris, Chemistfrog and Amy Baldwin. The latter nom de plume came with a profile stating that the author was "employed by a Fortune 20 company" and "assessing risk management and the financial health of various companies," when in fact no person with those credentials was employed by the publicity firms.

The SEC, in conjunction with the charges, released an alert to investors warning that "articles on an investment research website that appear to be an unbiased source of information or provide commentary on multiple stocks may be part of an undisclosed paid stock promotion."

WSJ Pro Transcript: Q&A With New York Fed President William Dudley

William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, took audience questions after a speech Friday, April 7, 2017 in New York. He discussed the Fed's balance sheet, financial regulation, the economy and other topics. Here is a transcript of the exchange, lightly edited for length and clarity.

Q: (In progress) week the minutes came out, and I see you said very clearly you are going to run down the balance sheet. So can you talk a little bit about what's the thought process? Why is a big balance sheet a problem? Is a big balance sheet a problem because it's holding long rates down? And is the implicit message here that the (Federal Open Market Committee) would like to see long rates go up just a little bit?

WILLIAM C. DUDLEY : Well, first of all, we didn't say we would. We said we anticipate that we might be able to do it sometime  (laughter) if the economy follows in an appropriate fashion. So it was appropriately caveated. And we're still working on this. The FOMC has not made any formal decisions or announcements in terms of how this is all going to work.

I think, though, we have made, I think, clear in a number of ways how we are thinking about this. Number one, that we that the primary tool of monetary policy is short-term rates, not the balance sheet. And so that once we get to the point where we want to start to end the reinvestment process, we're probably going to do it in a way that's gradual and phased out. And, two, that once that process starts, the primary tool of monetary policy will be adjusting short-term interest rates, not the balance sheet; we don't see the balance sheet as an active tool of monetary policy.

So the question is, why might you want to, you know, allow the reinvestment to run off? Well, I think, you know, an obvious reason is that, you know, the Fed has a particularly large footprint now in the U.S. financial system, with $4  trillion of assets. That's one reason: maybe you don't want to have a footprint of that size. Number two, I think that you might want to have a Federal Reserve that actually has the capacity to potentially expand their balance sheet again in the future. If we ever have another, you know, bad, bad recession that pins monetary policy at the zero lower bound, you might want to have the ability to actually expand your balance sheet again to provide support to the economy. So I think there is you know, I think there's a number of reasons to think that this is sort of an appropriate part of the transition back to a to a more normal monetary policy regime.

Q: A follow-up question on the balance sheet question, actually that ties in more closely to financial regulation.

There's been, I believe from the (former Fed governor) Jeremy Stein publication suggesting that the balance sheet has a financial stability component, that a large balance sheet might mitigate the risk of maturity transformation; it might disincentivize excessive short-term financing. So to what extent does the Federal Reserve consider the balance sheet to be not only a monetary policy tool, but a macroprudential tool?

MR. DUDLEY: Yeah, I mean, Jeremy Stein 's done a lot of work on this issue of is there a shortage of sort of safe financial assets in the financial system, and could the Fed or others provide more safe assets and that would somehow reduce the risk for maturity transformation. I think and I think that's a you know, I think that's an issue that there's ongoing debate about: some people thinking that that's quite important, other people thinking that that's not as not as big a deal as maybe Jeremy what Jeremy sees.

Obviously, you know, the other way that you can obviate against the maturity transformation issue is you can have liquidity regulation. So we have the LCR. We have the NSFR, net stable funding ratio. So there's other ways of sort of mitigating some of that risk of maturity transformation.

I think, you know, in general, I mean, I think the you know, the decision that the that the Fed, I think, is going to make is I'm not sure that we're going to go back to a balance sheet as small as the one that we had prior to the crisis because that would imply that we'd be going back to a what's called a corridor system, with just a few amount of reserves in the system and the Federal Reserve having to intervene every day, adding and draining reserves to try and keep the federal-funds rate right at target.

I think there's a you know, speaking for myself, you know, I think I would I favor a system more like the current system, which is called a floor system, where you have sufficient amount of excess reserves in the system so that your interest rate control is really driven by the overnight RRP and the interest rate you pay on excess reserves. That way you don't have to do all this all this you know, a lot of gymnastics to keep the federal-funds rate close to your to your target. It also has the advantage, to your point, that there would be more safe assets in the system; but also probably actually also facilitate, you know, sort of just efficiency of payment flows because people would banks would have higher balances, and so you wouldn't have as, you know, much need for daylight overdrafts and other queuing of payments. So I think that my own view is I favor going back to a floor system.

Now, the question is, how big is that? We don't really know for sure exactly how many how much excess reserves you need to be able to just sit there and not have to intervene in the market to keep the federal-funds rate at your objective. But generally I think most people, you know, that have looked at it suggest that maybe you have excess reserves somewhere in the area of a  a trillion to a trillion dollars, something in that order of magnitude. That's a lot less than what we have currently.

So my view I mean, speaking for myself is that I would expect that if the economy cooperates that we will begin to normalize our balance sheet starting sometime late this year or next year, and it will be a very gradual process, and we'll get to a much smaller balance sheet. But not as small as where we were prior to the crisis, when it was really just currency.

Q: Hearing the early objectives, they're trying to stop expansion of Dodd-Frank, or whatever, to stop a real tragedy from occurring. When we get all through the regulations revived year by year, what responsibility is laid on bank management not to pursue bad loans, the things which caused this? Does this have to be done by regulation, or can it be done by some understanding bank managements have a responsibility?

MR. DUDLEY: Well, of course bank managements have a responsibility to run their banks well. I mean, absolutely. I mean, do you think it's really feasible for the Federal Reserve or any regulator to have to run, you know, an organization with hundreds of thousands of employees and be able to see into every nook and cranny?

That's why we put so much emphasis on things like, you know, good technology, good risk management, good governance. Those are things that we can assess, and then it's on the bank to make sure that they actually carry those things out.

But it's absolutely on the on the banks. And I would hope that the bank shareholders would care and the board of directors would care deeply about the safety and soundness of their institutions.

Q: Actually, two questions. Just if you could comment on the apparent gap between some of on the economy, if you could comment on the apparent gap between some of the soft data, which paints a very robust picture; and some of the hard data, which appears to paint a less-robust picture. The New York Fed is sort of in the robust camp. And so which one is going to converge to which one, which way? Is the 

MR. DUDLEY: You tell me. (Laughter.)

Q: And, you know, so that's the first question.

And then just on the on the balance sheet, just the sort of trade-offs between the front end and the long end. And are they are they fungible, or how do you think about the trade-offs between the front end and the long end in terms of you know, is deferring or delaying, as you've recently said, pausing perhaps, you know, a rate hike to give room to let the balance sheet off, a pause for how long relative to just the relationship and how you think about 

MR. DUDLEY: Well, let me take that one first because I think some people misconstrued what I said last week. I said a "little pause." I didn't a pause is pretty short already, and I think a little pause is even shorter than that. (Laughs.) I mean, the idea is basically when you make the decision that you're going to start to normalize your balance sheet, that should have some consequence for long-term yields, so that should tighten financial conditions. Similarly, when you make the decision to raise short-term interest rates, that should also tighten financial conditions. So presumably you at the time that you make the decision on the balance sheet, you might want to forgo the decision on short-term rates just to make sure that the balance-sheet decision doesn't turn out to be a bigger decision than you thought you were making. So I would emphasize the words "little pause."

The question of short versus hard data, you know, I think you just raised what's a, you know, interesting conundrum right now, where the soft data is, you know, pretty weak. I mean, if you look at people's projections of first-quarter (gross domestic product growth), I think most of the consensus forecasts I've seen out there suggest that it's sort of in the 1 , maybe even a little weaker 1 to 1  %. If you look at things, though, that include that soft data, like the New York Fed 's Nowcast, which we include everything that sort of weighs on our ability to forecast GDP it's quite a bit firmer than that. I don't know where it is today. We release it on Friday, so when I get home I'll take a look at that. I think last week, though, I think it was at 2.8 %, I believe. So that's there is a gap. You know, I just don't think we know yet.

Another aspect of this that makes it a little more difficult is it looks like we have a seasonal adjustment problem with first-quarter GDP. You know, every year for the last few years, first-quarter GDP has come in unusually weak relative to the other quarters. So, you know, even if we get something that looks like 1 % in the first quarter, it might be actually more like 2 % in reality. So I don't know how it's going to be resolved. I'm interested as interested in seeing the movie as you are.

The Fiduciary Rule Is Delayed. So Now What?

By Lisa Beilfuss

In delaying Monday's initial compliance deadline for a new retirement-savings rule, the Trump administration has given the financial-services industry a breather and some clues into how the regulation might change.

But investors and advisers will have to wait at least until year's end for clarity on whether the fiduciary rule which aims to ensure that retirement savers get conflict-free advice ultimately stays, goes or gets revised.

The delay in the fiduciary rule's applicability date to June 9, made official Friday, gives the Labor Department more time to execute an order from President Donald Trump to re-evaluate the rule's potential economic impact on firms and consumers. It also gives a bit of a reprieve to parts of the industry that have stood to be most affected and have struggled to come into compliance.

While the regulation's fate remains uncertain, some experts say the Labor Department's approach to the delay suggests the fiduciary rule will be revised rather than rescinded. Rob Cirrotti, head of retirement and investment solutions at Pershing LLC , a division of Bank of New York Mellon Corp . , said the delay notice signals that "certain elements are here to stay" and some others may be watered down or revised out.

Here are a few things to know about the postponement:

What exactly is delayed and for how long?

The postponement isn't as straightforward as many observers expected, Mr. Cirrotti said. The Labor Department essentially announced a two-part delay.

On June 9, presuming there is no further delay, the heart of the rule kicks in. "Retirement investors will be entitled to advice that adheres to basic fiduciary standards," a Labor Department spokesman said, meaning brokers and insurance agents must work in clients' best interest.

That's the spirit of the rule and it isn't going away, Mr. Cirrotti said. Before the fiduciary rule, such advice givers have had to meet a lower bar of suitability that allowed them to sell higher-cost products so long as they were suitable to the investor's risk profile.

Other elements of the regulation have been pushed out until Jan. 1, 2018. Those include some of the communications advisers would need to provide clients, such as conflict-of-interest disclosures required for certain transactions.

Also delayed through year's end: A stricter exemption that would apply to sellers of variable and fixed-index annuities, which typically generate commissions. The fiduciary rule as originally written requires sellers of those annuities to meet a higher bar if they want to be exempt from the regulation and sell them to retirement savers. The Labor Department said the new, more onerous exemption won't kick in until January.

Why kick certain elements out to January?

Experts say that 60 days isn't enough time to conduct a review that is consistent with Mr. Trump's directive, which ordered the Labor Department to review the rule with a focus on potential effects on consumer costs, litigation and industry disruption. At the same time, the Labor Department couldn't get a longer delay approved by the gatekeeper of such delays the Office of Management and Budget because of the resulting costs to investors and the industry.

The department said it wanted to "avoid the possibility of investor confusion and needless or excessive expense as firms build systems and compliance structures that may ultimately be unnecessary or mismatched with the Department's final decisions on the issues raised by the Presidential Memorandum."

What clues can be gleaned about the rule's fate?

Mr. Cirrotti said the elements kicked out to January, particularly around client communications and the new exemption for annuities, are where the landscape is most likely to change.

That could mean brokers and insurance agents won't be made to provide all of the disclosures around conflicts that the rule originally required, potentially making the compliance less onerous but also keeping investors in the dark about conflicts that can come about when a broker or agent earns commissions.

Most amendments to a pre-existing exemption that applied to sales of variable and fixed-indexed annuities, which typically generate commissions, have been delayed through year's end. The fiduciary rule as originally written required sellers of those annuities to meet the conditions of the new Best Interest Contract Exemption in order to sell those products to retirement savers. Before being amended, the pre-existing exemption allowed advisers and insurance agents to receive commissions and fees, under conditions that required, in part, that the fees and commissions are "reasonable," for the sale of products like annuity contracts and mutual funds shares.

The new exemption, called the Best Interest Contract Exemption, also allows commissions to still be earned. But to do so, sellers have to disclose their commission and commit to working in the client's best interest. The conditions of this exemption (except for the impartial conduct standards that include a commitment to working in the clients' best interests) won't kick in until January.

Will there be further delays?

It's possible.

In its delay notice, the Labor Department said "if, after receiving comments on the issues raised by the President's Memorandum, the Department concludes that significant changes are necessary or that it needs more time to complete its review, it retains the ability to further extend the Jan. 1, 2018 applicability dates or to grant additional interim relief."

Will commentary from consumers and industry affect the rule's outcome?

The Labor Department said it "continues to receive a very high volume of comment and petition letters on a daily basis." The Labor Department recently reopened the comment period, seeking feedback on two counts. It opened the window for 15 days specifically to generate comments on the delay, and it opened another window for 45 days during which consumers and the industry could voice opinions on the issues raised by Mr. Trump's memo.

The department reported 193,000 comments and petitions as of March 17, when the first comment period closed At that point, comments expressing opposition to a delay outnumbered comments in favor of a delay by 12 to 1.

The second comment period covering the broader issues raised by the president is open until April 17.

"Comments on the rulemaking process are always taken seriously," the Labor Department spokesman said. He said that during the six-plus years that the project has been active, "there have been several rounds of public comment which resulted in numerous changes to the rule and exemptions."

WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup

Proposed Mexican Fintech Law Would Lift Banks, Startups

A law drafted by the office of Mexico's Secretary of Finance and Public Credit that would put the country's growing financial technology industry under the authority of the country's banking and securities regulator would help lenders and fintech firms grow, Fitch says. A draft of the law released late last month shows it would apply to crowdfunding platforms, companies that deal with virtual currencies such as bitcoin and online payment services, and would require all fintech firms to register with the regulator in order to help root out money laundering and disclose their methodologies for assessing consumer risk. "Mexico has significant growth opportunities for fintech considering the country's large size, high rate of penetration of mobile phones and internet and substantial unbanked population," Fitch says, noting 150-180 fintech companies have sprung up in Mexico in recent years.

China Regulator Asks Banks to Step up Risks Control

China's banking regulator warns banks against rising risks and has vowed to inspect their risk-control measures. Banks must strengthen their efforts to prevent risks related to liquidity, wealth management products, real estate and bond markets as well as local government debt, among others, the China Banking Regulatory Commission says in a guideline issued Monday.

Breaking Down Stumpf's Additional $28M Clawback

Wells Fargo (WFC) Chairman Stephen Sanger gave more detail on former chairman and CEO John Stumpf 's most recent clawback as a result of the board's investigation. The $28M in additional clawbacks represents a performance share grant he received in March 2016 covering 2013-16. "The board elected to claw that back based on their belief that they would not have paid that performance share grant had we know at that time of the reputational damage that Wells Fargo was about to sustain from the sales practices issue," Sanger said on a call with media. He said Stumpf doesn't necessarily need to write a check. Instead, it will be "captured" through Stumpf's supplemental retirement plan. Stumpf has to forfeit a total of $69M as a result of the bank's sales practices scandal. (emily.glazer@wsj.com; @EmilyGlazerWSJ)

Australia Mortgage Rules to Help Mitigate Risks, Moody's Says

Australian banks' exposure to the property market is yet another source of sovereign risk for the country, although the lenders' strong capitalization and generally high financial strength significantly reduces the risk of a banking crisis and any related costs to the government, Moody's says. It expects household debt will continue to rise from already elevated levels, as low interest rates and expectations of ongoing gains in home prices encourage purchases. Still, demand should be tempered somewhat by fresh regulation to cool investor demand and capping banks' interest-only mortgage lending, helping mitigate housing market risks, Moody's says.

A Breakdown of the Pay Wells Fargo Is Taking Back From Executives

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-claws-back-75-million-more-from-john-stumpf-and-former-retail-bank-head-1491823808" to claw back an additional $28 million of incentive compensation paid to former Chief Executive John Stumpf in March 2016 under an equity grant made in 2013. In September, it announced $41 million in clawbacks from Mr. Stumpf. Chairman Stephen Sanger said the bank can "capture" that amount from Mr. Stumpf through his supplemental retirement plan expected to pay out in coming months.

The board is also clawing back former retail bank leader Carrie Tolstedt 's outstanding stock options valued at about $47.3 million, following $19 million in earlier clawback activity. That brings the total the bank is taking back to $183 million, according to the board, marking one of the largest company clawbacks in recent history.

Regulators Likely to Benefit From Fintech Methods

Financial regulators are likely the next group to leverage analytical methods pioneered by fintech firms, according to a "https://www.carlyle.com/sites/default/files/market_commentary/Market published by private-equity firm Carlyle Group . Regulators have been slow to exploit advances that helped fintech startups challenge traditional banks and securities firms, according to Brian T. Schreiber and Jason M. Thomas . Between 2009 and 2015, banks paid more than $150 billion in penalties to authorities; during that time, implementation of the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act added more than 5,000 restrictions on the industry, raising its regulatory burden by a third, according to the paper. Regulators need to keep track of the impact of these rules, as well as others. The supervisory toolkit should include data feeds that provide regulators with an on-demand view of trends and risks, the paper's authors write. The argument recalls efforts by the Securities and Exchange Commission to build a real-time data warehouse of all quotes and trades in the stock market, which should be operational by 2018.

Banks' Confidence About Deregulation Might Be Premature

Banks are on a hiring spree, and a lot of the job growth is coming from states other than New York, including Illinois, Texas and Ohio. That indicates President Donald Trump 's promises to deregulate are being taken seriously by the financial-services sector, "https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-04-07/banks-hire-like-they-believe-in-trump". It's true that banks might have other reasons to add jobs, including growing profitability, he says. Meanwhile, Mr. Trump hasn't done much to act on his words, and getting Congress to revamp the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act will be a tough task. "So to the extent that financial companies are getting excited about deregulation, their enthusiasm might be premature," Mr. Whitehouse concludes.

Fed Needs Fewer Academics, More Businesspeople

The Federal Reserve should "increase the intellectual diversity" of its board of governors by hiring fewer academics and more "candidates with real-world business experience," "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-fed-could-use-less-book-learning-and-more-street-smarts-1491864871". Mr. Ricketts, founder of financial-services company TD Ameritrade and President Donald Trump 's nominee to be deputy secretary of the Commerce Department, says, "Intellect is important, but it's not enough. Practical knowledge, experience and wisdom are needed to produce good policy, and good policy is essential for our free-market economy to prosper."

"http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2017/04/10/an-unusual-pattern-is-taking-hold-in-the-junk-bond-market/" sold by U.S. companies is showing a never-seen-before pattern, one sign of how expensive that corner of the market has become.

The quickening evolution of trading   in charts

The evolution of financial markets is quickening thanks to the rise of automated trading algorithms, which range from the relatively simple, such as exchange traded funds, to artificial-intelligence powered hedge funds. Here is a selection of charts showing some aspects of how investing and markets have changed in recent years.

The most apparent shift is in the world of investing, where traditional active managers have suffered big outflows in favour of cheaper, passive investment vehicles such as ETFs and index-tracking funds. Vanguard alone, with $4tn of assets under management, dwarfs the entire hedge fund industry. And as this chart from Citi shows, passive investment inflows are accelerating.

Here is another chart from Citi that shows the state of play. Passive funds now make up a big chunk of overall assets under management in Asian and US equities, and a smaller   but rising   proportion in areas such as US bonds.

In addition to the usual arguments for passive funds, such as their cheapness, Citi strategist Robert Buckland says that the  paradox of skill  means it is getting harder for fund managers to beat their benchmarks.

He points out that the number of chartered financial analysts relative to the number of listed companies has exploded over the past two decades.  That s a lot of well-trained buyside and sellside analysts for every stock. No wonder it s got so tough to beat the market,  he says.

Things look a little brighter in the world of quantitative investing. The growing view that the future of active investing will not be human fund managers judging a company by the firmness of the chief executive s handshake but computer scientists tinkering with trading algorithms has led to an explosion of job postings for financial engineers, while demand for more traditional analysts has stagnated, as this Bank of America Merrill Lynch chart shows.

The number of investment factors used by investment groups has swelled since the financial crisis, as financial scientists unearth more and more tradable signals from big data, such as credit card transactions, app downloads and even satellite imagery.

High-octane, algorithmic trading is also ascendant, with high-frequency trading volumes picking up from the post-crisis drop-off. Meanwhile, the volume of trading done by traditional active asset managers has flatlined, even as the share of trading done by passive investment vehicles has grown, as this Credit Suisse chart shows.

This is affecting the structure of the stock market, with the most actively traded stocks becoming even more liquid, while smaller stocks are becoming more expensive to trade. Flash crashes are becoming more common, with algorithms making, cancelling and adjusting quotes at a fast pace. Here is another Credit Suisse chart that shows how many quote changes are made per million of shares traded.

The rise of ETFs is also reshaping the trading day. Passive investment funds typically try to do most of their trading at the end of the day so that their holdings best match their benchmark, which has herded ever more trading activity in the last half-hour of the day, as this chart of the Russell 2000 small companies gauge shows. The pattern is what analysts call a  liquidity smile .

It is important to remember that despite the roaring inflows into ETFs and quant funds, we are still only at the early stages of this investment revolution, with the vast majority of money still managed traditionally by human fund managers. There will undoubtedly be some potholes along the way, but markets are increasingly going to be shaped by machines rather than man.

Kenya's Tech Hub Gets a Makeover; 'Silicon Savannah' is refocusing on profit and revenues, going beyond social activism

Corrections & Amplifications

Disrupt Africa data show that the average funding secured by a Kenyan startup in 2016 was $402,469. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said it was $10,500. Funding for African internet and technology hubs in 2015 and 2016 totaled in the millions of dollars. A chart that accompanied an earlier version of this article incorrectly gave those sums in the billions of dollars. (April 11, 2017) 

NAIROBI, Kenya After a decade of buzz that brought bold headlines but few profits, Kenya's "Silicon Savannah" technology hub is retooling to put income before activism.

A homegrown African tech community is rising in this city: bootstrapped but profitable businesses using technology and the internet to solve commercial problems connecting the biggest names in tech and finance.

International Business Machines Corp. is training hundreds of Kenyan coders in Nairobi each year; Visa and Mastercard are turning to Kenyan fintech companies to crack the local market.

Last month, Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google started a strategic alliance with the iHub, an incubator and co-working space at the heart of Kenya's tech scene, to reach and train app developers there. The Silicon Valley companies will tap local talent for coding and product development; they also will train Kenyans in artificial intelligence, cloud computing and machine learning reinforcing the region's role as the center for technology in Africa.

"It is true we had some companies that were more excited about headlines and about what new widget would solve the problems of the world," said Patrick Njoroge, Kenya's Central Bank governor, in an interview last month. "What we've been pushing is for companies to focus on a particular problem. It's more sustainable."

Since the late 2000s, the startup community in this sprawling East African city welcomed top U.S. and European graduates, who were lured by adventurous opportunities and millions of dollars in no-strings-attached grants from Western donors. Newspapers queued up to profile startups using technology to spur African development in sectors as diverse as farming and transportation. Luminaries including former U.S. President Barack Obama and Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg visited the hub to trumpet its potential.

But beyond the buzz, few companies turned a profit and many died a quiet death, investors say. Funding has plummeted, with the total raised by Kenyan startups falling to $10.5 million last year from $47 million in 2015, according to data-collection platform Disrupt Africa.

Now, in the wake of the bubble, a less flashy but more successful model is emerging for startups in Silicon Savannah.

The iHub in Nairobi began as a social movement in 2010 and is now transforming itself into a for-profit company that collaborates with the likes of Facebook, Google and Microsoft Corp. The U.S. companies will use the iHub as a center for their training and talent-spotting. The recognition caps a long journey for the incubator founded by the group of activists behind Ushahidi, a platform created during widespread violence after elections in 2007 and 2008 that cost thousands of lives across the country. Ushahidi collected testimonies, used phones to record incidents and geo-located them using Google Maps.

Both Ushahidi and the iHub were largely funded by grants from foundations such as the Omidyar Network, the philanthropic fund owned by Pierre Omidyar, founder of online auction company eBay Inc. For the iHub, the model became increasingly unsustainable last year as it faced cash-flow problems, said its former chief executive, Kamal Bhattacharya, who took it over after a career at IBM and became chairman of the iHub board this month.

The incubator last year received $2 million in funding from Invested Development, a U.S.-based fund, that allowed the company to reorient its business. Mr. Bhattacharya raised prices for services and added multimonth contracts to the firm's revenue stream. The company has posted $1.5 million in annual revenue on average for the past three years.

Data collection remains patchy in Kenya, but the iHub reckons more than 100 startups have used its services over the past seven years, and more than 1,000 people have worked at startups during the same time. It now employs about 30 people full-time and has handled more than 50 projects in the past 12 months.

Kenya last year was the second-biggest technology hub in Africa in terms of the number of startups that secured funding, trailing only South Africa. But the average amount raised per startup last year declined 85% compared with the previous year, Disrupt Africa data show, from $2.6 million in 2015 to just $402,469 in 2016, relegating it to sixth place by this criterion behind Nigeria, Ghana, Egypt, Morocco and South Africa.

One fundamental change here is the type of investor attracted to Kenyan tech businesses. Angel investors often themselves successful businesspeople or returned from the Kenyan diaspora private equity and specialized technology funds are becoming more involved, just as Western donor agencies and charitable foundations are becoming less active, according to investors and technology entrepreneurs.

"The Peace Corps volunteers of the past came back to Kenya as impact-tech investors," says Agosta Liko, founder of the profitable fintech company PesaPal, in describing Kenya's tech scene during the initial years.

Mr. Liko, who avoided taking donor grants for his business that helps people pay for anything online using mobile money or credit cards, is hopeful that experienced entrepreneurs and homegrown startups will have more of a role.

"Many of us have been working hard and quietly for many years," Mr. Liko said. "The most important thing is that a number of Kenyan technology businesspeople are now becoming mentors and angel investors for new startups here."

Greece Plus Malls Equals Risk for One Property Investor; U.S. private-equity firm Vrde Partners takes stake in two Greek shopping malls

As risky bets go, Greece ranks right up there. When you add shopping malls to the mix, only the hardiest investors need apply.

That is the wager that U.S. private-equity firm Vrde Partners LP made last week when it paid  61.3 million ($65 million) for a stake in two of Greece's biggest shopping malls.

The deal stands out because there have been few commercial real-estate transactions over the last eight years in Greece, once the epicenter of Europe's financial crisis. Of the  255 billion ($270 billion) of commercial property traded in Europe last year, only $650 million of deals took place in Greece, mainly in the hotel sector, according to real-estate research firm Real Capital Analytics.

"There are some big question marks hanging over Greece," said Walter Boettcher, director of research at Colliers International, a real-estate broker.

At the same time, the rise of online shopping and changing consumer preferences around the world have led to massive retail bankruptcies and store closures in the U.S., the U.K. and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-glut-of-mall-space-echoes-in-india-1434473696".

Yet Minneapolis-based Vrde, a value investor on the hunt for discounted assets, sees opportunity.

"The risk is about the politics," said Tim Mooney, global co-head of real estate at Vrde. "The gutsy part of the trade is not at the asset level."

The Greek economy has only started to recover after shrinking by more than 25% during the financial crisis. The government is finalizing details of a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/greece-creditors-move-closer-to-deal-on-bailout-1491554583" with creditors to keep its economic bailout program going. A final agreement will pave the way for talks between European creditors led by Germany and the International Monetary Fund on debt relief.

Prolonged bailout negotiations revived uncertainty in Greece. The country's economy shrank faster than expected in the last quarter of the year, and while the Greek government expects growth to clock in at 2.7% this year, several economists believe it will be more modest.

Vrde paid the  61.3 million for a 31.7% stake in Lamda Malls SA, a unit recently spun out of Lamda Development SA, one of Greece's biggest real-estate companies. Lamda has two assets: Golden Hall in Athens, and Mediterranean Cosmos in Thessaloniki, a major city in the north of the country.

Even at the worst point of Greece's recession, occupancy at Lamda Malls never fell below 96%, "and you had no significant decline in tenant sales," said Anthony Iannazzo, a managing director at Vrde.

"It is rare as a value investor that you have the opportunity to observe how an asset will perform under a Great Depression-level economic crisis, but that is exactly the case here," he said.

While malls in the U.S., U.K. and elsewhere have suffered from "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mall-landlords-lure-medical-providers-as-retailers-bolt-1490698804", the Greeks have been slower to change. Last year, less than 70% of Greeks used the internet, while around 35% made a purchase online, according to a report from Deutsche Asset Management. Both figures put Greece with having among the lowest internet penetration in Europe.

Shopping malls like Golden Hall, with air conditioning, restaurants and play areas for children, are also not as common in Greece as they are in the U.S. or other parts of Europe, giving Vrde confidence it will remain a popular shopping destination, Mr. Mooney said.

The potential returns also were attractive to Vrde. Because the Greek property market is so illiquid, nailing down an average yield in Greece is difficult, analysts said.

"You're not getting paid yields that you would see in Ukraine. But you're getting paid more than Romania or Turkey," said Mr. Iannazzo at Vrde, which manages $12 billion of assets.

This isn't new ground for Vrde, which aims to buy assets or take control of companies at a discount to their potential value and then list them on a stock exchange or sell them.

The firm in 2011 bought U.K. home builder Crest Nicholson Holdings PLC, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2013.

Vrde in March bought Spanish housing developer Va Clere for  90 million. The company will be merged with a Spanish developer it already owns, and is being considered for an initial public offering or sale, Mr. Mooney said.

Last year, Vrde bought a stake in Trastor, a Greek real-estate investment trust, from Greece's largest lender Piraeus Bank. It now owns 54% of the group, which is focused on office and retail sectors.

"We like housing in Spain. We like retail in Greece," Mr. Mooney said. "As a value investor, we think it's the right time."

Lenders Tighten The Spigots on Mall Landlords; With foot traffic on the wane, retail property owners face more financing hurdles

The retail malaise hasn't stopped shopping-center landlords from getting loans it's just getting harder.

With an oversupply of malls, changing consumer habits and increasing competition from e-commerce, property owners frequently have to spruce up their assets to make them trendier and draw more foot traffic. 

But the process of getting the financing for this reinvestment has gotten more complicated, said analysts, lenders and landlords. Lenders now grill landlords repeatedly about tenants' creditworthiness and exposure to competition from neighboring developments and e-commerce. On top of that, borrowers may have to pay higher interest rates than they are used to, as the perception of risk increases and the Federal Reserve boosts short-term interest rates.

"There is a sea change in attitudes over the last eight months," said Joseph Miller, co-founder of Runyon Group, a real-estate company with offices in Los Angeles and New York. "Everyone is more cautious."

A broad swath of banks, private-equity funds and insurance companies "have a risk-off approach and are more selective," he said.

Loan terms have become more conservative. The average size of a retail real-estate loan was $8.3 million in 2016, down from $12.2 million in 2015, according to data from Real Capital Analytics. The average loan-to-value ratio fell to 66% in 2016 from 70% in 2015, while the average occupancy rate of the underlying properties rose to 98% in 2016 from 92% in 2015.

A steady drumbeat of store closures is escalating concerns about the"https://www.wsj.com/articles/mall-owners-rush-to-get-out-of-the-mall-business-1485262801", especially lower-tier malls and strip centers. Major retailers such as Macy's Inc., Sears Holdings and JC Penney Co. have said in recent months they plan to close as many as 290 stores, while Payless ShoeSource Inc. last week "https://www.wsj.com/articles/shoe-retailer-payless-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-1491336337"and said it would close 400 stores.

Real-estate executives and financiers said it is more difficult these days to value shopping centers amid the shift in shopping habits.

"Lenders are more forward-looking this time, and question what the property is going to look like five years from now," said Eric Wolf, managing director at Katz Properties LLC, a property investment, development and management firm. "There is more face time with lenders, and you go over things, and go over again," said Mr. Wolf, whose firm owns 27 shopping centers in the U.S.

Mall values can drop more sharply than residential and office properties if anchor tenants close and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/malls-woes-hurt-victorias-secret-bath-body-works-1487870850". JC Penney and Macy's closed stores at Hudson Valley Mall in Kingston, N.Y., in 2015 and 2016, respectively, and the value of the mall plummeted 90%. The mall was valued at $87 million in 2010. Last December, Kroll Bond Rating Agency said it was worth $8.1 million.

Not all malls are struggling. Some better-quality properties in affluent coastal cities with a steady stream of tourists continue to boost rents. Larger mall operators still make hefty investments in their best properties to keep them competitive.

"The stronger centers are getting stronger and the weaker centers are getting weaker," said Bill O'Connor, chief executive of O'Connor Capital Partners, a real-estate investment and development firm. "All this is happening faster than the previous cycles. It's a game of musical chairs when the music stops, you'll find out who has a seat."

But capital for retail real estate isn't drying up. In addition to banks, insurance companies also are extending loans to real estate owners, and private equity and hedge funds are on the lookout for deals for their debt funds.

Mr. Miller's Runyon Group recently secured a $47 million, 10-year securitized loan from Wells Fargo & Co. to refinance a mixed-use, open-air retail and office property in Los Angeles. It started negotiations in October, and over the next two months the 10-year Treasury rate jumped to 2.5% from 1.6%.

"Generally in two to three years, interest rates will be higher," said Mr. Miller. "We're stress-testing our business plans to be successful in an environment like that."

Why Cash Keeps Hanging On

How many $100 bills do you keep? Probably not 35. That's the average number outstanding for every person in the U.S., up from 23 in 2010.

Yet the amount of cash Americans keep at home and in their wallets, on average, "https://www.bostonfed.org/publications/survey-of-consumer-payment-choice.aspx", the lowest level since 2009 and barely enough to explain more than 5% of outstanding U.S. currency.

Businesses have been keeping less, too, as customers use cards and increasingly digital-payment platforms. Transactions processed by Venmo, the peer-to-peer mobile-payment platform owned by PayPal Holdings Inc ., reached about $20 billion last year, roughly tripling from 2015.

This is the paradox of cash: Even as people use it less, central banks are printing more of it. From the U.S. and the euro area to Japan and Australia, the value of currency in circulation has reached the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cash-is-dead-long-live-cash-1491735609" as a share of economic activity. In the U.S., cash as a share of gross domestic product has risen to more than 7.5%, the highest level in over 50 years.

Concerned the cash boom is driven by international crime, some governments have started to prune their denominations, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/india-to-phase-out-current-500-and-1000-rupee-bank-notes-1478619693". Some central bankers and economists also see the removal of cash as an opportunity to set interest rates below zero people currently have the option of storing their assets in zero-yielding bank notes.

Harvard University economist Ken Rogoff's new book "The Curse of Cash" argues removing $100 and $50 bills would make the tax-avoiding (and huge) cash economy harder to sustain, boosting tax revenues. "The government's ability to trace transactions through credit cards and bank accounts has gotten better and better," Mr. Rogoff said in an interview. Even a 10% reduction in tax evasion, which the Internal Revenue Service puts at around $500 billion a year, would bring in more than enough extra revenue to make up for the loss of seigniorage, he reckons. Seigniorage is the profit that countries make from printing money and declaring it legal tender: It costs just 14.3 cents to make a $100 bill, the Federal Reserve estimates.

Paradox or not, removing cash will be difficult. Rising interest rates are already blunting the argument against cash on policy grounds. Pruning cash doesn't necessarily stymie crime, either. In Sweden, for instance, the value of bills and coins in circulation has fallen by 25% since 2009 as Swedes flock to electronic-payment platforms. "Three of our biggest banks have stopped offering cash-handling services in most of their branches," said Alexander Ekbom, a Stockholm-based bank analyst.

Yet Sweden's shadow economy in 2014 was still larger than Germany's and Austria's, where cash usage is far more prevalent, according to recent analysis by Deutsche Bank AG economist Heike Mai. "Cash payments have become rare but the country still has a midsized shadow economy," she said, highlighting official statistics that show growth in card fraud and money laundering.

The biggest obstacle, however, could be voters' affection for cash and suspicion of big government. "Imagine the outrage at an attempt to take away people's money and enforce negative interest rates, at a rate that matters, like 5%," said John Cochrane, a free-market economics professor at Stanford University.

"Next thing, they'll be putting the numbers in our bodies," joked Mr. Ekbom, referring to the 10-digit numbers used by Swedish authorities and banks to identify people.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Barclays CEO Is Probed Over Bid to Unmask Whistleblower

By Max Colchester

LONDON U.K. regulators have begun an investigation into Barclays PLC Chief Executive Jes Staley over his attempts to unmask a whistleblower who raised questions about one of the bank's top hires.

The U.K.'s Prudential Regulation Authority and Financial Conduct Authority are probing both Mr. Staley and the bank over its treatment of whistleblowers after Mr. Staley tried to identify the source of an anonymous letter that criticized the new hire and Mr. Staley's previous dealings with him, Barclays said in a statement Monday. The bank added that it had issued a formal reprimand to Mr. Staley and would make a "significant" cut to his bonus. It is also conducting its own review into Barclays 's controls.

The hire in question was Tim Main, who was brought in from Evercore Partners to run Barclays 's financial institutions group, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Main had previously worked with Mr. Staley at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co . He declined to comment.

"I have apologized to the Barclays board, and accepted its conclusion that my personal actions in this matter were errors on my part," Mr. Staley said in a statement.

In June 2016, Barclays 's board and a senior executive received anonymous letters raising "concerns of a personal nature" about Mr. Main, as well as Mr. Staley's "knowledge of and role in dealing with those issues at a previous employer," the bank said. Mr. Staley initially asked Barclays 's internal security team to try to identify the authors of the letters, believing them to be an "unfair personal attack," the bank said. He was told that it wasn't appropriate to do so. But in July he followed up on the request, and the security team asked a U.S. law-enforcement agency to try to help. The whistleblower's identity was never revealed, the bank says.

A Barclays employee flagged the matter to the bank's board in early 2017. The board then commissioned its own probe and shared its findings with the U.K. regulators. Barclays said an internal investigation into Mr. Staley's actions concluded that he honestly, but mistakenly, believed that it was permissible to identify the author of the letter.

The probe is expected to take several months, according to people familiar with the matter. Punishments could range from a verbal warning to Mr. Staley's being barred from undertaking regulated activity, a step that would prevent him from remaining CEO. Barclays 's board will await the regulators' findings before docking a chunk of his 2017 bonus. Last year, Mr. Staley was paid 4.2 million ($5.2 million).

The issue is another stumble for Barclays as it tries to overhaul its image after years of scandals. Mr. Staley has trumpeted the bank's values and brought in executives to upgrade its controls. "This latest revelation represents a very significant embarrassment for the board as it tries to rebuild the group's reputation," said Gary Greenwood, an analyst at Shore Capital.

Since his arrival in late 2015, Mr. Staley has refreshed the bank's management team, bringing in a series of new executives. Many of them were from his alma mater, J.P. Morgan . He has replaced the bank's chief risk officer, chief operating officer and the head of the lender's investment bank. Some within Barclays have grumbled that Mr. Staley wasn't giving insiders a fair chance and was leaning too heavily on J.P. Morgan , where he spent over three decades, holding a portfolio of roles including running its investment bank.

Mr. Staley left J.P. Morgan in 2013 after a management reshuffle. He joined BlueMountain Capital, a hedge fund that had profited a year earlier from the "London whale" debacle, which left J.P. Morgan with more than $6 billion in losses.

Barclays investors have warmed to Mr. Staley's plan to reinforce Barclays 's investment banking franchise and refocus the lender on its U.S. and U.K. operations. The bank's share price has risen 43% this year.

Barclays Chairman John McFarlane said in a statement that he is "personally very disappointed" in Mr. Staley, but the board nonetheless said it supports his reappointment at the bank's annual shareholder meeting next month.

How Goldman Sachs Made More Than $1 Billion With Your Credit Score

By Liz Hoffman and AnnaMaria Andriotis

Goldman Sachs Group Inc . has backed skyscrapers and movie studios. But its big winner lately is a once-sleepy credit bureau.

Goldman bought TransUnion, the smallest of the three main credit-reporting firms, in 2012. By the time it went public three years later, TransUnion had become a data-mining machine, gathering billions of seemingly insignificant tidbits about ordinary Americans that it analyzed and sold to lenders, insurers and others.

Goldman has already pocketed nearly $600 million in profit and is expected to make about five times its initial $550 million investment.

The windfall shows the benefit of Goldman's decision to stick with private-equity investing after the financial crisis. Most big banks exited this activity as regulation stiffened. But Goldman, which has merchant banking deep in its DNA, stayed put and is even raising a new fund, its first since 2007, to buy companies.

Despite some  duds Goldman  backed a Texas utility  that later went bankrupt  in one of the biggest buyout flops of all time private-equity investing has been a moneymaker in recent years. Goldman has invested in a Japanese theme park, a U.S. network of home contractors and a Danish outsourcing company.

The Volcker rule, enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul  in 2010,  prevented banks from contributing more than 3% of the money raised by private-equity funds. Goldman adapted by doing deals directly from its balance sheet, rather than from a fund where its own money was mixed with investors. Doing deals this way complied with the letter, if not the spirit, of the Volcker rule, though it also limited Goldman to making mostly minority investments rather than the splashy takeovers it once pursued.

Goldman also raised new credit and real-estate funds, where there are more bargains to be found than in a red-hot stock market.

As the Trump administration weighs rolling back parts of Dodd-Frank, many expect the Volcker rule to be high on its list.

Goldman's new fund, which has already raised $4.5 billion and is expected to close later this year closer to its cap of $8 billion, includes just a sliver of Goldman's own money. It recasts the bank more like a plain-vanilla asset manager, investing other people's money and making its own profits largely on fees.

Goldman over the past months sold 20% of its stake as TransUnion shares reached records, climbing 24% so far this year, regulatory filings show. Taking into account stock sales and dividends, Goldman has so far pocketed nearly $600 million in profit and still owns a 25% stake in TransUnion valued at $1.7 billion.

The firm also has earned some $50 million in fees for underwriting TransUnion's IPO and raising debt for the company a unique perk for banks that have buyout arms.

TransUnion's contribution to the Wall Street firm extends beyond investment gains. Goldman's new consumer-lending platform, Marcus, was developed inside its private-equity arm by many of the same people who spearheaded the TransUnion investment, according to people familiar with the matter.

Their experience running TransUnion, which includes a seat on its board for a Goldman partner, helped build the bank's familiarity with consumer credit, some of the people said. Today, Marcus is a TransUnion client, using its data and other services to find customers and manage accounts.

Goldman and private-equity firm Advent International bought TransUnion for about $3 billion five years ago, putting in $550 million each and borrowing the rest. The privately held company in previous decades had been owned by the Pritzker family of Chicago.

As Goldman and Advent dug into TransUnion's business, they found the fastest-growing revenue was coming from the company's dealings with online-lending startups, people familiar with the investment said.

These companies, such as LendingClub Corp . and Prosper Marketplace Inc ., were using information from credit bureaus to find and vet potential borrowers. They were increasingly hungry for data that could pinpoint borrowers who traditional lenders might overlook or overcharge.

TransUnion's new owners doubled down on these clients. They recruited Jim Peck, a big-data enthusiast who had run LexisNexis Risk Solutions , as chief executive. He spent his first day in the company's data center.

TransUnion began appearing at fintech conferences. It rebranded itself with a techy, purposeful vibe, wrapping its initials, a lowercase "tu," in an @ sign. "We're not just a credit bureau; we're a force for good," chirped a 2015 video.

The company spent heavily on technology and acquisitions. It replaced its old mainframe, a relic from the 1970s, with nimbler systems that allow it to splice information in new ways. It built a new data center and started scooping up small companies with niche data sets.

One acquisition tracks public records to help with fraud enforcement related to online shopping, among other things. Another uses utility payments, cellphone billing records and other data points to identify creditworthy borrowers who lenders might have overlooked, either because they have little or no debt history or potential red flags on their traditional credit reports.     

TransUnion's costs grew by 56% between 2011 and 2014, twice as rapidly as revenue over that period. That is unusual for a company owned by private-equity firms, which often cut their way to profits.

All three credit-reporting firms  Equifax, Experian and TransUnion compile alternative data on consumers that go beyond the loan payments found in credit reports. And in some ways, TransUnion was late to the game. Experian says it began selling data that show whether consumers are racking up or paying down credit-card balances, in 2001, many years before TransUnion rolled this out.

Although it has been playing catch-up, TransUnion has found ways to stand apart from its rivals in terms of how it delivers its data to lenders. One example is Prama, a platform TransUnion launched last year that allows lenders to play with data. With a few clicks, lenders can see if their delinquency figures are better than peer groups. They can also find locations where delinquencies are on the rise.

By the time of its IPO in 2015, TransUnion had 30 million gigabytes of data, growing at 25% a year and ranging from voter registration in India to drivers' accident records in the U.S. The company's IPO documents boasted that it had anticipated the arrival of online lenders and "created solutions that catered to these emerging providers."

China Probes Insurance Regulator Chief

By Chao Deng and Brian Spegele

BEIJING China's anticorruption agency announced Sunday an investigation of the country's top insurance regulator amid growing concern in some parts of the government over lax industry oversight.

A statement from the Communist Party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection didn't give details on why Xiang Junbo, chairman of the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, was being probed. It said he was suspected of "serious violations" of party discipline, a phrase typically used to denote graft.

The China Insurance Regulatory Commission didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Xiang couldn't be reached, and it wasn't known if he had a lawyer.

The investigation against Mr. Xiang had been rumored for some time, and suggests the staying power of the anticorruption campaign championed by President Xi Jinping . Since rising to power in late 2012, Mr. Xi has targeted current and former leaders of government agencies, the military and state-owned enterprises. Many have been convicted and sentenced to lengthy prison terms, and the campaign has sown fear among officials and executives nationwide.

The probe into Mr. Xiang is particularly significant, breeding fresh uncertainty for China's insurance regulator, a key actor helping to ensure financial stability in the world's second-largest economy. Still, the investigation won't come as a total shock to China's insurance industry which had more than $2 trillion in assets last year where rumors have been circulating over Mr. Xiang's fate.

The investigation comes as Beijing contemplates how to better coordinate financial oversight between the central bank and banking, securities and insurance regulators. When Beijing appointed Guo Shuqing to head the China Banking Regulatory Commission in February, people familiar with the matter said the leadership was considering letting Mr. Guo oversee a potential merger between the banking and insurance regulators.

The spotlight has been on China's insurance regulator and Mr. Xiang since 2015, when domestic insurance companies began snapping up shares of listed firms across several sectors, including blue-chip names. A big reason for their spending spree was pressure to meet returns for highly lucrative investment products they began selling to ordinary investors.

China's insurance regulator stepped up oversight, although an earnest campaign to rein in insurers only came after the head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission drew the public's attention to their activities.

In December, Liu Shiyu criticized what he termed as corporate raiders that were using "improperly sourced" funds to buy stakes in companies, in comments that were widely interpreted as directed against aggressive insurance firms. Mr. Xiang himself also called for insurers to get back to the basics of providing insurance products.

Later that month, the insurance regulator notably intensified its crackdown on risky practices in the industry. It suspended Evergrande Life, the insurance unit of the country's largest property developer, from investing in stocks, accusing it of short-term trading that violated investment rules.

The insurance regulator also responded by proposing tighter rules on the shareholder structure of insurers, which analysts say would keep a check on any one controlling shareholder. It suggested that a single shareholder should be able to have a maximum 33% stake in an insurer, down from 51% previously, although the rule hasn't yet been implemented.

Mr. Xiang, 60 years old, took over as chairman of the commission in 2011 after serving as the head of Agricultural Bank of China, according to his official profile.

Cybertheft Attempt on Indian Bank Resembles Bangladesh Heist

By Julie Steinberg in Hong Kong and Gabriele Parussini in Mumbai

Cyberthieves who attempted to steal $170 million from an Indian bank last July used methods that strongly resemble those of an earlier, successful $81 million heist targeting Bangladesh's central bank , according to people familiar with the matter.

The similarities between the Indian and Bangladeshi hacks underscore concerns about a rash of cyberattacks in recent months on financial institutions around the world, including banks in the U.S., Mexico, Poland and the U.K. Some of these hacks have been linked to groups affiliated with North Korea, cybersecurity specialists said earlier this year.

State-owned Union Bank of India Ltd .'s computer system was infected with malware that allowed thieves to authorize the transfer of around $170 million from the bank's account in New York to private accounts in five locations, people familiar with the matter said. Fast detection by bankers allowed the Indian lender to prevent the money's release.

Investigators studying the Indian hack said similar tactics and coding were used by computer criminals who attempted to steal nearly $1 billion from Bangladesh's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in February of last year. Many orders had been filled with misspellings and formatting errors, and the Fed blocked some of the withdrawal but the thieves were able to move about $81 million to accounts in the Philippines.

U.S. prosecutors are building cases that would accuse North Korea of directing the Bangladeshi attack. North Korea's mission to the United Nations didn't respond to requests for comment.

This account of the Union Bank of India hack is based on interviews with Arun Tiwari, the bank's chairman, and several other people familiar with the incident.

The attack on Union Bank began in late July last year when an employee opened an attachment on an email that appeared to have come from India's central bank , Mr. Tiwari said. That action activated a piece of malware that allowed the hackers to steal Union Bank's access codes for the international messaging system banks use to authorize cross-border transactions, known as the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication , or Swift.

The hackers then used those codes to send authentic-looking instructions to a Union Bank account at Citigroup Inc . in New York, which handles processing of wire transfers and clears dollar transactions. The instructions ordered around $170 million to be sent to accounts in Thailand, Cambodia, Australia, Hong Kong and Taiwan.

The money went to several shell companies associated with Asian in particular Chinese organized crime syndicates, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The cybercriminals behind the Bangladesh heist similarly stole bank codes to place fake transfer orders. Swift in November said banks using its network had sustained fresh attacks from hackers since the Bangladesh heist. Swift declined to comment on whether Union Bank of India was one of those banks, although Mr. Tiwari said Swift officials have been working with Union Bank since the day of the hack.

Swift generally creates two reports per transaction: one sent to the originating bank, in this case, Union Bank, and another to the so-called correspondent bank handling the overseas transactions, which was Citigroup . The correspondent bank then forwards its report to the originating bank the next day, so it can cross-check the transactions.

On July 21, an employee in Union Bank's treasury department who was comparing the reports found that Citigroup had executed six transactions that Union Bank hadn't intended to authorize. He notified senior executives of the mismatch, and the bank immediately began trying to get the money back.

"This [office] was a war room that day," Mr. Tiwari said.

Union Bank recovered the money sent to Thailand, Cambodia, and Australia more than half of the total within 24 hours. It got a court order in Hong Kong to retrieve the rest of the funds, and had gotten all of its money back by July 24.

Employees on Citigroup 's cybersecurity team observed similarities in how the malware behaved in the Union Bank attack and that used in the attack on Bangladesh's central bank . Citigroup is an intermediary bank for the New York Fed , which gives it visibility into certain transactions.

Ernst & Young LLP , which was hired by Union Bank to investigate the hack and its aftermath, also concluded it had been executed similarly to the attack on the Bangladesh central bank , according to Mr. Tiwari. In both cases the malware reached the target banks by emails addressed to employees, and took control of Swift functions at the originating bank, a person familiar with the attack said.

Both hacks also disabled computer systems that create automatic logs of the transactions, another person familiar with the matter said.

Analysis: Cash Is Dead. Long Live Cash

By Adam Creighton

As credit card use and digital payment systems like Venmo and Android Pay spread, Americans use less and less cash to buy things. Yet the amount of bills and coins in circulation continues to grow: Hard currency as a percentage of U.S. gross domestic product is now at 8.6%, the highest level since the early 1950s, an era long before the widespread use of plastic and smartphones. Europe, Japan, and Australia have similar trends.

The most likely reason for the cash paradox, analysts say: a thriving global underground economy of tax evasion, organized crime and terrorism financing. Digital payments may be faster and more efficient, but cash cloaks transactions in privacy.

In a 2015 report titled "Why Is Cash Still King?" Europe's police agency, Europol , concluded that "while cash is slowly falling out of favor with consumers, it remains the criminals' instrument of choice."

"The Fed has long known most of the $100 bills aren't in America. It doesn't take great insight to realize they are being used to finance illicit activities," Alan Blinder, Princeton University economist and a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in an interview.

Such concerns last year prompted a global push against cash. Harvard economist Kenneth Rogoff's book, "The Curse of Cash," proposed phasing out $100 and $50 bills. Europe decided to phase out the  500 note. India moved in December to eliminate its 500- and 1,000-rupee bills. Countries including South Korea and Venezuela have withdrawn notes or coins in recent months.

But the push to get rid of cash is hitting speed bumps all over. India, for example, is already partly reintroducing its 500- and 1000-rupee bills after the government's abrupt demonetization program drew sharp criticism for hurting its cash-dependent rural population.

The U.S. shows no inclination to pare back its notes.

"I'm very conscious of the $100 bill being the world's reserve currency, and every central bank around the world has stacks of $100 bills where they used to have gold," Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal shortly before he left office in January.

One reason it's a non-starter in the U.S.: About 8% of people don't have a checking or savings account, making it all-but-impossible for them to participate in a cashless economy.

Banning cash "would bring the economy and many people to their knees if enforced," said Hoover Institution economist John Cochrane.

In the aboveground economy, card-based and digital payment systems offering ever-greater speed, safety and convenience have been steadily encroaching on paper money, even for small consumer transactions. Euromonitor International , a market-research firm, said the volume of global cash payments in 2016 for the first time fell below payments on credit and debit cards.

Some of the growth in cash can be attributed to the financial crisis and the aftermath, when people lost faith in banks, and when ultralow interest rates and anemic investment returns reduced the opportunity costs of holding savings in cash. The number of $100 bills in circulation, worth $1.15 trillion in December, has surged 76% since 2009, according to Federal Reserve data.

Mr. Rogoff sees sinister uses of cash. "The idea that today's high cash holdings are mostly explained by people engaged in legal activities taking advantage of low interest rates is nonsense," he said in an interview.

The underground economy is, by definition, difficult to measure, but large. In high-tax Europe it was 18% of GDP in 2015, and around 8% in the U.S., Japan and Australia according to Friedrich Schneider, a University of Linz economist, who's written extensively on the shadow economy.

The global turnover of organized crime in 2012, the most recent year available, was estimated at $870 billion by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime , greater than the GDP of the Netherlands.

Yet it's unclear whether curbing cash would be effective in reducing crime or would just prompt resourceful criminals to find other means of doing business.

"If a limit on cash transactions were an effective means of fighting organized crime, then there wouldn't be a mafia in Italy anymore," cracked a German member of parliament during a debate last year on whether his country should follow Italy, France, and Spain in imposing maximum limits on the size of individual cash transactions.

Germany, like the U.S., has so far resisted following its neighbors, due in part to civil liberties concerns.

Similar views prompt objections from American conservatives. "The real reason for this war on cash... is an ugly power grab by Big Government," conservative publisher Steve Forbes wrote in a column in his magazine last year.

Rising interest rates are also taking some steam out of the argument for doing away with cash. Central banks in Europe and Japan have experimented with negative interest rates in recent years to spur spending and investment. Because cash undermines the effects of negative rates, some economists have argued for doing away with it. But now that rates are rising in the U.S. and will potentially follow suit elsewhere, the argument against cash becomes even less compelling.

Cash might have its dark undersides, but it is still king.

The Anti-Bitcoin ETF

By Ari I. Weinberg

Regulators' rejection in March of two proposed bitcoin exchange-traded products was a reminder that there are currency exchange-traded products out there already that offer much that a bitcoin fund wouldn't currency diversification and an underlying market with enormous liquidity and regulatory oversight.

The Securities and Exchange Commission rejected a proposed listing of Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust , from Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, and later turned down a proposed bitcoin product backed by SolidX Management LLC. The SEC cited the lack of regulation of the bitcoin market as a stumbling block to the proposed listings.

In contrast, national currencies and much of the trading in the markets for them are extensively regulated, and they provide much greater liquidity than the bitcoin market. And there is no shortage of exchange-traded products for people who want to invest in those markets. At the end of March, there were 24 exchange-traded products listed in the U.S. that invest in single currencies or currency derivatives and nine that invest in baskets of currencies or derivatives, holding a total of $2.9 billion of assets, according to research firm XTF.

Funds that invest in a basket of currencies, like the $193 million WisdomTree Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Bullish Fund (USDU), provide diversification for investors who don't want to bet on the movement of a single currency. USDU is an actively managed exchange-traded fund benchmarked to the Bloomberg Dollar Total Return Index. The fund holds currency forwards that bet on the dollar's movement against a trade-weighted basket of currencies that includes the euro, yen, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, British pound, Australian dollar, Swiss franc, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and rupee.

The fund was down 3% year-to-date through March but returned 5.5% annualized over three years, according to research firm Morningstar Inc . It has a 0.50% expense ratio.

"We initially viewed this holding as a tactical play on a strong dollar," says Matthew Krajna, senior portfolio manager for Nottingham Advisors in Amherst, N.Y.

Now, he says, the firm views the fund as more of a long-term holding to provide diversification for clients' portfolios. He says investors have to be mindful to take gains or minimize loses by selling shares when appropriate, because the fund doesn't provide income in the form of yield or dividends that would help cushion losses in the share price.

Another option for investors interested in diversified currency exchange-traded products is the $736 million PowerShares DB US Dollar Index Bullish Fund (UUP). It has more assets and trades more than USDU, but its holdings are more concentrated: Nearly 60% of its exposure is to the euro. UUP was down 1.9% year-to-date at the end of last month but returned an annualized 6.5% over the past three years.

The Bloomberg Dollar Total Return Index, down 3.4% in 2017 through March, was up an annualized 6.1% over the past three years.

Fiduciary Rule Is Delayed, but Not Its Impact

By Michael Wursthorn

Some brokerages are forging ahead with a new retirement-savings rule even though the Trump administration has postponed and could cancel its implementation.

The fiduciary rule was set to take effect on Monday, but the Labor Department has officially delayed it for 60 days starting April 7. In that time, the department can revise it, rescind it or request another delay.

The rule would have required brokers who oversee $3 trillion in tax-advantaged retirement savings to act in their clients' best interest. That is a stricter standard than many brokerages were using. After the rule was unveiled in April 2016, some brokerages moved clients from commission-based accounts that could run afoul of the rule to fee-only accounts.

Among firms that disclosed their plans after the fiduciary rule was announced, Merrill Lynch   Bank of America Corp .'s wealth-management unit and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co . say they are still moving most clients to fee-based accounts. A J.P. Morgan spokesman said the bank would push back its deadline to track the Labor Department's actions. Other brokerages including Morgan Stanley and Edward Jones have said they would keep some previously announced changes, such as lower commission charges and some sales restrictions.

"Firms have been constantly revising their strategy to keep up with the latest potential options looked at by the Department of Labor," said Bharat Sawhney, a managing director focused on wealth and investment management at consulting firm Gartland & Mellina Group. "But the damage has already been done."

Thomas Powers, 75 years old, was faced with the following choice: move his assets to a fee-based account at Merrill Lynch or close out his individual retirement account and move to a self-directed commission-based brokerage account. "What's their motivation for the fee?" said Mr. Powers, a former marketing professional in Chautauqua, N.Y.

Mr. Powers was told soon after Merrill made its fiduciary-compliance plans known in October that he would have to move to a fee-based account if he wanted to keep his broker and access to Merrill's investment research. Mr. Powers for years had paid commissions for the stocks and bonds he directed his Merrill broker to buy in his IRA.

Mr. Powers wanted to retain access to research, but he didn't want to pay 1% of assets annually, a typical fee for such an account, and told his broker he would move his funds to a rival brokerage. That fee would eat into his savings and significantly increase his investment costs from what he was paying in commissions.

At a meeting several weeks later, Mr. Powers's broker offered a discounted annual fee of 0.3%, which would put Mr. Power's investment costs roughly in line with what he had been paying the past few years. Mr. Powers eventually agreed to move to a fee-based account.

Merrill hasn't determined how long those discounts will remain in place, a person familiar with the matter said.

Proponents of the rule say it protects retirement investors from conflicted advice that costs them $17 billion a year in extra expenses, creating a drag on returns. Opponents dispute those figures and say that brokerages and insurers looking to comply with the regulation would pass along compliance and related costs to savers and potentially cut off customers with relatively small balances from some forms of professional advice.

Brokerage executives say the fees are justified because they have to provide a higher level of service by spending more time understanding a client's full financial situation. Andy Sieg, who took over Merrill in January, told brokers in March that Merrill's focus on fee-based accounts "allows us to manage conflicts of interest when advising our clients, gives our clients clarity and transparency around the fees we charge and facilitates a disciplined investment process."

Merrill boosted its fee-based assets by $18.9 billion in the fourth quarter. Merrill currently advises on $208 billion of fee-based IRA assets, more than half of the firm's total IRA assets.

Investors who use insurance brokers for retirement planning also face tough choices. Julie Anderson, a 57-year-old pastor who lives near Minneapolis, has relied on an insurance broker for years to regularly provide advice and set her up with annuities to generate income in retirement. In the months after the rule was passed, however, she said her broker had become reluctant to give advice. Even as it became clear the rule would be delayed, the broker suggested she should seek help from someone else, she said.

The rule would have forced major changes to how insurance brokers work with retirement savers, in some cases limiting the advice and products they can sell.

Ms. Anderson said she is likely to turn to a financial adviser she learned of through her accountant for retirement advice, a move that will increase her investment costs.

"It feels like a part-time job on top of dealing with everything else in my life," Ms. Anderson said. "This is all confusing."

Index Firms Take Issue With Nonvoting Rights

By Richard Teitelbaum

No vote, no index. FTSE Russell said it won't add Snap Inc . or other companies with nonvoting shares to its major stock benchmarks when it updates them in June.

The issue of voting rights is raising the ire of some shareholders' rights advocates because founders and executives often end up with far more votes than shares. That has put index firms in the spotlight.

FTSE Russell issued a statement last week in response to concerns about stocks with no voting rights, such as the Class A shares Snap sold in March. The firm plans to consult with investors and other stakeholders over the next few months about whether to include companies with no voting rights in its indexes.

Current index members with nonvoting shares could be affected depending on the feedback that FTSE Russell receives in its discussions.

"It is possible that the future eligibility of existing securities, or the investment weighting assigned to them, may change," FTSE Russell said.

Changes could affect companies like Alphabet Inc . The technology giant's Class C shares, which carry no voting rights, are already included in various FTSE and Russell indexes, according to FactSet. So are its Class A shares, which do carry voting rights.

Alphabet is controlled by co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin and executive chairman Eric Schmidt through Class B shares that have 10 votes each.

"We as an index provider need to come to a decision on what the policy is," said FTSE Russell spokesman Tim Benedict. The firm said it plans to announce the results of its consultations in July.

Other companies with nonvoting share classes include Under Armour Inc . and Zillow Group Inc .

"It doesn't make sense to exclude companies that are well run," said Zillow finance chief Kathleen Philips, especially if there is no evidence that the lack of voting rights hurts performance.

Companies are generally eager to be included in a market index because doing so increases their investor base, according to Ben Johnson, director of exchange-traded fund research at Morningstar Inc. "From the point of view of Snap, I'm sure they are desperate to get on the other side of the velvet rope," he said.

Spokeswomen for Snap and Under Armour declined to comment. Alphabet didn't respond to an email and phone call.

Still, more nonvoting shares are in the pipeline. IAC/InterActiveCorp . shareholders approved a nonvoting share class last year, but the company said it won't issue stock until it resolves a lawsuit challenging the move. A company spokeswoman declined to comment.

Facebook Inc . last year proposed the issuance of a nonvoting class of stock and is also the subject of a lawsuit to prevent it from doing so. A Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment.

Big investors have begun to weigh in on the topic, since in many cases they are required to hold the stocks in an index.

"We are increasingly troubled by the rise of nonvoting and low-voting shares," said Arianna Stefanoni Sherlock, a spokeswoman for index fund giant Vanguard Group in an email. "These structures contradict our fundamental belief that shareholders' economic interests and voting rights should be aligned."

Some governance experts caution against excluding companies from indexes based on voting rights, noting how the precipitous decline in stock listings over the past 20 years has diminished the pool accessible to investors.

"Recent regulations have discouraged many private companies from making their equity available to the public," said Lori Ryan, director of the Corporate Governance Institute at San Diego State University. "The ability to separate economic offerings from voting rights allows control-oriented founders to make shares available to the public."

FTSE Russell, which is owned by the London Stock Exchange Group PLC , maintains thousands of major indexes under the the FTSE and Russell names. They are used by asset managers and others to gauge performance and determine which securities go into certain exchange-traded funds. The company said more than $10 trillion is benchmarked to FTSE and Russell indexes.

Each year, FTSE Russell adds and subtracts companies to its Russell indexes based on characteristics like market capitalization. The additions and deletions are disclosed beginning in early June. FTSE indexes are generally reviewed quarterly or semiannually.

FTSE Russell and rival MSCI Inc . excluded shares of Snap, parent of the photo-based messaging app Snapchat, from accelerated inclusion in some of their broad stock market indexes after the company's IPO because they failed to meet certain market criteria.

The methodology for a third firm, S&P Dow Jones Indices, included several obstacles to Snap's inclusion in the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, or S&P SmallCap 600 indexes notably a requirement that IPOs must trade for six to 12 months before being considered for inclusion.

Companies Get More Leeway on SEC  Conflict Minerals' Rule

By Dave Michaels

The Securities and Exchange Commission 's acting chairman has given companies more leeway on a rule that requires them to monitor the use of minerals that could benefit armed groups in Africa.

The "conflict minerals" regulation has divided Republicans and Democrats since Congress put the requirement into the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law. The SEC issued the rule, but a court struck down part of it in response to an industry lawsuit. The measure requires manufacturers and other firms to disclose whether they have used metals including gold, tin, tungsten and tantalum that originated in the Democratic Republic of Congo or nearby countries.

On Friday, the SEC effectively waived the biggest requirements of the rule. Acting Chairman Michael Piwowar, a Republican, said the move was appropriate because the courts had invalidated a key disclosure required by the rule.

Mr. Piwowar had foreshadowed Friday's action in January when he said the regulator would look for ways to give "additional relief" for companies subject to the conflict-minerals rule.

As a result of Friday's move, companies that believe minerals in their supply chain originated from those African countries won't have to trace the smelters or refiners used by suppliers, or have their disclosures audited by a third party, according to a notice the SEC posted on its website.

The SEC's action follows a series of moves by Mr. Piwowar to reconsider disclosures that are unpopular with congressional Republicans and business groups, who argue the information isn't material to investors. In February he said the agency would look for ways to minimize the burden on companies that must report the pay gap between chief executives and their employees.

Manufacturers sued the SEC over the conflict-minerals rule in 2013, arguing that part of the disclosure violated their free-speech rights. The measure forced firms to state whether their products have "not been found to be  DRC conflict-free.'" An appeals court ruled in 2014 that the SEC couldn't force the industry plaintiffs to use that language in their filings or in disclosures on their websites.

Following on the appeals court's ruling, a lower court ordered the SEC to rewrite the rule. It said the measure was unlawful "only to the extent" that it required firms to use the language invalidated by the appeals court.

The lower court didn't otherwise nullify the rule, meaning the SEC didn't have to provide all of the relief it offered Friday. Kara Stein, the other current SEC commissioner and a Democrat, criticized what she described as Mr. Piwowar's overreach to "unilaterally" undermine a rule "mandated by the Congress, adopted by the commission, and reviewed by the courts."

"It represents a troubling attack not only on the commission process, but also on the restraints of government power," she said.

WSJ Pro: Fed's Dudley Open to Changes in Financial Regulation

By Michael S. Derby

Federal Reserve Bank of New York President William Dudley said Friday he is open to changes that could lessen some of the burdens imposed on the financial-serviced sector by postcrisis rules, pointing to relief for smaller firms and reconsideration of the Volcker rule as possibilities.

"In contemplating changes to the regulatory regime, the good news is that the U.S. financial system is much sounder today than it was on the eve of the financial crisis," Mr. Dudley said in prepared remarks for a speech at the Princeton Club in New York. "That said, it is entirely appropriate to take a critical look at the changes that were made to the regulatory regime," he added. "While we do not yet have evidence of how these reforms will hold up during the next economic downturn, many have been in place long enough that we can begin to evaluate their efficacy."

Mr. Dudley didn't comment on the economy or the monetary-policy outlook in his speech.

His remarks come at a time of flux for the Fed's role as a regulator. The U.S. central bank plays a major role in financial oversight, but the official who spearheaded many of these endeavors, Daniel Tarullo, left the Fed this week. That role has now been taken over by governor Jerome Powell.

The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have weighed changes to regulation that would roll back some postcrisis rules. It isn't clear how successful they will be. The party was unable to push through major changes in health care despite full control of the presidency and legislature.

Mr. Dudley outlined some areas where changes to existing laws and rules would make sense. For one thing, lightening the burden of regulation faced by community banks and smaller financial institutions might be a good idea, he said. "For smaller institutions, the regulatory and compliance burdens can be considerably lighter because the failure of such a firm will not impose large costs or stress on the broader financial system," he said.

Mr. Dudley said the Volcker rule which prevents banks from speculating with their own money, known as proprietary trading could also be worth revising. He said that "the line between market-making and proprietary trading is not always clear-cut, which makes regulation in this space difficult," adding that "it may be worth considering giving greater discretion to trading desks that facilitate client business to intervene when markets are illiquid and volatile."

The Fed governor also said he could see modifying the Fed's annual stress testing of banks, which he deemed "vital," in a way that "might lessen the burden it places on banks."

That said, Mr. Dudley said many of the rules implemented in recent years have been a good thing, and have made the world a safer place.

"We have made considerable progress toward ending a regime in which some financial firms were  too big to fail,'" Mr. Dudley said. "The quantity and quality of capital and liquidity for U.S. banks have markedly improved, meaning that the banking industry can support the economy even under considerably more adverse economic conditions."

WSJ Pro: Fed's Powell Takes Over Tarullo's Regulatory Role

By Ryan Tracy

WASHINGTON Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell is taking over the regulatory oversight role previously filled by Daniel Tarullo, who resigned this week from his governor post.

Mr. Powell is now chairman of the Fed governing board's Committee on Supervision and Regulation, according to the Fed's website.

Mr. Tarullo previously held that title, which involves oversight of the regulatory policy and staff in the central bank's division of supervision and regulation. He used the role to gain outsize influence over the Fed's regulatory agenda.

Mr. Powell has experience with regulatory issues, but it isn't clear whether he will wield the same influence. President Donald Trump is expected to at some point nominate someone to fill the vacant role of Fed vice chairman in charge of supervision and regulation, and that person is expected to take the lead role on regulatory policy once confirmed by the Senate.

That Fed vice chairman post has never been officially filled, though Mr. Tarullo handled the duties in practice.

Sports Gambler Billy Walters Found Guilty of Insider Trading

By Erica Orden

A federal jury in Manhattan on Friday found legendary gambler William "Billy" Walters guilty on 10 criminal charges related to insider trading, dealing a significant blow to a figure who had long eluded the clutches of the government.

The nearly four-week trial of Mr. Walters, 70 years old, examined accusations that he earned illegal profits and avoided losses of more than $40 million over six years through tips about Dean Foods Co . from Thomas C. Davis, the company's former chairman.

Mr. Davis pleaded guilty in May 2016 to charges that include securities fraud and perjury and cooperated against Mr. Walters, a longtime friend.

Mr. Walters was arrested in May 2016 in Las Vegas, after a five-year investigation. The jury convicted him Friday after about a half-day of deliberations.

Mr. Walters allegedly passed one of the tips from Mr. Davis to famed golfer Phil Mickelson, who wasn't charged with any wrongdoing but agreed to pay the government more than $1 million. The amount included the profits the government says he made from that tip.

"Today, Billy Walters lost his bet that he could cheat the securities markets on a massive scale and get away with it scot-free," Acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Joon Kim said in a statement.

"Armed with his illegal edge, Walters made huge, perfectly timed trades, at times accounting for over a third of the trading volume in Dean Foods stock."

Barry Berke, an attorney for Mr. Walters, said his client planned to appeal the conviction.

The insider-trading investigation initially had examined whether activist investor Carl Icahn had passed tips to Mr. Walters, and whether Mr. Walters passed tips to Mr. Mickelson, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. The portion of the investigation related to Mr. Icahn involving potential trading in cleaning-products maker Clorox Co ., in which Mr. Icahn once held a stake later became dormant. He hasn't been charged.

The crux of the case at trial, however, concerned the relationship between Messrs. Walters and Davis. At one point, Mr. Walters allegedly gave Mr. Davis a prepaid cellphone with which to communicate inside information, and instructed him to refer to Dean Foods as "Dallas Cowboys ." After speaking with Mr. Davis, Mr. Walters would repeatedly call his Las Vegas broker to buy tens of millions of dollars in Dean Foods shares, according to authorities.

One example of their alleged scheming came in June 2008, when Mr. Davis disclosed that Dean Foods was increasing its earnings guidance for the second quarter of that year. Armed with that information, Mr. Walters allegedly bought nearly 4 million shares for $73.5 million a move that constituted about one-third of the company's trading volume over three days, and earned Mr. Walters profits of approximately $6 million, according to the indictment.

Federal and state authorities had indicted Mr. Walters four other times on charges related to his gambling, but he had never been convicted.

In 1999, for example, Mr. Walters was indicted by a state grand jury in Nevada on charges including money laundering, but the indictment was subsequently dismissed by a judge.

The verdict counts as perhaps the last major conviction largely under the watch of Preet Bharara, the former federal prosecutor whose office oversaw the investigation and indictment of Mr. Walters, and who was fired from his post as Manhattan U.S. attorney days before the start of the trial.

A successful crackdown on insider trading will likely become part of Mr. Bharara's legacy. During his tenure, he racked up more than 80 insider-trading convictions.

Wall Street Made Charles Murphy Successful, but Happiness Eluded Him

By Gregory Zuckerman, Serena Ng and Leslie Scism

Charles Murphy used to walk home through New York City's Central Park to his 19-room townhouse for dinner with his family. Last year, he began voicing worries about money to his boss, hedge-fund billionaire John Paulson, who often joined him along the way.

At 56 years old, Mr. Murphy had a net worth in the tens of millions of dollars. He entered Columbia University at 16 and later earned law and business degrees at Harvard and Massachusetts Institute of Technology .

On Wall Street, he had a ringside seat to some of the biggest financial events of the past 20 years, from the 1990s merger boom to the dot-com bust to the Bernard Madoff scandal and the travails of American International Group Inc . He made millions of dollars at banks and investment firms in New York and London, despite his share of setbacks.

During those walks, though, Mr. Paulson found himself trying to reassure Mr. Murphy, according to a person who knew both men, offering reminders of all he had accomplished. "You don't need to worry," Mr. Paulson would say.

Mr. Murphy was blessed with a commanding presence and boundless ambition. Yet his concerns over maintaining the life he had created for himself, his wife, Annabella, and their three young sons consumed him. The very qualities that helped him build a fortune were no match for his fear of losing it.

"In his mind, he had worries," said Beln Hormaeche, a close friend of Mr. Murphy and his wife. "But it was all in his mind."

Mr. Paulson, who eulogized Mr. Murphy last Monday, sought to explain his apparent suicide to friends and family during a funeral service in New York.

"The mind can play tricks with oneself, distorting reality," Mr. Paulson said. "No matter how much those close to him tried to help, and no one tried more than Annabella, Charles could not see a path forward &his mind created a trap from which he couldn't escape."

This account of Mr. Murphy's life and death is based on interviews with close friends and colleagues, as well as those familiar with his family.

Fast track

Born to a middle-class New York family in 1961, Mr. Murphy stood out at a young age for his drive and intellect. His father worked as an engineer for a utility company and sparked his son's early interest in books and classical music. The family lived in a modest Upper East Side walk-up apartment.

Mr. Murphy attended Stuyvesant High School, one of New York City's top public schools, before enrolling at Columbia. At 6 feet 6 inches tall, he became captain of the crew team. Out of the water, he discussed philosophy, poetry and arts, classmates recalled.

Mr. Murphy became interested in investment banking while pursuing advanced degrees at Harvard and MIT, said Tom Seeman, a Harvard classmate.

In 1985, he was recruited by Goldman Sachs Group . Inc., embarking on a two-decade career at the world's biggest banks including Morgan Stanley , Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG .

Mr. Murphy spent most of that time in London, where he was seen as polished and articulate, favoring expensive suits. He closed complicated deals involving insurance companies and won praise for his financial analysis. He could also be rigid in his point of view, and disregarded opposing ideas, colleagues said. Some who worked with Mr. Murphy recalled times when he retreated into his office and closed the door, wanting to be left alone for days. That's how he focused at work, said someone close to the family.

In 1993, he married Heather O'Brien, a 24-year-old American preparing to start doctoral studies in theology, according to a wedding announcement. Six years later, after the couple had two children, the marriage collapsed. Ms. Murphy later married Sol Kerzner, a South African hotel magnate.

After the breakup of his marriage, Mr. Murphy became a fixture in London's club scene, colleagues said. In 2004, Mr. Murphy married a young Londoner, Annabella Demetriou, and became devoted to her, friends said. In 2006, he threw her a lavish 30th birthday party in London featured in Tatler magazine.

In the late 1990s, he became excited about the chance for bigger rewards outside Wall Street. At the height of the internet-stock frenzy, Mr. Murphy quit Morgan Stanley to become chief financial officer of a London startup, Antfactory Holdings Ltd. The firm backed technology companies and eyed a lucrative initial public offering itself.

Mr. Murphy accepted a token salary and was given stock with the potential to be worth tens of millions of dollars if the company went public or was sold. Within 18 months of his move, internet stocks had crashed, ending Antfactory's ambitions.

Mr. Murphy got another chance at a potentially lucrative IPO in 2007. Fairfield Greenwich Group, a Connecticut firm that managed $15 billion for wealthy individuals investing in hedge funds, considered going public. Mr. Murphy was hired to oversee its strategy.

As his family prepared to move to the U.S. from London, Mr. Murphy paid $33 million for the seven-level, 11-fireplace, limestone Upper East Side townhouse of Matthew Bronfman, an heir to the Seagram liquor fortune.

The Fairfield Greenwich IPO never happened. The firm had channeled billions of dollars of its investors' money into a fund overseen by Mr. Madoff, whose giant Ponzi scheme was uncovered in 2008. Mr. Murphy was out of a job. He tried to sell his house in 2009 as he and his wife considered moving back to London.

By chance, Mr. Murphy and his wife were invited to a dinner party at a friend's East Side home, where he struck up a conversation with Mr. Paulson, of Paulson & Co .

Mr. Paulson had just made $20 billion betting against mortgage securities and banks in what was considered one of the great trades in financial history. Now, he wanted to invest in insurance companies. Mr. Murphy knew how, and he was eventually hired for the job.

One of Mr. Murphy's early ideas was to invest $80 million to help recapitalize struggling insurer Conseco Inc. The deal earned Paulson & Co . more than $100 million.

More recently, in search of another lucrative trade, Mr. Murphy asked another hedge-fund investor: "What can we do that's bigger?"

The answer seemed to be AIG, the insurer that in 2008 required a nearly $185 billion U.S.-funded bailout. The company had repaid taxpayers by 2012, and management was focused on improving its financial performance.

In March 2015, Messrs. Murphy and Paulson met with AIG Chief Executive Peter Hancock and offered a different plan: break up the insurance conglomerate. AIG resisted. Mr. Murphy spent months pitching his proposal to hedge funds and eventually persuaded billionaire Carl Icahn, who was already eyeing AIG.

"I didn't know him well," Mr. Icahn said, "but in our meetings I found him to be very bright and knowledgeable, and I liked him."

Mr. Murphy lobbied Wall Street analysts to write research in support of the plan. Some analysts said their conversations with Mr. Murphy amounted to lectures. A half-hour on the phone with Mr. Murphy was "29 minutes of Charles talking," one said. People who challenged the AIG breakup recall being barraged by Mr. Murphy with an avalanche of facts and figures.

At an AIG investor meeting hosted by Mr. Hancock in November 2015, Mr. Murphy repeatedly interrupted Mr. Hancock as the chief executive tried to answer investors' questions, some of the attendees said.

"Most investors are polite and deferential to management," said former Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Josh Stirling. "He was definitely confrontational."

The following February, AIG offered Messrs. Icahn and Paulson board seats to avert a proxy fight. Mr. Paulson suggested Mr. Murphy take his spot but AIG demanded someone else. The reason, according to people familiar with the matter: Directors felt Mr. Murphy was too abrasive.

In the fourth quarter, Paulson sold nearly half of its AIG position, locking in double-digit gains from the stock's improvement in 2016.

Retreat

Mr. Murphy made several million dollars a year at Paulson, a person close to the matter said. His compensation had been rising in recent years, though the firm performed poorly of late.

People around Mr. Murphy told him he needn't worry about money, but he worried nonetheless. Mr. Murphy had a $12 million mortgage on his Upper East Side home, according to public records. Two of his youngest children attended private schools; two more from his first marriage were in college.

Early in 2016, he put his townhouse on the market for $49.5 million. By summer, the price had dropped to $42.5 million.

Around July of last year, some of Mr. Murphy's friends and family saw a change. He looked tired. Instead of leading conversations, he was withdrawn, seemingly lost in thought.

Making even minor decisions, whether to go to the beach or take a walk, unsettled Mr. Murphy. His wife brought him to a psychiatrist, who diagnosed him with depression, prescribed medications and closely monitored him, friends said.

Mrs. Murphy tried to draw her husband out of his shell. "Charles, what do you think?" she asked him during a dinner a few months ago with friends. Mr. Murphy smiled and made an effort to join the conversation, a friend recalled.

Mr. Seeman, the former Harvard classmate, would see Mr. Murphy when he visited New York City. In the past few months, he said, Mr. Murphy began putting off his requests to meet: "When I asked him how things were going, he would say,  OK,' or,  Not so well,' when in the past he would always be more expansive."

The Paulson firm has lost money so far in 2017, according to an investor. In February, AIG's shares fell on setbacks in its turnaround plan, though they remain above Paulson's purchase price.

Mr. Murphy confided to a rival hedge-fund investor it had become more difficult for him to find attractive investments in a rising stock market.

A few weeks ago, Mr. Murphy had lunch with an old friend and said he was depressed and seeing a doctor. On Feb. 21, Mr. Murphy added his wife as a co-owner of their Upper East Side home, according to public records. That month, the asking price for the house was listed as $36.5 million.

In recent weeks, Mr. Murphy spoke with colleagues at Paulson about new investment opportunities, showing signs of renewed enthusiasm. He and his family celebrated Mr. Murphy's birthday on a ski trip in Vail, Colo., which seemed to buoy his spirits.

A friend staying at the same resort recalled fondly the sight of Mr. Murphy guiding one of his sons down the bunny slope, the father's long legs stretched around the boy's skis.

Flying home on Sunday, March 26, Mrs. Murphy told a friend that her husband had a "great week" and that the holiday was "fabulous."

The next day, Mr. Murphy sat down for breakfast with his wife and children. As he left for work, the nanny took notice of Mr. Murphy's suit and crisp shirt.

"You look good," she said, according to a close family friend.

"I feel great," Mr. Murphy responded.

That morning, Mr. Murphy worked in Paulson's Midtown Manhattan office.

Later, he headed to the Sofitel New York hotel a few blocks away, checked into a room and jumped from the 24th floor.

Analysis: Now Anyone Can Invest in Startups if They Have the Stomach for It

By Christopher Mims

When Oculus VR sold to Facebook for $2 billion in 2014, some asked: What if the people who backed the virtual-reality startup two years earlier on the crowdfunding site Kickstarter had received shares instead of T-shirts or VR headsets?

They might have seen $100 turn into $14,000, says Richard Swart, chief strategy officer of NextGen Crowdfunding.

Until the past year or two, the Oculus approach to crowdfunding was the only one available to everyday investors who aren't wealthy. Federal law prohibited Kickstarter and similar platforms from offering shares to backers, so startups doled out merchandise or other perks instead.

But the Securities and Exchange Commission recently finalized rules based on the 2012 Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, creating an opportunity for so-called equity crowdfunding, which companies like Mr. Swart's are eager to promote.

An Oculus-like success story is what the equity crowdfunding industry needs in order to take off, proponents say. However, most of the deals investors are buying into so far suggest such an outcome is unlikely anytime soon.

Worse, it seems as though many investors will be unlikely to see any return on their investments at all: Some companies appear to be using this funding mechanism as a last resort, having been passed over by professional investors.

Last week, Ronco Brands  the company founded by Ron Popeil, of Veg-o-Matic and Pocket Fisherman fame announced its intention to file for what is colloquially known as a "mini IPO." Permitted since June 2015, these are public offerings of tradable stock, but the companies can raise only up to $50 million.

Ronco has 22 employees, $17 million in debt, 2015 revenue of $9 million and auditors who have "raised substantial doubt" in securities filings about whether the company can continue to operate. Ronco's chief executive says the company needs to acquire enough capital to leverage its half-century-old brand and grow.

Then there's video-streaming site VidAngel, designed to allow viewers to skip objectionable content in Hollywood films. The company raised more than $10 million from 7,554 customers in December 2016. The mini IPO was pitched as a way to fund VidAngel's legal battle with movie studios that say the company is illegally streaming their movies. Soon after the fundraising round closed, a district court judge issued an injunction to shut down VidAngel's streaming of studio films. Meanwhile, the company is developing original content such as "family friendly" stand-up comedy.

Or take Elio Motors , maker of a three-wheel car and the first company to launch a mini IPO under the new rules, in November 2015. The company probably couldn't have survived without the $16.9 million it raised through equity crowdfunding, founder and CEO Paul Elio says. It has helped open doors to bankers and traditional sources of private equity, he adds. None of them has committed to the additional $300 million the company says it needs to start production, however.

One of the highest-funded projects in Kickstarter history is The Coolest Cooler, which has raised more than $13 million on the site. Then it attempted in March 2016 to raise equity crowdfunding via the site CircleUp from accredited investors, or those with more than $200,000 in income or net worth of at least $1 million. This led to negative press, and the listing was pulled. The Coolest Cooler "weren't a fit for our platform," a CircleUp spokeswoman said. The startup, which didn't respond to requests for comment, still hasn't shipped coolers to all of its Kickstarter backers.

Mini IPOs are allowed by the JOBS Act's Regulation A+: Participants can raise up to $50 million, and the stock is immediately tradable. Another part of the JOBS Act, Regulation CF (for "crowdfunding"), allows companies to sell up to $1 million in shares which must be held for at least 12 months. These smaller offerings, possible since May 2016, are increasingly used by early-stage startups, often in combination with product preorders.

Darren Marble, CEO of CrowdfundX, which markets equity crowdfunding deals including Elio's mini IPO, says he is worried about many of these offerings. "We probably reject 90% or 95% of the deals directed to us," he says. "I think the vast majority of [companies] choosing [mini IPOs] are inherently poor fits for this regulation."

Both sets of rules allow anyone, regardless of income, to invest. But Regulation CF has very stringent caps on the size of the investments, segmented by investors whose net worth or income is less than $100,000, and those whose income or net worth is higher. For Regulation A+, the cap is 10% of a person's net worth or income, whichever is greater.

"It's very early," says Slava Rubin, cofounder and chief business officer of crowdfunding site Indiegogo . Through a partnership with equity-crowdfunding platform MicroVentures, Indiegogo has been offering shares for less than a year.

To date, 11 equity-based projects have been fully funded, including an at-home beer-tap startup called Fizzics, a smart connected ball from Play Impossible, a movie called "The Field Guide to Evil" and a food truck that serves "seasonal" grilled-cheese sandwiches. The average investment on Indiegogo 's equity platform is over $500, Mr. Rubin says.

The SEC has been careful some critics say excessively careful in crafting investor-protecting regulations around equity crowdfunding. But the fact that the rules are looser than conventional IPO regulations means there will be fraud, says Josh Brown, CEO of financial planning firm Ritholtz Wealth Management.

"I'm not against [these rules]," Mr. Brown says. "The problem is some [investors] are going to get f ed. Without a doubt." Some Wall Street traders, he adds, call the JOBS Act the "Just Open Bucket Shops" Act, a reference to the fraudulent brokerage firms whose high-pressure sales tactics were in part responsible for the stock market crash of 1929 and the formation of the SEC.

It's clear that the original intention of the JOBS Act to encourage formation and growth of new businesses in a world in which the stock market is actually shrinking was a good one. What isn't yet clear, and won't be clear for some time, is whether everyday investors will be savvy enough to sort the good deals from the bad.

The government shouldn't "set loose a new generation of wolves of Wall Street who can sell people stories and a dream and leave people holding the bag," Mr. Brown says.

WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup

Liberal Dems Got a Heads-Up About Tarullo's Resignation

It was the morning of February 10, and former Fed governor Daniel Tarullo was preparing for the public announcement of his resignation that afternoon. Whom did he call? Fellow regulators Comptroller Thomas Curry and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Martin Gruenberg were his first call of the day, according to a copy of his schedule released by the Fed today. Then he called two members of Congress, and only two: Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), both liberal Democrats. The calls speak volumes about the people Tarullo considered himself closest to in Washington--a predilection that probably won't be shared by his successor. (ryan.tracy@wsj.com; @ryanjtracy)

New Head for Wells Fargo 's Asset-Based Lending Division

Wells Fargo says David Marks will lead Wells Fargo Capital Finance, the bank's asset-based lending division. Marks takes over for Guy Fuchs, who WSJ earlier this year reported was resigning. Similar to Fuchs, Marks will report to Ed Blakey, who heads Wells Fargo Commercial Capital. Marks most recently was a group risk officer. He has also led sales, service and operations groups in WFC's wholesale banking unit among many roles after joining in 1987. Marks will oversee the "core" parts of capital finance, which provides asset-based lending, specialized junior and senior secured financing, channel finance, factoring and financing for domestic and international trade companies in the US, Canada and UK.

Sports Gambler Walters Found Guilty of Insider Trading

A federal jury in Manhattan today found legendary gambler William "Billy" Walters guilty on 10 criminal charges related to insider trading, dealing a significant blow to a figure who had long eluded the clutches of the government. The nearly four-week trial examined accusations that the 70-year old Walters earned illegal profits through tips about Dean Foods (DF) from Thomas C. Davis, the company's former chairman. Walters was arrested in May 2016 in Las Vegas after a five-year investigation. The jury convicted him today after about a half-day of deliberations. (erica.orden@wsj.com)

The Regulatory Nominations Process Has Broken Down

The process for nominating and confirming presidential appointments for financial regulatory agencies has broken down, with the average length of the nominations process tripling since the late 1980s, "https://bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BPC-Financial-Regulatory-Vacancies.pdf" by Justin Schardin and Ashmi Sheth of the Bipartisan Policy Center. The breakdown has "led to agencies routinely being understaffed at the leadership level," they find. They optimistically argue that "fixing the nominations process is easier than developing perfect financial regulation," provided the president and the Senate "commit to ensuring that vacancies are filled in a timely manner."

Regulators Should Focus on Bankers, Not Banks

Regulators should focus on the incentives and penalties faced by individual bankers, rather than the institutions they work for, if they are to avoid future bailouts and malfeasance, "https://bankunderground.co.uk/2017/04/05/guest-post-why-regulators-should-focus-on-bankers-incentives/". Mr. Goodhart argues that banks don't make decisions, exhibit behavior, or have feelings, while individuals do. Penalties for bad behavior should therefore be applied to bankers, rather than banks. Mr. Goodhart writes that the large fines levied on banks for wrongdoing are "monstrously unfair and inefficient" since they hit shareholders who had little control over the behavior being penalized.

Trump's Pick for Wonky Post Shows He Means to Deregulate

The professor, Neomi Rao, was tapped to be head of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, which operates within the Office of Management and Budget. "Its staff of fewer than 50 career professionals reviews the regulatory, information-collection and statistical activities of federal agencies," writes Ms. Dudley, herself a former OIRA administrator. "That may not sound exciting, but regulation is one of the most direct and powerful ways by which a president can advance his policies." Ms. Rao, an associate professor at George Mason University's Antonin Scalia Law School, bring to the role "an openness to different perspectives and an ability to manage the competing demands of regulatory policy," Ms. Dudley writes.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Liontrust CEO eyes growth after Alliance Trust deal; Face to Face: John Ions

Head of boutique says industry should start to listen to retail clients

When John Ions, a fifty-year-old graduate of North Staffordshire Polytechnic, was appointed chief executive of Liontrust seven years ago, he inherited a fund company in crisis.

In early 2010, Liontrust was abandoned by two star fund managers, causing its assets to crash from a high of 5bn to 1.1bn. Mr Ions had just been poached from Tactica, a rival investment boutique where he was chief executive, to be Liontrust's head of retail.

Shortly after his arrival at the London-based investment boutique, the dive in assets prompted Liontrust's chief executive at the time, founder Nigel Legge, to quit, and Mr Ions found himself catapulted into the hot seat.

Liontrust has more than recovered since. Although it remains small, the London-listed company has a cluster of funds popular among financial advisers and has gained a reputation for offering solid stock picking in the UK small-cap space.

Its Liontrust Special Situations fund holds its own in the UK equity sector, and is ranked as one of the top five best-performing funds over a three-year period, according to FE Analytics, the data provider.

Good performance has helped to secure money from investors; Liontrust last week reported a 36 per cent increase in assets under management for the year ending March 2017.

Speaking to the Financial Times from his office next to the Savoy Hotel in London's West End, Mr Ions, whose company today oversees 9bn of assets, is not afraid to criticise his more powerful competitors.

One of his biggest peeves in recent years was a ruckus at the Investment Association , the UK's asset management trade body, in 2015 over the consumer-led agenda of Daniel Godfrey , its chief executive at the time.

Some members felt Mr Godfrey made the IA behave more like a regulator than a cheerleader, prompting Schroders and M&G, two of the UK's largest fund houses, to temporarily quit the club and take their 550bn of combined assets with them.

At the time, Mr Ions branded the pair "disrespectful" to their fellow IA board members, who would have preferred to keep the dispute behind closed doors.

Two years later Mr Ions remains visibly irritated by the affair, and the fact that Peter Harrison , chief executive of Schroders, was recently appointed as chairman of the IA. His concern is that the asset management body looks resistant to change.

"[Mr Harrison's appointment] looks like: here's the old guard back."

Mr Ions is focusing on how to accelerate the company's growth, and has been hunting for acquisition targets.

A suitable buying opportunity presented itself late last year, when Alliance Trust, the investment company, decided to sell its investment arm, which had just over 2bn of assets.

Liontrust was the successful bidder, announcing last December that it had bought the investment business for 30m.

"It is a business I looked at a couple of years ago when Katherine Garrett-Cox was running it, so it was obviously something of interest to me," says Mr Ions.

This was around the time Elliott Advisors, the activist hedge fund that launched a dogged campaign to overhaul Alliance Trust, first "raised its head", he says, making a deal difficult.

He continued to pursue Alliance, however, due to the strength of its environmental, social and governance expertise, which Mr Ions believes will help Liontrust attract more institutional money, as well as capturing fussy millennial investors.

"If you look at any of the big institutions or pension funds in Europe, [ethical investing] is pretty much embedded in the first page," he says.

Alliance also brings a European distribution network to Liontrust, which has traditionally been a UK-focused house. Europe will become a "significant potential marketplace", says Mr Ions. He adds that the company will register any new funds in Dublin in future.

While optimistic about his company's future, he concedes the asset management industry faces growth challenges.

Active fund managers, in particular, are struggling to maintain the growth rate of previous years as investors flock to lower-margin passive funds. A tide of regulation from authorities in the US, Asia and Europe has not helped profit margins.

Mr Ions is critical of fund companies that are trying to buy their way out of these problems by making serial acquisitions in areas such as wealth management .

"If I look around at the asset managers now, it is harder and harder to see what [their] strategies are," he says. "There are groups that I think are slightly rabbit-in-the-headlights."

Adding to these woes, many asset managers are doing a terrible job of communicating with investors, he says. This is a significant problem in the UK, where retirees have recently been allowed to take their pension in a lump sum and spend it.

He says: "I've got mates in Newcastle that ring up and go, 'Johnny, what do I do with my lumper?' Obviously it is a hugely important decision for these people, and they don't really have any idea [about where to put their cash]," he says.

One of the consequences of this breakdown in trust has been the worsening reputation of the asset management industry. A damning review of the sector published last year by the UK watchdog exacerbated this problem, he believes.

He is in two minds about the regulator's criticism of fund managers.

On the one hand, Mr Ions is a firm believer in fund management's higher purpose. "[If the] asset management industry mobilises the capital that allows the economy to work, that is a good starting point," he says. "So how come we end up with a bad reputation at the end of it?"

But he also believes many fund managers are out of touch. They could, he says, listen more carefully to individual investors, rather than large institutions with more money.

"The significant change in the next five to 10 years is going to be [that we] now start listening much more to the end investor," he says.

Goldman's Wager on Credit Data Pays Off

By Liz Hoffman and AnnaMaria Andriotis

10 April 2017
The Wall Street Journal

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has backed skyscrapers and movie studios. But its big winner lately is a once-sleepy credit bureau.

Goldman bought TransUnion, the smallest of the three main credit-reporting firms, in 2012. By the time it went public three years later, TransUnion had become a data-mining machine, gathering billions of seemingly insignificant tidbits about ordinary Americans that it analyzed and sold to lenders, insurers and others.

Goldman has already pocketed nearly $600 million in profit and is expected to make about five times its initial $550 million investment.

The windfall shows the benefit of Goldman's decision to stick with private-equity investing after the financial crisis. Most big banks exited this activity as regulation stiffened. But Goldman, which has merchant banking deep in its DNA, stayed put and is even raising a new fund, its first since 2007, to buy companies.

Despite some duds -- Goldman backed a Texas utility that later went bankrupt in one of the biggest buyout flops of all time -- private-equity investing has been a moneymaker in recent years. Goldman has invested in a Japanese theme park, a U.S. network of home contractors and a Danish outsourcing company.

The Volcker rule, enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul in 2010, prevented banks from contributing more than 3% of the money raised by private-equity funds. Goldman adapted by doing deals directly from its balance sheet, rather than from a fund where its own money was mixed with investors. Doing deals this way complied with the letter, if not the spirit, of the Volcker rule, though it also limited Goldman to making mostly minority investments rather than the splashy takeovers it once pursued.

Goldman also raised new credit and real-estate funds, where there are more bargains to be found than in a red-hot stock market.

As the Trump administration weighs rolling back parts of Dodd-Frank, many expect the Volcker rule to be high on its list.

Goldman's new fund, which has already raised $4.5 billion and is expected to close later this year closer to its cap of $8 billion, includes just a sliver of Goldman's own money. It recasts the bank more like a plain-vanilla asset manager, investing other people's money and making its own profits largely on fees.

Goldman over the past months sold 20% of its stake as TransUnion shares reached records, climbing 24% so far this year, regulatory filings show. Taking into account stock sales and dividends, Goldman has so far pocketed nearly $600 million in profit and still owns a 25% stake in TransUnion valued at $1.7 billion.

The firm also has earned some $50 million in fees for underwriting TransUnion's IPO and raising debt for the company -- a unique perk for banks that have buyout arms.

TransUnion's contribution to the Wall Street firm extends beyond investment gains. Goldman's new consumer-lending platform, Marcus, was developed inside its private-equity arm by many of the same people who spearheaded the TransUnion investment, according to people familiar with the matter.

Their experience running TransUnion, which includes a seat on its board for a Goldman partner, helped build the bank's familiarity with consumer credit, some of the people said.

Goldman and private-equity firm Advent International bought TransUnion for about $3 billion five years ago, putting in $550 million each and borrowing the rest. The privately held company in previous decades had been owned by the Pritzker family of Chicago.

As Goldman and Advent dug into TransUnion's business, they found the fastest-growing revenue was coming from the company's dealings with online-lending startups, people familiar with the investment said.

These companies, such as LendingClub Corp. and Prosper Marketplace Inc., were using information from credit bureaus to find and vet potential borrowers. They were increasingly hungry for data that could pinpoint borrowers who traditional lenders might overlook or overcharge.

TransUnion's new owners doubled down on these clients. They recruited Jim Peck, a big-data enthusiast who had run LexisNexis Risk Solutions, as chief executive.

TransUnion began appearing at fintech conferences. It rebranded itself with a techy, purposeful vibe, wrapping its initials, a lowercase "tu," in an @ sign. "We're not just a credit bureau; we're a force for good," chirped a 2015 video.

One acquisition tracks public records to help with fraud enforcement related to online shopping, among other things. Another uses utility payments, cellphone billing records and other data points to identify creditworthy borrowers who lenders might have overlooked, either because they have little or no debt history or potential red flags on their traditional credit reports.

TransUnion's costs grew by 56% between 2011 and 2014, twice as rapidly as revenue over that period. That is unusual for a company owned by private-equity firms, which often cut their way to profits.

All three credit-reporting firms -- Equifax, Experian and TransUnion -- compile alternative data on consumers that go beyond the loan payments found in credit reports. And in some ways, TransUnion was late to the game.

Although it has been playing catch-up, TransUnion has found ways to stand apart from its rivals in terms of how it delivers its data to lenders. One example is Prama, a platform TransUnion launched last year that allows lenders to play with data. With a few clicks, lenders can see if their delinquency figures are better than peer groups. They can also find locations where delinquencies are on the rise.

By the time of its IPO in 2015, TransUnion had 30 million gigabytes of data, growing at 25% a year and ranging from voter registration in India to drivers' accident records in the U.S. The company's IPO documents boasted that it had anticipated the arrival of online lenders and "created solutions that catered to these emerging providers."

Markets & Finance: First Trust's ETFs Are Unsung Force

Some of the biggest action in exchange-traded funds last month took place in two little-known First Trust ETFs.

The biggest trader? First Trust Advisors LP itself.

The trading was triggered by a rebalancing of the $2.5 billion First Trust Dorsey Wright Focus 5 ETF. The fund tracks a Dorsey, Wright & Associates index that analyzes recent market trends for signs of momentum, buying sectors and industries with the most substantial recent gains. It owns just five ETFs at a time, all picked from the First Trust lineup.

Last month, energy stocks dropped out of the index, while the banking sector gained favor, reflecting its postelection rally. The shift prompted the Dorsey Wright ETF to sell one First Trust ETF and buy another.

As a result, assets in a First Trust ETF that buys bank stocks swelled 34-fold in March to $910.6 million, marking the six-month-old fund as one of the most-successful recent launches in the ETF industry. During the month, First Trust Energy AlphaDEX ETF, which invests in energy companies, lost almost two-thirds of its assets.

Dorsey Wright, now a unit of Nasdaq Inc., has long been a favorite among investment advisers. Some follow its strategy without using the Dorsey Wright ETF, buying and selling the underlying First Trust ETFs themselves.

First Trust created the ETF in 2014 because customers wanted the popular Focus 5 strategy packaged into one product, said Ryan Issakainen, senior vice president and ETF strategist with First Trust. Bundling the ETFs saves investors the trouble of rebalancing themselves and offers some tax benefits. First Trust also offers a second Dorsey Wright ETF that makes many of the same trades.

But analysts have questioned the Dorsey Wright ETF for its high fees, market-roiling trades and subpar returns.

"There are significant benefits for First Trust for launching products that fit into this strategy, but some investors don't necessarily know what they're buying," said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual-fund research for CFRA, a consulting firm.

It has been one of First Trust's most successful ETFs. It is also one of its most expensive because First Trust charges investors both for the Dorsey Wright ETF and for the five First Trust ETFs it owns, pushing the total cost to $89 a year for every $10,000 invested. The average investor in an index-tracking stock ETF pays $20, according to Morningstar.

The ETF's trading also stokes interest in First Trust's other ETFs. Its recent purchase of the First Trust Nasdaq Bank ETF made the new fund more appealing to investors who won't buy small, thinly traded products.

While funds of funds are common in the mutual-fund industry, they are relatively rare in ETFs, accounting for 191 U.S. funds with combined assets of $35 billion out of a $2.8 trillion market, according to XTF, a market-analytics firm. Some of the ETFs, especially leveraged equity funds, buy ETFs from several issuers while others invest only in in-house products.

One common use of funds of funds is target-date retirement products. BlackRock Inc., for example, offers several iShares ETFs that invest in other iShares ETFs based on risk models that range from conservative to aggressive.

The strategy can leave ETFs with high concentrations in other funds. The iShares allocation ETFs combined own as much as 68% of some of the underlying ETFs, according to FactSet. The Dorsey Wright rebalance leaves the ETF as the biggest shareholder in the First Trust bank fund.

The Dorsey Wright rebalance is notable because funds of funds rarely make such a large investment in a new product, said Mr. Rosenbluth. It raises concerns about its potential price impact on the bank ETF once its biggest investor bails out, Mr. Rosenbluth said.

It is also one of its most expensive because First Trust charges investors both for the Dorsey Wright ETF and for the five First Trust ETFs it owns, pushing the total cost to $89 a year for every $10,000 invested. The average investor in an index-tracking stock ETF pays $20, according to Morningstar.

The ETF's trading also stokes interest in First Trust's other ETFs. Its recent purchase of the First Trust Nasdaq Bank ETF made the new fund more appealing to investors who won't buy small, thinly traded products.

While funds of funds are common in the mutual-fund industry, they are relatively rare in ETFs, accounting for 191 U.S. funds with combined assets of $35 billion out of a $2.8 trillion market, according to XTF, a market analytics firm. Some of the ETFs, especially leveraged equity funds, buy ETFs from several issuers while others invest only in in-house products.

One common use of funds of funds is target-date retirement products. BlackRock Inc., for example, offers several iShares ETFs that invest in other iShares ETFs based on risk models that range from conservative to aggressive.

The strategy can leave ETFs with high concentrations in other funds. The iShares allocation ETFs combined own as much as 68% of some of the underlying ETFs, according to FactSet. The Dorsey Wright rebalance leaves the ETF as the biggest shareholder in the First Trust bank fund.

The Dorsey Wright rebalance is notable because funds of funds rarely make such a large investment in a new product, said Mr. Rosenbluth. It raises concerns about its potential price impact on the bank ETF once its biggest investor bails out, said Mr. Rosenbluth.

Meet an Unsung Force in Stock Trading: First Trust's ETF of ETFs; While funds of funds are common in the mutual-fund industry, they are relatively rare in ETFs

Some of the biggest action in exchange-traded funds last month took place in two little-known First Trust ETFs.

The biggest trader? First Trust Advisors LP itself.

The trading was triggered by a rebalancing of the $2.5 billion First Trust Dorsey Wright Focus 5 ETF. The fund tracks a Dorsey, Wright & Associates index that analyzes recent market trends for signs of momentum, buying sectors and industries with the most substantial recent gains. It owns just five ETFs at a time, all picked from the First Trust lineup.

Last month, energy stocks dropped out of the index while the banking sector gained favor, reflecting its postelection rally. The shift prompted the Dorsey Wright ETF to sell one First Trust ETF and buy another.

As a result, assets in a First Trust ETF that buys bank stocks swelled 34-fold in March to $910.6 million, marking the six-month-old fund as one of the most successful recent launches in the ETF industry. During the month, the First Trust Energy AlphaDEX ETF, which invests in energy companies, lost almost two-thirds of its assets.

Dorsey Wright, now a unit of Nasdaq Inc., has long been a favorite among investment advisers. Some follow its strategy without using the Dorsey Wright ETF, buying and selling the underlying First Trust ETFs themselves.

First Trust created the ETF in 2014 because customers wanted the popular Focus 5 strategy packaged into one product, said Ryan Issakainen, senior vice president and ETF strategist with First Trust. Bundling the ETFs saves investors the trouble of rebalancing themselves and offers some tax benefits. First Trust also offers a second Dorsey Wright ETF that makes many of the same trades.

But analysts have long questioned the Dorsey Wright ETF for its high fees, market-roiling trades and subpar returns.

"There are significant benefits for First Trust for launching products that fit into this strategy, but some investors don't necessarily know what they're buying," said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual-fund research for CFRA, a consulting firm.

It has been one of First Trust's most successful ETFs. It is also one of its most expensive because First Trust charges investors both for the Dorsey Wright ETF and for the five First Trust ETFs it owns, pushing the total cost to $89 a year for every $10,000 invested. The average investor in an index-tracking stock ETF pays $20, according to Morningstar.

The ETF's trading also stokes interest in First Trust's other ETFs. Its recent purchase of the First Trust Nasdaq Bank ETF made the new fund more appealing to investors who won't buy small, thinly traded products.

While funds of funds are common in the mutual-fund industry, they are relatively rare in ETFs, accounting for 191 U.S. funds with combined assets of $35 billion out of a $2.8 trillion market, according to XTF, a market analytics firm. Some of the ETFs, especially leveraged equity funds, buy ETFs from several issuers while others invest only in in-house products.

One common use of funds of funds is target-date retirement products. BlackRock Inc., for example, offers several iShares ETFs that invest in other iShares ETFs based on risk models that range from conservative to aggressive.

The strategy can leave ETFs with highly concentrated positions in other funds. The iShares allocation ETFs combined own as much as 68% of some of the underlying ETFs, according to FactSet. The Dorsey Wright rebalance leaves the ETF as the biggest shareholder in the First Trust bank fund.

Concentrated ownership hasn't been a problem because the allocation funds don't turn over that much, and the underlying stocks in the ETFs within the fund are easily traded, said Paul Lohrey, head of U.S. iShares product development and consulting.

The Dorsey Wright rebalance is notable because funds of funds rarely make such a large investment in a new product, said Mr. Rosenbluth. It raises concerns about its potential price impact on the bank ETF once its biggest investor bails out, said Mr. Rosenbluth.

"The strategy doesn't usually hold another fund that has just come to market like this," said Mr. Issakainen. "It's an unusual case, but we're still very comfortable with it."

Mr. Issakainen said the size of the ETF is less important than the tradability of the companies the fund invests in. While the Dorsey Wright ETF only owns five other ETFs, those funds invest in more than 200 stocks.

The Dorsey Wright ETF has shed $2.1 billion since the end of 2015 as momentum strategies fell out of favor. The goal is to capture the gains of a hot sector, but sell before it hits bottom. Such funds won't buy at the lowest price or sell at the highest, but try to come close enough to beat the wider market.

Momentum systems tend to do well when there is a clear and lasting market trend, but can suffer when sentiment changes quickly, as it has in the past year.

The Dorsey Wright ETF's recent rebalance is a case in point. The fund sold its energy ETF long after its peak, denting returns. Over the past year, it would have been more profitable to buy and hold an S&P 500 index fund.

Luxury retail exodus hits New York property; Landlords have been slow to adapt leasing strategies after the departure of upmarket brands from 'vanity' store fronts

Manhattan's Bleecker Street has seen better days. Retail rents on the main drag of Greenwich Village had soared for five years, boosted by a frothy investment market and booming tourism as New York recovered from the Lehman crisis. But in recent months upmarket retailers, facing steeper losses to online shopping and ever pricier rents, have shut their stores.

Marc Jacobs, Jimmy Choo and Ralph Lauren helped transform Bleecker Street from a bohemian centre to a high-end shopping paradise. Their departure, along with other luxury brands, has left two or three vacant shops on each block.

"The pioneers that made that street are pulling back," says Faith Consolo, chairwoman of the retail leasing and sales division at Douglas Elliman, a real estate group. "It really casts a shadow. I haven't seen a cycle like this before."

Similar trends are emerging along the priciest shopping corridors in the US, including Robertson Boulevard in Los Angeles and the design district in Miami, as retailers pull back from "vanity" real estate.

They have been deterred partly by runaway rental growth - as much as 50 per cent in five years, according to Cushman & Wakefield, a property consultancy.

But beyond the cyclical patterns of real estate, there is a structural shift, analysts say, as online sales draw retailers' focus away from expensive store sites. While a presence on a glitzy street was once deemed a necessary marketing expense, some luxury retailers are adapting to a new kind of shopper who prefers browsing the internet.

The Amazon factor is hurting retailers' margins, says Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm, "so they are spending more on their own ecommerce platforms rather than bricks-and-mortar divisions".

Meanwhile, although consumer confidence surveys appear positive, sales growth overall has dropped . The signs of weakness are leading some landlords to offload properties.

On New York's Fifth Avenue, the world's most expensive shopping street, vacancy rates have jumped from 10 per cent a year ago to 16 per cent, according to C&W. Rents have fallen for the first time since the recession "and the trend is not over", it warns.

Vacancy rates across the SoHo district have climbed to 18 per cent, from 12 per cent a year ago, according to Jones Lang LaSalle, an investment manager that specialises in commercial property.

Retailers' newfound caution has had a "very significant and fast" negative impact on retail property, says Chris Conlon, chief executive of Acadia Realty, a real estate investment trust.

It is not just prestigious streets that have been hit. Malls are also hurting, as chains such as Sears and Macy's shut hundreds of stores. Analysts at Green Street Advisors say "low growth is the new normal", while rents are becoming decoupled from tenants' revenue growth as sales move online.

"[Rents] are at a price point now that exceeds what retail sales can perform," says Spencer Levy, global head of research for CBRE, a real estate group. He notes that a stronger US dollar also dents sales in New York, where deep-pocketed foreigners historically flock for deals.

Investors have caught the gloomy mood. Shares in US retail Reits have tumbled almost 25 per cent since a peak last August, according to Dow Jones, compared with an 11 per cent decline across all Reits. Capital values in the private market have yet to mirror that shift, but listed groups often act as a bellwether.

Meanwhile hedge funds are building significant short positions against the sector. Short interest against international retail Reits has more than doubled to $12.5bn since November, according to S3 data. Of this, $1.5bn of short positions are held against Simon Properties, the US's largest retail Reit.

"Looking back over several years, this is the first time I have seen [short interest] at over $10bn in aggregate," says Mr Dusaniwsky.

The nervousness is also affecting the non-listed sector. Thor Equities, a private equity real estate group, is seeking to sell three Fifth Avenue properties bought between 2007 and 2011 after failing to find tenants for much of the space put loan repayments at risk.

"If you want big tenants . . . there aren't that many that want that size footprint any more," says Jedd Nero, principal at the New York office of Avison Young, a real estate broker.

Thor chiefs "did not get the numbers they wanted" and are looking to lease out the spaces, says someone familiar with their thinking.

One of the properties, a 19-storey office and retail building at 590 Fifth Avenue, has had its asking price cut from $170m last year to $150m, according to Bill Shanahan, a broker at CBRE who is selling the property. Plans to convert it into a flagship retail space failed to tempt a tenant.

Analysts and brokers say landlords have been slow to adapt their leasing strategies despite an overhang of supply, leading to "very lengthy" deal negotiations, according to C&W.

Mr Conlon says: "If you bought in SoHo or Fifth Avenue in 2015 and you underwrote that real estate to capture that kind of growth, then it's kind of like musical chairs: the music stops and you're probably disappointed today."

As rents continue to slip, some landlords and tenants have agreed to meet in the middle, says Patrick Smith, vice-chairman of JLL's retail broker, who predicts that "by the end of this year you're going to see more transactions".

However, most retailers are staying on the sidelines, says Mr Nero: "No one wants to catch a falling knife."

There are pockets of excessive lending in the market. Green Street says Reits that own malls of the less desirable "B" and "C" grades are "carrying too much debt and are ill-equipped for a sizeable decline in asset values". However, more prudent lending since the 2008 crisis should limit the potential for distress.

Meanwhile the structural shift towards ecommerce looks likely to have some way to run. Green Street estimates that about 20 per cent of sales for "mall-like products" such as clothing have shifted online - and forecasts that the proportion will rise above 30 per cent in the next five years.

Other prime retail locations may also have to confront this shift. Rents in Hong Kong's Causeway Bay are weakening and on the Champs-lyses in Paris they have been flat over the past year, according to C&W - although downturns in tourism were bigger factors than online sales.

In New York it is difficult to gauge how long the correction will last because there have been few deals to draw upon, according to Mr Conlon. "We're in the middle of it," he says.

For spaces in SoHo that were renting for $1,000 a square foot at the market peak, rents have dropped as much as 20 per cent. "Retailers are saying: I'm not sure what I should pay, so I'm going to wait," says Mr Conlon.

He says Acadia is preparing to buy as markets become distressed.

Avison Young agrees. "You're seeing a seismic shift in retail, and you'll continue to see consolidation as tenants that can't figure it out go out of business," says Mr Nero.

"It's not the way it was in the past 100 years, where you put a product on the shelf and everyone comes in."

Glass-Steagall Where Are the Votes?

Last summer, supporters of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall law got a boost when both the Republican and Democratic party platforms endorsed a return of the policy. The biggest roadblock: Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee and favorite to win the presidency. Her support was "https://www.wsj.com/articles/clinton-staffers-wrestled-with-glass-steagall-position-wikileaks-emails-show-1476137650"; she didn't include it in her Wall Street proposals.

Mrs. Clinton lost, and now President Donald Trump's administration keeps saying it wants to work with lawmakers on a new version of the law, which forced the separation of traditional banking from investment banking before its repeal in 1999. First, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-treasury-nominee-mnuchin-backs-21st-century-glass-steagall-for-banks-1484857155". Then it was White House "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fdic-official-details-idea-for-a-new-glass-steagall-law-1489429800". And this week, Gary Cohn , the White House National Economic Council director, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gary-cohn-backs-breaking-up-big-banks-1491491219".

One key source of support is missing: congressional Republicans. If they start to jump on board, banks should look out.

Mr. Cohn's statement was significant because as a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc . executive, he is perceived to be a firewall against populist policies. "With him supporting Glass-Steagall's restoration, there is no one in the [Trump] inner circle left to fight it," said Cowen & Co. analyst Jaret Seiberg.

For now, it doesn't appear that Mr. Cohn or anyone else on Team Trump is fighting for a return to Glass-Steagall. His comments Wednesday, in a private meeting with members of the Senate Banking Committee, came in response to a question from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.). Most of the discussion focused on tax issues, according to people who were there.

The Trump administration hasn't articulated any Glass-Steagall-like proposal, and has given conflicting signals about what it would back. People who heard Mr. Cohn's remarks said he voiced support for a simple separation of the two businesses. Yet Mr. Mnuchin said in January that "separating out banks and investment banks" "https://www.wsj.com/articles/under-trump-u-s-banks-could-get-a-british-makeover-1485345603", suggesting he wanted some less draconian version of the policy.

Congress would need to sort out the details, and there is little evidence that Republicans in power on Capitol Hill want to spend their time doing so. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) not someone who shies away from supporting controversial policies is advocating a different idea for cracking down on big banks, focusing on higher capital requirements. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R., Idaho) seems more eager to tackle housing-finance policy than to pick a fight with the nation's largest banks.

Glass-Steagall boosters say Messrs. Hensarling and Crapo could win more support for their ideas by adding the bank-breakup policy to a legislative package. But do those votes exist?

Ms. Warren's 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act, reintroduced on Thursday, had 10 Senate co-sponsors last Congress, with Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) the lone Republican. A similar dynamic was seen in the House, where a comparable bill from Rep. Michael Capuano (D., Mass.) had two Republicans among its nine sponsors.

There used to be little incentive for Ms. Warren, Mr. Capuano or their co-sponsors to beat down lawmakers' doors gathering support for their idea. After all, the Obama administration wasn't interested in making it reality.

Team Trump's consistent encouragement has changed that dynamic. Now it is up to Glass-Steagall proponents to translate that change into votes.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Gary Cohn Backs Breaking Up Big Banks

By Ryan Tracy and Emily Glazer

WASHINGTON The former Goldman Sachs Group Inc . executive who is the top White House economic adviser told lawmakers he could support legislation breaking up the largest U.S. banks, according to people familiar with the matter, a development that bolsters congressional efforts to reinstate the Depression-era Glass-Steagall law.

The comments by Gary Cohn , director of the White House National Economic Council, came in a private meeting with lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee Wednesday, these people said. His remarks were reported earlier by Bloomberg.

Mr. Cohn was asked by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) whether the administration planned to carry out a promise included in the Republican 2016 platform and made by the Trump campaign to restore the law separating traditional commercial banking from Wall Street investment banking. The law was repealed in 1999.

Mr. Cohn expressed an openness to working with Ms. Warren on the issue, and said he could support a simple policy completely separating the two businesses, these people said. There are various ideas for restoring some form of Glass-Steagall, running the gamut from splitting apart firms completely to separating their various operations under an umbrella holding company.

A White House spokeswoman said Mr. Cohn "was simply discussing the president's previously stated position," adding, "The president spoke to the need for a simplification of the banking system on the campaign trail, what he called a  21st century Glass-Steagall,' to make it easier for businesses to grow and create jobs in their communities."

Mr. Cohn's comments are consistent with other statements by Trump administration officials. But it isn't clear how much support there is for the idea among Republicans more broadly. Ms. Warren on Thursday reintroduced a bill called the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act. Three other senators joined her, including one Republican, Sen. John McCain of Arizona. In the last Congress, Mr. McCain was the only Republican to sponsor the bill.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has also said the administration is open to implementing some version of President Donald Trump's campaign promise. But in his Jan. 17 confirmation hearing, he expressed concern that "separating out banks and investment banks right now under Glass-Steagall would have very big implications to the liquidity in the capital markets and banks being able to perform necessary lending."

While the Trump team has endorsed the Glass-Steagall idea, it hasn't come forward with its own proposal. Meanwhile, Treasury officials are meeting with financial-industry officials to discuss ways to roll back rules adopted under the Obama administration. They are due to make recommendations to the White House in early June.

Some observers said they didn't view Mr. Cohn's comments as a threat.

"We continue to believe that a return of some form of Glass-Steagall remains more of a headline risk rather than a real policy risk and we think the odds are against the reinstatement of the law," Brian Gardner, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said in a note to clients Thursday.

"I don't think we're concerned," said one banker at a large firm. The bank is "pleased with the direction" of Mr. Trump's administration and its executives aren't racing to change strategy or make a big new lobbying push. "It's the same day as it was yesterday," this person said. "It's not a time to go crazy."

Tim Pawlenty, president of the Financial Services Roundtable trade group, said Thursday: "Large financial institutions play a role in the American economy other institutions are not able to fill. We are working with Congress and the administration on a common-sense approach to financial regulation modernization and look forward to more progress."

Mr. Cohn's comments will give Ms. Warren and other supporters of the idea more momentum. He was until recently the No. 2 executive at Goldman Sachs , the Wall Street investment bank that took on more traditional banking businesses and the additional regulation that comes with them after converting to a bank holding company to receive government assistance during the 2008 financial crisis.

Mr. Cohn "was the most likely obstacle within the Trump White House" to restoring Glass-Steagall, said Jaret Seiberg, an analyst with Cowen & Co., in a note to clients. "With him supporting Glass-Steagall's restoration, there is no one in the inner circle left to fight it."

Mr. Seiberg said banks may be underestimating the threat: "At some point the market is going to have to accept that the Trump administration is serious about restoring the Glass-Steagall separation between commercial and investment banking."

Glass-Steagall was adopted in the 1930s as a way to keep securities businesses separate from taxpayer-insured banks. The separation between lending and investment banking slowly eroded in the latter part of the 20th century, as banks won regulatory exceptions to diversify their businesses.

Since Congress repealed the law in 1999, liberals have pushed for reinstating it, calling such a move a simple way to make the economy more stable by removing a taxpayer backstop from risky activities. Proponents of bringing back the law also say it would diminish the size and political influence of large Wall Street banks.

The 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory-overhaul law took a half-step toward Glass-Steagall when it mandated the Volcker rule, which bars banks from certain activities unless they are trading on behalf of their customers. Many banks have since closed so-called proprietary trading desks.

The Glass-Steagall idea hasn't gained broad support yet, even among Democrats. Former Federal Reserve Gov. Daniel Tarullo , the Fed regulatory guru who stepped down Wednesday, was asked about Glass-Steagall earlier this week. He pointed out that in 2008, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers  two investment banks without traditional lending businesses caused significant financial stress.

"Just by separating things doesn't mean people stay out of trouble," he said, adding that there would be costs to forcing banks to separate and lose the potential business advantages of combining their operations. "If you are going to have those costs and still have financial stability problems &then maybe we are not getting much after all."

BOE's Carney Says Brexit Will Test Commitment to Globalization

By Jason Douglas

LONDON The U.K.'s exit from the European Union represents "a litmus test" for major economies' commitment to a robust, global financial system, the governor of the Bank of England said Friday, as the central bank ordered foreign lenders based in London to present comprehensive contingency plans that cover a messy Brexit divorce.

In a speech in London, Mark Carney said the global financial system stands at "a fork in the road," where one path leads to continued cooperation between regulators across borders and the free flow of capital world-wide, while another leads to greater protectionism, a fragmenting of the financial system and higher costs for borrowers.

"On one path, we can build a more effective, resilient system on the new pillars of responsible financial globalization. On the other, countries could turn inward and reduce reliance on each other's financial systems," Mr. Carney said during a speech at the London offices of Thomson Reuters Corp ., according to a text of his remarks published by the central bank.

"The net result would be less reliable and more expensive financing for households and businesses, and very likely lower growth and higher risks in all our economies."

Mr. Carney said coming Brexit talks between the U.K. and the EU will test leaders' resolve to maintain an open and global financial system. London is "Europe's investment banker," Mr. Carney said, and the two sides in the talks are "ideally placed" to carve out a deal that keeps capital flowing seamlessly around Europe. They already share common standards and regulators work closely together, he said.

A far-reaching deal between the U.K. and the EU on financial services would offer other countries a template to emulate in bilateral free-trade deals, he added. "Such an approach could be applied more broadly to the immense benefit of the global economy," Mr. Carney said.

His remarks underscore the high stakes for the U.K. in maintaining London's pre-eminent role in Europe's financial system after it formally leaves the EU, expected in early 2019. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May has said she wants financial services included in a "new, comprehensive bold and ambitious" free-trade accord between London and Brussels. But European officials have signaled they want to reduce the EU's reliance on London's capital markets after Brexit, and some banks are already planning to shift some operations to other member states.

Mr. Carney said the BOE has written to London-based banks, including those headquartered in the U.S., to demand details of their contingency planning surrounding Brexit.

In a letter to bank executives, BOE deputy governor for prudential regulation Sam Woods said that planning has been "uneven" across bank boardrooms and hasn't sufficiently addressed the risk that Brexit talks collapse and the U.K. exits the EU with no deal.

Banks have until July 14 to update the BOE on their plans, the central bank said.

WSJ Pro: Fed's Kashkari Rebuts Dimon on  Too Big to Fail'

By Gabriel T. Rubin

The Federal Reserve 's Neel Kashkari pushed back against claims by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. chief James Dimon that the problem of "too big to fail" banks had been solved, arguing that the issue is "alive and well" and that large banks still hold too little capital to absorb losses during a crisis.

Mr. Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, made the argument in a blog post Thursday. His rebuttal came two days after Mr. Dimon's annual shareholder letter, in which the chairman of the U.S.'s largest bank by market capitalization argued that "it was clear that the banks have too much capital."

Mr. Kashkari, who since assuming his position at the Minneapolis Fed last year has made solving "too big to fail" a signature focus, dismissed Mr. Dimon's contention that current capital standards are restraining lending and economic growth.

"The truth is that borrowing costs for homeowners and businesses are near record lows," he wrote.

Mr. Kashkari is an advocate of raising equity capital requirements substantially to avoid the possibility of a taxpayer-financed bailout for a large financial institution in the event of a severe financial crisis.

He did agree with Mr. Dimon, however, that financial regulations should be made less complex, a goal he believes could be achieved with a simpler, higher capital threshold.

Two Former Barclays Employees Acquitted in Libor Retrial

By Philip Georgiadis

Two former Barclays PLC employees have been acquitted of conspiracy to defraud in relation to the manipulation of Libor interest rates after a retrial in London.

The acquittals conclude the U.K. Serious Fraud Office 's final outstanding trial over Libor the London interbank offered rate although the agency said its investigation is continuing.

Ryan Michael Reich was acquitted Wednesday and Stylianos Contogoulas was acquitted Thursday morning, a spokeswoman for the SFO confirmed.

The monthlong retrial of the two traders came after a jury in July last year failed to reach a verdict on the two men, while convicting three other former Barclays employees in connection with the investigation.

Mr. Reich said in a statement that he had acted in accordance with the rules at the time. "I am saddened that it has taken so long to expose the case against me, a junior trader just doing my job over a decade ago, as being totally without foundation," Mr. Reich said.

Mr. Contogoulas's legal team didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Barclays declined to comment.

British citizens Jonathan Mathew and Jay Merchant, as well as American Alex Pabon, were all convicted of conspiracy to defraud in last year's trial. Messrs. Merchant and Pabon were both Libor traders, while Mr. Mathew was a submitter.

Peter Johnson, a senior submitter and head U.S. dollar cash trader at Barclays, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud in October 2014. Tom Hayes, a former bank trader at both UBS Group AG and Citigroup Inc ., was found guilty in August 2015 of rigging Libor and sentenced to 14 years in prison, though that was later reduced to 11 years.

The SFO has brought charges against 19 individuals in relation to Libor and the separate Euribor rate. Of those, eight have now been acquitted, four have been convicted and one pleaded guilty.

Six individuals from Deutsche Bank and Barclays have been charged and will stand trial over conspiracy to defraud in relation to Euribor.

The Wall Street Journal first drew attention nine years ago to industry concerns around how Libor was being set, sparking a global probe that has resulted in multiple convictions and billions of dollars in penalties paid by banks. Barclays paid $450 million to U.S. and U.K. authorities in 2012 and admitted that traders and managers had sought to rig the rate.

Data Clash Heats Up Between Banks and New York Stock Exchange

By Alexander Osipovich

Some of Wall Street's biggest firms are balking at an attempt by the New York Stock Exchange to assert greater control over market data a behind-the-scenes spat that highlights the growing importance of Big Data in today's financial markets.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co ., Citigroup Inc ., Goldman Sachs Group Inc . and electronic traders Virtu Financial Inc. and KCG Holdings Inc . are among the firms concerned about the exchange's move, people familiar with the situation said. Virtu confirmed its opposition to NYSE's move, while none of the others would speak on the record.

The dispute centers on a new contract called the NYSE Master User Agreement, which the exchange operator is requiring firms to sign to keep trading on its markets.

At the heart of the dispute is legal language about who owns the data that brokers submit to the exchange when they buy and sell stocks. The contract implies that NYSE owns the data. Brokers and big trading firms say the data are rightfully theirs.

Exchanges aggregate such data and sell it in the form of high-speed feeds often to the same firms whose trading activity generated the data in the first place. Such data feeds have become a growing source of revenue for exchanges in recent years, prompting complaints from Wall Street firms that they are being overcharged.

"This dispute demonstrates the fundamental point market participants have been making about the exchange's unchecked control over market data and its pricing," Virtu Chief Executive Doug Cifu said in an email.

"You'd be hard pressed to find another industry where a government-licensed entity can take your intellectual property and sell it back to you at an arbitrarily high markup," Mr. Cifu said.

The master user agreement, a seven-page document available on NYSE's website, differs from similar contracts from the Big Board's competitors, lawyers say.

"It appears that NYSE could be going further than other exchanges," said David Franasiak, a lawyer who reviewed the agreement for The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Franasiak is a principal at Williams & Jensen PLLC, a law and lobbying firm that has worked for brokerage firms, but he isn't involved in the current dispute.

Dozens of other firms have already signed the agreement, a person close to NYSE said.

The clash began early this year when NYSE released an update to the contract, replacing a previous version that brokers had found acceptable and surprising them with the new language, according to one of the people familiar with the dispute.

Upset brokers reached out to one another and held conference calls, including as recently as March 30, people briefed on the discussions said.One person said NYSE was set to take part in the call last week but backed out. The person close to NYSE said the exchange has been engaged in ongoing dialogue with the firms.

Another call involved the Securities and Exchange Commission , which is monitoring the situation and remaining neutral, said a person familiar with the matter.

NYSE has linked the agreement to a technology overhaul called Pillar. The market operator has told firms they must sign the agreement to use new, faster networking hardware being introduced as part of the Pillar rollout.

The deadline to sign it was repeatedly pushed back, according to notices emailed to traders and posted on NYSE's website.

The new hardware was initially set to go live on NYSE's Arca marketplace on Feb. 13, but that was delayed to March 13 and then March 27. Most recently, a March 20 glitch on Arca prompted another delay. NYSE has yet to announce the new date.

Controversy over the cost of market data has been brewing for years. Brokers complain that exchanges like NYSE, which was a nonprofit until 2006, have become more aggressive about raising data fees since they turned into for-profit corporations.

NYSE's owner, Intercontinental Exchange Inc . or ICE , has beefed up its data business since completing its acquisition of the Big Board in 2013. Last year, 44% of ICE 's net revenues came from market data sales and related fees, up from 9% in 2011. Much of that increase is due to acquisitions of data companies, but some is due to price increases and new data products, according to the company's SEC filings.

Stock exchanges are "exploiting their monopoly over market data," the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association , a lobbying group for banks, brokers and asset managers, said in a filing submitted to the SEC last year as part of a long-running legal battle with NYSE and Nasdaq Inc . over fee increases.

ICE has said in the past that its data fees are reasonable, and exchanges reject claims that they are abusing their market power.

In many of the user agreements for U.S. exchanges, firms give up some rights to market data in order to be allowed to trade on the exchange. There is typically a provision in which users grant the exchange a license to take their raw trading data and resell it in the form of aggregated data products, provided that the identities of the people or firms behind the trades aren't revealed.

NYSE competitors Nasdaq , Bats and IEX Group Inc . all have such clauses in their user agreements. They also contain boilerplate language stating that the user "retains all ownership and other rights" to the data they submit to the exchange.

But the NYSE master user agreement contains no such provision. Instead, it states that market data on the exchange is the property of NYSE. It also lacks a licensing provision in which users grant the exchange the right to use their data even though past NYSE user agreements have contained such language.

The contract "runs counter to the position that a lot of firms and Sifma have taken with respect to who owns market data," said Eric Noll, chief executive of Convergex, a New York-based brokerage. Mr. Noll said he was aware of the dispute over the master user agreement, although Convergex isn't among the firms that have been fighting it.

Squabbling over market data costs appears unlikely to cease even if the fight over NYSE's contract cools down. "It's a continuing, ongoing feud," Mr. Noll said.

Lehman Floats RMBS Settlement Worth at Least $1 Billion

By Jonathan Randles

Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc . is floating a settlement that would pay at least $1 billion to institutional investors holding debt tied to soured mortgage loans, as the failed investment bank looks to clear one of the last major hurdles in winding down its affairs more than eight years after filing for bankruptcy.

The proposed settlement, which must be approved by a judge, provides Lehman with a path to resolving a dispute that has dragged on for years over how much it owes for faulty residential mortgages it bundled into securities and sold to investors. A bankruptcy judge will consider approving the settlement in July, according to papers filed Thursday.

The proposed deal would establish the floor of $2.416 billion for the mortgage claims, which under Lehman's plan have recovered more than 39 cents on the dollar.

In a letter sent to trustees, Robert Madden , a Gibbs & Bruns LLP lawyer who represents the financial institutions supporting the deal, said there was no reason the other trustees "could or should refuse this guarantee of a certain recovery of more than a $1 billion in cash, with the opportunity to obtain more."

A bankruptcy judge will determine the final value at a so-called estimation hearing. A handful of financial institutions representing mortgage-backed securitization trusts have argued the value of the claims is much higher and wanted Lehman to set aside $12.14 billion cover them.

The proposed settlement relates to 244 residential mortgage-backed securities trusts issued by Lehman. The trustees allege Lehman misrepresented the quality of the underlying loans.

Trustees have until June 1 to accept the settlement offer, according to court documents. Lawyers representing the trustees didn't respond to a message Thursday seeking comment.

More than a dozen institutional investors holding a share of the residential mortgage debt are backing the deal, court papers say. Supporters include BlackRock Financial Management Inc ., Goldman Sachs Asset Management LP and Pacific Investment Management Co. LLC .

Mr. Madden said the proposed settlement provides a reasonable framework for resolving a dispute that he said has been uniquely challenging and time-consuming because of the size of Lehman's bankruptcy.

The settlement is good for investors because it only sets a floor on the claims and doesn't cap the amount trustees would be able to seek, Mr. Madden said. The underlying claims are based on tens of thousands of individual mortgage loans, he said.

"It really gives the trustee a shot to swing for the fences and, importantly, get this thing over with," Mr. Madden said.

Lawyers for Lehman are asking a bankruptcy judge in New York to set an October trial to determine the value of the claims. Investors would be in line to get a percentage of what the judge determines the final claims are worth based on Lehman's approved chapter 11 repayment plan.

Lehman, once the nation's fourth-largest investment bank, collapsed into the largest bankruptcy ever in September 2008 and its U.S. brokerage business was quickly sold off to Barclays PLC .

A team of bankruptcy professionals under the direction of turnaround firm Alvarez & Marsal managed Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc .'s assets until the holding company's exit from chapter 11 in 2012, when a reorganized company emerged, overseen by a new board.

The remains of the holding company is expected to exist in some form for several more years as it unwinds its remaining holdings.

Brazil Financial Markets Regulator Suspends IPO Over Irregularities

By Luciana Magalhaes

SO PAULO Brazil's market regulator on Thursday suspended the initial public offering of Azul Linhas Areas Brasileiras SA, alleging the airline broke rules regarding the release of information.

Azul, Brazil's third-largest airline by passengers, aimed to raise more than $500 million in the IPO in Brazil and in the U.S., which was set to be priced Thursday night.

But the process was suspended after the regulator, known as the CVM, said in a note that irregular advertising material was used during presentations to investors and confidential information related to demand and pricing of shares was released to the media.

The suspension will last for up to 30 days if the "irregularities" are corrected, the regulator said. Otherwise the sale won't be allowed to proceed. The CVM didn't immediately explain what measures would be needed to permit the sale to go forward.

Azul, created in 2008 by businessman David Neeleman, who also founded U.S. discount carrier JetBlue Airways Corp ., declined to comment on the suspension of its IPO.

The budget airline already had seen three previous efforts to sell shares to the public sink due to economic and political problems in Brazil since 2013.

It expected to sell as many as 72 million preferred shares, for up to 23 reais ($7.37) each in Brazil and as much $21.81 a unit in the U.S., this week.

The company had applied for the shares to trade on the B3 stock exchange in Brazil, which recently changed its name from BM&FBovespa, under the symbol "AZUL4" and on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "AZUL."

WSJ Pro: Iceland's Exit from Capital Controls Brings New Risks, Says Central Bank

By Nina Adam

Iceland's central bank said Thursday that the removal of capital controls on households and business in mid-March proceeded "smoothly," but warned the new environment could bring risks.

Icelandic banks' easier access to foreign credit markets could tempt them to grant loans in a foreign currency to residents who are unprotected against exchange rate swings, the central bank warned.

"If such loans are granted on a large scale, it could undermine the stability of the financial system," the bank said in its biannual financial stability report. It urged parliament to pass legislation that restricted such behavior.

The central bank said economics conditions in Iceland were "favorable," but house prices appeared to have risen faster than wages in the last few months.

Treasury Lifts Sanctions On Two Who Left Blacklisted Company

By Samuel Rubenfeld

The U.S. Treasury Department removed two people on Thursday from its sanctions list. The reason: They don't have any affiliation with a company under sanctions.

Treasury removed Donna MacBain, from the U.K., and Siobhan Hanrahan, from Ireland, from the sanctions list, it said in a notice posted to its website. They were targeted in September 2016 as part of action against Canadian payment processor PacNet Group, which Treasury said at the time is a third-party money launderer on behalf of fraud schemes targeting the elderly and the vulnerable.

PacNet Services Ltd., which serves as a holding company for various PacNet entities, said on its homepage that it categorically rejects the allegation.

"We will vigorously defend ourselves against these unproven allegations which we only learned about on Sept. 22, 2016, through media reports," the company said in the undated message, adding that it is "working to address" the U.S. blacklisting.

A Treasury spokesman said in an email on Thursday that both Ms. MacBain and Ms. Hanrahan "are no longer employed" by PacNet, and neither serves as a corporate officer for any PacNet entity. Moreover, the spokesman said, neither had any assets or property to freeze at the time of their designation.

The spokesman said they "no longer meet the criteria" for sanctions. Treasury removed sanctions in February from two other individuals who had been targeted over links to PacNet.

Separately on Thursday, the U.S. State Department named Abu Anas al-Ghandour as a terrorist, placing sanctions on him. The State Department said he is a military commander for Hamas who leads a brigade for the group in Gaza, and has been involved in many terrorist operations.

Analysis: Not a Dot-Com Bubble, Not 2007, but a Nasty Mix of Both

By James Mackintosh

When the market value of loss-making Tesla Inc . passed that of Ford Motor Co . this week, it was a perfect illustration of investors' love affair with disruptive technologies. Investors seem to have forgotten another valuation comparison they should think about more often: In October 2008, the market value of Mattel Inc ., maker of Matchbox toy cars, passed heavily indebted Ford.

Old hands in the markets like to say that one year in seven investors worry about balance sheets, rather than profit. It has been eight years since that last applied, but as the Federal Reserve starts to discuss running down its own balance sheet, it's a good time to think about corporate indebtedness again.

Companies have been loading up on debt based on two assumptions, shared by investors: that economic growth will be slow, and it will be steady. This is the perfect environment for leverage, as low growth keeps interest rates low relative to inflation, while the expectation of steady growth means few worry about a bad year interrupting repayments.

The danger is that either assumption proves wrong, and the focus shifts back from profit to balance sheet. Such a shift could be ugly, because there is so much more debt than usual being piled up by companies outside the finance sector: The ratio of debt to operating cash flow of the highest-quality U.S. companies is just slightly down from a record reached last year, Morgan Stanley calculates. Given leverage has in the past jumped in recessions, this is particularly unusual.

Rather than expanding overall profit, companies have been boosting the return to shareholders by replacing equity with debt a zero-sum transfer which cannot be repeated indefinitely.

"You've got high returns on equity in the U.S., but they're supported by radically higher levels of leverage so to some extent they're a mirage," says Andrew Lapthorne, head of quantitative equity research at Socit Gnrale .

Consider the bubbles of 2000 and 2007. In 2000, share prices were very (very!) high but debt was relatively expensive. The assumption was that new technology would lead to rapid earnings growth, but it would be volatile and uncertain, so needed to be financed with equity.

The rash of initial public offerings was a natural supply response to the demand for shares, and established companies took advantage too, financing takeovers far more than usual with new equity. The bust that followed was painful, but share prices bore the brunt of the adjustment and the recession was so shallow it barely shows up in the economic data.

Tesla is in some ways a repeat of the dot-com era. A sky-high valuation is justified by the hope that an untested product mass-market electric cars will generate big profits.

In 2007, debt was cheap compared with equity, so companies chose to issue debt to buy back shares, and to finance the takeover boom with loans. Worse, the finance bubble boosted earnings to unsustainable levels and left the banks vulnerable. When the bust came, the assumption that earnings growth was sustainable proved wrong, and the sudden focus on the balance sheet forced companies to replace debt with equity.

Ford was doubly caught out by the 2008 crash, with earnings plunging and debt too high (although unlike rivals General Motors and Chrysler, it didn't go bankrupt). Ford has learned a lesson, with more cash than debt on its automotive balance sheet today, although its finance arm, a separate source of trouble amid the banking collapse, is big again.

Today's market is different from both 2000 and 2007. Equities are expensive, but still look relatively cheaper compared with debt on widely used models which compare bond yields to the "earnings yield," forecast earnings as a percentage of share price. CFOs like to issue whatever investors will pay the most for, and at the moment that is debt, so companies have been selling debt to buy back shares.

If and when there is a nasty surprise from the economy or the Fed, highly valued shares in companies with a lot of debt and a mistaken assumption of solid earnings will be the most vulnerable.

The market isn't yet repeating the 2000 equity bubble or the 2007 debt bubble, but it has some of the worst features of both. If investors turn out to be mistaken in thinking the economic cycle won't turn down for years yet, it's going to hurt.

WSJ Pro: Market Talk: Daily Analysis Roundup

 Glass-Steagall-Like' May Not Be Glass-Steagall

It's possible that a "Glass-Steagall-like change" could increase systemic risk, create unregulated too-big-to-fail firms and put taxpayers on the hook for future bailouts, warns Dennis Kelleher, CEO of Better Markets, a nonprofit organization advocating for financial-industry reform. The White House "could recreate the dangerously un- or under-regulated shadow banking system that existed before the [2008] crisis," which "could incentivize unacceptable risk-taking and moral hazard," Kelleher says. He made his comments in response to reports top White House economic adviser Gary Cohn says he could support legislation for breaking up the largest US banks. Most troubling is the "potential benefit that would be uniquely enjoyed" by Goldman Sachs (GS ), Cohn's former firm, Kelleher says. Glass-Steagall, a law which separated traditional commercial banking from Wall Street investment banking, was repealed in 1999. (Daisy.Maxey@wsj.com; @DaisyMaxey)

House Passes Bill to Promote Online Investing

House overwhelmingly passes legislation that provides some regulatory relief for private investors to join venture capital funds in order to promote online capital raising for small businesses. The legislation amends a 77-year-old investment law so more investors can join a fund without having to register with the SEC. It lifts the threshold required for a fund to register with the SEC from 100 investors to 250 investors. "Excessive regulations give the biggest companies a competitive advantage but undermine entrepreneurs, small business owners, and the investors that back them with capital," House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R, Texas) said in a press release. The bill introduced by Rep. Patrick McHenry (R, NC) is among several proposals meant to spur financial technology, called the "innovation initiative," that McHenry is likely to reintroduce to Congress soon.

A Fresh Wrinkle in the Case Of Jeffrey Lacker

Documents obtained by the activists associated with the Fed Up campaign are raising questions about the timeline as to when the Richmond Fed found out about its former president's role in a leak investigation. The group obtained letters from all of the regional banks from late 2015 dealing with the renomination process regional bank presidents were undergoing at the time. Only the Richmond Fed sent a supplemental letter to the Board of Governors, in a letter dated Jan 7, 2016. The content of the letter is redacted but it stands out because no other bank submitted such a document. Fed Up says this follow up letter suggests "the circumstances regarding Lacker's reappointment were unique, or that new information had come to light." (michael.derby@wsj.com)

CarMax : Credit Tightening Amid Subprime Delinquencies

Used-car seller CarMax (KMX) is seeing a decline in sales financed by third-party finance providers, to whom KMX pays a fee. A "credit tightening" by those providers, lower credit application volume "from customers at the lower end of the credit spectrum" and delayed federal income tax refunds "all contributed to the decline in Tier 3 mix," KMX says. This comes as suprime auto lending has gone sour recently, with the level of such auto loans slipping into delinquency climbing to the highest level since 2010. KMX also reports a $15.4M increase in its provision for loan losses. KMX, which reported better-than-expected profit and revenue, falls 1.5% to $55.85. (joshua.jamerson@wsj.com; @joshjame)

Wells Fargo Overhauls Its Credit-Card-Processing Business

But small-business owners and industry participants say high-pressure sales tactics are common. They add that complex pricing structures and costly early-termination penalties that can lock customers into contracts are also prevalent.

Merchant processors collected about $18.15 billion in debit- and credit-card fees from merchants in 2016, according to the Nilson Report, a newsletter tracking the payments industry. Banks such as Wells Fargo , Bank of America Corp . and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co . are among the biggest players.

Dodd-Frank's Effect on Middle-Class Credit

The Dodd-Frank Act caused a "substantial redistribution" in credit from middle-class to wealthy households by increasing the cost of originating mortgages, find Francesco D'Acunto and Alberto G. Rossi in a "http://conference.nber.org/confer/2017/CFs17/D'Acunto_Rossi.pdf". "Lenders reduced credit to middle-class households by 15%, and increased credit to wealthy households by 21%" between 2010 and 2014, they find. Credit to low-income households was unaffected, which the authors attribute to protections under the Fair Lending Act. The redistribution of credit was particularly high in counties that were more exposed to large lenders.

Republicans Target Retirement Savings

Recent moves by Republican lawmakers and the Trump administration will make it harder for Americans to save for a secure retirement, "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/opinion/rising-risks-for-retirement-savers.html?emc=edit_th_20170406&nl=todaysheadlines&nlid=46659547&_r=1". The House and Senate recently voted to reverse an Obama administration regulation that would allow cities and counties to organize retirement savings plans for private-sector workers without employer plans, and the Trump administration is delaying the effective date of the Labor Department's fiduciary standard rule. "What congressional Republicans and Mr. Trump are doing is looking for ways to line Wall Street's pockets with the retirement savings of working people," the board writes.

Glass-Steagall Where Are the Votes?

Last summer, supporters of the Depression-era Glass-Steagall law got a boost when both the Republican and Democratic party platforms endorsed a return of the policy. The biggest roadblock: Hillary Clinton , the Democratic nominee and favorite to win the presidency. Her support was "https://www.wsj.com/articles/clinton-staffers-wrestled-with-glass-steagall-position-wikileaks-emails-show-1476137650"; she didn't include it in her Wall Street proposals.

Mrs. Clinton lost, and now President Donald Trump 's administration keeps saying it wants to work with lawmakers on a new version of the law, which forced the separation of traditional banking from investment banking before its repeal in 1999. First, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-treasury-nominee-mnuchin-backs-21st-century-glass-steagall-for-banks-1484857155". Then it was White House "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fdic-official-details-idea-for-a-new-glass-steagall-law-1489429800". And this week, Gary Cohn , the White House National Economic Council director, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gary-cohn-backs-breaking-up-big-banks-1491491219".

One key source of support is missing: congressional Republicans. If they start to jump on board, banks should look out.

Mr. Cohn's statement was significant because as a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc . executive, he is perceived to be a firewall against populist policies. "With him supporting Glass-Steagall's restoration, there is no one in the [Trump] inner circle left to fight it," said Cowen & Co . analyst Jaret Seiberg.

For now, it doesn't appear that Mr. Cohn or anyone else on Team Trump is fighting for a return to Glass-Steagall. His comments Wednesday, in a private meeting with members of the Senate Banking Committee, came in response to a question from Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.). Most of the discussion focused on tax issues, according to people who were there.

The Trump administration hasn't articulated any Glass-Steagall-like proposal, and has given conflicting signals about what it would back. People who heard Mr. Cohn's remarks said he voiced support for a simple separation of the two businesses. Yet Mr. Mnuchin said in January that "separating out banks and investment banks" "https://www.wsj.com/articles/under-trump-u-s-banks-could-get-a-british-makeover-1485345603", suggesting he wanted some less draconian version of the policy.

Congress would need to sort out the details, and there is little evidence that Republicans in power on Capitol Hill want to spend their time doing so. House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) not someone who shies away from supporting controversial policies is advocating a different idea for cracking down on big banks, focusing on higher capital requirements. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R., Idaho) seems more eager to tackle housing-finance policy than to pick a fight with the nation's largest banks.

Glass-Steagall boosters say Messrs. Hensarling and Crapo could win more support for their ideas by adding the bank-breakup policy to a legislative package. But do those votes exist?

Ms. Warren's 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act, reintroduced on Thursday, had 10 Senate co-sponsors last Congress, with Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.) the lone Republican. A similar dynamic was seen in the House, where a comparable bill from Rep. Michael Capuano (D., Mass.) had two Republicans among its nine sponsors.

There used to be little incentive for Ms. Warren, Mr. Capuano or their co-sponsors to beat down lawmakers' doors gathering support for their idea. After all, the Obama administration wasn't interested in making it reality.

Team Trump's consistent encouragement has changed that dynamic. Now it is up to Glass-Steagall proponents to translate that change into votes.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Gary Cohn Backs Breaking Up Big Banks

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/gary-cohn-backs-breaking-up-big-banks-1491491219" Group Inc. executive who is the top White House economic adviser told lawmakers he could support legislation breaking up the largest U.S. banks, according to people familiar with the matter, a development that bolsters congressional efforts to reinstate the Depression-era Glass-Steagall law.

The comments by Gary Cohn , director of the White House National Economic Council, came in a private meeting with lawmakers on the Senate Banking Committee Wednesday, these people said. His remarks were reported earlier by Bloomberg.

BOE's Carney Says Brexit Will Test Commitment to Globalization

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/boes-carney-says-brexit-will-test-commitment-to-globalization-1491557312" represents "a litmus test" for major economies' commitment to a robust, global financial system, the governor of the Bank of England said Friday, as the central bank ordered foreign lenders based in London to present comprehensive contingency plans that cover a messy Brexit divorce.

In a speech in London, Mark Carney said the global financial system stands at "a fork in the road," where one path leads to continued cooperation between regulators across borders and the free flow of capital world-wide, while another leads to greater protectionism, a fragmenting of the financial system and higher costs for borrowers.

WSJ Pro: Fed's Kashkari Rebuts Dimon on  Too Big to Fail'

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-kashkari-rebuts-dimon-on-too-big-to-fail-1491507317" pushed back against claims by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. chief James Dimon that the problem of "too big to fail" banks had been solved, arguing that the issue is "alive and well" and that large banks still hold too little capital to absorb losses during a crisis.

Mr. Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, made the argument in a blog post Thursday.

Data Clash Heats Up Between Banks and New York Stock Exchange

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/data-clash-heats-up-between-banks-and-new-york-stock-exchange-1491471000" are balking at an attempt by the New York Stock Exchange to assert greater control over market data a behind-the-scenes spat that highlights the growing importance of Big Data in today's financial markets.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co ., Citigroup Inc ., Goldman Sachs Group Inc . and electronic traders Virtu Financial Inc. and KCG Holdings Inc . are among the firms concerned about the exchange's move, people familiar with the situation said.

Lehman Floats RMBS Settlement Worth at Least $1 Billion

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/lehman-floats-rmbs-settlement-worth-at-least-1-billion-1491517041" is floating a settlement that would pay at least $1 billion to institutional investors holding debt tied to soured mortgage loans, as the failed investment bank looks to clear one of the last major hurdles in winding down its affairs more than eight years after filing for bankruptcy.

The proposed settlement, which must be approved by a judge, provides Lehman with a path to resolving a dispute that has dragged on for years over how much it owes for faulty residential mortgages it bundled into securities and sold to investors. A bankruptcy judge will consider approving the settlement in July, according to papers filed Thursday.

Brazil Financial Markets Regulator Suspends IPO Over Irregularities

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/brazils-azul-linhas-aereas-seeks-to-raise-more-than-500-million-in-ipo-1491495039" on Thursday suspended the initial public offering of Azul Linhas Areas Brasileiras SA, alleging the airline broke rules regarding the release of information.

Azul aimed to raise more than $500 million in the IPO in Brazil and in the U.S., which was set to be priced Thursday night. But the process was suspended after the regulator, known as the CVM, said in a note that irregular advertising material was used during presentations to investors and confidential information related to demand and pricing of shares was released to the media. The budget airline already had seen three previous efforts to sell shares to the public sink due to economic and political problems in Brazil since 2013.

WSJ Pro: Iceland's Exit from Capital Controls Brings New Risks, Says Central Bank

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/icelands-exit-from-capital-controls-brings-new-risks-says-central-bank-1491483102" Thursday that the removal of capital controls on households and business in mid-March proceeded "smoothly," but warned the new environment could bring risks.

Icelandic banks' easier access to foreign credit markets could tempt them to grant loans in a foreign currency to residents who are unprotected against exchange rate swings, the central bank warned.

Treasury Lifts Sanctions On Two Who Left Blacklisted Company

"http://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2017/04/06/sanctions-lifted-on-2-who-left-blacklisted-company/" removed two people on Thursday from its sanctions list. The reason: They don't have any affiliation with a company under sanctions.

Treasury removed Donna MacBain, from the U.K., and Siobhan Hanrahan, from Ireland, from the sanctions list, it said in a notice posted to its website. They were targeted in September 2016 as part of action against Canadian payment processor PacNet Group, which Treasury said at the time was a third-party money launderer on behalf of fraud schemes targeting the elderly and the vulnerable. PacNet Services Ltd., which serves as a holding company for various PacNet entities, said it categorically rejects the allegation.

Analysis: Not a Dot-Com Bubble, Not 2007, but a Nasty Mix of Both

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/not-a-dot-com-bubble-not-2007-but-a-nasty-mix-of-both-1491500666" like to say that one year in seven investors worry about balance sheets rather than profit. It has been eight years since that last applied, but as the Federal Reserve starts to discuss running down its own balance sheet, it's a good time to think about corporate indebtedness again.

The market isn't yet repeating the 2000 equity bubble or the 2007 debt bubble, but it has some of the worst features of both. If investors turn out to be mistaken in thinking the economic cycle won't turn down for years, it's going to hurt.

Dodd-Frank's Effect on Middle-Class Credit

The Dodd-Frank Act caused a "substantial redistribution" in credit from middle-class to wealthy households by increasing the cost of originating mortgages, find Francesco D'Acunto and Alberto G. Rossi in a "http://conference.nber.org/confer/2017/CFs17/D'Acunto_Rossi.pdf". "Lenders reduced credit to middle-class households by 15%, and increased credit to wealthy households by 21%" between 2010 and 2014, they find. Credit to low-income households was unaffected, which the authors attribute to protections under the Fair Lending Act. The redistribution of credit was particularly high in counties that were more exposed to large lenders.

Republicans Target Retirement Savings

Recent moves by Republican lawmakers and the Trump administration will make it harder for Americans to save for a secure retirement, "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/opinion/rising-risks-for-retirement-savers.html?emc=edit_th_20170406&nl=todaysheadlines&nlid=46659547&_r=1". The House and Senate recently voted to reverse an Obama administration regulation that would allow cities and counties to organize retirement savings plans for private-sector workers without employer plans, and the Trump administration is delaying the effective date of the Labor Department's fiduciary standard rule.

Luxury retailers beat a retreat from  vanity  real estate

Manhattan s Bleecker Street has seen better days. Boosted by a frothy investment market and booming tourism as New York recovered from the Lehman crisis, retail rents on the main drag of Greenwich Village had soared over the past five years. But in recent months upmarket retailers, facing steeper losses to online shopping and ever pricier rents, have shut their stores.

The departure of luxury brands including Marc Jacobs, Jimmy Choo and Ralph Lauren, which helped transform Bleecker Street from a bohemian centre to a high-end shopping paradise, has left two or three vacant shops on each block.

 The pioneers that made that street are pulling back 	. 	. 	. 	it really casts a shadow,  says Faith Consolo, chairwoman of the retail leasing and sales division at real estate firm Douglas Elliman.  I haven t seen a cycle like this before. 

Similar trends are emerging along the priciest shopping corridors in the US, including Robertson Boulevard in Los Angeles and the design district in Miami, as retailers pull back from  vanity  real estate. They have been deterred partly by what had been runaway rental growth   as much as 50 per cent in five years, according to Cushman & Wakefield, the property consultancy. 

But beyond the cyclical patterns of real estate, there is also a structural shift, analysts say, as online sales draw retailers  focus away from prestigious store sites. While before a presence on a glitzy street was deemed a necessary marketing expense, some luxury retailers are now rethinking their footprint to adapt to a new kind of shopper that prefers browsingthe internet from the sofa.

The Amazon factor is hurting retailers  margins  so they are spending more on their own ecommerce platforms rather than bricks-and-mortar divisions , says Ihor Dusaniwsky, head of research at S3 Partners, a financial analytics firm.

Meanwhile, although consumer confidence surveys appear positive, sales growth overall has dropped. The signs of weakness are leading some landlords to offload properties.

On New York s Fifth Avenue, the world s most expensive shopping street, vacancy rates have jumped from 10 per cent a year ago to 16 per cent, according to Cushman & Wakefield. Rents there have fallen for the first time since the recession  and the trend is not over , the consultancy warns. Vacancy rates across SoHo have climbed to 18 per cent, from 12 per cent a year ago, according to Jones Lang LaSalle.

The newfound caution among retailers has had a  very significant and fast  negative impact on retail property, says Chris Conlon, chief executive of Acadia Realty, a real estate investment trust.

It is not just prestigious streets that have been hit. Malls are also hurting, as chains from Sears to Macy s shut hundreds of stores. Analysts at Green Street Advisors argue that  low growth is the new normal , while market rents are becoming decoupled from tenants  revenue growth as more sales move online.

 [Rents] are at a price point now that exceeds what retail sales can perform,  says Spencer Levy, global head of research for CBRE. He notes that a stronger US dollar also hurts sales in New York, where deep-pocketed foreigners historically flock for deals.

Investors have caught the gloomy mood: shares in US retail Reits have tumbled by almost 25 per cent since their peak last August, according to Dow Jones, compared with an 11 per cent decline across all Reits. Capital values in the private markets have yet to mirror that shift, but listed shares often act as a bellwether.

Meanwhile, hedge funds are building up significant short positions against retail players. Short interest against international retail Reits has more than doubled to $12.5bn since November, according to data from S3 Partners. Of this, $1.5bn of short positions are held against Simon Properties, the US s largest retail Reit.  Looking back over several years, this is the first time I have seen [short interest] at over $10bn in aggregate,  says Mr Dusaniwsky of S3 Partners.

The nervousness is also affecting non-listed groups. Thor Equities, the private equity real estate firm, is seeking to sell three Fifth Avenue properties bought between 2007 and 2011 after failing to find tenants for much of the space, risking an inability to generate income to pay off loans attached to the properties.  If you want big tenants 	. 	. 	. 	there aren t that many that want that size footprint any more,  says Jedd Nero, principal at real estate broker Avison Young.

Thor  did not get the numbers they wanted  and is now looking to lease out the spaces, says someone familiar with the company s thinking.  Landlords take a little while to face reality,  the person adds.

One of the properties, a 19-storey office and retail building at 590 Fifth Avenue, has had its asking price cut from $170m last year to $150m, according to Bill Shanahan, a broker at CBRE who is selling the property. Plans to convert it into a flagship retail space failed to tempt a tenant.

Analysts and brokers say that landlords have been slow to adapt their leasing strategies despite an overhang of supply, leading to  very lengthy  deal negotiations, according to Cushman & Wakefield.

Mr Conlon of Acadia Realty says:  If you bought in SoHo or Fifth Avenue in 2015 and you underwrote that real estate to capture that kind of growth, then it s kind of like musical chairs: the music stops and you re probably disappointed today. 

As rents continue to slip, some landlords and tenants are beginning to meet in the middle, says Patrick Smith, vice-chairman of JLL s retail brokerage, who predicts that  by the end of this year you re going to see more transactions .

However, most retailers are staying on the sidelines for now, says Mr Nero:  No one wants to catch a falling knife. 

While there are some pockets of excessive lending in the market   Green Street says, for example, that Reits owning less desirable  B  and  C  grade malls are  carrying too much debt and are ill-equipped for a sizeable decline in asset values    more prudent lending since the 2008 crisis should help to limit potential distress.

However, the structural shift towards ecommerce looks likely to have some way to run. Green Street estimates that about 20 per cent of sales for  mall-like products  such as clothing have shifted online; that is forecast to rise above 30 per cent in the next five years.

Other prime retail sites may also have to confront this shift.

Rents in Hong Kong s Causeway Bay are weakening and on Paris s Champs-lyses they were flat over the past year, according to Cushman & Wakefield, though downturns in tourism were bigger factors than online sales.

In New York, it is difficult to gauge how long the current correction will last because there have been few deals to draw upon, says Mr Conlon. For spaces in SoHo that were renting for $1,000 per square foot at the peak, rents have dropped by as much as 20 per cent.  We re in the middle [of the correction]. Retailers are saying: I m not sure what I should pay, so I m going to wait.  He says Acadia is preparing to buy in these markets because he predicts they will be distressed.

 You re seeing a seismic shift in retail, and you ll continue to see consolidation as tenants that can t figure it out go out of business,  says Mr Nero of Avison Young.  It s not the way it was in the past 100 years, where you put a product on the shelf and everyone comes in.

 Big Data  Startup Uptake's Round Rises to $90 Million; With an extra $50 million, funding for Brad Keywell-led industrial analytics  firm doesn't let up

Just a couple months ago, Brad Keywell's latest venture was fresh off of a Series C round that brought in $40 million at a $2 billion valuation for the Chicago company.

Now Uptake Technologies Inc., an industrial big-data analytics startup, has more than doubled that round by bringing it to a total of $90 million, thanks to the participation of undisclosed investors, the company said.

Investors identified in February in the Series C round were led by Revolution Growth the venture fund headed by Steve Case, Donn Davis and Ted Leonsis.

Mr. Leonsis, who has joined Uptake's board, served on the boards of MediaBank (now MediaOcean) and Groupon, which were started by Mr. Keywell and his Uptake co-founder Eric Lefkofsky. He also knew Ray Lane, another director on Uptake's board, who is a partner emeritus at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and former president and CEO at Oracle. Mr. Lane had invested in Uptake previously, as part of GreatPoint Ventures.

Uptake sells predictive analytics software that collects and interprets sensor data for clients in mining, rail, energy, aviation, retail, and construction industries. The company aims to leverage the data to improve safety, efficiency, and productivity of the clients' operations.

Other Uptake backers include Lightbank, a fund headed by Mr. Lefkofsky, New Enterprise Associates, and Caterpillar Inc., which is also a client.

Other startups in the industrial-data business have picked up venture investors recently.

In February Aviso Inc., which offers enterprises a predictive-analytics platform, raised additional capital in a Series B round now totaling $23 million from Scale Venture Partners, Next World Capital and Shasta Ventures.

Armada Logistics Inc. in March raised early-stage capital from undisclosed investors. Armada's asset-intelligence software offers visibility into client's supply chain by wiring up pallets and analyzing the data.

Banks Clash With NYSE Over Data --- Rift over who owns lucrative information about trading activity divides Wall Street

By Alexander Osipovich 
833 words
7 April 2017

Some of Wall Street's biggest firms are balking at an attempt by the New York Stock Exchange to assert greater control over market data -- a behind-the-scenes spat that highlights the growing importance of Big Data in today's financial markets.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and electronic traders Virtu Financial Inc. and KCG Holdings Inc. are among the firms concerned about the exchange's move, people familiar with the situation said. Virtu confirmed its opposition to NYSE's move, while none of the others would speak on the record.

The dispute centers on a new contract, called the NYSE Master User Agreement, which the exchange operator is requiring firms to sign to keep trading on its markets.

At the heart of the dispute is legal language about who owns the data that brokers submit to the exchange when they buy and sell stocks. The contract implies that NYSE owns the data. Brokers and trading firms say the data are rightfully theirs.

Exchanges aggregate such data and sell it in the form of high-speed feeds -- often to the same firms whose trading activity generated the data in the first place. Such data feeds have become a growing source of revenue for exchanges in recent years, prompting complaints from Wall Street firms that they are being overcharged.

"This dispute demonstrates the fundamental point market participants have been making about the exchange's unchecked control over market data and its pricing," Virtu Chief Executive Doug Cifu said in an email.

"You'd be hard pressed to find another industry where a government-licensed entity can take your intellectual property and sell it back to you at an arbitrarily high markup," Mr. Cifu said.

The Master User Agreement, a seven-page document available on NYSE's website, differs from similar contracts from the Big Board's competitors, lawyers say.

"It appears that NYSE could be going further than other exchanges," said David Franasiak, a lawyer who reviewed the agreement for The Wall Street Journal. Mr. Franasiak is a principal at Williams & Jensen PLLC, a law and lobbying firm that has worked for brokerage firms, but he isn't involved in the dispute.

Dozens of other firms have already signed the agreement, a person close to NYSE said.

The clash began early this year when NYSE released an update to the contract, replacing a previous version that brokers had found acceptable and surprising them with the new language, according to one of the people familiar with the dispute.

Upset brokers reached out to one another and held conference calls, including as recently as March 30, people briefed on the discussions said. One person said NYSE was set to take part in the call last week but backed out. The person close to NYSE said the exchange has been engaged in dialogue with the firms.

Another call involved the Securities and Exchange Commission, which is monitoring the situation and remaining neutral, a person familiar with the matter said.

Controversy over the cost of market data has been brewing for years. Brokers complain that exchanges like NYSE, which was a nonprofit until 2006, have become more aggressive about raising data fees since they turned into for-profit corporations.

NYSE's owner, Intercontinental Exchange Inc., has beefed up its data business since completing its acquisition of the Big Board in 2013. Last year, 44% of ICE's net revenue came from market-data sales and related fees, up from 9% in 2011. Much of that increase is due to acquisitions of data companies, but some is attributable to price increases and new data products, according to the company's SEC filings.

ICE has said in the past that its data fees are reasonable, and exchanges reject claims that they are abusing their market power.

In many of the user agreements for U.S. exchanges, firms give up some rights to market data to be allowed to trade on the exchange. There is typically a provision in which users grant the exchange a license to take their raw trading data and resell it in the form of aggregated data products, provided that the identities of the people or firms behind the trades aren't revealed.

NYSE competitors Nasdaq Inc., Bats and IEX Group Inc. all have such clauses in their user agreements. They also contain boilerplate language stating that the user "retains all ownership and other rights" to the data they submit to the exchange.

But the NYSE Master User Agreement contains no such provision. Instead, it states that market data on the exchange is the property of NYSE.

It also lacks a licensing provision in which users grant the exchange the right to use their data -- even though past NYSE user agreements have contained such language.

LIBOR SCANDAL

Ex-Bank Employees

Acquitted in Retrial

Two former Barclays PLC employees were acquitted of conspiracy to defraud in connection with the manipulation of the London interbank offered rate after a retrial in London.

Ryan Michael Reich was acquitted Wednesday and Stylianos Contogoulas was acquitted on Thursday a spokeswoman for the U.K.'s Serious Fraud Office confirmed.

The acquittals conclude the agency's final outstanding trial over Libor manipulation but its investigation continues, it said.

CURRENCIES

Czechs Abandon

Koruna-Euro Peg

The Czech central bank dropped its target for the koruna's exchange rate against the euro, a fresh sign that Europe has put the threat of deflation behind it and is looking forward to a more-normal monetary policy.

The Czech National Bank on Thursday became the second noneuro central bank to abandon a euro peg in a little over two years. But unlike the Swiss National Bank's decision in January 2015 to drop a franc ceiling without warning -- which caused the euro to collapse as much as 30% intraday against the franc and the Swiss stock market to plunge nearly 9% the day it occurred -- the Czech move had been telegraphed for months. The Czech currency rose just slightly after the announcement and Czech stocks hardly moved.

The central bank adopted the target of around 27 koruna to the euro in November 2013 as a way of boosting inflation by ensuring the koruna didn't strengthen against the euro, which would have lowered the prices of imported goods and services.

NATURAL GAS

Stockpile Increase

Is Short of Estimate

The U.S. Energy Information Administration said natural-gas stockpiles rose by 2 billion cubic feet in the week ended Friday, compared with the 7.8 billion cubic feet expected by forecasters surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.

The report is a widely watched measure of supply and demand. A smaller-than-expected addition to storage likely indicates smaller supply or greater-than-expected demand.

Storage levels are now just 15% above the five-year average, compared with 21% above in early March. They are 17% below levels from a year earlier, the EIA said.

New export facilities and surging demand from Mexico have caused big increases in demand at a time when last year's spending cuts have kept production lower than expected. It is down 2.7 billion cubic feet a day from a year ago, according to UBS Group AG, or about 2% to 3%, according to Platts Analytics.

Want a Loan in China? Keep Your Phone Charged; On credit-scoring's leading edge, financial-technology upstarts use artificial intelligence  to analyze swells of unconventional data

To judge potential borrowers, lending app Yongqianbao collects more than 1,200 data points, from the usual credit information like a bank-card number to what phone a person uses and how many calls go unanswered.

Financial-technology upstarts like Yongqianbao are on the leading edge of credit scoring, using artificial intelligence to analyze swells of data, much of it unconventional. "While banks only focus on the tip of the iceberg above the sea, we build algorithms to make sense of the vast amount of data under the sea," says Jiao Ke, founder and chief executive of Yongqianbao, a product of Beijing Smarter Finance Information Technology.

China is an ideal laboratory. The country lacks reliable credit-history systems for individuals, while data-privacy expectations are minimal and smartphones are everywhere and used by young Chinese for nearly everything including personal finance.

Some 160 million Chinese went online to take out loans worth 1.2 trillion yuan ($173.9 billion) in 2016, according to research firm iResearch. That puts China way ahead of any other country, including the U.S., where online lenders provided more than $36 billion of loans in 2015, according to KPMG. And iResearch forecasts China's total will grow at an annual rate of about 50% for the next three years.

In the U.S., credit reports include bill-payment and loan histories, current debt, even criminal records. In China, mortgages were barely available before 2000. Americans average 2.6 credit cards each; Chinese, a third of a card. Plus, many Chinese are still paid in cash.

Fintech in China is grappling with fraud and defaults, a result in part of fast growth and spotty regulation. The iResearch report says overdue rates over the past four years ranged from 10% to 20% the "main factor that prevents online lending from becoming a mainstream channel in China's financial industry."

Fintech champions say the power of artificial intelligence is bringing default rates down by finding correlations between smartphone behavior and risk and using them to create tools that can analyze creditworthiness in an instant.

Yongqianbao crunches its 1,200 data points to generate more than 100,000 risk scenarios in a few seconds. The result: a loan whose terms are tailor-made.

Fintech startups elsewhere are also using alternative data such as mobile usage and online-shopping records to assess credit risk. But China's scale 695 million smartphone users and huge amounts of online lending allows AI programs to get better faster, say people in both the internet and finance industries.

Affirm, the San Francisco-based online lender led by PayPal co-founder Max Levchin, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/morgan-stanley-makes-100-million-move-on-fintech-startup-affirm-inc-1476352982". Yongqianbao, by comparison, approved 1.2 million loans worth 1.8 billion yuan ($270 million) in February alone.

Yongqianbao, whose name means "use-money pal," mostly issues short-term "payday" loans of 500 yuan to 5,000 yuan ($72.50 to $725). About 80% of its borrowers are younger than 30. Loans past the 60-day due date stood at 2.8% in February, according to Mr. Jiao, a former project manager for search engine Baidu.

A competing platform, Dumiao, averages 30,000 personal-loan applications a day. It makes cash loans of 1,000 yuan to 50,000 yuan, mostly to people under 35. As of January, 1.4% of loans were 30 to 89 days past due.

Among the two startups' findings from running hundreds of millions of loan applications: iPhone users tend to have lower late-payment rates than Android phone users, and people who don't answer calls or whose outgoing calls go unanswered represent a higher default and fraud risk. Other red flags: making many changes when filling in the application, letting batteries run down and changing phones frequently. Multiple applications from a single Wi-Fi hot spot is a danger sign. And users who borrow in one city but spend in another are poorer risks.

These startups, which aim to become the credit bureaus of digital finance, differ on how much decision-making power to entrust to their fast-learning machines.

Dumiao, whose executives hail from traditional financial institutions, approves only 5% to 8% of first-time cash-loan applicants because they're "overkilling" for safety purposes, says Ren Ran, who left Capital One Financial last year to join Dumiao's parent, Pintec Group, and leads Dumiao's data-science unit.

Yongqianbao, whose approval rate for first-time applicants is 20% to 30%, is run by engineers.

"We don't hire any risk-control people from traditional financial institutions like the other fintech companies do," Mr. Jiao says. "We don't need human beings to tell us who's a good customer and who's bad. Technology is our risk control."

Cendana's Michael Kim: Seed Funds Became Hostages in Overfunded Startups; Senior preferred stock that occurs in some late-stage rounds is very dangerous for seed funds, he says

Michael Kim has been investing in the growing crop of seed funds since 2010 as managing partner of San Francisco-based fund of funds Cendana Capital. Cendana just "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cendana-raises-260-million-to-back-seed-funds-1491361865".

In an interview with WSJ Pro Venture Capital (edited for clarity and length), Mr. Kim discussed how seed funds became the main source of early-stage funding, the emergence of incumbent seed funds, how new firms can compete, and his worries about the seed market.

WSJ: What worries you about the seed market?

It has to originate with distributions. We had good distributions from the Fitbit IPO via "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jeff-claviers-softtech-vc-collects-150m-for-two-funds-1465385405", and

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-trade-desk-surges-in-first-day-of-trading-1474499560", for example.

But overall in the past few years, high late-stage valuations were getting out of control. That created substantial misalignment between the early-stage and late-stage investors. A seed fund would be perfectly happy with a billion-dollar exit. But if the company had raised $500 million at a $3 billion valuation, late-stage investors wanted a $10 billion exit.

In a way, seed funds became hostages in those kinds of high-valuation, overcapitalized companies. Senior preferred stock that occurs in some late-stage rounds is also very dangerous for seed funds.

Also, in the last 12 months we've seen more pay-to-play insider rounds, where if you don't participate your existing shares convert to common. Those are very dangerous rounds for seed rounds. You might put good money after bad. Our advice isn't to participate in pay-to-plays.

WSJ: Why did you think it was wise to pursue a strategy of a fund of seed funds in the first place?

Part of the rationale for why I started Cendana was that venture capital was changing. It got a lot cheaper to start a company. And the top-tier venture funds got larger, so there was a real opportunity-cost for them to spending time with investments of $500,000 to a million dollars. There was a funding gap of institutional-quality VCs focused on the earliest stage.

WSJ: How did seed rounds change over time?

Seed rounds have generally evolved from what we now call "pre-seed." Now the types of companies that larger seed funds invest in have revenue, have product-market fit, have strong metrics. Seed is the new Series A. Seed is de facto early-stage investing.

WSJ: How does the landscape of seed funds look different compared with the time you started?

When I first started Cendana there were 10 to 15 seed funds that were potentially institutional quality. Now, people talk about 300 to 400. Maybe 10-15% of those are institutional quality.

WSJ: How can new fund managers compete against this incumbent class of seed funds?

New seed funds need to be more thematic. A new generalist fund would find it very hard to compete against the incumbent seed funds. We've seen blockchain, Internet of Things and connected home, AR/VR funds. We are seeing AI and machine-learning funds.

In general, it makes sense. But the big question is--is it too narrow and too early?

WSJ: Do you spend all of your capital on re-ups into existing seed funds that you like?

We keep an eye on new and emerging managers. We've created a bucket for pre-seed funds. Having a specific allocation toward pre-seed is very important in terms of generating more alpha for our investors.

We have a pilot program, where we invest $1 million into fund managers we like but where we have questions about some part of their strategy. For example, we have a pilot with Bolt. We weren't sure whether seed was the right entry point for the hardware sector. We are getting comfortable that it can work.

Bullish Reception Set for Okta IPO; New range puts startup on track to raise up to $187 million

Okta Inc. lifted its maximum price estimate for its planned initial public offering, in a sign of strong demand for shares in the billion-dollar startup.

The identity-management company put the new high end of its price range at $17 a share, which would raise up to $187 million, according to a regulatory filing Wednesday. Previously it was "https://www.wsj.com/articles/okta-ipo-could-raise-up-to-165-million-1490640568" at $13 to $15 a share.

Okta, which is expected to start trading on the Nasdaq on Friday, follows the IPO of another enterprise software company, MuleSoft Inc., whose shares jumped almost 50% on the first day of trading.

Other enterprise companies, like Yext Inc. and Alteryx Inc., have filed for IPOs. Last Friday, big-data software company Cloudera Inc. disclosed its own filing; analysts and bankers expect a growing level of optimism over enterprise software offerings in 2017.

"We actually think this is a sign of things to come in 2017, as mega consumer internet unicorns will likely wait until 2018," said Rohit Kulkarni, a managing director of research for SharesPost Financial Corp. "Even more enterprise software companies will pursue IPOs in the next several months because they are in favor right now with market investors."

Okta plans to sell 11 million shares. The San Francisco company, with close to 1,000 employees, was last valued by private investors at $1.2 billion.

As the need increases for an independent, cloud software vendor amid cybersecurity threats and other concerns, "Okta occupies an increasingly strategic spot inside its customers' technology footprints," said Mr. Kulkarni.

From a financial standpoint, the company may be almost as attractive as MuleSoft with its recurring revenues, high gross margins and high customer retention rate. But despite revenue growing faster than other recent enterprise software IPOs, the company is burning cash at a high rate, Mr. Kulkarni said.

Stocks Give Up Gains After Fed Minutes; Some Fed officials say share prices look high relative to certain valuation measures

U.S. stocks fell Wednesday, reversing an early surge that had sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average up almost 200 points.

Minutes from the Federal Reserve and reported comments from House Speaker Paul Ryan on the status of a tax overhaul contributed to the reversal, some traders and investors said.

The Dow industrials were up 0.96% at their intraday peak but closed lower in their biggest erased gain in more than a year. The blue-chip index ended the day down 41.09 points, or 0.2%, at 20648.15.

The S&P 500 lost 7.21 points, or 0.3%, to 2352.95, and the Nasdaq Composite fell 34.13 points, or 0.6%, to 5864.48.

Minutes from the U.S. central bank's March policy meeting showed officials agreed that they would likely begin "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-minutes-most-officials-saw-reduced-balance-sheet-later-this-year-1491415332" which includes assets purchased during and after the 2007-09 recession, later this year.

Also Wednesday afternoon,"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-ryan-idUSKBN1772H9?feedType=RSS&feedName=politicsNews"that Mr. Ryan said the House, Senate and White House weren't yet "on the same page" on taxes.

"There's a general sense that until we get into earnings season and get broader data points, we continue to be susceptible to policy, whether its monetary policy or fiscal policy," said Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank's Private Client Reserve. "We haven't seen a great deal of progress on the fiscal policy, which continues to be an area of concern for investors."

Shares of financial companies led declines in the S&P 500, falling 0.7%. J.P. Morgan Chase fell $1.12, or 1.3%, to $86.19. Charles Schwab lost 75 cents, or 1.9%, to 39.48, and Morgan Stanley declined 77 cents, or 1.8%, to 41.74.

Also in the Fed minutes: Some officials said stock prices looked high relative to some valuation measures, citing the possibility of a correction in financial markets as a risk to their economic forecasts.

Companies in the S&P 500 have traded at more than 20 times their past 12 months of earnings for 106 consecutive sessions, the longest stretch since 2010, based on FactSet.

Stocks' broad early-session advance followed oil-price increases and data from payroll firm Automatic Data Processing Inc. and Moody's Analytics that showed the U.S. private sector added"https://www.wsj.com/articles/private-sector-reports-stronger-than-expected-boost-to-payrolls-in-march-1491397601". The Labor Department's jobs report for March is scheduled for Friday.

Prices of U.S. government bonds edged lower, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rising to 2.352%, from 2.350% Tuesday.

The WSJ Dollar Index, which tracks the U.S. currency against a basket of 16 others, rose less than 0.1%.

The dollar had fallen sharply after the Fed's March meeting as some investors were disappointed that the central bank didn't increase its projections for rates or economic growth.

The Stoxx Europe 600 inched up less than 0.1%, buoyed by gains in the energy and basic resources sectors.

The Shanghai Composite Index rose 1.5%, notching its best day since August. Japan's Nikkei Stock Average gained 0.3%, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.3% as higher base-metal prices supported local miners. Metals prices got a lift from signs of fresh supply disruptions and expectations of rising demand from China and the U.S.

Boeing Sets Up Venture Capital Arm; HorizonX unit makes first investments in Upskill and Zunum Aero

Boeing Co. is establishing a venture capital arm as part of a broader push to capture technology that includes innovations that could be used beyond its core aerospace and defense sectors.

The company announced the new Boeing HorizonX unit Wednesday alongside its first two minority investments and a pledge to deploy tens of millions of dollars a year world-wide in pursuit of technology that might be deployed in the next five to 15 years.

Boeing is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbus-to-create-venture-capital-arm-innovation-center-in-silicon-valley-1432919479""https://www.wsj.com/articles/lockheed-martin-takes-stake-in-chip-designer-1481819825" including Airbus SE and Lockheed Martin Corp. as well as "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704764404575286311495643870" such as General Motors Co., all of which have reorganized their innovation efforts under a single umbrella with the ability to make minority investments.

Steve Nordlund, who will head the new unit, acknowledged Boeing was responding to moves in the marketplace but said it wasn't playing catch-up, with the establishment of HorizonX coming as it prepares to launch another stand-alone operation tasked with securing a bigger share of aftermarket and services.

"The big difference is we're moving this entire effort to the enterprise level," said Mr. Nordlund, formerly vice president strategy at Boeing's defense unit. He will report to Greg Smith, chief financial officer and strategy chief.

Boeing's efforts to boost productivity of its jetliner production have included borrowing techniques from the auto industry. One of the two initial investments is in Upskill, a Washington, D.C., firm that makes software for wearable devices that use augmented reality to perform tasks more efficiently.

It also is taking a minority stake in Zunum Aero, a Kirkland, Wash, firm developing electric aircraft propulsion systems. JetBlue Airways Corp, an Airbus jet operator that "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jetblue-airways-forms-technology-unit-1455166861", also is taking a stake. Mr. Nordlund said Boeing's pipeline included a mix of stand-alone deals and those with strategic partners.

Similar to peers, Boeing is targeting areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and additive manufacturing, but Mr. Nordlund said there were capabilities within Boeing such as preventing tampering with hardware that could be married to external technology and sold outside the aerospace industry.

Metals: Gold Pares Losses After Fed minutes; Copper prices jump as looming miners' strikes in South America reignited supply concerns

Gold prices pared losses in aftermarket trading Wednesday, after minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest monetary policy meeting revealed few details about the timing of further rate increases.

Gold for April delivery was recently down 0.3% at $1,255 a troy ounce in electronic trading. Prices closed down 0.8% at $1,248.50 a troy ounce in regular trading on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Minutes from the Fed's March 14-15 meeting showed officials agreed they would likely begin shrinking a $4.5 trillion portfolio of Treasury and mortgage securities later this year. The minutes offered few hints of when the central bank planned to tighten borrowing costs.

"There was no sense of urgency," said Ira Epstein, a strategist at the Linn Group. For now, "it looks like the increases will come at a gradual pace."

Expectations that rates will stay low tend to boost gold, which struggles to compete against yield-bearing investments when monetary policy tightens.

Gold prices fell earlier in the day, after "https://www.wsj.com/articles/private-sector-reports-stronger-than-expected-boost-to-payrolls-in-march-1491397601" that U.S. private sector hiring remained strong last month.

Private payrolls across the nation rose by 263,000 last month, said payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody's Analytics. This was much better than a gain of 180,000 expected by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal.

Silver for May delivery closed down 0.7% at $18.87 a troy ounce.

Meanwhile, copper prices jumped Wednesday, as looming miners' strikes in South America reignited supply concerns.

Copper for May delivery closed up 2.6% at $2.6800 a pound on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Helping drive the gains are strikes in Southern Copper Corp.'s Peruvian Toquepala and Cuajone mines and Ilo smelter that are scheduled to begin on April 10, said Citi's David B. Wilson.

Snowflake Computing Inc. has raised $100 million in new capital aimed at expanding its cloud-based data warehousing product for enterprises.

The Series D was led by Iconiq Capital with participation by Madrona Venture Group. The funding included existing investors Altimeter Capital, Redpoint Ventures, Sutter Hill Ventures and Wing Ventures.

Data-driven enterprises are gradually moving away from on-premises and cloud legacy systems. Spending through 2020 on cloud-based, big-data analytics will grow 4.5 times faster than spending for on-premises solutions, according to IDC forecasts.

Snowflake is planning to use the capital on research and development and for international expansion. The company already has a team in Europe and soon plans to establish a presence in Asia, said Chief Executive Bob Muglia.

With the new round, the San Mateo, Calif., company has raised a total of $205 million since 2012.

Markets & Finance: Dimon Marvels at $100 Million Phone Trade

How fast is technology spreading at big banks? A $100 million currency trade was recently made through J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. with a cellphone.

So said J.P. Morgan Chairman and Chief Executive James Dimon on Tuesday after the release of his annual shareholder letter.

Responding to a question from a student on innovation in financial services during an interview with Yahoo Finance, Mr. Dimon talked about how the nation's largest bank spent $9.5 billion on technology and how customers were using electronics in a variety of businesses, including the bank's foreign-exchange business.

"We had someone do a $100 million F-X trade on their mobile phone the other day," Mr. Dimon said.

He then transitioned to joking about a potential future innovation that could save banks and investors money -- keeping people from doing trades after a few drinks.

What they are going to have to do one day is "put a breathalyzer on that phone, so you don't feel macho after dinner and a drink or two and say -- I'm going long the yen!" Mr. Dimon said, blowing into his hand to simulate the process.

Corporate and investment bank chief Daniel Pinto wrote in his shareholder letter that 83% of notional forex trading at J.P. Morgan is now done electronically, a big shift from years past. And on peak days in 2016, $200 billion in currencies was traded through the bank's electronic channels, including its J.P. Morgan Markets platform that provides services ranging from research to posttrade reporting.

Those technology investments along with risk oversight helped the bank during big market swings such as Brexit, the U.S. presidential election and uncertainty around China's growth rate, Mr. Pinto wrote.

Mr. Dimon also wrote about technology in his letter. "The reasons we invest so much in technology (whether it's digital, big data or machine learning) are simple: to benefit customers with better, faster and often cheaper products and services, to reduce errors and to make the firm more efficient," Mr. Dimon wrote.

He said that about $3 billion of the $9.5 billion in technology spending in 2016 was for new projects, and about $600 million of that was in financial-technology areas including digital and mobile efforts.

International Property: Germany: Investors Turn to Real Estate for Safety --- Turbulence in Europe is driving some to park their money in Germany's properties

Last fall, when a planned 3.3 billion euros ($3.5 billion) initial public offering of a German office-building company was pulled due to weak demand, market observers expected private-equity giant Blackstone Group LP to move in for the kill.

Blackstone had previously expressed interest in OfficeFirst Immobilien AG, which owns about 100 properties in Frankfurt, Berlin and other German cities. When the IPO was shelved, "I was expecting Blackstone to look them deep into their eyes and say, 'What is the discount?'" said Peter Papadakos, an analyst with real-estate research firm Green Street Advisors, who tracked the deal closely.

Instead, Blackstone last week closed on its purchase of OfficeFirst in a deal valuing the company at roughly the same 3.3 billion euros price tag that caused IPO investors to balk. The firm felt the price was fair given rent and occupancy trends in Germany, according to people familiar with the matter.

Blackstone and some other investors also increasingly see Germany as a haven in a turbulent Europe, where risks include a disintegration of the euro.

"If the euro remains, [Germany] will remain in the same strong position it is now," said Lars Huber, chief executive of property giant Hines's European operation. "If the euro breaks up, when the dust settles Germany will probably be even stronger."

Last year, Germany led Europe in commercial-property sales volume for the first time, displacing the U.K., which has topped charts since 2007, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics. The values of office buildings, shopping centers and warehouses are continuing to rise in many markets, experts say.

Foreign investors new to European property markets typically have looked at London and Paris before Germany, which has had a reputation for plodding growth. But these days Germany appears more attractive to many investors given uncertainty in the U.K. due to its coming divorce from the European Union, and in France ahead of elections.

"Boring is sexy in a world where you have more volatility and political risk," said Marcus Lemli, head of European investment for Savills PLC.

Germany's relative strength comes as investors world-wide grapple with the challenges of investing in commercial property after years of steady price increases in most markets.

German sales volume has slumped, but far less than in the rest of Europe. In the last six months of 2016, transaction volume was roughly 38.3 billion euros, down 4.8% from the same period in 2015, according to Real Capital Analytics. By comparison, volume in all of Europe was down 13.1% during the same time frame, RCA said.

Prices are rising in Germany, as evidenced by the willingness of investors to accept lower yields -- or "capitalization rates" as they are known in the industry -- when they buy buildings. In the past three years, yields of prime high street retail have declined an average of 0.7 percentage point in the top seven cities, according to Savills.

Berlin office buildings are especially hot thanks to the city's growing population, limited supply and booming tech scene. Prime office capitalization rates there are at 3.25%, a record low, according to CBRE Group Inc.

U.K.-based Rockspring Property Investment Managers has made three acquisitions in Berlin in the past six months, including a 59 million euros deal last week for Coca-Cola Co.'s German headquarters. "The standout location for tenant demand is Berlin," said Stuart Reid, a Rockspring partner.

Investments in other German cities also have been doing well. In 2013, a venture of Hines and an Asian investor purchased Siemens AG's former headquarters in Munich as a redevelopment project. Today, it is 40% preleased to media company Conde Nast and about a year ahead of schedule, according to Mr. Huber.

Germany's relative strength comes as investors around the world grapple with the challenges of investing in commercial property after years of steady price increases in most markets. Overall, investment volume is down in Europe and the U.S. mostly because the values of top properties in many cities are at or near record levels.

German sales volume has slumped, but far less than in the rest of Europe.

Today, it is 40% preleased to media company Conde Nast and about a year ahead of schedule, according to Mr. Huber.

The growing foreign demand has made it tougher for German investors to compete, especially for trophy properties.

"I don't expect that . . . investors will accept much lower yields than where we are now," said Jochen Schenk, a board member at German property firm Real I.S. AG.

Patrizia Immobilien AG, an Augsburg, Germany-based real-estate investor with 12 billion euros of assets under management in Germany, has been looking more for fixer-upper properties outside the prime markets attracting many foreign investors. Pricing in those markets has become "a bit irrational" lately, said Konrad Finkenzeller, Patrizia's head of international capital markets. "If this continues for the next two or three years, then I'm really worried," he said.

Snap AV: Quant s comeback under the cover of AI?

This is from Bernstein s recent note entitled AI, the data flood and the future of investment research? Important to say up top that they admit that AI focused funds are thin on the ground:

Most asset managers that we speak to on this topic say that they are at an early stage of evaluating its potential. We often encounter asset management companies that are in the process of assessing how to use such techniques, or actively hiring people with the relevant skills or trying to decide how to budget for such a push. Big data is expensive, and the impact of this on its adoption should not be overlooked, especially as the asset management industry tries to cut costs. The vast majority of firms are not even at the stage of actually running analysis on the relevant datasets, they are at an earlier stage of trying to decide what data to get access to, and how they would use it if they did have it.

There are some exceptions to this though. We can identify a small group of funds where they describe AI as being at the forefront of their approach to investment. They have relatively small AUM at present (in the region of USD 1bn) but this presumably will grow. There is then a much larger pool of capital (USD 416bn) run by CTAs where AI appears to inform at least part of the investment approach, but is almost certainly far from being the dominant investment trigger (at least not yet). It probably makes sense that CTAs lead in terms of AUM based on such strategies at present as it is a more natural extension of an already heavily quantitatively-lead approach.

And there is still a tendency to dwell on "https://twitter.com/modestproposal1/status/847154393124421638".

But assuming there are suitable datasets available and there is an eventual search for AI driven analysis that concentrates on single stocks   in an effort to find signals that aren t arb d away in a matter of seconds   then  quant  might make a comeback & of sorts:

The growth of big data plus AI to come up with  fundamental  investment recommendations on single stocks has good claim to be one possible route to lengthening the alpha decay time of the signals. That could have the interesting consequence of breaking down the distinction of quant and fundamental investing. Quant investing is often thought of as generating a signal for the cross-section of all stocks, whereas fundamental investing tends to come to a conclusion for stocks one at a time. If big data is applied at the single stock level this would yield a result that looked much more like a fundamental investment conclusion, albeit one reached in a very data-intensive way.

One conclusion from recent asset flows has been that in one sense quant  blackboxes  have been out of favour. Exhibit 1 shows the asset share of quant long-only funds as a % of equity AUM. Ever since the financial crisis, funds branded as quant in this area have lost asset share and have so far failed to regain it.

Is this a massive headwind for big data-led approaches? Not necessarily. Partly this is investment style. Arguably one of the reasons that long only quants have gone out of favour has been that it is nothing to do with quant per se. Instead what has gone out of favour is low tracking error long-only funds regardless of their investment technique. Also, we sense that although the word  quant  may still be toxic with some consultants (ironically, they are one of the groups most keen on smart beta, which is nothing other than  quant lite ), as soon as the brand is instead big data or AI or machine learning, then investors show more interest.

Peer-to-peer site MarketInvoice has poached a senior manager from Santander UK to oversee its risk team with a plan to develop artificial intelligence to help expand the business.

The site, which was launched in 2011, has recruited Shaun Alexander as head of risk to improve its credit scoring system by using machine learning and AI to automate processes.

MarketInvoice enables small businesses to sell their unpaid invoices to investors as a way to gain working capital. Peer-to-peer sites believe their advantage over traditional banks is their ability to price risk more accurately.

Mr Alexander joins from Santander, where he was head of risk for asset-based lending, managing credit risk across invoice and asset financing. He previously held roles at consultancy Oliver Wyman and Barclays.

He said: "For too long, as I have witnessed first-hand, the status quo in risk management has gone unchallenged.

"Much more can be done with the available technology to drive and enhance the quality and speed of risk decisions for UK businesses."

Ilya Kondrashov , chief operating officer and co-founder of MarketInvoice, said: "As we grow, in handling the scale and volume of interest in the business, it is imperative that we have the resources to deliver on our customer promise whilst delivering the highest-quality risk tools."

The appointment comes only weeks after MarketInvoice hired Giles Andrews , the founder of Zopa, the first peer-to-peer lender, as its chairman .

Mr Andrews recently said his aim as chairman was to help scale up the business while attempting to preserve its nimble "fintech" culture.

The site has grown rapidly, extending more than 1.1bn of finance to small businesses since it was founded in 2011 - almost half of which came in the past year.

Anil Stocker , founder of the business and a former Lehman Brothers employee, is targeting 2bn of total lending this year, helped by the launch of a new service to offer finance secured against all of a company's invoices, rather than on a per-invoice basis.

Transcript: Q&A With Fed's Patrick Harker in Philadelphia; Philadelphia Fed president talks about fintech, financial regulation and community banking

Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker took audience questions on Monday, April 3, 2017 in Philadelphia, Pa., following "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-harker-still-sees-three-rate-increases-in-2017-as-appropriate-1491246399". He discussed fintech, financial regulation, community banking and other topics. Here is a transcript of the exchange, lightly edited for length and clarity.

Q: The assumption that you've been making is that fintech is coming from a lot of startup companies, right? That may be true or not, but I wanted to ask you to clarify that point. What about if a Google or a, you know, social media company like Facebook wanting to enter (inaudible)? Could that be how would that work in conjunction with the rest of the banking system?

PATRICK HARKER: Yeah, I mean, there are a lot of different players. I don't think it's necessarily just startups. The banks themselves are making some investment in this space. I mean, you do have other players Apple, Google, and others that are moving into this space. But, again, it's a big space, right? It's a very big space, and there's lots of functions across the spectrum.

If you think of financial services, I mean, there's directly you know, Venmo. How many use Venmo, right? So you've got that, directly consumer-facing. But then you have merchant banking and correspondent banking, and you've got the back end of all the services provided to corporations. So it's where in that space you'll find most of the innovation. Right now it tends to happen more on the payments-system side as opposed to these back-office kind of rails that are running.

There we are the Federal Reserve has initiated a conversation over the last several years with the industry to develop some thinking about what is the new payments system in America. And so we've started two major work streams. And this is really being headed by one of my colleagues, the president of the Kansas City Fed, along with a fellow who left the Chicago Fed as first vice president and is now running this full-time. And it's a conversation that involves large firms, as you mentioned; mid-sized firms; and then small firms.

And it involves banks at all levels, too, because one of the challenges is we think about banks you probably think about banks as Chase, Citi. But if I'm sitting out in the bank out in Amish Country that's in our district, the Bank of Bird-in-Hand, they're serving the Amish community  very small, but critically important to that community. So we can't think of it as just the large banks, but it's really all the banking sector because we need to make sure those guys are protected as well, right, in this evolution.

That conversation we're having involves two major work streams. One is on faster payments, so almost real-time payments, because in many of the systems that exist today, even though it's a cool frontend on your phone that you're paying off of, it's still running on very old rails, right, very old pipes through the Federal Reserve System as we try to clear those payments over time, right? So those are happening on the backend. Not all, but many of those.

And then, of course, the other work stream is not just faster, but also more secure. I mean, one of the big challenges every bank faces and we've surveyed the banks every year I've been at the Fed and we go out and talk to the banking community. The first thing on their list, the most the biggest risk they face is not interest rate risk, it's not credit risk, it's not the downside of the credit cycle. It's cybersecurity. They are petrified around cybersecurity. And so it's an issue around security of these systems that is paramount.

Now, what we've asked the industry to do is to put proposals forth about where they want to play in this new system. But we've laid out and, of course, we don't necessarily want to be in the game, necessarily, right? We do provide some of these services today. ACH, we are one of the providers. Not the only provider, but we're one of the providers that gets your paycheck into your checking account. But then, on the other side, on the wholesale side, there's Fedwire and Fedwire Securities, one of many services we provide of moving money between institutions. Again, we don't necessarily have to play in this if there's a private-sector solution that's better, but what we insist on are a set of criteria.

One of those criteria is ubiquity: everybody has to have access. What we're worried about is that there may be cream-skimming, and people taking the most profitable segment and then leaving that small bank that's serving the community shut out.

So those two work streams have come together. We're now analyzing them. We have a process for analyzing these proposals. And we'll what comes out and where people want to play.

It's not obvious to me and I can only speak for myself that people necessarily want to build the fundamental rails that we've built over many decades, right? It just doesn't seem that that it could happen. I'm not ruling it out, but I sort of doubt that.

So there's a lot of players in that industry. And we're trying to create a safe space and a and a level playing field where they can all play because, again, we want this innovation. And we actually would like to create and some other countries have created what are called sandboxes, where some existing financial institutions can actually be not relieved of, but some of the regulation relaxed so that they can innovate a little bit in this space, so that they have a level playing field as well. Because one of the issues with an existing financial institution is as opposed to, say, a startup fintech they have a regulatory structure they have to fit under versus the Google or the startup who doesn't. So we're trying to create a level playing field there, too. And some countries have done that effectively, and we're learning from that.

Q: Perhaps you would comment on how do banks manage risk. How do they estimate risk? The kinds of things I would assume are, I mean, the estimated risk of inflation and so forth. Perhaps you would comment on that.

MR. HARKER: So if there's if there's a core competency of a well-managed financial institution, it's risk management, right? Yeah. What everybody's bad at and not just banks, but this is generally true, right? seeing the proverbial black swan, right, the thing that just nobody thought was going to happen. And that's part of what happened in the crisis, right? We had thinking  one could argue groupthinking, almost, because it wasn't just I mean, we as a society believed this, that house prices couldn't go down. It was sort of a fundamental belief. I mean, look at all the shows, the flip-the-house shows that were on, right? I mean, it was just you couldn't prices could never go down. Of course, that was wrong, right? I mean, it was sort of fundamentally wrong, and it led to the crisis we had to live through.

But, absent that which some would argue was a black swan, but you know, there's arguments on both sides of that in academic literature the banks are actually quite good at managing the risks they know, right? And so interest rate risk, credit risk, those things are pretty well-known.

Now, there's new advances in technology there. There have been a lot of advance in a lot of the banks in machine learning being brought into a lot of those models to try to enhance, because there's a lot of opportunity to reduce cost and increase profit if you get the right model in place, right?

And you're starting to you're starting to see patterns that emerge. And so institutions spend an enormous amount of time on that. And then that's on the that side of the business. And, of course, there's a whole industry when it comes to the trading side of the business, right? So investment models. I mean, that's I won't talk about that. But on the banking side, the risks they know I think they manage quite well.

But part of our job as the regulator, or one of the regulators so the way  just sort of step back. The way that regulatory structure in the United States works, we have a very complicated regulatory structure. So we have keep it simple two types of banks. There are more than that, but let's call it two for now. There are national bank think Citibank and then there are state member banks, local banks the Bank of Elmira, the Bank of Bird-in-Hand, right? They have a state regulator, and so they have to adhere to state regulatory. And then they also have a choice of which federal regulator they want. That can be either us or the FDIC, the people who insure the deposits. They have a choice.

The national-level banks do not. Their regulator is the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. If you've never heard of that, look at a dollar bill. That's the other person that signs, you know they are the Comptroller of the Currency. They regulate national banks, but we regulate the holding companies of those banks, all banks. We regulate all the holding companies. So it's a very elaborate structure of regulation.

But one of the issues after the crisis and what was brought in with the Dodd-Frank Act was that large institutions, above a certain size, would have to go through what's called stress testing or CCAR, and that we would impose we would pose a scenario to them or a set of scenarios to them and we have to check if they had adequate capital to absorb the losses in a in a situation that was negative, all right? And that process is underway. There's a lot of conversation about modifying that process. It's not perfect, but it has caused when I talk to bankers privately, a lot of them will say, even though they don't like the process because they've had to put in a lot of effort, they've learned some things, right? Not everybody said this, but some have said they've learned some things about their own risk-management processes.

And that's a healthy thing. That's a healthy thing for our economy, right? If banks can learn to be better and better risk managers, they benefit and we benefit as an economy.

Q: One of the things I was struck by when you compare the national banks to the state banks is you have investment that's necessary to keep what do you think is going to happen to the state bank system, you know, 30 years from now? How are they going to have anywhere near the ability to compete with the Wells Fargos?

MR. HARKER: Yeah, so that's a really, really good question. So I think did everybody hear the question? You have these large banks and small banks.

And so these are community banks. We'll call them that, right, as opposed to the large institutions that you would know. Not only the Wells and Chases as well, but a TD Bank, which is a super-regional bank. That's the old phrase for them. But there's categories of banks going up and down in terms of size.

It is a challenge. Right now, for a variety of reasons, there has been consolidation of those banks, and you see that in this market. There's just banks are acquiring other banks to get scale at the community level.

There's a concern there. This is the dynamic you see all the time in these markets. When a large national bank comes into a market, while there's a lot of advantages to them coming in with the scale they have, the disadvantage is they don't know their customers well. And so what they tend to first lose are a lot of the small-business loans because they don't understand a lot of the small businesses. And then they lose some other local knowledge. So you'll actually start to see some de novo banks that is, startup banks although we've not had those because of the crisis. We're starting to see a little uptick in some of the de novos, the new banks that are coming in. So larger banks acquire, they lose touch with some of the idiosyncrasies of those local markets. So that's the plus for the small banks. That's their core you know, that's their comparative advantage.

A good example. Again, this is Bank of Bird-in-Hand. So our regulators actually had to spend some time learning their business because here is an Amish farmer who has a barn and we ask, OK, you're going to get a loan; let's see your insurance on the barn. And the bank says, well, they don't have any. And we say, what, they don't have any? No, no, no, no, no, no, right? You know, Risk Management 101, you know. They're Amish. When the barn burns down, the community comes and rebuilds the barn, right? Well, a big national bank would have no clue about that, right? Just like that concept just but those individuals living in that community completely understand the local culture of that community and they serve that community.

Another good example, in the insurance world. My daughter and her husband sold a bought a place in South Philly, a gentrifying area of South Philly. They called a bunch of national insurers for homeowners, and the person asked, do you have a flat roof? Yes. So you live in a townhouse? No, I live in a rowhouse. There is no such thing as a rowhouse. I have a townhouse on my screen. (Laughter.) I don't know what a rowhouse is, right? I'm sitting in, I don't know, Omaha or something. I have no idea what a rowhouse is. So they finally gave up, after days of trying. They went down the street to the local insurance guy. He said, yeah, we get this all the time, you know? So there's local knowledge that matters.

The challenge for the small institutions, they've been challenged in this low-rate environment. Their margins have been really compressed. That's starting to ease up a little bit as rates start to come up, so there's some relief there.

But the other two areas that they're deeply concerned about, one is in the area of cybersecurity because they don't have the ability to protect themselves like the large guys. Now, most of these banks don't actually build their own back-office stuff, right? They go to a third-party vendor, and they, frankly, just have to trust that that third-party vendor knows what they're doing. And we try to help them through our regulatory process to do some due diligence. But this is number one on their list.

In fact, for the last several years we've been convening large banks in our district together with the U.S. attorney, Secret Service the Secret Service has some jurisdiction in this space and us and the FBI to give them advice on how to protect themselves. And some of the advice, it's high-tech, but here's a good example.

This is one I sat in on a bunch of these meetings, and our chief information security officer asked a bunch of information security officers: How many email addresses do you have at your bank? And everybody said, one. So you used the same email address to go to the Web as you do to manage your network? Yeah. Ooh, that's a bad thing. (Laughter.) So, one, you have two email addresses, one that never goes outside the bank. It was one of these a-ha moments. Like, well that's cheap, right? So there's some simple cyber hygiene that we're trying to provide the institutions.

But the last piece is probably the most problematic, and I don't know what to do about it because I believe these institutions are really important. In the old days I hate using that phrase but the large financial institutions had bank training programs. They hired freshly minted undergraduates, trained them on how to be a banker. They'd work at the big bank for a while, then the smaller banks would hire them, promote them with a higher level of authority. Those programs are gone. So a lot of these community banks that are aging out. You look at the age profile of their management team and they don't have people behind them to take over.

So I've heard from a lot of these folks. The dynamic is it's time to get out, right? We'll just sell, because I can't find people I don't have a succession plan for myself. That you don't think about, but that's very real for a lot of these institutions. And so I don't know how to solve that one.

The cyber one, we're helping a little bit. But those institutions I mean, again, we think we're living in cities, we're urban. You go out to the small, rural communities throughout America, these small banks are their lifeblood, right? And without them, they're in real trouble. So we want to try to maintain that community banking structure.

Q: What I also am wondering is, is there a move of the Fed with respect to its responsibility to grow the economy, if community banks were necessary and if fintech is about to crush them? And one of the things the American Bankers Association has a for-profit arm that sells services to its member banks so that they can compete. What I'm wondering is, is that a role that the Fed might have to step in?

MR. HARKER: Yeah.

Q: You know, beyond you're already in this business with (Automated Clearing House) and check clearance. I wonder if you need a broader 

MR. HARKER: Yeah, I'm not sure, because what's emerging we have one here in this district  are bankers' banks. So in between us we're the ultimate banker's bank, right, because we're the lender of last resort and the bank, there are emerging coalitions of banks that form another company that provides all the scale services, right? So they provide all the (information technology), the IT support. The one bank I'm thinking about even provides low-cost telecommunications and Web services to the bank, and provides a whole and also credit. So I think there is an intermediary in there that's starting to emerge that I actually am pretty supportive of because they're allowing these small institutions to do their thing, knowing their customer, but then not having to worry about all this other stuff. That's what the banker's bank does.

And so that outsourcing of a lot of that activity is actually, I think, quite beneficial. I've written on this. There's a paper that I wrote with my colleague Grard Cachon several years ago on independent of whether you would even have the scale issue, which you do, it may be in these small banks' self-interest in terms of price competition to do this. And there's a long theoretical argument why that's the case, but that's playing out in the market right now, that these coalitions actually seem to make a lot of sense to me. And so I would encourage these banker's banks to continue to grow.

Q: Take you back to the risks. You were talking about the idea of outsourcing part of your the things you do. Like somebody does checks to make sure the IRA regulations are being followed or whatever. The more you move things out, don't you increase risk? Now you are depending upon the  somebody (inaudible)  the external agencies who are providing essential regulatory services for you.

MR. HARKER: Well, I don't think I'm necessarily talking about them providing the regulatory services. They may provide training and so forth. But you as a bank are still going to need a compliance staff. We're going to insist on that, right, as a regulator. And the state regulator will, too.

So it's now, it's more of the scale stuff, the IT stuff, right, that I think you can get dramatic cost savings with, particularly as we move to cloud computing. And that's a slow process for the industry because of security and security concerns, but it is it is happening. And so I think you're going to see more and more of this with cloud computing.

Q: Let me take you back on trust for a moment. There is at some high level either regulation the regulatory mechanism is providing increasing trust in the enterprise and (inaudible). But in some ways (inaudible)  especially during the recession, things broke because people didn't expect it. (Inaudible) things depended on things depended on things that nobody understood, including the regulators.

MR. HARKER: That was yep, and nor did many people in the bank. (Chuckles.)

Q: (Inaudible)   right? So the regulators are charged now with assessing the risks, but there might be areas where risk is extremely hard to assess. Would that then put a ceiling on the kind of trust we can expect to get from the institutions?

MR. HARKER: Well, look, I think healthy skepticism's always a good thing, right? So we're never going to be perfect at this. I mean, I think you have to go into this just facing reality: you're never going to be perfect at this. And if there are going to be issues, the goal I mean, you're going to miss things. I mean, I think it's just human nature, right? You're just going to miss them. At least try to minimize the damage, right?

And so part of the issue is trying to figure out all those tightly coupled I mean, think about what we had. It was this tightly, tightly coupled system, right, where there were all kinds of derivative products that people were investing in and not knowing and it just cascaded along. And when you pulled out one string, this whole thing came apart.

So this is the engineer in me, right: Don't design such tightly coupled system (laughs) right, to the extent you can. Or least put buffers in, right, so that when that one string gets pulled, only a piece of it fails, right? I mean, this is the kind of engineering design thinking that's part and parcel of what we do. And I think that's how we have to think of regulators, too.

There won't be a perfect solution for everything, but I think it's and it's, by the way, the same way that people are thinking about cyberattacks. You're not going to stop them. Now, you try as hard as you can, you're not going to stop all of them. But at least minimize the damage when they happen, right? So, again, I think it comes back to, in these tightly, tightly coupled systems, don't make it that way, right? (Laughs.) So design it so that the network isn't that tightly coupled anymore. I think that's part of the design thinking.

There's actually been some recent papers on that in economics. There's actually a Ph.D. that's graduating I think he already graduated from Penn here, Penn State in economics, who's working on exactly that question right now. And he's been he's been at the bank a little bit and giving some seminars. So I think that's the way we need to start thinking in terms of regulation. We want a level playing field, but we want to minimize risk. We're never going to get rid of it completely. In fact, it would be dangerous to get rid of it completely because the economy grows with prudent risk-taking, right? So you don't you can't get rid of all risk because that's just unhealthy for the economy, but you can get rid of these let's call them catastrophic risks.

Populists, Globalists Clash on Financial Integration

Resurgent nationalism in the U.S. and Europe could have lasting consequences for global financial regulatory standards, and some argue the changes could hurt economic growth and financial stability.

The twin geopolitical earthquakes of Brexit and the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president pose acute challenges to regulatory bodies such as the European Commission or the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and their ability to impose or recommend (with any significant amount of moral suasion) uniform standards for the global financial system.

With Brexit in particular, the financial integration of the European Union is at stake, given the likely loss of "passporting" privileges for British banks, which have long constituted the hub of financial services in Europe. Passporting allows London-based lenders and insurers to operate anywhere in the EU. Large multinational banks with operations in London are "https://www.wsj.com/articles/j-p-morgan-scours-europe-for-best-post-brexit-home-1490779804"for new homes within EU member countries.

"You've just turned your back on 40 years of financial integration," said Institute of International Finance President Tim Adams in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, referring to Brexit. A subsequent "tit-for-tat effort to wall off capital" would introduce major inefficiencies into global capital markets and encourage financial institutions to seek favors from national regulators, rather than operating under a set of uniform international standards, he said.

Mr. Adams highlighted the impact that devolution in financial integration could have on economic activity, using the example of an international supply chain. In an integrated system, a single bank could handle the financing for all the transactions involved in a particular deal, regardless of where they occurred. But in a less-integrated system, different banks might have to finance individual parts of the deal creating inefficiencies and higher costs for the parties involved as well as consumers.

Brexit, which has been championed by Mr. Trump as an example of nationalist interests winning out over unaccountable globalists, has also emboldened Republican skeptics of international regulatory bodies.

Shortly after Mr. Trump's inauguration, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R., N.C.), the vice chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen calling negotiations with international standards setters like the Basel Committee "unacceptable."

In a committee hearing shortly after that, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-lawmakers-tell-yellen-to-pause-new-fed-rules-1487201336"on suggestions the Fed should stop engaging in conversations with international regulators and noted that rules are only binding if U.S. regulators choose to implement them.

Nonetheless, some international regulators recognize the need to be more transparent and accountable if they are to maintain the trust of national policy makers, particularly those skeptical of their mission.

"https://www.bis.org/speeches/sp170228.pdf"about financial integration in Geneva in February, Bank for International Settlements General Manager Jaime Caruana argued for making the "positive case for financial globalization," which he said has been responsible for boosting living standards.

Financial globalization hasn't yet reached its peak potential, Mr. Caruana said, cautioning that potential "can be realized only if there is far-reaching cooperation in its management."

Both the U.K. and the Trump administration seem to be moving away from the model of international cooperation on regulatory standards and financial integration. It remains to be seen whether the "globalists'" can regain their footing in the debate and restore the influence of international financial organizations.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Dodd-Frank Overhaul Vote Unlikely Before Summer, Lawmaker Says

By Ryan Tracy

WASHINGTON The House won't vote until this summer at the earliest on changes to the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law, a senior Republican said Monday, demonstrating how the path for regulatory relief remains in flux as lawmakers grapple with health-care policy, a tax overhaul and other issues.

Rep. Patrick McHenry (R., N.C.) said financial regulatory policy could make it to the House floor "when it is warm out &perhaps June, July would be my hope." The vice chairman of the House Financial Services Committee and Republicans' chief deputy whip in the House was speaking in an interview with WSJ Pro Financial Regulation.

"The whole year is shifted because we have taken longer on health care," Mr. McHenry added, saying he and other Republicans need to get used to passing "imperfect" legislation that can actually become law. When a Democrat was in the White House, GOP ideas were unlikely to become law, but now Republicans "are shooting with real bullets" when it comes to writing legislation, he said.

When Republicans do move toward voting on a financial regulatory bill, there is "no question" the House can "pass a major change to financial services law," Mr. McHenry said. "What the Senate can do from there is an open question," he added, nodding to the fact major Dodd-Frank changes might face opposition from Senate Democrats.

Mr. McHenry said there are other ways for Republicans to adopt major financial regulatory changes. Republicans are considering using changes in financial services law to "pay for" a tax overhaul, he said. He mentioned one specific provision: repealing the government's authority under Dodd-Frank to provide temporary loans to a failing financial firm.

The Congressional Budget Office estimates repealing the provision, known as orderly liquidation authority, could save about $15 billion over 10 years. "Even in D.C., that is real money," Mr. McHenry said. "It is a large enough dollar amount where the threshold would make sense for the fight."

Other potential changes that could find their way into a tax overhaul or budget bill are more in flux, Mr. McHenry said. That includes changes to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's structure, which he described as a "moving target" because Republicans have different ideas for how they want to change the agency.

Mr. McHenry also called on U.S. regulators to disclose more information about the positions they take in international regulatory discussions, including on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.

He criticized the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency for what he views as moving too fast in its recent efforts to adopt a federal banking charter for financial-technology firms, and said that the OCC's efforts have resulted in a charter that is probably too narrow for those firms to try to obtain.

"I would like to give them more authority," he said, referring to potential legislation giving federal regulators wider latitude to offer charters for fintech firms. "I don't think you're going to have a huge movement into the space around what the OCC is attempting to do."

WSJ Pro Transcript: Fed's Kashkari on Too Big to Fail, Dodd-Frank and More

Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, delivered remarks and took questions at an event on March 31, 2017, at the Minnesota CLE Conference Center, in Minneapolis. He discussed the structure of the Fed, the issue of "too-big-to-fail" financial institutions, the 2010 Dodd-Frank law and other issues. Here is a transcript of the exchange edited for clarity and length.

NEEL KASHKARI: I do want to make it a conversation. So, please, I always ask audiences to show me respect by asking me your toughest question. And I mean that sincerely, because if you're thinking of a tough question there's a chance somebody else is thinking of a tough question, and I'd rather get it out in the open and have a chance to address it than have you leave having not asked and answered your question. I'm only going to speak for a few minutes up front, and then I'll turn to Karen and we'll have a discussion, and then turn to all of you.

Let me just start with level setting. You all most of you probably know this but some people many not on why I'm here. I didn't know a lot about the Federal Reserve before I went to Washington when I was at the Treasury Department.

One of the things that's unique about our country is that our central bank is distributed around the country. If you look back in American history, as a country we hated the idea of having a central bank at all. Alexander Hamilton created the first one. It lasted about 20 years. We didn't like the idea of all this power concentrated in this group in Washington. It just felt un-American.

And so we had these fits and starts and then we had a lot of financial crises in the 1800s, and finally Congress said, we need to do something about this, and they just said, we need a central bank.

And so but the negotiation was the compromise was we're going to have a central bank but it's not going to be all concentrated in one place in Washington, D.C. under the control of the executive branch. So the compromise was they created the Board of Governors in Washington and then they created 12 regional Federal Reserve banks around the country and those regional bank presidents, myself included, are appointed by local representatives.

So there's a board of directors here. It's chaired by a woman named MayKao Hang, who runs the Wilder Foundation in St. Paul. Our deputy chair is Ken Powell, the CEO of General Mills and there's nine total and they're the ones who did a search and ended up appointing me. And the point of this is that you get a distributed central bank. You have a diverse set of perspectives, not just representing Washington, not just representing New York.

So the reason that's important for you to understand is it's important for me to hear from you so I can get a better sense of what's going on in our region. I travel a lot around our region, which is Minnesota, North and South Dakota, Montana, part of Michigan, part of Wisconsin, to understand what's happening in the local economy, what's happening in the credit market there, and that helps me become smarter. When I go back to Washington, D.C., and make our policy recommendations, I'm here to represent you and to represent your clients. And so that's why I'm here and that's why it is very important that I hear directly from you what's on your mind and what you are seeing and experiencing.

Now, I've been at the bank for a little over a year. I joined January of last year. One of the first issues I wanted to take on was the issue of too-big-to- fail. So I was as Karen said, I was one of the first responders to the financial crisis. I saw firsthand how hard it was to arrest the crisis once it was in full bloom and I feel very strongly we never want to have that happen again as a country.

The problem is if you look at human history, human societies are prone to exuberance. They're prone to overreach. They're prone to crisis. So these things happen every 50 years, every 80 years, every hundred years and they tend to be different when they happen in the future. But there are echoes. There are some similarities as they happen.

And so I, right out of the gate, started with our researchers at the Minneapolis Fed, which has been a longtime leader on the issue of too big to fail, and said, what can we do about this what analysis can we bring to the table. And so last year we brought the best experts in the world to Minneapolis, hear from them. Some of them said, break up the banks. Some of them said, increase capital for the banks. Some of them said, don't do anything Dodd-Frank is just fine it's addressed the problem.

But we said, let's hear all sides let's do our own analysis and put forward our own plan, and in November we released a draft of that plan and we've been receiving comments and are preparing to release a final plan. The bottom line is, and I've been saying this to anybody who will listen, is the biggest banks are absolutely still too big to fail. Don't let anybody tell you otherwise.

If one of the big banks ran into trouble today, they would be in the Oval Office on their knees begging for a bailout and the administration would have little choice but to help. Why? Because you all saw what happened when Lehman went into bankruptcy, the chaos it created in the money market markets, the chaos it created in the broader banking sector, in the nonbanking sector. It almost brought our economy to its knees. Only with massive government intervention both in the money markets themselves and through the (Troubled Asset Relief Program) and the Federal Reserve were we able to stabilize the economy.

And so I don't think that's a good situation for us to be in as a country and so the plan after all the analysis that we did, the plan that we put forward effectively doubles the capital requirements of the biggest banks and it forces them to make a tough choice: you can either stay large that's fine and you're going to have a lot more capital to protect all of us, or you can choose to restructure yourselves, and if your business model can support that higher capital, that's great. You can choose to make that decision. You decide how to respond to that.

But the bottom line is the taxpayer should not be on the hook for the big risks that the biggest banks are taking. And keep in mind, when you and I go to get a home loan the banks ask us to put 20% down, typically. Why do they do that? That 20% is to protect the banks in case you and I screw up and get into financial trouble.

Well, it's pretty simple. If we make the biggest banks put 20% down on their investments, then we get protected from their bad investments and their bad bets. Seems pretty fair to me. So our basic plan and there's a lot of detail there's 50 pages of detail on our website you can look at our basic plan is substantially higher capital requirements on the biggest banks those $250 billion in assets and above and then with that we can relax regulations on the small banks that are not systemically risky, because I know you hear from a lot of small banks I do how they're getting smothered by the same regulatory net that's trying to address too big to fail.

Well, the truth is little community banks are not systemically risky for the economy, they do have a very important role to play in providing credit to our communities and they should not be captured in the same regulatory net. So that was a big a big initiative for us and I'm proud of the work that we've done and, again, happy to take your feedback.

I'll say this. We put this out. We sought comments from experts. To be blunt, nobody's been able to poke holes in our analysis. Our analysis is spot on and I'm very proud of that and it's based on analysis that the (International Monetary Fund) has done looking at the history of financial crises around the world and figuring out how do we best learn from that, how do we best have a regulatory system that can protect us from that and how do we do it in a way that society is better off. So that's number one.

Number two, in a very different way, one of the things that surprised me about our region you know, this is a really remarkable local economy. It's very diverse. We have financial services. We have manufacturing. We have ag. We have mining. We have health care, et cetera. It's a diverse economy that's doing quite well overall and we have overall low unemployment.

But we have huge gaps in our society here all around the country but also here, and that surprised me the extent of the racial and economic disparity in our region, and I wanted to understand why that is. And so I started talking to economists at the Minneapolis Fed and around the country and I was amazed at how little we understand what the source is of those gaps.

I'll give you just a data point. In America nationwide, black unemployment is almost always twice white unemployment. If it's a booming economy and white unemployment is four, there's a really good bet that black unemployment is going to be eight. If it's a recession and white unemployment is seven, pretty good bet black unemployment is going to be 14. And even if you adjust for education, so it's college graduates versus college graduates, same disparity, or non-high-school graduate versus non-high-school graduate, same disparities.

So I started asking the basic questions. Why is that? What are the structural factors? Now, we know as the nation's central bank we can't tailor monetary policy to individual communities or segments or groups. It's a blunt tool for the whole country. But my view is if we can do the research to understand these problems and put forward ideas that other policy makers, whether it's the executive branch or Congress, could then take and implement and do something with, then that's an appropriate role for us to play.

So in January of this year, a few months ago, we announced what we're calling the Opportunity and Inclusive Growth Institute, which is a research institute focused on understanding economic and racial disparities. And it's not just about race. t's also about rural communities and the gaps between rural America and the cities that are generally doing better, understanding what can be done, whether it's education or housing, et cetera.

And so we're just getting started. In May, we're having our first conference. We've recruited the best academics in the country who are working on these issues to advise us as our board of advisers. We have visiting scholars who are going to be coming from around the country to Minneapolis to work with us to understand these issues and see what role the Federal Reserve can play in analyzing that and putting forward solutions.

This is a long-term research initiative. It's going to take years. I mean, honestly, these problems are decades or more in the making. We're not going to come up with answers overnight. But we're going to do our part and we're going to get going, and so that's another big initiative.

And what the thread that is woven underneath all of this is I want us to take on the biggest economic challenges that we face as a nation, period. I believe the Federal Reserve banks, and there is 12 of them, should be research centers taking on these big long-term issues. If we're not going to do it, who's going to do it?

I mean, you're watching Washington like I am. Washington, by its nature, being a political city, is much more has to be focused on short-term issues, short-term challenges. Somebody needs to be doing the long-term economic research and thinking on these big challenges and I want us to play that role in partnership with others. And so that's what we're going to do.

And so with that, happy to I could sit down next to you, Karen 

MS. GRANDSTRAND: Well, you've made several comments about the structure of the Fed and its decentralized structure, and there have been numerous proposals saying that it doesn't work anymore. What do you say to those? Any merit?

MR. KASHKARI: You know, it's nobody would if you started from a clean sheet of paper today nobody would design it exactly the way it is today. I'll give you an example. So the Minneapolis Fed, we're here in Minnesota. We have a fairly small population. The San Francisco Fed has 60 million people in their Western region of the country.

Now, a hundred years ago these diagrams, the way the districts were designed, made sense. Missouri has two Federal Reserve banks. They're in St. Louis and Kansas City. That was a compromise to buy off some very powerful senator who was negotiating the bill. So if you started with a clean sheet of paper you wouldn't design it this way.

Having said that, it works, and, you know, we've found a way over decades to get the system to work and so I think we need to be more transparent in how we're making decisions. I think we need to be engaged with the public more, more transparent, getting more feedback so that people have confidence in the way we're approaching our decisions.

So I'm doing everything I can to try to innovate in how we reach out to people, whether it's doing a lot of Q&A like this. By the way, the reason we're live streaming this is I want as many people who want to know what I'm talking about, what I'm doing, I want them to be able to do that.

So I live stream all of my events. I'm on Twitter. I do Twitter Q&A with people to engage with people from the public. I'm looking for every way I can to try to demystify the Fed and I think if people saw what we're really doing people would have a lot of confidence in the current structure. So I don't think we need a big change in the structure. I do think we need to communicate more freely than we have been historically.

MS. GRANDSTRAND: You've seen many aspects of government. You were at Treasury. You ran for governor in the state of California. Anything surprise you about the Fed? Anything you didn't expect?

MR. KASHKARI: You know, I knew the Fed from when I was at Treasury because we worked very closely together, had very smart people, very high quality, dedicated to public service, and that's absolutely true. If you got to know our colleagues here in Minnesota and around the country at the Minneapolis Fed and elsewhere, you'd be very proud of them and proud that our nation attracts people who have this commitment to public service.

So that didn't surprise me. I knew that. One thing that did surprise me is I talked about some of the disparities and the racial gaps in our region. We have those in the Fed, too. We don't have enough diversity in the Fed itself and it's something that we are working hard to try to improve.

So if you look at the (Federal Open Market Committee), currently I'm the only nonwhite person on the FOMC. The new Atlanta Fed the Atlanta Fed just selected a new president, [an] economist named Raphael Bostic. He'll be the first African-American Federal Reserve Bank president in the history of the country. It's amazing. It took 103 years for one of the 12 presidents to become African-American. And so we need more diversity at the Fed at the staff level and at the senior levels. It's something the whole system is committed to. I was surprised to the extent of that before I got in and saw it for myself.

MS. GRANDSTRAND: You talked about the plan and too big to fail, and you referenced two pieces of it, I think, and I believe it's a four-step plan. The first step was the capitalization of the very biggest banks. How are you defining the big banks?

MR. KASHKARI: So $250 billion assets and above.

MS. GRANDSTRAND: So why that benchmark?

MR. KASHKARI: You know, that's admittedly, it's somewhat arbitrary. Whenever you make policy you have to pick some boundaries, and it just based on our analysis and looking at different literature reviews, it seemed like that was a reasonable way to capture the biggest banks. And the truth is the idea of systemic risk there is judgment involved. I wish it was a simple formula that we could perfectly define, and it is contextual.

So I'll give you an example. You know, Bear Stearns was saved in a weekend in March 2008 when the financial system was in a very perilous state. If Bear Stearns had run into trouble three years earlier and the economy was very strong and all the other banks were fine, it probably would have been okay to just let Bear Stearns go into bankruptcy. So the definition of what is systemic depends on what else is happening in the rest of the economy. And so we just looked at the biggest institutions in America and said, we have to draw a line somewhere. This seemed like a conservative place to draw the line that erred on the side of protecting taxpayers rather than protecting shareholders.

MS. GRANDSTRAND: Second part of your plan gets at the systemic risk, and you've designated the secretary of the Treasury to have a pretty significant role. Why did you put that huge obligation with the secretary of the Treasury?

MR. KASHKARI: So what in what we say in the plan is for these biggest banks it's about a dozen of them first thing we do is you take up their capital levels to, roughly, double where they are today and then the Treasury secretary must certify affirmatively that these banks are no longer too big to fail.

Now, imagine you're the Treasury secretary. You're not going to want to make that certification because if you certify that this bank is no longer too big to fail and it runs into trouble and it needs a bailout, you have some big-time egg on your face.

So we wanted to put the Treasury secretary in a bind to make the Treasury secretary really reluctant to make that certification, and he or she will only make that certification if they are really confident that this bank is no longer too big to fail, and if they if they refuse to make that certification, the capital levels start cranking up even higher.

And this will put again, the whole idea is we want somebody on the hook to make this call. And if they don't make the call because they're not sure taxpayers are protected, the banks are going to see even higher capital levels, which is going to create huge incentives for the banks to restructure themselves.

So here's the thing. The banks love to tell you and me and brag about their great economies of scale that we all benefit from as a society. Well, if the banks actually have these great economies of scale that we all benefit from, they can afford higher capital. If they cannot afford higher capital, then these economies of scale are a myth and all they're doing is their business model depends on taxpayer subsidies, in a sense. So we're putting that to the test by ratcheting up capital requirements automatically absent this certification.

MS. GRANDSTRAND: But if you ratchet up capital won't people put their money elsewhere?

MR. KASHKARI: Absolutely.

MS. GRANDSTRAND: What's going to stop investors from not putting money in other industries and will we have management talent also leave the federal or the financial services industry?

MR. KASHKARI: Well, I mean, what would you expect to have happen? So we jack up the capital requirements on the biggest 12 banks in America. What's going to happen? One is those banks may choose to restructure themselves, which I would not be opposed to.

Two, they may the activity and the talent may move to community banks or regional banks. We may not have a we won't have as concentrated a banking sector as we have today. We'll have a more competitive banking market, which I also think is good for the economy. I also think it's good for financial stability to having more diversity and more competition, and smaller banks playing a bigger role. So I think that's a good thing.

The bigger risk that we're worried about is activity moving from the biggest banks let's say, J.P. Morgan or Goldman Sachs to hedge funds, and if it all moves from J.P. Morgan to Citadel or Bridgewater these really big hedge funds have we really accomplished anything or have we just moved the risk from one place to another. And that's why in step three of the plan we apply a tax on the debt of the biggest shadow banks.

So if you're a little shadow bank, a little hedge fund, you don't pay any tax. Or if you're a big hedge fund and you don't have any debt, you don't pay any tax. But if you're a big hedge fund, 50 billion (dollars) and above that's debt financing your investments then that could be a systemic risk in the future and we want to level the playing field so that the cost of funding of the highly capitalized banks and these big shadow banks is level.

So there's no incentive to migrate the activity to just some other unregulated part of the market and this, we think, is a real innovation. Nobody else had put out put forward a way to deal with the shadow banks and we do, and so we do think that that's important.

MS. GRANDSTRAND: Now, you've talked about big banks and community banks. What about the middle?

MR. KASHKARI: In the middle, we are leaving them alone, basically saying we're not calling for any change to the current regulations that they're undergoing. We're not increasing their capital requirements.

I will say this. If we have confidence that the biggest banks are all highly capitalized, then the system as a whole is much more resilient than it is today. And then we could look at all sorts of regulations and saying, do you need these other regulations on whether it's community banks or mid-sized banks, do you need to be have them as onerous as perhaps they are today?

You know, and having the biggest banks with substantially higher capital requirements, it's like vaccinating them, right? You vaccinate the herd, and then any one of them can't bring down the whole herd because the whole herd has been vaccinated. And that's why it's so important that the biggest banks all have higher capital.

MS. GRANDSTRAND: One thing I liked about in reading your plan is you addressed supervision and regulation. In my experience, people tend to talk about regulation and forget about the supervision part, which to me is important and very distinct from regulation, particularly in this environment where on-site exams, informal rule-making, policy statements I would argue probably affect the banking industry maybe more than some of the statutes and rules. So what do you envision in terms of that supervision of the community banks versus the midsize versus the big? Will the exam process stay the same? Would you allow this informal rule-making to continue? Do we need to redo that part of the equation?

MR. KASHKARI: Yeah. I think on both sides, supervision and regulation for community banks, we need to take a fresh look and get it right. And again, I just talked to a lot of community banks. But some of the things that they're asking about, just to be candid, are not things that maybe the Fed or the OCC directly affects. It may be things that it's the CFPB. And so I think we need to take a comprehensive view on what we're putting community banks through.

I'll give you I wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal a few months ago about my own experience getting a home loan in Minnesota, which was brutal. I mean, I couldn't believe how painful the process was in terms of the documentation requirements. I thought that they had figured out who I was and they were punking me (laughter) by just continuing to ask me more and more and more things.

MS. GRANDSTRAND: Maybe they were.

MR. KASHKARI: Maybe they were.

And so it was just and I actually felt bad for because of the banker that I was dealing with, the mortgage lender, would call me and apologize that underwriting was asking for this additional documents. He's, like, I know this is ridiculous, but there is no negotiating with the underwriting department. It was I mean, I felt bad for them because it felt like a climate of fear, like, just they're terrified of making a mistake. I finally got the loan approved and I bought my house, but it was still a very, very painful process.

So I and I do think that we have it we do need to take a step back and look at what we're doing, doesn't make sense, rationalize these things, especially for community banks, which are not systemically risky for the economy and because they are uniquely positioned to provide credit, especially in small communities in America. It's very hard for the Bank of Americas and Citibanks and J.P. Morgans to know what's happening in rural communities across our region. That's the role that community banks have to play. And so I do think we have to take a fresh look.

But I also know, when I and I meet with members of the House and Senate a lot when I'm in Washington. While there seems to be bipartisan consensus on wanting to relax regulations on community banks, they're nervous that that might be a Trojan horse for relaxing regulations on the biggest banks. And that's why these two issues have become linked. And so it's so important that we really address too big to fail for the biggest banks so that we can then decouple regulation and supervision of the community banks.

MS. GRANDSTRAND: You talked about the process of going through your home loan, so that touches on, you know, consumer regulation and protection. How do we balance that consumer protection with safety and soundness? And is it your sense it's out of balance right now?

MR. KASHKARI: Well, I think if you look at loans are being made, business loans are being made. If you look at surveys of small businesses, they're generally able to get access to credit. It's just a very painful process, as I experienced. I got my loan. I was prequalified for it. I got an attractive rate. It was just an extremely painful process. So you have to really want it if you want to go through the process.

People with bad credit it's much harder to get credit today. And I'm not sure so that's unfortunate, but I'm not sure that that's necessarily a bad like, we don't want banks making loans that they will be nervous about, right? We don't want to force them to make loans to people who maybe there's not a high probability of them paying it back. And so that those getting people with helping people have better credit is a separate policy problem than whether or not banks are making loans.

So I don't know. Did I answer your question?

MS. GRANDSTRAND: Mmm hmm which leads to another interesting aspect of what's going on. Increasingly, banks are being looked to as the solution to some of those policy issues, be it redlining, jobs, terrorism. Should banks be used in that fashion?

MR. KASHKARI: Well, I think banks we need to make sure banks are treating their customers fairly. We need to make sure that you know, the Wells Fargo account scandal is pretty shocking to anybody who's looked at it. So making sure that banks are treating their customers appropriately and fairly is important, whether it's a big bank or a little bank. Making sure banks are not turning a blind eye to potential money laundering or financing of fraudulent activities or terrorist activities is also it's important that they abide by the rules and take that very seriously. And I know the regulators are focused on that appropriately so.

But we can't expect banks or banks are not there to solve all of society's problems. As I said, if we have Americans who are struggling with bad credit, that's not the banks' fault, right? Those are issues about education, financial education, financial literacy, the job market more broadly other things that affect poverty, affect families' lives, et cetera. We can't expect the banks to solve all of that.

But we can expect the banks to do their part, which is treating all their customers fairly, being honest with them and following the rules and following the law.

MS. GRANDSTRAND: One of the comments often made about your proposal is it puts the American banks at a disadvantage with their global competitors. Do you want to address that topic?

MR. KASHKARI: Sure. You know, it's true. The fact is, if you go to Europe today, they don't really care about "too big to fail." Europe basically says, we have these national champion banks, and it's their pride and joy. And if every 20 years or 30 years, have to bail them out, that's OK; we have national champions, and we're happy to have that. That's a silly policy position, I think. I don't think it's one that we as Americans should have.

And if we can show the world that we can have large banks that are well-capitalized, that are not exposing our taxpayers to unnecessary risks, then maybe we can lead the world and show the rest of the world that there is a way that they can have similar in their countries. But I don't think we should wait just because Europe wants to bail out their banks every 20 or 30 years. I don't think that that means we should follow their path.

And by the way, I'd also say, if any of these European banks that are undercapitalized want to do business in America, we should subject them to the exact same rules that we subject our banks to. And that's how we can start to level the playing field.

MS. GRANDSTRAND: Your paper spends a lot of time on the cost-benefit analysis. And my understanding is there would actually be a drag on the economy, putting in these high-capital levels. For the longer-term good, my experience is we live day to day, quarter to quarter. I mean, if you look at what shareholders expect of publicly traded banks, for example: What have you done for me today? How are you ever going to convince citizens, Congress, to take and put something in place that's going to deal with something 50 years from now, maybe, that hurts us now?

MR. KASHKARI: Well, we do it and so the analysis is this: When you raise capital requirements, there are some economists who say there is no harm to the economy, it doesn't affect credit availability. I don't believe that. I believe there is some cost to it. It does raise the cost of borrowing a little bit for those banks' borrowers.

Now, remember, we're raising capital requirements on the dozen or so biggest banks in America, none of the rest. So what'll end up happening is some of the activity is going to move smaller institutions again, which is good from a financial stability perspective.

But let's admit there are some costs. Safety isn't free. Right, this is just like physical safety. So after 9/11 we as a country imposed many new requirements to improve our physical security. We hired more police officers, hired Homeland Security officers, more metal detectors at airports. Physical safety isn't free. There is a cost-benefit analysis. We avoid potential terrorist attacks, but we pay for it in some inconvenience and some more taxes that we spend.

So we as a country have to decide how much financial safety we want. Financial safety isn't free. So we've done the analysis and said, if we raise the cost of credit a little bit for the customers of these biggest banks, but we avoid these terrible financial crises that we have you know, whether it's the Great Depression or now that we had in the in the financial crisis in '08 there is a benefit. And so do the costs exceed the benefits? No. The benefits exceed the costs. So, over time, society is better off.

One more analogy is nuclear power. A big bank is like a nuclear reactor, right? If it melts down, if it makes a mistake and fails, it's devastating for society. So what happens if there is a nuclear power meltdown? Government will spend whatever it takes to stabilize that reactor because of the costs of that meltdown are catastrophic for society. So we can either ban nuclear power, or what have we done? We regulate it so tightly that it virtually can't fail you can never say never, but it virtually can't fail.

That's the same way I think we should treat the biggest banks in America, which is, you can choose to stay large, but we're going to regulate you so that society is protected. And those regulations of nuclear power does increase the cost of power a little bit for all of us, but that's a choice that we've made. And so I feel like what we're doing is we're presenting you and the American people some options, some costs and some benefits, and then the public can decide how much safety you want in our financial system.

MS. GRANDSTRAND: Now, to accomplish your plan, do you need legislation? Can this be done only through a new regulation? And how do we get there?

MR. KASHKARI: Yeah, we do need we would need legislation, especially for things like the tax on shadow banks, et cetera. And I do think at the end of the day this decision about safety versus cost is ultimately a political decision and I don't mean partisan politics; I mean the American people expressing a view through their elected representatives. I do think that Congress is the right body to make this type of a decision. And, you know, we just got to keep educating people.

And the biggest concern that I have is we as a society tend to forget the lessons that we just recently learned. We just recently went through this terrible crisis, and now the winds are blowing, maybe we should deregulate, as though, oh, it can't happen again. And so it's not that you and I are not going to make the mistake. It's the next generation and the generation after that after we're all retired or beyond that are going to make that mistake.

And so the question is, can we put in place a regulatory system today that can stand the test of time so that when we've forgotten and now this time is different, it can't happen again, the regulations are there to protect us from ourselves?

MS. GRANDSTRAND: A number of proposals, and in particular one has focused on Glass-Steagall. What are your views on Glass-Steagall? Do we put it back in place, tweak it?

MR. KASHKARI: Yeah, you know, Glass-Steagall in my view wasn't I'm not opposed to a reintroduction of Glass-Steagall, but I don't think it would address the too big to fail issue by itself. If you look at the last crisis, just as an example, there were pure-play investment banks that got into trouble, like Lehman or Bear Stearns, and there were pure-play commercial banks that got into trouble. It wasn't simply the merging of the two of those activities. And so I'm not opposed to it, but again, I don't think it would solve the problem. All of the analysis that I've seen, or most of it, suggest that substantially higher capital requirements are the best way to address this. And even (FDIC Vice Chairman) Tom Hoenig, parts of his proposal also called for much higher capital requirements focusing on the leverage ratio.

MS. GRANDSTRAND: With respect to the supervision of banks, we were talking earlier today about how the way supervision is conducted seems to have evolved. You know, back in 1985 some of us were (chuckles) thinking back to those years there were no such things as enforcement actions. And now you open the newspaper and, you know, I think the top five headlines in American Banker are which banks have gotten the penalty of the day. What do you think about that system? Is it is it good for society to set rules through enforcement actions? How has this affected that relationship between the industry and the bank regulators?

MR. KASHKARI: Well, I mean, I can't imagine it's pleasant to receive an enforcement action. But enforcement actions in my experience come after a lot of dialogue saying, you need to address this, you need to address this, you need to address this. And they don't address it. And then guess what? You're going to get an enforcement action. And so there needs to be some form of follow-up.

It's funny; I meet with banks, and they say, oh, it's so arbitrary why we got this enforcement action, you know, we've been complying with everything. Then I go I meet with the examiners, and I meet the supervision, and I meet with folks in Washington, and they say, that's ridiculous. These are the five things we asked them to do. We asked them a year ago. They said, yes, we got it. A year later, they haven't done any of them. And we went back, and we said, we really meant it, you need to do these five things. Yeah, we got it, we're on it, we're doing it. And they didn't do it. Guess what? You're going to get an enforcement action. So there needs to be some teeth. You need to follow the rules.

MS. GRANDSTRAND: Switching topics you made headlines recently for your dissenting vote. You want to talk a little bit about the FOMC, why you dissented, and what happens (inaudible) doors?

MR. KASHKARI: Sure. So I in the last in March, the FOMC meeting, the FOMC (inaudible) to raise interest rates by 25 basis points. And I was the lone voter to dissent, saying, no, we should hold rates steady. And I have in January I published an article looking at exactly the data that I look at on inflation, on the job market to reach my decision on where the appropriate level of interest rates is. If you're really interested in this topic, there is a lot of detail in that website that I would point you to.

So Congress has given the Fed what we call a dual mandate, which is stable prices which means what we define as 2% inflation and maximum employment, as many Americans working as who want to work as possible. So we look at data on both of those to see, are we achieving our dual mandate? And if you look over the last five or six years, we keep getting it wrong. For five or six years in a row, we keep expecting inflation's going to rebound, right around the corner, and we keep thinking, oh, the job market is as strong as it's going to get.

Well, it turns out inflation has been coming in under our target consistently for the past several years and the job market keeps exceeding our expectations. We keep thinking that we're at maximum employment, and then all these Americans re-enter the labor force which is a really good thing and it turns out we're not yet at maximum employment. So we would have declared victory too soon.

So I voted no because in both of those measurements we're not there yet. You know, just this morning our measure the most important measure we look at for inflation, called PCE or personal-consumption expenditures, came out, and core inflation which strips out energy and food, which are really volatile core inflation ticked up ever so slightly, maybe from 1.7 to 1.8, but it's more rounding than anything. So we're still coming up a little short on our inflation target, and we're not coming up quickly at all, and the job market keeps surprising us.

You know, one of the data points that we look at is called labor-force participation, how many Americans are in the labor force. And it fell dramatically after the financial crisis. Now, a lot of people said, well, that's because of demographics. Our society is aging. More people are retiring. But even if you strip out retirees and you just look at working-age Americans, there's still some room to come back to what we used to consider normal in terms of how many working-age adults are actually working.

So, because we're coming up short on both of our measurements, I said there's no reason to hurry up and raise rates. Let's let inflation keep climbing back to target, and let's see how the job market if it can keep strengthening and bringing workers back in, that's a good thing.

And so I don't think there's a huge disagreement between me and my colleagues. We're looking at the same data. I just see the balance of risk a little differently than they do.

MS. GRANDSTRAND: Could you comment on the Fed's balance sheet?

MR. KASHKARI: Sure. This is a topic of great interest these days. We have about a $4 1/2 trillion balance sheet as a result of the quantitative easing programs that the Fed launched after the financial crisis. And the reason this is let me just back up for a second. The reason the Fed launched (quantitative easing) is because interest rates fell so what are interest rates? Interest rates are where savings and investment are meant to balance. They clear the market. Interest rates fell down to zero because of the Great Recession and the financial crisis and the slow recovery. But if you look at the economic fundamentals, the economy as a whole was actually calling for deeply negative interest rates to clear the market of savings and investment. But the Fed couldn't do that. They were stuck at zero. So either they were out of ammunition, or they said we need another tool to provide monetary stimulus to the economy because we can't go deeply negative. So they said, well, we're going to buy up long-term bonds to try to drive down long-term interest rates, which will have a similar effect as reducing interest rates. So that's why the Fed ballooned its balance sheet.

Now that the economy is getting stronger and we're starting to raise interest rates, there is interest among FOMC members to start to shrink that balance sheet in a gradual and predictable way. And so what I've said is I would like us to announce our detailed plan for exactly how we're going to do that so the markets can see it, can understand it, we can see the market's reaction to it, and give the markets as much advance warning as possible. Then we start that process, and then we can go on with interest rate increases when the data call for it.

MS. GRANDSTRAND: I gather from your comment you would support greater transparency in terms of Fed decision-making?

MR. KASHKARI: Yeah, I think so, and different transparency.

So one thing that's different about me and my colleagues is I never make I don't think I do ever make predictions about when the next rate hike is going to be or how many we're going to have this year or next year. The reason is we're usually wrong, and people get really upset when we say, oh, it's going to be three hikes this year it's going to be three hikes, and then it ends up being one. Or it's going to be four hikes, and then it ends up being one. And so I just think it adds a lot of noise and confusion when you have all these Fed heads offering these predictions about how many hikes there are going to be.

So I think it's much better to say I don't know how many hikes there are going to be; here's the data I'm going to look at in reaching my decisions. I'll be very transparent in terms of what data I look at. You can look at the same data I do. You can look at it in the same real time that I do, and you can use your own judgment. And so I try to err on the side of giving you more information about what data I think is most important rather than making predictions, which I think just leads to confusion. And so I would encourage us to have a different type of communication, rather than more of the same communication.

MS. GRANDSTRAND: I think it's time now to open it up to the audience and the really hard questions.

MR. KASHKARI: Good.

MS. GRANDSTRAND: So do we have our first question?

Q: Your proposal to double the capital obviously has a number of industry people who think it's not a good idea, but I haven't seen a lot of support from your fellow bank presidents. Why? And without that support, does it really go anywhere?

MR. KASHKARI: Well, some of them I'll let them speak for themselves. Some of them have expressed some support on the idea of more capital for less you know, if you really increase the capital requirements, you could relax some of the other rules. I think that there's more support for that than maybe you realize. You know, we'll see. I feel like my job is to identify risks, call them out, being as transparent as I can, and offer potential solutions, and then it's up to regulators and ultimately up to Congress to decide what to do with that. And so we're going to keep pushing. You know, I meet with as I mentioned, I meet with senators and representatives of both sides of the aisle, and there's a lot of agreement that we need to address the too-big-to-fail issue. And there's a lot of agreement that we need to relax regulations on community banks, and so this is one of those issues where I actually think something could get done in Washington. But I don't feel like just because it's hard means I shouldn't take it on.

Q: Karen asked you a question about transparency. So from the standpoint of an ignorant observer who reads the newspaper, it seems like there's been this evolving trend toward greater transparency over the years at the Fed. So things that used to be a black box, policy decisions and the like, are now talked about, as you mentioned, with fairly divergent approaches. Is that the new normal? Is that intentional? Has it just happened over time?

MR. KASHKARI: No, it is intentional. You know, so the Fed's posture really in the Greenspan era was we're like "The Wizard of Oz," right? We're so mysterious; don't even ask because you couldn't understand, and we wouldn't tell you anyway. And that didn't serve us well. Because when the financial crisis hit, all of a sudden we needed the American people to trust us, and we had not earned that trust because we had not built that trust over time. And so we're still paying the price for that lack of transparency. So all of us are trying in our own ways to be more transparent, to earn the trust of the public that we need in order to do our jobs.

And so yeah, I think that that is it's intentional. You know, for example, in the 80s the Fed never even put out a statement when they made a monetary policy decision. They just figured the markets would figure it out depending on what's happening in interest rates. Now, we put out statements after every meeting. Now, four times a year the chair does a press conference. So starting with the chair first Chair (Ben) Bernanke and now Chair (Janet) Yellen they've really dialed up transparency and communications and all Fed principals are trying.

Q: What did you do up to this time to cut possibility of stealing money of small organizations by some individuals? For instance, secretary-treasurer of some organizations can take all money of their organization and move to another account, and nobody has access to them. An organization comes to a sort of dying situation because it cannot pay their financial obligations. So did you do something not you your organization did something to preclude, to stop such situation?

MR. KASHKARI: So let's say you have an institution of some kind and you have a financial professional who could steal from that institution by routing the money somewhere where nobody else knows where it's gone. Is that right?

Q: Yeah, nobody knows because you will not tell.

MR. KASHKARI: Well, so I think now you're getting into things like audits and financial controls and the ability you know, does that institution have appropriate financial control? So I think the Fed's role is, as we're supervising banks, we're also talking to the auditors, we're also looking at the financial controls to make sure that the appropriate financial controls are in place. But you're right, it is very hard to prevent one sole bad actor from doing something bad in their own institution, and it's, as you've indicated, in that institution's interest to put the appropriate controls in place. So I think that our job would be talking to the auditors, looking at the financial controls ourselves, making sure they're following rules and regulations, but at the end of the day it is also going to be up to management to make sure they put in place appropriate controls in their own organization. I think it's very hard for us to know that.

Q: No, I don't believe that is very hard, I'm sorry, because I contradict you.

MR. KASHKARI: That's OK.

Q: Impose on all banks, all tellers understand, to accept money to be deposited but to not be withdrawal from account except of signature of secretary-treasurer or somebody from board, or two people from board? And then chances to be stolen will be much less, understand? But at this time, for instance, secretary-treasurer can go and take money at least in some organization I see and took them and put them in another account at another bank, and the organization can do nothing.

MR. KASHKARI: Right, but you're speaking I'm not disagreeing with you.

Q: It's a simple formality.

MR. KASHKARI: You're speaking about the core financial controls and the rules within that organization of who's authorized to transfer money?

Q: Yes.

MR. KASHKARI: I understand. And so I'm with you. I'm not disagreeing with you. So I guess I'm in agreement with you.

Q: Yeah, should be one, two person from the board or president, plus secretary-treasurer. Secretary-treasurer should do simply bureaucratic work, not to take decision what to be done with money. It should such decisions should be taken by executive committee, or by president plus somebody from executive committee. Yeah, so I don't know, at this time do you do you implement it in banks' obligations for financial withdrawal, financial payments-- &

MR. KASHKARI: But again, it's going to depend on the bank.

Q: to have two, three signatures from the organizations?

MR. KASHKARI: Large institutions will have a higher threshold than smaller institutions.

Q: (Inaudible.)

MR. KASHARI: And so we do. We do talk to banks and look at what financial controls they have in place and try to assess it. So if you have specific instances where you think that that's not being done appropriately, let's chat afterwards and let's I want to get to the bottom of the risk that you're talking about.

Q: Let me ask you a question about the political scene. I heard Barney Frank on radio the other day quite passionately saying that Dodd-Frank had gone too far in creating handicaps for small community banks and that it ought to be changed. And he was asked, do some of your former colleagues agree with you, and his response was, yes, he said, I think the majority of them do, but nothing really has happened in that regard. Do you have a thought about that?

MR. KASHKARI: Yeah. I think it hasn't happened I agree with him that there is a lot of consensus on that point, but I think it's being wrapped up in the big bank issue, is my read of the political situation; that people who do want to relax on small banks are nervous that it's actually going to be relaxed on the biggest banks, and that's why these two issues have gotten conflated. And that's why in our plan that we've put forward, we've said here's what we're going to do to the biggest banks, and once people have real confidence that the biggest banks are safe and sound, that's going to make it easier to then do what I believe both sides of the aisle want to do and relax regulations on community banks. That's why I think they're personally, I think that's why there hasn't been much movement.

Q: Could you comment on the impact of rising rates on federal deficit and what that's going to do to the challenges that Congress has got in trying to solve the budget problems?

MR. KASHKARI: Sure. I mean, I think you spelled it out right there. As rates go up, there are going to be impacts on not just the private economy but the federal deficit as well. To be candid with you, that's not what factors into our interest-rate decisions. Our interest-rate decisions are based purely on what's happening in the U.S. economy what's happening in terms of inflation and the dual mandate, what's happening in terms of the job market, and what's the optimal interest rate for achieving our dual mandate over time. And you know, we think that other policy makers are paying attention to what we're doing, and hopefully it will factor into their thinking.

And let's talk about fiscal more broadly. Depending on what Congress decides to do in terms of taxes, in terms of health care, in terms of trade, that also factors into our own analysis of what the outlook is for the U.S. economy. So these things are definitely interrelated, but the mandate that we've been given is look at the U.S. economy, look at your dual mandate, set interest rates based on that, not based on making it easier or more difficult for Treasury to fund their spending. That's up to them.

Q: The Minneapolis Fed has been regarded for decades for the research that they produce and somewhat cutting edge, particularly related to public stadium funding and early education done by your predecessors. What lessons do you think could be learned given the Twin Cities region is kind of a hallmark in taking an opposite approach to that public stadium funding? What lessons can we learn in getting your initiative marketed and out in front of people in a different way?

MR. KASHKARI: Repeat what you just said about the hallmark?

Q: Well, between, you know, the stadiums in St. Paul and Minneapolis over the last couple of years, the growing trend around the country of (National Football League) stadiums now saying everybody who's got one everybody who wanted one has one, and public funding was some factor involved in most of those.

MR. KASHKARI: So, I mean, that's not an example of success on our part, right? Well there are lessons, though, nonetheless. We may not have won the so, first of all, you know, this idea of the NFL has a great racket, and they restrict the number of teams so that there's overdemand for teams. And then they get the cities to bid against each other, and they extract those rents for the NFL's benefit. I mean, it's a great racket if you're an NFL owner, but the taxpayers pay and so that's a problem. And the only way to solve that, I think, would require federal legislation to prohibit this because each state is operating in its own what it thinks is its own self-interest and but the NFL owners are the ones who really benefit from it. So we failed in delivering that message.

However, the Minneapolis Fed and some of my predecessors a guy named Art Rolnick, who is our research director and a researcher who is currently at our bank, Rob Greenwald have been working on the issue of early childhood education for years, and it's an important lesson to the gentleman's question about, you know, how likely is this to happen in terms of too big to fail. So what I've taken away from them is they pounded this drum on early childhood education and the research behind it, showing that you know why we got into early childhood education? Because the economists at the bank said public money for stadiums is stupid, and someone said OK, smarty pants, well, what should we be investing in if that's stupid? And they said OK, we'll go think about it, and the highest (return on investment) they could find was public taxpayer dollars investing in early childhood education in terms of payback for the taxpayers. That's how they came on that issue.

So the lesson, though, is, they'd been pounding this drum over and over and over again and eventually people paid attention, and eventually the stuff is actually getting implemented. And so while we may not have been successful in convincing people not to spend public money on stadiums, they've been pretty darn successful in getting people to realize early childhood education is a good investment for the taxpayers. And so the lesson for us, as it relates to too big to fail is, don't give up easily, you know. People say, well, it seems like nothing changes; well, nothing changes until everything changes.

You know, I look at I take a political lesson from the country's views on gay marriage. So in California I came here from California. In 2008, not that long ago, the state of California, which views itself as the most progressive state in the world, the state of California voted to ban gay marriage in 2008. But the activists stayed on it, stayed on it, stayed on it, stayed on it, stayed on it now, basically the laws of the land have changed not very long later, and so it seems like nothing changes until people wake up and then everything changes. So I feel like on the issue of too big to fail, we have an obligation to keep speaking up, and then, people may not agree with us, but if we keep speaking up maybe they will agree with us.

WSJ Pro: SEC Chairman Nominee Was Vetted by Executives Close to Trump

By Dave Michaels

WASHINGTON President Donald Trump's pick to lead the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission met with several prominent business executives close to the president's campaign before he was named to lead the top Wall Street overseer.

Jay Clayton disclosed the meetings with billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel and GOP fundraiser Rebekah Mercer in a letter to Sen. Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, which plans to vote Tuesday on Mr. Clayton's nomination to be SEC chairman. In response to follow-up questions sent after Mr. Clayton's March 23 confirmation hearing, the nominee wrote that he also met with Darren Blanton, a Dallas-based investor and founder of Colt Ventures. The firm's activities include private-equity investing and proprietary trading, according to its website.

"While I have not specifically looked into it, I believe it is fair to presume that one or more of these individuals may be affiliated with one or more public companies or other companies that are regulated by the SEC," Mr. Clayton wrote to Mr. Brown (D., Ohio).

Mr. Clayton, a partner at law firm Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, could be confirmed this month by the full Senate after he clears the banking committee Tuesday. It's unclear how many Democratic votes he will get. Democratic senators including Mr. Brown have questioned his personal and professional ties to firms that are overseen by the SEC. Mr. Clayton has represented many Wall Street banks during his career as a lawyer, while his wife works as a wealth adviser for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. She has said she would step down from the job if her husband were confirmed.

Mr. Thiel, an investor and entrepreneur, has helped recruit people for jobs in the Trump administration and served on the executive committee leading Mr. Trump's transition to the White House.

Ms. Mercer was a member of the committee and oversaw a super PAC that supported Mr. Trump during his campaign against Hillary Clinton. Her father, Robert Mercer, is the co-chief executive officer of Renaissance Technologies LLC, a quantitative hedge fund that is regulated by the SEC.

In the letter, Mr. Clayton wrote that he met with Mr. Trump, White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, White House counselor and chief strategist Steve Bannon, and Martin Silverstein, a corporate lawyer who was ambassador to Uruguay under former President George W. Bush. Mr. Clayton also wrote that he met with activist investor Carl Icahn after his nomination was announced, saying Mr. Icahn sought the meeting after media reports surfaced naming Mr. Clayton as a potential chairman.

Testifying before the banking committee last month, Mr. Clayton called for providing regulatory relief to encourage more initial public offerings. U.S. investors, he said, are among those missing out the most if fast-growing private firms decide not to go public to avoid the regulatory scrutiny that goes along with listing their shares on an exchange.

In his written responses to Mr. Brown's questions, Mr. Clayton further described how he might seek to reduce regulatory requirements. Public firms face a litany of internal controls and compliance requirements intended to bolster the integrity of financial statements "that comparable, well-run private companies may determine are not in the best interest of shareholders," Mr. Clayton wrote. "I believe we should be examining this situation with an eye toward identifying less burdensome means to achieving effective regulation of newly public companies."

Banks Turn to Virtual World to Modernize Physical Commodities Trading

By Stephanie Yang

Banks and traders are experimenting with the technology behind bitcoin in an effort to solve longstanding problems in the trading of physical commodities.

Blockchain, the technology used to record ownership of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, has been making inroads recently in the financial world. Central banks and other institutions are exploring it for payments and data sharing. Major banks including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. have tested the technology in recording financial transactions.

Now commodities players are trying out blockchain to help buy and sell goods and raw materials.

French bank Natixis and the commodity trading firm Trafigura Pte Ltd. unveiled a platform in late March with International Business Machines Corp. to carry out U.S. crude oil transactions electronically using blockchain technology.

A group of participants in the cotton market is also evaluating the use of blockchain in trading and plans to release its results in May. The consortium, which has partnered with IBM to use its blockchain platform, includes major agricultural commodities traders Cargill Inc. and Louis Dreyfus Co.

The technology records each transaction in a ledger, of which every computer has an identical copy. This makes counterfeiting virtually impossible, since every transaction can be checked against the other records, and obviates the need for costly and time-consuming back-office record-keeping by third parties like finance companies.

Firms are turning to blockchain because the exchange of physical goods is plagued by pitfalls that have existed for decades in these notoriously opaque markets.

Trades routinely get bogged down by paper documents that take time to verify and can be lost or forged during ownership changes. This can be costly for consumers and producers, especially when payments or deliveries are delayed or interrupted. It can also cause frustration for those unable to track exactly where their materials come from.

By establishing a decentralized system, traders think they can cut down on time, expenses and opportunities for fraud. Blockchain can create digital codes for, say, each bale of cotton or gold bar, and records all points of sale on an encrypted list that is verified by multiple parties.

"I'm more and more convinced that this technology is going to be disruptive for the industry," said Patrick Arnaud, managing director of trade and commodity finance at ING Groep NV.

ING, Socit Gnrale and commodities trade house Mercuria in February executed the first delivery of crude oil to run entirely on a blockchain platform. The trade tracked the transport of crude oil from Africa to China.

ING found that the use of blockchain, instead of paper certification, reduced its involvement in each transaction to about 25 minutes from an average of three hours. Blockchain also cut costs by about 30%, the bank said.

The banks are in discussions now to conduct a similar trade in liquefied natural gas, according to Mr. Arnaud.

Despite the eagerness of some traders to adopt the technology, blockchain faces a number of hurdles to widespread use in commodities trading.

Regulatory requirements for exchanging goods are different from country to country and may need to change to become compatible for cross-border blockchain trades.

"It's going to brush up against an existing compliance regime as well as regulation or legislation in its own right," said Emma Weston, co-founder of AgriDigital, a commodity management platform that has used blockchain to trade grain.

Another challenge is persuading an industry that has been resistant to change to embrace a new system especially one that has had some miscues. While the underlying protocol for bitcoin has never been hacked, apps and services built on top of it have been plagued with privacy and hacking scandals.

Mallory Alexander International Logistics has run two shipping trials with blockchain this year, but its president remains skeptical about new trading technologies.

Over the past 15 years or more, attempts to modernize data in shipping "always seem to hit a snag," said Neely Mallory. "There are a lot of countries that U.S. agriculture is shipped to that are not ready to embrace it."

Another concern for commodity traders is how much proprietary information would be shared with others if blockchain is used. Those experimenting with the technology say there is still discussion on what data would be limited and for which parties.

"No one would want their information on who's trading what" to be seen on the blockchain, said Mark Pryor, chief executive of commodities trading software provider the Seam, which is leading the cotton consortium.

In metals, the U.K.'s Royal Mint and futures exchange CME Group Inc. plan to launch digital certificates for physical gold this year. The exchange IEX Group Inc. is also experimenting with a gold exchange run on blockchain.

Mr. Pryor said using blockchain could change the mind-set of some hardened commodities traders.

"People are not used to working in an environment where they trust the data, where they trust the systems," he said.

Frankfurt Landlords Welcome Brexit Business

By William Wilkes and Art Patnaude

FRANKFURT The office market in Germany's financial capital is emerging as one of the winners from Brexit less than a year after the U.K.'s historic vote to quit the European Union.

British Prime Minister Theresa May last week began the process by formally notifying the EU of the U.K.'s intention to withdraw. That began a two-year divorce process.

But major financial institutions with offices in London already have begun to plan for difficulties with doing business across the English Channel. For instance, banks in London currently can sell products to clients in mainland Europe. Brexit is likely to change that.

Competition among European cities and countries to lure business from post-Brexit Britain has been heating up, with Paris, Dublin, Milan and even Wroclaw, Poland, making their case heard.

But Frankfurt appears to be in pole position. Around 15 major banks from the U.S., Japan, China and Britain are in talks with German officials about relocating to Frankfurt, according to people familiar with the matter.

Banks could shift up to 900 staff each from London to Frankfurt to ensure they can continue operations when the U.K. quits the EU, as soon as 2019.

Russia's second-largest bank, VTB, in February said it would establish a new headquarters in Frankfurt, which it said will likely gain in importance after Brexit. Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said they could relocate staff to Frankfurt.

What's more, other tenants in Frankfurt's market have been getting more aggressive in leasing space partly with an eye toward incoming competition from across the English Channel. Last year, businesses leased 525,000 square meters (5.6 million square feet) in the city, the most since 2007 and 34% more than in 2015, according to JLL.

Prime office rents at the end of the fourth quarter were  37 per square meter a month, up 4.2% one year earlier, JLL said. Frankfurt has a limited supply of very large offices, so newcomers will likely drive prices higher.

By contrast, the London market has been softening. Office tenants there leased 10.1 million square feet in 2016, down from more than 11.7 million in 2015, according to JLL.

London landlords have been increasing their offers of free rent and other incentives to lure tenants. Some also have begun to cut rents, a trend that would be exacerbated if firms start leaving en masse.

"Risk is heightened," said Alex Jeffrey, chief executive at U.K. firm M&G Real Estate.

But big financial services firms still want a London presence. German lender Deutsche Bank even as it talks about moving jobs home to Frankfurt is also negotiating to lease office space in a new London development from Land Securities PLC, one of the U.K.'s biggest landlords.

London also still has advantages over Frankfurt. While leasing trends are less favorable, London's vacancy rate remains lower: 4.2% compared with 9.1% for Frankfurt, JLL says.

Meanwhile, it is easier to build in Frankfurt than in London partly, because there is more available land and other redevelopment opportunities, analysts say. More Frankfurt projects are moving off the drawing board, raising the likelihood of more competition.

New Frankfurt projects that are under way include Tishman Speyer's Omiturm, a 45-story tower that will include 472,000 square feet of office space and 88,000 square feet of rental space. It is scheduled to be completed by the beginning of 2019.

No office leases have been announced yet, but negotiations are intensifying with several financial services firms, according to Florian Reiff, a Tishman Speyer senior managing director. "You can see now the market is firming up," he said. "The Brexit decision is becoming more concrete," he said.

PGIM Real Estate, a unit of Prudential Financial Inc., also sees Brexit-related demand picking up for its Junghof Plaza project in Frankfurt. A venture led by PGIM acquired the 14-year old office building late last year and is converting it into a mixed use project with office, retail and a hotel.

"Investment banks, especially from the U.S., are in the market" even though they might not move for a few years, said Sebastian Ferrante, PGIM's head of Germany. "Every move by a financial institution with all the logistics that involves is nothing to be done over a six-month period."

Inspector General Says Fed Could Improve Monitoring of Big Banks

By Katy Burne

The Federal Reserve could be more consistent in how it carries out the ongoing monitoring of big banks, the central bank's Office of Inspector General concluded in a report, also pointing to resource constraints facing examiners.

In their report released Monday, auditors at Inspector General's office said they had assessed the effectiveness of the Fed's continuous monitoring for large and complex banks, and suggested a series of improvements to its training practices and record keeping.

The Fed conducts this monitoring from a unit called the Large Institution Supervision Coordinating Committee, or LISCC. The group, composed of officers from both the Fed's board and its individual reserve banks, was formed in 2010 and now is the hub for Fed bank supervisory decision-making.

Ongoing monitoring is less formal than a targeted examination of a bank, and it involves supervision of an institution's day-to-day operations to keep on top of emerging and known risks. During 2015, examiners for big banks spent 44% of their time on routine continuous monitoring and 12% on enhanced continuous monitoring, the report found.

But the Inspector General said its assessment showed the LISCC's structure could be more effective, and noted inconsistencies around how bank examiners document their work and retrieve reports from databases around the Fed system. "Although the Board and the Reserve Banks have multiple documents that address the expectations for certain aspects of continuous monitoring, the Board hasn't issued guidance that harmonizes these expectations across its supervisory portfolios and the Reserve Banks," the OIG wrote in a summary of its report.

Some examiners indicated that their resources felt stretched, according to the OIG.

During interviews, auditors heard from examiners that they don't always have sufficient time to review the information gathered, and that the teams may not have analyzed all the information before it is uploaded.

Other examiners said they were reluctant to cancel document requests and meetings for fear of missing vital information, but the OIG said given the healthier state of banks in the wake of the financial crisis, it makes sense to rationalize these requests.

This could also help teams that complained about not being able to find specific documents and monitoring results across the many information storage facilities and repositories around the Fed.

"Team members indicated that it is difficult to find information that they are looking for," the OIG said in its report.

The OIG suggested more enhanced training and supervisory guidance that would help to "foster more consistent execution" across the Fed system and maximize its effectiveness.

The work was a follow up to the Inspector General's earlier field studies showing how opportunities existed to help encourage Fed bank supervisors to share divergent views about examinations more openly.

In an earlier 2014 evaluation of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's continuous bank monitoring, the Inspector General recommended  the bank lay out more detailed expectations for documenting the work of supervisors, and how those materials could be accessed. Monday's report broadened the scope to include a review of the Cleveland Fed, the New York Fed, the Richmond Fed and the San Francisco Fed, which concluded last November.

A senior officer at the Fed board wrote in a March 21 letter to the Inspector General that he agreed with the recommendations and would follow up.

Michael Gibson, director of supervision and regulation at the Fed Board of Governors, said in the letter he recognized "that there are opportunities to clarify our expectations for continuous monitoring through additional guidance and training" for both the LISCC teams and supervisors of large foreign banks.

Mr. Gibson said the Fed had introduced a new monitoring and analysis program for the LISCC, whose organizers are responsible for ensuring consistency across supervisory monitoring. A steering group is also working on integrating the  program, which Mr. Gibson said should be approved by May 31, including guidance about developing enhanced training.

Digital Clue Links North Korea to Theft at New York Fed, Security Firm Says

By Robert McMillan

A newly discovered digital clue links the hacking group blamed for a multimillion-dollar cyberattack on Bangladesh's central bank to a computer in North Korea, according to the Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab ZAO.

Kaspersky announced Monday at its security conference on the Caribbean island of St. Maarten that its researchers had obtained digital records showing a European server used by the group to launch its attacks exchanged data in January with a computer that had an internet address belonging to North Korea's state-owned internet service provider.

Security experts have long suspected the hacking group, known as Lazarus, was backed by North Korea, but that assessment hinged on a 2014 Federal Bureau of Investigation claim that one Lazarus hack the compromise of Sony Pictures Entertainment in 2014 was conducted by North Korea.

Although The Wall Street Journal reported last month that the FBI is pursuing a criminal case linking North Korea to Lazarus's activity, the agency hasn't provided any public evidence to substantiate the alleged North Korean link.

Multiple calls to the North Korean mission to the United Nations went unanswered.

The newly discovered evidence came from a rare technical error by the Lazarus hackers, according to Kapersky.

The hackers failed to remove computer-log files on a server used by the group, and these digital records show the server briefly connecting to another computer in North Korea, said Vitaly Kamluk, a researcher with Kaspersky.

North Korea has "very little presence on the internet, and the chances that this is just a random connection are extremely small," Mr. Kamluk said. "It does place North Korea into this equation."

As with most developments in the shadowy world of computer intrusions, this latest piece of evidence isn't conclusive. It is technically possible, for example, for someone to hack the North Korean computer and connect it to the Lazarus server to throw off investigators, Mr. Kamluk said.

Although the attacks against Sony and Bangladesh Bank occurred in 2014 and 2016, respectively, the Lazarus group has been active since at least 2009 and recently has targeted banks in Europe and the U.S., Mr. Kamluk said. Lazarus is a name given to a group of the hackers by security researchers. No member of the group has been publicly identified.

Often, as with the Bangladesh central-bank hack, the Lazarus hackers quietly break into computer networks and lurk undetected for months before attacking, the security experts said. The Lazarus group is suspected of stealing $81 million from Bangladesh Bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York last year after initiating fraudulent orders asking for nearly $1 billion.

The use of digital currency may have been one of the reasons that Lazarus's server logs weren't removed, Mr. Kamluk said. The European server containing log files was configured to perform a series of calculations that generated Monero, a digital currency similar to Bitcoin. But this computationally intensive work seems to have overwhelmed the machine, Mr. Kamluk said.

"They overconsumed the resources of the server and the server just crashed," he said.

Bank of America Using FATF Reports to Gauge Risk

By Samuel Rubenfeld

Hollywood, Fla. Bank of America Corp. is using a recent assessment of the money laundering risk in the U.S. economy to help determine risk among its customers, according to a bank official.

William Fox, global head of financial crimes compliance at Bank of America, said during a panel discussion at an anti-money laundering conference that he had briefed senior management about the latest evaluation of the U.S. from the Financial Action Task Force, an international standards-setting body.

"If you haven't briefed senior management [about the report], you should think about it," he told the audience at the conference being hosted by the Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists in Hollywood, Fla.

Mr. Fox, who previously was director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network at the U.S. Treasury Department the leading U.S. agency fighting money laundering said his bank is reviewing its client base to assess whether its non-financial and other high-risk customers pose any money-laundering concern.

"We are looking at that to determine whether we need to pay attention to those sectors and clients. The risk is there," he said.

The latest FATF evaluation of the U.S. was positive overall, but it identified  serious gaps" in U.S. oversight of beneficial owners, as well as of non-financial organizations such as non-profits, lawyers or accountants.

Rick McDonell, executive director of ACAMS and the former executive secretary of the FATF, said that despite the shortcomings, the U.S. is viewed as a leader in the anti-money laundering area, and other countries learn from its example.

"When the U.S. does well &that is a plus, and a positive incentive for others," he said.

Sarah Runge, director of the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Strategic Policy focusing on terrorist financing and financial crimes, said the U.S. government welcomed the report, noting that the U.S. received the highest marks in four categories studied by the FATF.

"This report is a reflection of the success of what we put together" on anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, she said. SInce that time, she said, the U.S. Treasury made the financial sector "a key partner" in the national-security framework.

"We were not surprised about the findings," she said.

Cash Cow Credit Cards May Get Hit by U.K. Bank Regulators

By Paul J. Davies

British regulators may take a chunk out of the credit card industry's revenues, just as the debt cycle looks ripe for a rise in defaults.

For Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group which has just acquired a big U.K. credit card book from Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch this will likely prove painful.

The proposed changes came about because the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority, whose role includes safeguarding consumers' interests, is concerned about the high level of debt held on credit cards for 18 months or longer.

More than three million people in the U.K. have card debt that costs them more each month in interest and charges than they repay. Each customer pays around 2.50 ($3.14) for 1 of debt repaid, the FCA says.

The FCA wants banks to intervene earlier, encourage people to pay down this debt quickly, or stop charging them interest and come up with a repayment plan. The body says that in the first few years, this could save consumers between 310 million and 1.3 billion.

That would be a hit to the industry's revenues. Card balances in 2016 averaged 62 billion, of which 57% was interest bearing, according to data from the British Bankers' Association. At an annual interest rate of 20%, in line with that of many credit cards, that would put annual industry interest income at about 7 billion a little more than five times the top-end of estimated consumer savings.

Credit card income is significant for U.K. banks. Cards bring in nearly 30% of Barclays's U.K. revenues and nearly 10% of group revenues. At RBS, card income represents about 5% of group revenues. Lloyds doesn't report card income separately.

Consumers have relied more heavily on cards to fund spending following 2016's Brexit vote, which has kept the economy humming. However, fast growth in consumer lending has led the Bank of England to review credit standards and to focus on consumer risks in 2017's banking stress test. Add in the FCA's measures and banks look likely to curtail consumer lending, which could be a drag on the economy.

Credit card profits have been helped in recent years by very low default rates, but rising inflation is now expected to put pressure on real incomes in the U.K., while interest rates are likely to start rising.

Losing these revenues as the credit cycle turns will likely give the card industry a bloody nose.

Wells Fargo Ordered to Reinstate Whistleblower

The Department of Labor's OSHA division has ordered Wells Fargo (WFC) to reinstate a former bank manager who lost his job after reporting "suspected fraudulent behavior to superiors and a bank ethics hotline," according to DOL. The manager had received positive performance reviews but was terminated after reporting separate incidents of suspected fraud. He was initially told he had 90 days to find a new position at WFC and when unsuccessful, he was fired. OSHA concluded that whistleblowing contributed to his ouster and ordered WFC to compensate him about $5.4M including damages and lawyers fees. A WFC spokesman says said the bank disagrees with the findings, adding: "To date there has been no hearing on the merits in this case, and we will be requesting a full hearing of the matter."

Credit Suisse Stocks Extend Losses

Credit Suisse shares extend losses after the bank's disclosure Friday that it had been contacted by Dutch, French and UK authorities over client tax issues. This prompted fears of more legal headaches for the Swiss lender. Shares fell about 1.2% Friday and were down another 1.7% to 14.65 Swiss francs at 0841 GMT Monday. (brian.blackstone@wsj.com)

Finnish Covered Bonds to Get Regulatory Boost

The Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority's decision to set the minimum risk weight on residential mortgages at 15% is positive for banks' credit and their covered bonds, Moody's says. Finnish lenders will now need to increase the capital they hold against mortgages. This will come in handy if and when losses start kicking in. Finnish household debt has risen to 125% of disposable income, the Bank of Finland said earlier this year. Covered bonds are debt backed by collateral, typically mortgages.

Postcrisis Bank Closures Hit Urban Areas the Hardest

Bank-branch closures since the financial crisis have disproportionately affected Americans who live in urban areas, as well as low-income households and minorities, "http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/NCRCResearch04-03-2017.pdf"by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a consumer-protection group. The NCRC found that 6,008 branches, or 6% of the total, were closed between 2008 and 2016. Of the closures, 82% were in urban areas and the remainder in rural areas. Several metro areas lost 15% to 25% of their branches, with the most acute losses in Baltimore, Chicago, Philadelphia, Las Vegas and Detroit. The NCRC also found service gaps in rural areas, resulting in "banking deserts," defined as areas where there are no banks within 10 miles of populated areas. These deserts disproportionately affected minorities, according to the paper.

Could Bank Mergers Return Soon?

Since the financial crisis, no bank has "dared challenge regulators" that discouraged financial firms from getting bigger through merger deals but that could start to change under the Trump administration, "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/31/business/dealbook/why-the-urge-to-merge-could-return-to-wall-street.html?ref=dealbook&_r=0". At the outset of the crisis, the Federal Reserve put the banking industry "on a path toward being an oligopoly," as it encouraged healthy banks to buy failing ones. But "then the Fed shut off the spigot," he writes. A loosening of Fed restrictions on mergers could lead to a wave of commercial bank mergers, though Mr. Cohan believes that won't happen in the immediate future. Still, "one thing we know for sure is that the times are changing in Washington, and fast," he writes.

Britain's Proposed Debt Relief Rules Destined for Failure

"The FCA wants card issuers to prod such debtors to repay faster, or ultimately give them a break on their repayments," the board writes. But that would be akin to treating a hangover "before the patient has stopped drinking," they write, and such rules are not likely to solve Britain's personal and credit-card debt issues.

Populists, Globalists Clash on Financial Integration

Resurgent nationalism in the U.S. and Europe could have lasting consequences for global financial regulatory standards, and some argue the changes could hurt economic growth and financial stability.

The twin geopolitical earthquakes of Brexit and the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president pose acute challenges to regulatory bodies such as the European Commission or the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and their ability to impose or recommend (with any significant amount of moral suasion) uniform standards for the global financial system.

With Brexit in particular, the financial integration of the European Union is at stake, given the likely loss of "passporting" privileges for British banks, which have long constituted the hub of financial services in Europe. Passporting allows London-based lenders and insurers to operate anywhere in the EU. Large multinational banks with operations in London are "https://www.wsj.com/articles/j-p-morgan-scours-europe-for-best-post-brexit-home-1490779804"for new homes within EU member countries.

"You've just turned your back on 40 years of financial integration," said Institute of International Finance President Tim Adams in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, referring to Brexit. A subsequent "tit-for-tat effort to wall off capital" would introduce major inefficiencies into global capital markets and encourage financial institutions to seek favors from national regulators, rather than operating under a set of uniform international standards, he said.

Mr. Adams highlighted the impact that devolution in financial integration could have on economic activity, using the example of an international supply chain. In an integrated system, a single bank could handle the financing for all the transactions involved in a particular deal, regardless of where they occurred. But in a less-integrated system, different banks might have to finance individual parts of the deal creating inefficiencies and higher costs for the parties involved as well as consumers.

Brexit, which has been championed by Mr. Trump as an example of nationalist interests winning out over unaccountable globalists, has also emboldened Republican skeptics of international regulatory bodies.

Shortly after Mr. Trump's inauguration, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R., N.C.), the vice chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, sent a letter to Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen calling negotiations with international standards setters like the Basel Committee "unacceptable."

In a committee hearing shortly after that, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gop-lawmakers-tell-yellen-to-pause-new-fed-rules-1487201336"on suggestions the Fed should stop engaging in conversations with international regulators and noted that rules are only binding if U.S. regulators choose to implement them.

Nonetheless, some international regulators recognize the need to be more transparent and accountable if they are to maintain the trust of national policy makers, particularly those skeptical of their mission.

"https://www.bis.org/speeches/sp170228.pdf"about financial integration in Geneva in February, Bank for International Settlements General Manager Jaime Caruana argued for making the "positive case for financial globalization," which he said has been responsible for boosting living standards.

Financial globalization hasn't yet reached its peak potential, Mr. Caruana said, cautioning that potential "can be realized only if there is far-reaching cooperation in its management."

Both the U.K. and the Trump administration seem to be moving away from the model of international cooperation on regulatory standards and financial integration. It remains to be seen whether the "globalists'" can regain their footing in the debate and restore the influence of international financial organizations.

Jay Clayton disclosed the meetings with billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel and GOP fundraiser Rebekah Mercer in a letter to Sen. Sherrod Brown, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, which plans to vote Tuesday on Mr. Clayton's nomination to be SEC chairman. In response to follow-up questions sent after Mr. Clayton's March 23 confirmation hearing, the nominee wrote that he also met with Darren Blanton, a Dallas-based investor and founder of Colt Ventures.

Blockchain, the technology used to record ownership of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, has been making inroads recently in the financial world. Central banks and other institutions are exploring it for payments and data sharing. Major banks including J.P.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/frankfurt-landlords-welcome-brexit-business-1491298202" is emerging as one of the winners from Brexit less than a year after the U.K.'s historic vote to quit the European Union.

Competition among European cities and countries to lure business from post-Brexit Britain has been heating up, with Paris, Dublin, Milan and even Wroclaw, Poland, making their case heard. But Frankfurt appears to be in pole position. Around 15 major banks from the U.S., Japan, China and Britain are in talks with German officials about relocating to Frankfurt, according to people familiar with the matter.

William Fox, global head of financial crimes compliance at Bank of America, said during a panel discussion at an anti-money-laundering conference that he had briefed senior management about the latest evaluation of the U.S. from the Financial Action Task Force, an international standards-setting body.

For Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group which has just acquired a big U.K. credit card book from Bank of America Merrill Lynch this will likely prove painful. The proposed changes came about because the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority, whose role includes safeguarding consumers' interests, is concerned about the high level of debt held on credit cards for 18 months or longer.

Fear of Automation's Dark Side Leads to Calls for Action; Some investors back policy or private-industry moves to head off a dystopian future

By Tomio Geron

Matt Ocko is a venture capitalist placing big bets on the latest in artificial intelligence and big data.

But he also expects that leaps forward in related automation technology will put many people out of work, and he's one of several Silicon Valley investors who think it's unfair to expect society to adapt without offering help to people who are at risk from rapid change.

"You can't simply command a welder who just lost his job and has a family of four to become an AI TensorFlow expert," said Mr. Ocko, managing partner at Data Collective. "If you lose your job, you don't have the capital to invest in retraining. You can't send yourself to MIT while your kids are starving."

Mr. Ocko of Data Collective says that people thrown out of work by automation could receive a tax credit to allow them to own robots or other types of devices that displaced them.

Several venture investors support public-policy initiatives or moves by private industry to head off the threat of a dystopian future in which human labor is devalued or made superfluous.

Some say the technology industry itself must take on the issue.

Among the ideas circulating are giving displaced workers tax credits to own robots or other technology that replaces them. Others have proposed new kinds of insurance or expanding the social safety net, along with expanding job-skills training for a world staffed by robots.

Doing nothing could be an ugly scenario, according to some forecasts. A PricewaterhouseCoopers report predicted that automation will place 38% of the U.S. labor force at high risk in the next 15 years. U.S. venture capitalists more than doubled investment dollars poured into artificial intelligence to $1.72 billion last year, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

But many automation-focused founders and investors haven't acknowledged the societal risks, let alone the need for a policy response to address the issue.

Not surprisingly, some of the most active venture backers of automation and AI tend to be more optimistic about the technology's effects on society.

Vishal Harpalani, founder of a new firm called Automation VC, says his companies make lives better by making services drastically cheaper. He has backed startups automating dermatology, security, property management and medical diagnostics.

The firm's tagline? "Investing in companies that automate human labor."

One of the startups, YoDerm Inc., makes online dermatology more affordable.

"You're talking an almost 10x decrease in price for services like that," Mr. Harpalani said. "That's happening in every single service: legal, financial, security. Prices are going to drop so substantially that people who couldn't see a dermatologist will have one that's software-enabled."

Mr. Harpalani gives voice to an outlook that many VCs share but don't often openly trumpet in Silicon Valley: automation, whatever its costs, makes good business sense.

"Efficiencies in the system get passed on to consumers," said Daniel Gross, who heads Y Combinator's AI team. "At the end of the day I'd rather have a future with free housing or free basics for everyone in the world instead of hanging onto a few (traditional) jobs."

Emergence Capital's Gordon Ritter says automation and AI help workers to do their jobs better. He cites his portfolio company Chorus, which improves the efficiency of salespeople.

But many future-minded investors have called for expanding the social safety net. A popular idea is universal basic income, which would give all citizens a cash stipend. Among other things, UBI is sometimes cast as a last resort or safety net if automation eliminates a vast number of human jobs.

Research into UBI has gained support from venture capitalists such as Roy Bahat of Bloomberg Beta, Hemant Taneja of General Catalyst and Albert Wenger of Union Square Ventures. Y Combinator has also funded a research project on the idea.

Mr. Ocko believes UBI may not give people enough meaning in their lives and could lead to "something that looks like Clockwork Orange."

Others in tech such as Bill Gates have weighed in, saying that companies using automation or robots should be "https://qz.com/911968/bill-gates-the-robot-that-takes-your-job-should-pay-taxes/".

But just retraining people with digital skills and using UBI as a backup isn't enough, says Tim Hwang, an automation expert and a partner at legal technology firm Robot Robot & Hwang LLP. Mr. Hwang suggests automation insurance that would pay those who are automated out of a job. Private industry could contribute, avoiding the need for a large government program like basic income, he says.

His other ideas: community college curricula should adjust every 6 to 12 months based on economic changes; government programs focus on new growth jobs categories; and tax credits to foster growth in industries that are harder to automate.

There have been few proposals by politicians to address automation. Rep. Doris Matsui has proposed funding to retrain displaced automated workers into science and technology jobs and to forgive up to $100,000 in student loans for recent grads to train those displaced workers.

Meanwhile, looking into the distant future isn't the only way to address this issue.

"My big message is: if you care, look at the present," said Mr. Bahat, whose firm, like many others, has invested in artificial intelligence startups. "There are plenty of forms of work society needs: elder care, teachers. You don't need to look to the future. Just solve that now."

For Mike Abbott, the enterprise Internet of Things is here and data is at the core. His firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers has bets on companies bringing connected devices to businesses from Relayr, a startup making sensors to monitor industrial equipment, to drone services provider Airware, to his most recently announced deal, Ripcord, a startup making robots that digitize paper records.

WSJ: Why is Kleiner Perkins getting deeper into the enterprise Internet-of-Things right now?

I look at it in the following way: it ultimately is around data. Airware is looking at imagery data. In the case of Ripcord, we're talking about analog and digital, including how to take unstructured and make it more like semi-structured kind of information. It's because most companies are realizing that they're either a data company and they need the structure and platform to offer insights from the data they're collecting, or they see that in the future they need to augment that part of the business. Look at the prediction that we're hitting over 40 zettabytes (of data) by 2020. If the insights or the ROI of that data is not delivering, then the value of that data to the enterprise is near zero.

That's a particular interest of mine: what are the areas that we should be leveraging within deep learning, within these advances in these neural nets to solve real problems within the enterprise that either can save the company money or provide some advantage for them within their business?

These advances in computer vision have been key to some of the latest applications, and I think will be key to some of the things that are on the horizon. With some of the advances in natural language processing, how can we do a more efficient job with customer support than maybe certain companies today are doing today that are just human-driven?

You've been credited with solving what some have called "Twitter's greatest problem." As a former vice president of engineering at the company, you slew the once-frequent "fail whale." What is Twitter's greatest problem right now, and how would you solve it?

I've been out of the company for quite some time, so it's hard to say exactly what's going on internally. What it feels like from the outside to me is there's not the conviction to make big, bold product decisions. And I think what concerns me to a degree as someone who led the team that designed and built WebOS at Palm, I know that public markets are not always that patient with product changes. I think those two things make an inherent challenge for the business. Having Jack (Dorsey) as the CEO is the right thing in that there's a founder at the helm who has that ability to make really radical product decisions. I'm hopeful that those are still to come. Time will tell.

Subprime lending: elevator pitch

Peer-to-peer lending is so last year. Old-fashioned banking is the new frontier. At least, that is what subprime lender Elevate is pitching as the Texan companypreparesfor a second attempt at a flotation that makes more sense as an exit than an entrance.

Like outfits such as Lending Club, Elevate relies heavily on technology for credit analytics and to keep costs down. But, in contrast to its sales pitch two years ago, it stresses that it is not a peer-to-peer lender. Instead, Elevate retains loans on its own balance sheet rather than selling them to third parties.

Elevate s lending is largely unsecured. The need for its product is not surprising; a recent "https://www.federalreserve.gov/2015-report-economic-well-being-us-households-201605.pdf" by the Federal Reserve estimated that almost half of all US adults did not have enough savings to cover a $400 emergency expense. The same proportion said they were looking to take on more debt. The climate is supportive for alternative financiers, too. Risk-averse banks have stepped back from lending to less creditworthy borrowers, while financial stocks have risen sharply amid expectations of higher interest rates and abonfire of regulations.

The company increased its revenue by a third to $580m in 2016. The effective annual interest rate it charges on its loan portfolio is 146 per cent. Despite high rates, the company has been losing money   for obvious reasons. In each of the past two years, it had to provision over half of its revenues for loan losses.

It also has expensive debt, and wants to use the cash injection from the initial public offering to retire some of it. Such savings might have moved profits to the black had the Brexit vote not also caused foreign exchange losses on the UK operations.

The company warns it may not be able to  achieve consistent profitability  in the future. Limiting the amount of debt funding is prudent, although   for growth   its clients must not do the same. The IPO provides two venture funds that own half the shares with a route towards an exit. Smart investors will leave others to help them along it.
