Will Tech Leave Detroit in the Dust? As IPO proposals value Uber at an eye-popping $120 billion, auto makers are racing to gain ground in everything from car sharing to driverless technology. At stake: who will control the future of transportation

General Motors plans to roll out a robo-taxi service next year that will let urbanites hail a driverless Chevrolet Bolt. Ford is overhauling a dilapidated Detroit train station to become a tech hub aimed at attracting software superstars. Daimler wants to merge one of its divisions with archrival BMW to create a juggernaut for services like ride hailing and car sharing.

And Toyota says it's evolving into an entirely different company, one that focuses more on services that move people around. "It's a matter of surviving or dying," says Chief Executive Akio Toyoda .

The global auto industry thinks it sees the future, and it will require a transformation without precedent in business history: The giant industrial sector has to turn itself into a nimble provider of software and services.

This week brought yet another signal of the forces it's up against: Uber Technologies Inc ., which has chalked up about $4.8 billion in operating losses over the last six quarters, is laying plans for an initial public offering that bankers think could value it at $120 billion. That's more than General Motors Co ., Ford Motor Co . and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV combined.

Auto executives say they need to avoid a nightmare tech scenario that's become a common refrain at industry gatherings. They don't want to become the next "handset makers" commodity suppliers of hardware, helplessly watching all the profits flow to software makers like Apple Inc . and Alphabet Inc ., the parent of Google . Both companies are investing in software for driverless cars.

"We are transforming our hardware-based company into a business that piece by piece will press further into the service economy," said Jrgen Stackmann , a Volkswagen AG board member in charge of sales, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal this week.

Industries from Hollywood to publishing to retail are similarly trying to transform themselves into tech businesses as they confront disruptions from Silicon Valley.

In the auto industry, executives must confront entrenched corporate cultures and limited budgets in a business that is low margin and highly vulnerable to downturns in the economy. They must sustain profits in the traditional, capital-draining business of cranking out millions of cars each year, as they simultaneously try to invest in costly future technologies financial constraints not faced by tech rivals.

Even with financial backing, car companies will still need to change mindsets internally and get different parts of the company working collaboratively to support the new ventures, said Doug Betts , a veteran auto industry executive who also spent nearly two years working at Apple Inc .

"Typically, car companies are not very good at that," said Mr. Betts, now a senior vice president of global automotive operations at J.D. Power. "There are these really strong and huge silos that over 100 years have gotten good at what they do and also good at throwing rocks at everybody else."

Software expertise is also a weakness, Mr. Betts said, because auto makers have long depended on their suppliers to write code rather than building that talent internally.

Auto makers point out that they have one advantage that newcomers to the industry don't: vehicles.

"Ultimately, you can have the best services platform there is, but if you don't have the vehicles to operate on it, that won't do you much good," said Sam Abuelsamid, a senior analyst with Navigant research. "That's where the manufacturers have an ace in the hole."

Many analysts believe businesses like Uber and Alphabet's self-driving tech subsidiary Waymo LLC won't have the appetite to get into the low-margin, capital-intensive business of car manufacturing.

Some auto executives say they can hold on to their roles as hardware providers while also tapping into the growth of more-profitable services. Mr. Stackmann said VW can earn millions more customers than it currently has by offering transportation as a service through a network of connected cars.

"They talk about scalability, but where is the added value from Uber?" he said. "We have a technical foundation and will build connectivity into our vehicles to connect them and our customers to our ecosystem. In the long term, the question will be: Why do you need Uber?"

Uber's $120 billion valuation isn't guaranteed. It was among proposals recently submitted to the company by investment banks looking to represent the ride-hailing firm in an initial public offering that could take place early next year, according to people familiar with the matter. The valuation takes into account a range of factors, including Uber's food delivery business and ownership stakes in Didi in China and Grab in Singapore.

The figure stands in stark contrast to the downbeat outlook in Detroit, where shares of Ford and GM are stuck at multi-year lows, even though the two car makers have rung up more than $50 billion in operating profit since the start of 2016.

Tasha Keeney, an analyst with ARK Invest, which owns shares in GM, Alphabet and Tesla Inc ., said $120 billion "seems very overpriced." Though she sees strong consumer interest in ride hailing, she said the challenges Uber has confronted in its autonomous-car program could hinder its growth longer-term, especially as rivals advance the technology faster, building robo-taxi fleets that compete with its business.

Auto industry executives have long seen tech-industry threats coming. The valuation of Elon Musk 's Tesla has soared in recent years, pulling even with GM's, as it has shown it can create a fiercely loyal customer base for electric cars. Google began working on autonomous-vehicle technology in 2009 and its self-driving car unit Waymo is today considered a leader in the technology.

Meanwhile, more people are moving to large, congested cities, and technology is giving them more options for getting around without owning a car.

While demand for new cars and trucks remains robust and selling them will remain a core part of the industry's business in the years to come, many executives believe the long-term profit growth is limited as new forms of transportation proliferate and more car owners ditch their vehicles for shared ones, hurting sales.

Car companies are trying to diversify into new business models that, much like Uber, sell transportation as a service. Revenue is generated by usage as opposed to a one-time vehicle sale, and because the service isn't as capital-intensive as building and selling cars, executives believe it can ultimately command higher margins.

They envision networks of automated vehicles, which riders could hail via smartphones, similar to the way Uber and Lyft Inc . operate now but without drivers. By 2030, such fleets could account for one-quarter of miles driven in the U.S., Boston Consulting Group estimates. Intel Corp ., the chip-maker whose processors are being used in some autonomous vehicles, foresees this new, so-called passenger economy when today's drivers become passengers in driverless cars, shuttles and other vehicles generating as much as $800 billion by 2035 and $7 trillion by 2050.

To make the shift, many car makers are restructuring their businesses, aiming to free up capital to make the new investments. Some auto companies, like GM, Ford and Toyota Motor Corp , are investing in new tech startups, purchasing artificial-intelligence and robotics firms, and hiring thousands of workers in tech hubs in California and Tel Aviv, Israel. Several car companies have acquired or invested in makers of lidar, laser-based sensors that help driverless cars navigate. The auto makers are tapping the tech world for software-engineering talent, a skill traditionally in short supply in the car business.

GM Cruise, the car maker's autonomous-car unit, has grown from a 40-employee startup acquisition in early 2016 to more than 900 people in San Francisco. In May, the company established GM Cruise as a standalone entity to attract outside investment. The move cleared the way for a $2.25 billion infusion from Japan's SoftBank Group Corp .'s tech-focused Vision Fund, which should provide the working capital it needs to launch the driverless taxi service it hopes to debut in some U.S. cities next year. Executives at GM believe such a network could in the long-term generate profit margins of up to 30%, versus the nearly 9% margin it posted globally last year.

Many companies are also striking alliances with each other and their would-be tech rivals to spread the risk and costs of developing these new ventures.

Honda Motor Co . this month pledged to invest $2.75 billion in GM Cruise and help develop the technology. Rival German car makers BMW AG and Mercedes-Benz parent Daimler AG have proposed a joint venture to combine the companies' car-sharing and ride-hailing services.

"Obviously, every company would like to do everything by themselves...except that we can't," said Carlos Ghosn , chief of the three-way Renault-Nissan -Mitsubishi alliance, during an event this month.

Daimler AG plans to create a separate business unit called Daimler Mobility AG next year focused on on-demand transportation. An Uber-like ride-hailing service Daimler started a decade ago, Mytaxi, has grown popular in Europe. The mobility unit could eventually become a candidate for an IPO as the car company seeks to tap the huge market valuation enjoyed by Uber, analysts say.

"As pioneers in automotive engineering, we will not leave the task of shaping future urban mobility to others," Daimler Chief Executive Dieter Zetsche said last spring.

Toyota is slimming down its core business units to free up cash for investments. The Japanese car maker is also investing in Uber, pledging to integrate its autonomous driving technology into Uber's own self-driving prototype.

Over the last year, GM has taken journalists and investors through a factory in suburban Detroit, where workers plan to build self-driving Chevrolet Bolt electric cars that have no steering wheels or brake pedals. The message: It has the manufacturing might to crank out thousands of robot cars, while tech rivals like Alphabet's Waymo unit must equip their autonomous systems onto vehicles they purchase from traditional car companies. Waymo has said it will start an autonomous car service sometime this year.

"We are the only company that has all of the necessary assets under one roof," GM Chief Executive Mary Barra told analysts earlier this year.

The family offices using venture capital to involve younger members

 Younger family members 	. 	. 	. 	get excited by the opportunities 	. 	. 	. 	focused on AI or blockchain 

Family dynasties can be reluctant to give the young control of the purse strings.

In 1481, Prince Richard, despite being made fifth Duke of Norfolk, was not allowed to inherit the accompanying estate straightaway on the grounds of immaturity. But, then, he was only eight years old, and soon to be locked in the Tower of London with his brother, so he probably did not need too much pocket money. A decade or so later, Lorenzo de  Medici, at 43, was still deemed too young to become the titular prince of Florence. Renaissance mortality rates caught up with him before he could make full use of grandfather Cosimo s wealth. Even Alexandre de Rothschild, scion of the 18th century banking family, was reported to be too young at age 29 to take over from his father. And that was in 2010.

But there are signs that this is changing. Family offices that manage money for multiple generations say that involving the young can have advantages   particularly in one area: private equity and venture capital investing.

Chris Ivey, head of the European private client practice at Cambridge Associates, advises wealthy families and foundations   and finds all age groups have a role to play.  We take family clients to see the best private equity managers and venture capitalists in Silicon Valley   Palo Alto and Menlo Park. One time, I thought:  Oh wow, I ve got someone in their twenties coming along!  What I found is that when talking to younger family members, the VCs strike up a rapport really quickly. There is an affinity and mutual understanding of technology and the latest trends. 

He suggests it is a generational thing.  VCs are getting younger, so they find younger family members have a lot in common [with them] and are more often on their wavelength. 

That can help the family office and its advisers, too. With the best venture capital funds able to pick and choose their investors, they are likely to enjoy working with younger people who might stay with them for longer.  Partners at VC firms, who are often in their 30s, find it easy to relate to the newer generation   and of course recognise a potential source of investment for many fund cycles to come,  Ivey says.

Adam Wethered, co-founder of Owl Private Office, suggests the longer timescales and multiple stages of private equity and venture capital investment are well-suited to younger family members.  Private equity needs to be understood for its inherent nature,  he argues.  It is a long-term, illiquid financial commitment, usually requiring investment of more money at a later stage to grow, or save, the enterprise. 

Another adviser who runs money for wealthy families suggests the outcomes are good for the young as well:  The uplift to returns to locking money up for a long time is one area where it is simpatico. 

Often, though, it is the nature of the investment, not just the numbers, that enthuses the 20- or 30-year-olds.  Older family members are often comfortable in their own sector,  explains Vikash Gupta, founder of multifamily office VAR Capital.  Younger family members or the next generation are more open to partnering up with professional PE and VC houses so they can get exposure to interesting companies 	. 	. 	. 	[they] get excited by the opportunities in VC sector that are focused on the latest technology companies, such as AI or blockchain. 

These technologies are closer to their experience and day-to-day lives, points out Wethered.  The young are certainly more likely to have a cryptocurrency wallet than the older investor   millennials are also more likely to have a fintech account such as Revolut. 

That can make tech  incubators , such as Telefonica s start-up accelerator Wayra, which seeds, launches and guides young entrepreneurs, a focus for families  younger generations.

Environmental and societal concerns are growing areas of interest, as well. Eirian Jones, head of investments at Wren Investment Office, is seeing a growing enthusiasm for impact investing.  Younger family members are expressing a desire for their capital to have a positive impact on the environment and society,  he says.  So we work with them to understand the extent to which they want to blend financial return expectations with environmental and societal outcomes.

Still, this does not mean sixtysomethings are having any less say in families  private equity decisions. One adviser to two wealthy families says, pointedly:  Influence of the younger generation? I have not actually seen that. High net worth individuals, generally, get on with private equity because they have the ability to get their heads round businesses. 

He points out that the heads of wealthy families are often people who made money from a business and so they find private equity investment in specific, individual ventures more understandable than a merger arbitrage hedge fund, for example.  There is increasing sector specialisation in private equity,  he observes,  because if a guy made money in retail, he will say:  Find me a fast-growing retail business I understand . And private equity guys can find them in Asia. 

Ivey agrees that family members can more easily relate to businesses backed by private equity than to retail investment products.  For some, private investments are also more tangible   in meetings they hear about real companies, rather than funds and benchmarks. 

For those nearer the sixtysomething end of the scale, it helps to maintain a connection to business.  When they sell their family company, they like investing in private equity, as they believe private equity is connected to the real economy and their own experiences,  says Maite Lacasa, partner at MdF Family Partners.  Private equity is something they understand and something they think they can replicate with the same success they had in their previous venture. 

They can replicate higher returns, too, as family offices  ability to lock up money in private equity over long periods delivers an illiquidity premium. A paper from UBS Asset Management last year on The Value of Illiquidity cited a study of nearly 1,400 private equity funds over a 24-year period: their median return net of fees outperformed their public equity market counterpart   the S&P 500 index   by more than 3 per cent per year.

Mads Ryum Larsen, partner and head of investor relations at IK Investment Partners, suggests this is ultimately the appeal, no matter how old or young you are:  Family offices have been consistently increasing their allocation to private equity and other illiquid asset classes, as they have found that the return premium that they re achieving within those asset classes outstrips any negative consequences from lack of short-term liquidity. 

Put this premium together with the risk appetite of youth and it is little wonder the age of Ivey s Californian travel companions is coming down   if not yet to 15th-century levels.

Why interest is growing in healthcare and life sciences

Chris Ivey, pictured, of Cambridge Associates says that with mainstream private equity strategies attracting high valuations, his family clients have a bias towards smaller, more focused private equity funds and earlier stage venture capital.  Healthcare and life sciences is a particularly exciting area as we are early in seeing the benefits of technological advances on drug discovery and patient treatment and care,  he explains.

Venture capitalists specialising in healthcare point to the coming together of a number of trends: people living longer, a drive to cut costs in healthcare delivery, the role of technology and artificial intelligence in diagnostics and drug discovery and growing demand from Asia.

Venture capital investors are also seeking to benefit from another sector trend: big pharma companies spending less on their own research and development for new drugs.

 It s a space taken by VC and life sciences managers,  notes Ivey.  They get wind of teams in big pharma companies not getting backing internally so they will finance a spin out [create a separate entity].  Roivant Sciences and BridgeBio Pharma are two specialist companies that have financed spin-offs in recent years.

Real estate loans by small banks stir fears

Shares plunge in Arkansas lender that has backed developments as far away as New York

Fears that smaller US banks are taking excessive risks in commercial real estate deepened on Friday as shares plunged in an Arkansas lender that has ploughed billions of dollars into developments in states as far away as New York.

Bank OZK   which this year changed its name from Bank of the Ozarks   revealed that it was taking a $45m writedown on two commercial real estate (CRE) loans, sending its shares down by more than a quarter in afternoon trading.

Bank OZK has $22bn in assets, half of which are CRE and multi-family real estate loans, making it a leading example of a nationwide trend: As big banks have pulled back from CRE and regulators have warned about high valuations, small banks have turned to the asset class as opportunities to expand in other areas have declined.

 It is a risk you have too many of your eggs in one basket,  Paul Fiorilla, an analyst at Yardi Matrix research, said while discussing CRE lending in general.  You do hear talk in the market that some banks have become really aggressive on some deals. 

Bank OZK has quadrupled its assets since 2013. Most of its real estate loans are in the southern US, but a significant portion   nearly $3bn   are in New York. It took the writedowns on loans secured by a mall property in South Carolina and a residential development in North Carolina.

The mall has a Sears store as an anchor tenant. Sears declared bankruptcy earlier this week. Another anchor tenant, JC Penney, has also struggled in recent years. The residential credit was secured by a development where high-end units had not been selling as well as expected.

Bank OZK emphasised that the two loans were made in 2007 and 2008, meaning they were older than nearly all the rest of its loans, which were largely originated since 2015. The properties also had loan-to-value ratios of 80 per cent, while the great majority of OZK s portfolio has LTVs between 50 and 60 per cent, it said.

Banks with under $100bn in assets have significantly increased their CRE exposure in recent years. As of the second quarter of this year, commercial real estate and construction loans accounted for 20 per cent of the assets at these banks; five years ago, it was 15 per cent. That amounts to $280bn in new CRE loans added to small-bank balance sheets across the US.

Commercial property prices are at an all-time high, according to the Real Capital Analytics national CRE index, which hit 133 in August. Its pre-crisis peak was 106.

Small banks that want to grow their balance sheets may not have many choices beyond CRE.

 Over the last 20 years or so, the avenues for loan growth for small banks have shrunk,  said David Ellison, a portfolio manager specialising in financials at Hennessey funds.  Student loans are taken by the government. Reits (real estate investment trusts) gobble up a lot of the big, high quality real estate opportunities. Fannie and Freddie get more of the mortgages, and the accounting rules have made them harder for small banks to hold. Higher yielding stuff is effectively taken away by the capital rules. 

Big banks, by contrast, have grown cautious about the category. At banks with over $100bn in assets, CRE takes up a slightly smaller portion of balance sheets than it did five years ago.

JPMorgan Chase s chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said last week the bank was being  very selective  about CRE as competition for loans was hot. John Shrewsberry, Wells Fargo s chief financial officer, described in the company s earnings call how competition from non-bank lenders had diminished banks  market share.

Margins on CRE loans have been put under pressure by competition from non-bank lenders, who often sell loans on to retail investment funds. Jim Costello of Real Capital Analytics said debt funds built their share of new construction lending from 7 per cent in 2015 to 20 per cent this year.

These funds have been willing to invest at higher loan-to-value ratios than banking rivals, he said.  Most of it is not crazy lending, but they are stretching on what they are doing,  he said.  This is high octane money coming in late in the cycle. 

At some small banks, CRE concentration is far greater than 20 per cent. There are 430 US banks, with an aggregate $327bn in assets, where commercial real estate represents over 40 per cent of assets.

Many of these banks do most of their CRE lending in their home areas, and are small, with $1-2bn in assets. Some are larger, though: EagleBank of Bethesda, Maryland, has $7.9b of assets, including $5bn in CRE and construction loans. Half of the $10bn in assets at Independent Bank of McKinney, Texas, are in construction and CRE. At the East Boston Savings Bank, almost 70 per cent of the $5.7bn in assets are in CRE, construction, and multi-family housing developments.

Joanne Kim, chief executive of CBB bank, a $1.1bn Los Angeles bank that serves a largely Korean-American customer base, said familiarity with her customers is a source of safety in her loan book. She prefers borrowers with low overall leverage who have owned properties through a whole credit cycle.

 I want to know they have been through some up and downs,  she said.

Good day. If you had any doubt how momentous Uber Technologies Inc.'s initial public offering will be for the tech industry, consider: Any IPO won't arrive for months at least, and yet it's already dominating tech news. Some headlines and analysis from the past 24 hours:

Central to Uber's IPO will be the metrics of Nelson Chai, who became chief financial officer last month. Read more.

Morgan Stanley's top tech banker has moonlighted for years as an Uber driver, which may help the bank win the role of top underwriter. Read more.

Uber sold its first-ever bonds, issuing $2 billion of debt to fund operations until the IPO. Read more.

In Uber-adjacent news today, we also have items on First Round Capital, which made a prescient early bet on the ride-hailing giant, and Niu Technologies, a China-based electric-vehicle company making its own public debut. Plus some news that has nothing to do with Uber, if that's your sort of thing.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

IPO fever: As U.S. scooter companies get flooded with private capital, one Chinese manufacturer already is taking a ride on the Nasdaq. After reducing its offering price range down to $9 to $10 per American depositary share from $10.50 to $12.50, Niu Technologies priced at the bottom of the range at $9, giving it a market capitalization of just over $1 billion. Shares are expected to begin trading on Friday morning. WSJ Pro's Katie Roof has the story.

Booster: Vector Launch Inc., a startup developing small launch rockets for microsatellites, has gotten a new funding boost. Kodem Growth Partners and Morgan Stanley Alternative Investment Partners led the $70 million Series B. Venture investors have backed numerous companies banking on the development of the space market, such as satellite operator Planet Labs Inc., satellite imaging analysis startup Orbital Insight Inc. and Spaceflight Industries Inc. WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova has the story.

First Round, next fund: Early-stage investor First Round Capital is raising a new fund, targeted at roughly $209 million, an uptick from its last fund closed two years ago, according to a regulatory filing. The Philadelphia firm founded by Josh Kopelman has backed hundreds of startups, but its seed investment in Uber's first round in 2010 is the deal that vaulted the firm to prominence. WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova has more.

Cumming's Take: Saudi Furor Could Challenge Sponsors and Investors

By Chris Cumming

The diplomatic crisis over the disappearance of a Saudi journalist raises dangers for firms that accept money from the government of Saudi Arabia and even limited partners that invest alongside it.

Private-equity and venture firms are co-investors in some of the many technology companies backed by the kingdom, which is the single largest investor in U.S. startups. That scale of Saudi government money in private markets means that any response the U.S. government may take up to sanctions could have ripple effects on private equity.

Short of sanctions, firms that do business with the Saudi government and public pensions that invest in vehicles it backs could face public scrutiny, even pressure to divest investments.

Read more in Cumming's Take.

VC Funds

Benchmark Capital has received commitments of $77.5 million for a side fund as it raises its ninth investment vehicle, according to a regulatory filing. The fund, Benchmark Founders' Fund IX LP, could reach $122.7 million, the filing indicates. Benchmark is raising a related fund with a $425 million goal, WSJ Pro reported earlier this month. The firm didn't respond to a request for comment.

Matchstick Ventures has raised $12.3 million for Matchstick Ventures Fund II LP, which could reach $25 million, according to a regulatory filing. The seed investor, with offices in Minneapolis and Boulder, Colo., provides up to $1 million in funding to startups across the Rocky Mountains and Northern U.S. regions.

New Money

Lucid Software Inc., the maker of a cloud-based visual collaboration platform, closed on $72 million in additional funding. The new capital was provided by existing investor Spectrum Equity, alongside new investors Meritech Capital and Iconiq Capital, bringing the company's total funding to $114 million. Read more.

CNEX Labs Inc. alleged in Texas federal court this week that Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei Technologies Co. and its Futurewei unit have engaged in a multiyear plan to steal CNEX's technology. A lawyer for Huawei denied the allegations, which were made in a countersuit in response to a complaint Huawei itself had filed last year, accusing CNEX and Mr. Huang its former employee of stealing its trade secrets and demanding detailed information about CNEX's tech. CNEX is backed by investors including M12 and Sierra Ventures. Read more.

Real estate loans by small banks stir fears

Shares plunge in Arkansas lender that has backed developments as far away as New York

Fears that smaller US banks are taking excessive risks in commercial real estate deepened on Friday as shares plunged in an Arkansas lender that has ploughed billions of dollars into developments in states as far away as New York.

Bank OZK   which this year changed its name from Bank of the Ozarks   revealed that it was taking a $45m writedown on two commercial real estate (CRE) loans, sending its shares down by more than a quarter in afternoon trading.

Bank OZK has $22bn in assets, half of which are CRE and multi-family real estate loans, making it a leading example of a nationwide trend: As big banks have pulled back from CRE and regulators have warned about high valuations, small banks have turned to the asset class as opportunities to expand in other areas have declined.

 It is a risk you have too many of your eggs in one basket,  Paul Fiorilla, an analyst at Yardi Matrix research, said while discussing CRE lending in general.  You do hear talk in the market that some banks have become really aggressive on some deals. 

Bank OZK has quadrupled its assets since 2013. Most of its real estate loans are in the southern US, but a significant portion   nearly $3bn   are in New York. It took the writedowns on loans secured by a mall property in South Carolina and a residential development in North Carolina.

The mall has a Sears store as an anchor tenant. Sears declared bankruptcy earlier this week. Another anchor tenant, JC Penney, has also struggled in recent years. The residential credit was secured by a development where high-end units had not been selling as well as expected.

Bank OZK emphasised that the two loans were made in 2007 and 2008, meaning they were older than nearly all the rest of its loans, which were largely originated since 2015. The properties also had loan-to-value ratios of 80 per cent, while the great majority of OZK s portfolio has LTVs between 50 and 60 per cent, it said.

Banks with under $100bn in assets have significantly increased their CRE exposure in recent years. As of the second quarter of this year, commercial real estate and construction loans accounted for 20 per cent of the assets at these banks; five years ago, it was 15 per cent. That amounts to $280bn in new CRE loans added to small-bank balance sheets across the US.

Commercial property prices are at an all-time high, according to the Real Capital Analytics national CRE index, which hit 133 in August. Its pre-crisis peak was 106.

Small banks that want to grow their balance sheets may not have many choices beyond CRE.

 Over the last 20 years or so, the avenues for loan growth for small banks have shrunk,  said David Ellison, a portfolio manager specialising in financials at Hennessy funds.  Student loans are taken by the government. Reits (real estate investment trusts) gobble up a lot of the big, high quality real estate opportunities. Fannie and Freddie get more of the mortgages, and the accounting rules have made them harder for small banks to hold. Higher yielding stuff is effectively taken away by the capital rules. 

Big banks, by contrast, have grown cautious about the category. At banks with over $100bn in assets, CRE takes up a slightly smaller portion of balance sheets than it did five years ago.

JPMorgan Chase s chief financial officer, Marianne Lake, said last week the bank was being  very selective  about CRE as competition for loans was hot. John Shrewsberry, Wells Fargo s chief financial officer, described in the company s earnings call how competition from non-bank lenders had diminished banks  market share.

Margins on CRE loans have been put under pressure by competition from non-bank lenders, who often sell loans on to retail investment funds. Jim Costello of Real Capital Analytics said debt funds built their share of new construction lending from 7 per cent in 2015 to 20 per cent this year.

These funds have been willing to invest at higher loan-to-value ratios than banking rivals, he said.  Most of it is not crazy lending, but they are stretching on what they are doing,  he said.  This is high octane money coming in late in the cycle. 

At some small banks, CRE concentration is far greater than 20 per cent. There are 430 US banks, with an aggregate $327bn in assets, where commercial real estate represents over 40 per cent of assets.

Many of these banks do most of their CRE lending in their home areas, and are small, with $1-2bn in assets. Some are larger, though: EagleBank of Bethesda, Maryland, has $7.9b of assets, including $5bn in CRE and construction loans. Half of the $10bn in assets at Independent Bank of McKinney, Texas, are in construction and CRE. At the East Boston Savings Bank, almost 70 per cent of the $5.7bn in assets are in CRE, construction, and multi-family housing developments.

Joanne Kim, chief executive of CBB bank, a $1.1bn Los Angeles bank that serves a largely Korean-American customer base, said familiarity with her customers is a source of safety in her loan book. She prefers borrowers with low overall leverage who have owned properties through a whole credit cycle.

 I want to know they have been through some up and downs,  she said.

Qualtrics International Inc. has filed papers to take the customer-analytics company public in an exit for Accel, Insight Venture Partners and Sequoia Capital.

Qualtrics helps customers like Microsoft Corp. and Dropbox Inc. with a broad range of services, including market research, customer analytics and employee engagement.

Founded in 2002, the Provo, Utah company was valued at $2.5 billion post-money in its latest funding round last April, according to PitchBook data.

Qualtrics's plans follow in the footsteps of Utah-based startups Pluralsight Inc. and Domo Inc., which also went public earlier this year.

The IPO filing reveals that several venture firms were able to maintain significant stakes in Qualtrics. Accel holds more than 16% of the company leading into the IPO, Insight Venture Partners owned over 15% and Sequoia had more than 10%.

The prospectus shows that the company had $289.9 million in revenue for 2017, up 52% from $190.6 million in 2016. Qualtrics also turned a profit of $2.6 million last year after losing $12 million the previous year.

Business News: Property Insurers Dodge Bullet on Storm

Hurricane Florence is unlikely to dent property insurers' third-quarter earnings, especially when compared with the devastation from last year's hurricane season.

Florence, which made landfall in North Carolina on Sept. 14, caused significantly more flooding damage than wind damage. While insurers typically cover wind damage, most residential flooding damage is either covered by the federal government or uninsured.

Florence caused between $1.7 billion and $4.6 billion in insured losses due to wind and storm surge, according to an estimate by catastrophe modeler AIR Worldwide. In contrast, insurers in the third quarter of 2017 faced three massive hurricanes -- Harvey, Irma and Maria -- that, combined, caused about $92 billion in insured losses, according to Swiss Re.

"It seems like Florence didn't have as big of an impact as initially expected" for insurance losses, said Mike Zaremski, analyst at Credit Suisse. "It was definitely a much bigger flood event."

Travelers Cos. kicked off the insurance earnings season Thursday, posting core operating earnings of $687 million, or $2.54 a share, up from $253 million, or 91 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.

Overall, the New York-based insurer reported a profit of $709 million, or $2.62 a share, up from $293 million, or $1.05 a share, a year earlier. Total revenue, which includes investment income, rose 5.4% to $7.72 billion.

Travelers, part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, is one of the first big property-casualty insurers to report quarterly earnings, and its results are watched closely as a bellwether for others that follow.

The insurer said Thursday its pretax catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, totaled $264 million during the quarter due to Hurricane Florence and other storms, compared with $700 million a year earlier.

The company is among the largest sellers of insurance to U.S. businesses and sells car and home insurance to individuals and families.

Travelers has closed more than 90% of its homeowners claims tied to Florence, Chief Executive Alan Schnitzer said on a conference call, adding that the company expects significant losses from Hurricane Michael, which made landfall in Florida on Oct. 10.

Also on Thursday, American International Group Inc. and Allstate Corp. pre-announced their third-quarter catastrophe losses. AIG expects pretax catastrophe losses of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion due to Florence, natural disasters in Japan and other events. Allstate said it expects pretax catastrophe losses of $625 million, including about $88.5 million due to Florence.

Insurance and reinsurance companies set to report earnings next week include Chubb Ltd., Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., Cincinnati Financial Corp. and Everest Re Group Ltd.

As of Oct. 3, more than 282,000 insurance claims representing about $1.7 billion in insured losses had been filed due to Hurricane Florence, not including the state's insurers of last resort, according to the North Carolina Department of Insurance. Of those claims, about 25% were for federal flood insurance.

Florence's uninsured flood losses in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia could range from $13 billion to $18.5 billion, according to an estimate from analytics firm CoreLogic.

Michael could be more expensive for the insurance industry, but its financial impact is still being tallied.

Many of the biggest U.S. homeowners insurers have a small presence in Florida, and small to midsize Florida-based companies provide a large portion of the state's home insurance. Those companies rely heavily on reinsurance.

As of midday Wednesday, private-sector insurers had received nearly 70,000 claims for about $680 million in insured losses due to Michael, according to the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation.

Blackstone Profit Jumps, Helped by Rising Markets; Private-equity firm's assets under management climb to $456.69 billion

Blackstone Group LP reported a 17% increase in third-quarter profit as continuing market strength buoyed the value of its investments.

Net income rose to $442.7 million, or 64 cents a share, from $377.9 million, or 55 cents a share, a year earlier.

The value of Blackstone's private-equity portfolio rose 7.5%, a slowdown from the 9.5% growth it posted in the second quarter but significantly outpacing its 3.3% growth in the year-earlier period. The S&P 500 climbed 7.2% in the third quarter.

The investment firm's economic profit, which reflects changes in the value of unrealized investments, rose to $911.4 million, or 76 cents a share, from $822.1 million, or 68 cents a share, a year earlier. The figure exceeded the 74 cents consensus estimate of analysts polled by FactSet.

On a call with analysts Thursday, Blackstone Chief Executive Stephen Schwarzman said factors such as rising interest rates in the U.S., trade tensions, emerging-markets weakness and geopolitical risks in Europe are driving more market uncertainty and volatility.

"However, the U.S. economy remains in great shape by nearly any measure," he said. "Growth is strong, confidence is high and there aren't any signs of the excess we saw ahead of the last down cycle."

Blackstone said its assets under management rose to $456.69 billion, from $387.45 billion a year earlier. The private-equity firm has set a goal of reaching $1 trillion in assets by 2026.

On Oct. 4, Blackstone"https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstone-to-buy-clarus-as-it-jumps-into-life-sciences-1538625780", an investment firm focused on life sciences, to serve as a platform for future acquisitions and partnerships in that sector. Clarus will become Blackstone Life Sciences, a new business line for the firm. Blackstone on Oct. 1 said it had completed its deal "https://www.wsj.com/articles/thomson-reuters-in-talks-to-sell-stake-in-unit-to-blackstone-1517310551" in the financial and risk business of Thomson Reuters. The deal values the business at $20.4 billion.

On Monday, Mr. Schwarzman "https://www.wsj.com/articles/some-top-wall-street-executives-shun-saudi-conference-1539635658?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=7" in Saudi Arabia amid allegations that the Saudi government was complicit in "https://www.wsj.com/articles/turkey-to-inspect-saudi-consulate-where-khashoggi-went-missing-1539604362?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=6"Jamal Khashoggi. Saudi Arabia has denied the allegations. The move was noteworthy because of the firm's ties to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The sovereign-wealth fund last year committed $20 billion in matching funds for Blackstone's infrastructure fund, which could eventually be as big as $40 billion.

"Like everybody, we've been concerned about what we've been reading the last couple of weeks," said Blackstone President Jon Gray on Thursday's call. "That said, for us, we take a long-term approach, both to our relationships and to building businesses."

Third-quarter distributable earnings, the share of profits that could be returned to shareholders, rose to $769.3 million, or 63 cents a share, from $625.6 million, or 52 cents a share, a year earlier.

Blackstone said it would pay a 64-cent dividend for the quarter, versus 44 cents a year earlier, and would pay a 10-cent special dividend. It said it repurchased 6 million of its shares in the third quarter as part of a previously announced buyback.

Blackstone shares fell 79 cents, or 2.2%, to $35.30.

Tech
Secretive Data Company Palantir Weighs Giant Public Offering; Bankers have told the firm it could go public with a valuation as high as $41 billion

Data-mining giant Palantir Technologies Inc., one of Silicon Valley's most secretive companies, is weighing an initial public offering likely to be among the largest in recent years, people familiar with the matter said.

Palantir is discussing with investment banks Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley plans to go public as soon as the second half of 2019, the people said. Some bankers have told the firm it could go public with a valuation of as much as $41 billion depending in part on the timing or twice what it was most recently valued by private investors, the people said.

People familiar with the plans said they remain in flux, and that Palantir could ultimately decide to stay private or offer shares at a lower price to what is being discussed.

The discussions come amid a gusher of technology giants charging toward newly volatile public markets. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week that ride hailing firms Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. are eyeing public debuts. Uber received proposals to go public "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-proposals-value-company-at-120-billion-in-a-possible-ipo-1539690343", nearly double its value in a private fundraising round just two months ago.

Other well-known startups considering IPOs in the months to come include workplace instant-messaging app Slack Technologies Inc. and delivery service Postmates Inc., the Journal has reported.

Anything close to $41 billion would be a lofty valuation for a company of Palantir's current size. The company has told investors it expects around $750 million in revenue this year, up from roughly $600 million a year earlier. That would equate to an IPO value of 55 times 2018 revenue. Uber's proposed valuation, by comparison, would be no more than 12 times the $10 billion to $11 billion it expects to generate in revenue this year.

Co-founded by famed investor Peter Thiel, Palantir made its name analyzing large volumes of data for intelligence agencies and governments around the world. Its analytics have been credited by investors and its staff with helping the U.S. government hunt down and kill Osama bin Laden, as well as disrupt broader terrorist networks.

Some of its government work has attracted scrutiny. Privacy advocates have assailed Palantir for its role in helping law-enforcement agencies identify suspects in crimes. Protesters this year gathered outside its Palo Alto, Calif., headquarters and tracked down some of the firm's early executives to picket.

Palantir says its systems "facilitate accountability and oversight."

Started in 2004, Palantir counts as an old hand in Silicon Valley. It has roughly 2,000 employees with an average age of 30 years old. Staffers embed on military bases for its defense work, and in factories and corporate offices world-wide for its commercial arm.

Some employees and investors complain that the company has remained private for so long. That has made it hard for them to cash out their private stakes and contributed to some employees' decisions to leave, people familiar with the matter said.

Palantir has long teased about a debut on the public stage. In a 2016 interview with the Journal, Chief Executive Alex Karp said the company"https://www.wsj.com/articles/palantir-ceo-says-company-is-being-positioned-to-go-public-1477498155", which would allow employees to "have liquidity at a fair price."

Palantir last raised money several hundred million dollars at a $20 billion valuation in a private fundraising round in 2015.

At roughly double that, Palantir would be seeking a valuation far above its peers. Competitor Tableau Software Inc., which went public in 2013, has a market value of around $9 billion. Analysts expect it to post revenue of about $980 million this year.

Investment bankers often provide a rosy outlook for a company's future finances, as well as their projected value in an IPO, to earn their business in going public.

With Palantir, the potentially higher valuation in an IPO reflects in part the firm's improving business prospects, people familiar with the matter said.

After Palantir shared some of its internal metrics with Morgan Stanley bankers, the bank returned with a range of $36 billion to $41 billion for a 2020 public offering, the people said. That range would be lower in the event of an earlier IPO, they said.

Such growth would put Palantir in a rare echelon of public companies, bankers at Credit Suisse separately told the company, according to documents reviewed by the Journal. The Credit Suisse materials advised that there are only two comparable public companies with growth in Palantir's range.

Good day. A record-setting year for mergers and acquisitions is taking shape even as valuations get ever loftier. Today we look at what is behind the bonanza, and how sustainable it is.

Plus, WSJ Pro's Tomio Geron gives his take on an unusual coin deal that exemplifies the way Andreessen Horowitz's specialized crypto fund is rewriting the industry rules when it comes to investing in blockchain ventures.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Deal bonanza: Lofty valuations have done little to stop companies from writing acquisition checks in 2018. The year is on pace to set a record for venture-backed M&A dollars, according to Dow Jones VentureSource data. The first three quarters of 2018 saw $102.5 billion in startup purchases across 574 deals already exceeding the totals seen in each of the last three full years. WSJ Pro's Katie Roof has the exclusive.

Big Apple seeds: Nat Turner and Zach Weinberg have set up Quaker Health, a seed fund focused on New York health-care startups, working with proceeds from the $1.9 billion sale of their cancer-research startup Flatiron Health earlier this year. Roche Group's acquisition of Flatiron was one of the largest exits for a New York-based venture-backed startup. WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova has the exclusive.

Geron's Take: A16z Crypto Wades Into a Public Market

By Tomio Geron

If you needed any reminder of how much crypto investing differs from venture investing, consider the $15 million investment that Andreessen Horowitz's a16z crypto fund made in MakerDAO's tokens.

It's an interesting deal that confounds the traditional venture model in multiple ways it's publicly trading and it highlights how far crypto deals can take venture capitalists outside their comfort zones.

Under the terms of its investment, a16z got the token at a discount of about 25% off the public's price, according to MakerDAO President Steven Becker, who cited the venture firm's "full services" and deep blockchain-sector experience.

Typically, venture investors would be loathe to invest in a publicly traded stock, and it's just as unlikely that they would invest in a publicly traded token.

Read more in Geron's Take.

Head of Edmond de Rothschild on the future of wealth and the family feud

 It s very exhilarating!  It has just been suggested that I take a moto-taxi (a motorcycle) to catch my train after our interview   and Ariane de Rothschild is tickled at the thought.  Everybody does it. I said I ll do it too, but my girls said,  Oh no you can t ,  she says.

The girls   Ariane s four daughters with her husband Benjamin de Rothschild   are clearly a singular influence on the forceful philanthropist turned chief executive. Born in El Salvador and raised in Colombia and Zaire, Ariane Langner married into what is probably the most famous banking dynasty in the world. Since taking over in 2015 as head of Edmond de Rothschild, the private bank and asset manager founded by her father-in-law   her husband is chairman of the board   she has become one of its most prominent figures.

We are sitting in her apartment on a sweltering day in Paris, just days after the longstanding feud between Ariane s wing of the family and that of her cousin by marriage, David de Rothschild, from the Rothschild and Co wing, has been resolved. She refers to the agreement as  settling with David . At the heart of the legal battle was the idea that neither side should have the right to use just the Rothschild name, lest it cause confusion among would-be clients. Part of that confusion arose from the different natures of the two businesses: while Edmond de Rothschild focuses on private banking and asset management, Rothschild & Co, while growing its own wealth management business, is a mergers and acquisitions specialist.

 Even here, a lot of bankers felt uncomfortable with the lack of clarity,  she says.  I don t think it s healthy that you receive here a phone call saying  Allo, am I contacting Rothschild and you are not honest enough to say:  No, it s not the one you think.  

The settlement was  definitely a relief , she says. Referring to the fact that the French branch of the Rothschild family is now in its seventh generation, she says:  Generations tend to drag on layers and layers of unsaid things, so this is a very good reboot. 

But while the lawsuit she initiated was the most public change Ariane has made, there have been plenty of others behind the scenes: reorganising the bank, promoting women to senior leadership roles and cutting back on overseas expansion to focus on core activities.  When I took over, it was a classic case of businesses that had had very fast growth in a very favourable market, so [it was] an environment where, to a certain extent, people ended up believing the sky was the limit,  she says.  With 2007/08 all of a sudden everybody said: oh maybe the sky s not the limit but kept hoping it would get back to what they were used to. 

She broke down boundaries between the various parts of the business, which include banking, vineyards, hotels, property, foundations and boat racing.  I don t believe in silos,  she says.  A banker or winemaker should be at the same level. My father-in-law [Edmond de Rothschild] used to call the wine business  les danseuses  [which she translates as  the little capricious toy ] and I thought it was very wrong. These businesses are profitable. 

The firm had a branch in Hong Kong that was not profitable, so she closed it.  While I m resizing the business I cannot develop Asia - of course, you cannot forget Asia, so that will come,  she says.

Her approach has, if not exactly ruffled feathers among the bankers, perhaps caused confusion among those more accustomed to a traditional approach.

She tells me about one of her first meetings with her head of French private banking and asset management, Vincent Taupin. Madame de Rothschild had just signed the company up to the United Nations Development Programme s sustainable development goals and had told her employees they had to take it seriously. Her team gifted her two beehives, which she installed on the roof of the building.

 One of the first meetings with Vincent, we had one of the first samples of one of the honey pots and I think he freaked out. We had a meeting on banking and I said:  Did you see my honey pots?  and I think he thought:  Oh, this is going to be a difficult meeting. 

But Ariane de Rothschild is firm in her view that traditional private banking needs to be shaken up.  It was about getting them back to the core of banking on the one hand. It s refocusing on service, service, service, client needs, client needs, client needs. 

 It s very important that my bankers know what wealth is about,  she adds.  I expect more of my bankers than just selling products. Clients want to know more than just the products and I think it s important to share with them our knowledge and philanthropy. 

It sounds like she is inviting them to be members of a club, I venture.  Exactly,  she says.  A lot of the clients, they re interested to know us as a family, how we allocate. A lot - a lot - of the questions are [about] managing future generations, which is one of the hardest questions to answer. 

Defining the family s values was important for positioning Edmond de Rothschild, she says.  We said: what are we really about? We did a lot of work on values and company culture. Rothschild is history, it s family, it s especially in countries like France close to a myth, but I said we are a real company with real targets. 

The core value that she believes her branch of the family demonstrates is panache.  On our side there s a panache: the sailing, the gigantic parties that my father-in-law used to throw   he used to sing Sinatra at 2am at the bank parties. Panache is a way of being   it s not vulgar. 

Pride is another core family value, she says.  When I grew up in Africa, pride was a very strong value. When I moved to Europe one thing that shocked me was a lot of people don t have much pride. [I said] to bankers: a lot of you are arrogant and pride is the opposite of arrogance. Being very demanding of yourself and the people around you: that s pride. Arrogance is self-centered - it s very destructive. 

She is a fan of robo-advice - the artificial intelligence that many banks are developing to help clients manage their investments. But it threatens to shake up the industry, leading to questions over whether the private banker is a dying breed. De Rothschild thinks not.  I think the fear of some bankers - are we going to be replaced? I really don t think so. I think the content of their jobs is going to be all the more interesting. The crunching, the searching: a lot will be done better than you can possibly do yourself. 

What does that leave?  I think emotions, thank god. Dreams, aspirations, real stories, authenticity.  She comes back to the idea that clients want to know what the de Rothschild family have invested in and why.  People remain highly sensitive to the human factor. The ability to share the passion and the logic on why you invest in certain companies: I don t think robo-adviser will do it. 

She argues that her company is well placed to meet the needs of the next generation, who tend to be more engaged in social affairs.  For me, it s a very comfortable zone because that s what this family has always done,  she says.  A lot of millennials come to us and say,  How do I find my balance?  Surprisingly, as a very old brand, we attract a lot of younger wealth because we connect very strongly on philanthropy and entrepreneurship. 

The Rothschild family is of particular interest among Asians, she says.  You d be surprised to see the number of Asian clients especially whose only question is: how do you get to seven generations? It s an obsession to establish a dynasty. 

France under Macron has been good for the wealthy, she says - a view echoed by many other private bankers in Paris. Labelled the  president of the rich,  since his election last year Macron has cut taxes on the wealthy and businesses and vowed to turn the country into a  start-up nation .

 The tech crowd is amazingly vibrant,  she says.  [Compared to] three years ago France today is a very different atmosphere. I think the culture is changing as well: France has always had this culture that making money is not perceived well and I think this is really disappearing. 

Her view on quotas for women is nuanced.  People are making quotas the end but it should be the means. I m very much in favour of helping open the door. Once the door is open, it s really up to you to make the difference. 

Referring to the company s now chief operating officer, Sabine Rabald, she says:  I said come and do operations, she said err, I don t know and I said neither do I know how to be a CEO so if we fail, we fail collectively. I m giving you a try. I think women need to be pushed a bit harder. Honestly I think once you put them in these positions once they re there I don t see a difference between men and women at all. 

Middle management at Edmond de Rothschild is still only 24 per cent women, which she says is a focus.

As perhaps only the very wealthy can, she eschews a traditional banker s concern with performance.  At the end of the day, plus one, minus one   really? Does it really make that big a difference to me? No, what makes a big difference to me is to have a banker who understands my needs. 

It is clear that Ariane de Rothschild does not identify as a banker.  What I m trying to build is a bank that is not just a bank. I don t think tomorrow s clients are interested in just a bank.  She is also used to fighting her corner. She says those who work for her are  starting to understand  that she wants them to think in terms of the bigger picture.  Asking of them to have a much larger view of Edmond de Rothschild, really develop a sense of curiosity: it s tough for a banker.  But she adds:  I think some are starting to enjoy it, because at the beginning they were saying: what the hell is she asking us to do? 

Still, as I cling to a moto-taxi racing through the streets of Paris a short while later, I feel some sympathy for Ariane s daughters and I am glad, for her sake at least, that there are some battles she does not win.

SEC Ruling Hits at Exchanges' Profit

By Alexander Osipovich, Dave Michaels and Gretchen Morgenson

The Securities and Exchange Commission ruled against the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Inc. over the fees they charge Wall Street banks and traders for market data, casting doubt on a crucial revenue stream that has helped make up for falling income from trading.

The five-member commission on Tuesday unanimously shot down a pair of requests to raise fees for certain NYSE and Nasdaq data, saying the exchanges hadn't justified the price increases. The decision is the first time the SEC has rejected fee increases for the exchanges' most lucrative class of stock-market data feeds.

The SEC's decision sided with the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, or Sifma, a major financial-industry trade group that had accused the exchanges of "exploiting their monopoly over market data." Brokers say big and small investors alike will benefit if regulators rein in skyrocketing market-data costs.

The SEC also put into limbo over 400 other market-data fee increases that were challenged by Sifma. The regulator didn't reject those price increases but told the exchanges to review brokers' complaints that they undermine competition, giving the exchanges a year to do so. The move puts pressure on the exchanges to restrain fees or disclose more about why they are necessary.

"Today's decision is a victory for ordinary investors in our stock markets -- who have, for too long, been paying steep costs for an uneven playing field," said SEC Commissioner Robert J. Jackson Jr.

A NYSE spokeswoman said the decision represents a "troubling shift by the SEC" toward "regulatory overreach prioritizing the interests of powerful Wall Street interests," adding the exchange didn't believe the decision would withstand its challenge. Nasdaq said in a statement that it was "disappointed" by the ruling and would appeal in federal court. "This decision represents the latest in a 20-year-long series of attempts to over regulate the best capital markets in the world, in order to benefit the largest financial institutions," it said.

Brokers, including those that serve retail-oriented investors such as mutual and pension funds, say they are essentially required by SEC rules to buy the data. The costs, brokers say, act as a tax on the industry, which they either swallow or pass on to customers.

Data has emerged as a lucrative business for the three big exchange groups that dominate the U.S. stock market: NYSE parent Intercontinental Exchange Inc., known as ICE, Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets Inc. Until the 2000s, exchanges made only a small share of revenue from data and sometimes even gave data away free. Now, revenues from ICE's and Nasdaq's various data-related businesses rival what the companies make from trading.

That shift coincided with an explosion in demand. The importance and sheer volume of market data has grown in the past few decades due to the widespread adoption of electronic trading and the rise of ultrafast traders who need lightning-quick information about price moves.

Exchanges sell data on current stock prices and recent trades, as well as on how much supply and demand there is for stocks at different price levels. High-frequency traders use such data to power their computerized trading strategies. Brokerages, including banks UBS Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co., use it to ensure they are giving their clients -- hedge funds, pension funds and other big investors -- the best price on each trade.

Building on their core equities-data business, exchanges have pushed into related areas, such as bond-price data and market-analysis software. From 2014 to 2017, total annual revenues from market-data services for the big three exchange companies surged 45% to $2.3 billion, according to an analysis by the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, a research group whose members include big banks and asset managers.

Exchanges said the analysis overstates the size and growth rate of their data business. Disclosures from ICE, Nasdaq and Cboe show their combined stock-market data revenues were around $560 million in 2017, although that doesn't include connection fees that traders and brokers must pay to access such data. The figure also excludes sales of options and futures data.

So far, small investors haven't seen much impact from rising data costs, and their overall trading costs have generally fallen in recent years. Well-known names in retail investing have nonetheless joined Wall Street banks in complaining about fee increases. Charles Schwab Corp., Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price Group Inc. were among 24 companies that signed a letter to the SEC in December blasting the exchanges' "oligopoly" over stock-market data.

Clearpool Group Inc., a startup electronic brokerage whose office is just a few blocks from the Big Board's historic headquarters in lower Manhattan, said its yearly outlays for NYSE equities data climbed to $343,000 in 2015 from $212,000 in 2013, a 62% increase. Since then, Clearpool's NYSE data expenses have dropped, because it stopped paying for the priciest data feeds, the company said. "What we've seen is a steady increase in the pricing," said Clearpool CEO Joe Wald.

The SEC's ruling will likely make it tougher for exchanges to raise fees for data and related charges for connecting to their computer systems. The SEC has already started to scrutinize such fee increases more closely, in a broad effort to ensure they don't undermine competition, according to regulators and traders involved in the fight.

U.S. stock exchanges have long used their status as pillars of American capitalism to get their way in Washington. From 2016 through September, the SEC didn't reject any of 95 exchange proposals related to connection fees, according to an analysis by Mr. Jackson, the SEC commissioner.

The SEC's Sifma ruling reopens fundamental questions about the role of exchanges. Should they be utilities working for the good of markets, or, as for-profit companies, should they focus on making money for shareholders?

The NYSE's metamorphosis into a Big Data company started in the 2000s, after new SEC rules aimed at breaking the decades-old NYSE-Nasdaq duopoly took effect. As recently as the 1990s, it handled more than two-thirds of U.S. equities trading on a dollar basis.

The rise of rival exchanges and electronic trading platforms eroded the Big Board's market share. Today the NYSE handles about 23% of U.S. stock-trading volume.

As it battled low-cost competitors, the exchange's traditional business suffered. From 2008 to 2017, the NYSE's net revenue from transaction fees fell by more than 40% to $196 million, according to an analysis by Equity Research Desk, a research firm.

Seeking to lift its flagging fortunes, the NYSE turned to its trove of trading data. On an average day, around 1.7 billion shares change hands on the NYSE's markets. Vast volumes of digital messages zip around the Big Board's 400,000-square-foot data center in Mahwah, N.J., each of which represents a trade or a pending order to buy or sell stocks. The NYSE compiles those messages into high-speed electronic feeds that it sells to brokers and traders.

The NYSE also broadcasts stock prices through a cheaper, slower public data feed, called the securities information processor, or SIP. This is used by retail brokers such as TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. and internet search engines like Google and Yahoo.

Banks and electronic-trading firms say the SIP is too slow to be useful. Sifma has accused the NYSE and other exchanges of underinvesting in the SIP to steer big-ticket customers to pricier data feeds. The NYSE and other exchanges deny that contention.

MIT unveils big AI and computing project

Innovation Blackstone's Schwarzman gives $350m towards $1bn investment at university

Massachusetts Institute of Technology has announced a $1bn commitment to computing and artificial intelligence that will see the size of its faculty in these fields nearly double, based on a $350m gift from Stephen Schwarzman, chief executive and co-founder of the global private equity group Blackstone.

MIT said the initiative would be the largest investment in computing and AI made by an American university, and its biggest structural change since the 1950s, when academics at MIT started pioneering research into AI.

A "signature new building" on MIT's Cambridge campus outside Boston, to be completed by 2022, will house the Schwarzman College of Computing. Fifty faculty positions will be created, which will, in turn, lead to a larger influx of graduate researchers.

"We are reshaping MIT," said Rafael Reif, president of MIT. "The Schwarzman College will constitute both a global centre for computing research and education, and an intellectual foundry for powerful new AI tools."

An equally important role will be to equip students and researchers in other disciplines, such as economics, linguistics and urban studies, to use computing and AI to advance their work. The idea, said Martin Schmidt, MIT provost, is to create "bilinguals   people who are as fluent in computing and AI as they are in their own disciplines".

Mr Schwarzman said: "As one of the world leaders in technological innovation, MIT has the right expertise and the right values to serve as the 'true north' of AI in pursuit of the answers we urgently need ... "Our hope is that this ambitious initiative serves as a clarion call to our government that massive financial investment in AI is necessary to ensure that America has a leading voice in shaping the future of these powerful and transformative technologies," he added. Prof Reif said MIT started discussions with Mr Schwarzman about his gift early this year, with a final decision to go ahead made in the summer.

MIT trustees approved the new college's establishment this month. In addition to Mr Schwarzman's $350m, other donors have committed a total of $300m, leaving MIT with $350m still to raise to achieve its $1bn target.

In February the university announced a focused programme of AI research called MIT Intelligence Quest. The initiative is more broadly based, encompassing education as much as research. Both aim to bolster the appeal of academia at a time when the tech industry's voracious appetite for computing and AI specialists threatens to suck the most talented scientists and engineers from universities into corporate research.

In addition, MIT is looking for new ways to retain people by enabling them to work both at the university and at high-tech companies with research centres in the Boston area.

'Our hope is that this ... serves as a clarion call to government that massive investment in AI is needed'

Pro Private Markets
VC Daily: IPO Proposals Value Uber at $120 Billion; Bessemer on Both Sides; Corporate Venturing

Good day. Bessemer Venture Partners saw two of its portfolio companies link up on Merger Monday as Twilio Inc. agreed to a $2 billion acquisition of SendGrid Inc. BVP's Byron Deeter, on the boards of both companies, recused himself from the boardroom talks. The deal and its inside-the-family setting of terms echoed a similar tie-up from last July, when two Sequoia Capital-backed startups (Square and Weebly) tied the knot.

Today we also look at another merger in the cybersecurity world, and WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova explains why some venture firms are proceeding with caution when taking on corporate LPs.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Breaking: Uber Technologies Inc. recently received proposals from Wall Street banks valuing the ride-hailing company at as much as $120 billion in an initial public offering that could take place early next year, according to people familiar with the matter. WSJ's Liz Hoffman, Greg Bensinger and Maureen Farrell have the scoop.

Bessemer on both sides: Cloud communications platform Twilio Inc., which went public in 2016, agreed to pay $2 billion in stock to acquire email marketing specialist SendGrid Inc., whose IPO was last year. Bessemer partner Byron Deeter sits on the boards of both companies, and Bessemer's Jeff Epstein is on Twilio's board. Bessemer still owns about 8% of Twilio, which had a market cap of about $7.4 billion as of Monday's market close. Bessemer also owned 13% of SendGrid. WSJ's Maria Armental has more.

Exit for Team8: Sygnia Inc., a cybersecurity startup founded by Team8, has been sold to Singapore's Temasek Holdings. The deal was valued at about $250 million, according to a person familiar with the matter. WSJ Pro's Tomio Geron has the story.

Play for keeps: Thirty Madison Inc., a consumer health-care startup known for its hair-loss treatment brand Keeps, has raised $15.25 million in Series A financing. The New York company is one of several direct-to-consumer health startups such as Hims Inc. addressing common but often undertreated conditions like hair loss and erectile dysfunction. WSJ Pro's Heather Mack has more.

Chernova's Take: Risks and Benefits in Corporate Funding

By Yuliya Chernova

Corporations are getting more active in the venture landscape, both by investing in startups and in venture funds.

While they bring new opportunities for those who take their money, they can also be unreliable partners.

"Their staying power can be shorter because they don't have this 10- to 12-year horizon that a financial investor has," said Jenny Fielding, managing director at Techstars, who previously led venture investments at BBC Worldwide's corporate arm.

Some venture firms make a point of structuring their funds with special care to minimize exposure to the fickleness of corporate limited partners. Backers in the real-estate sector, whose stock prices have been on shaky ground lately, provide a case in point.

More in Chernova's Take.

Exits

OJO Labs, a startup offering conversational real-estate technology, has acquired real-estate database provider WolfNet Technologies. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed. Austin, Texas-based OJO has raised more than $28 million in funding from investors including LiveOak Venture Partners, Silverton Partners and Northwestern Mutual Future Ventures.

HiFiBiO Therapeutics, which is developing novel treatments for cancer and autoimmune disorders, has acquired peer H-Immune Therapeutics for an undisclosed sum. In May, HiFiBiO secured $37.5 million in Series B funding led by Sequoia China and LYFE Capital, with participation from Legend Star Capital, Proxima Ventures, VI Ventures and Nest.Bio Ventures. The company has offices in Cambridge, Mass., Paris and Shanghai.

VC Funds

Israel-based Glilot Capital Partners has closed its third fund at $110 million. Like the firm's first two funds, Glilot III will invest in Israeli early-stage startups in artificial intelligence, big data and cybersecurity sectors.

Updata Partners has opened a $300 million sixth fund, according to a regulatory filing. The Washington-based growth-equity firm invests $10 million to $25 million in software, tech-enabled services and digital-media providers.

New Money

Garrison, a London-based provider of secure web browsing technology, has raised a new funding round of $30 million led by Dawn Capital. IP Group, BGF and NM Capital also participated. "https://www.garrison.com"

In recent years, U.S. stock exchanges thought they had a guaranteed profit machine that could revive their sagging businesses: selling market data at ever-higher prices to a captive audience of Wall Street banks and traders.

On Tuesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission unanimously ruled against the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Inc. in a 12-year legal dispute over market-data fees.

The five-member commission shot down a pair of requests to raise fees for certain NYSE and Nasdaq data, saying the exchanges hadn't justified the price increases. The decision is the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/brokers-notch-wins-in-fight-over-exchanges-data-practices-1538049600". It casts doubt on a crucial source of revenue that has helped make up for declining trading-fee income.

The SEC's decision sided with the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, or Sifma, a major financial-industry trade group that had accused the exchanges of "exploiting their monopoly over market data." Brokers say big and small investors alike will benefit if regulators rein in skyrocketing market-data costs.

The SEC also put into limbo over 400 other market-data fee increases that were challenged by Sifma. The regulator didn't reject those price increases but told the exchanges to review brokers' complaints that they undermine competition, giving the exchanges a year to complete the effort. The move puts pressure on the stock exchanges to restrain fees or disclose more about why they are necessary, which exchanges have historically resisted.

"Today's decision is a victory for ordinary investors in our stock markets who have, for too long, been paying steep costs for an uneven playing field," said SEC Commissioner Robert J. Jackson Jr. He added that "exchanges will have to show that competitive forces, not market power, justify any increase."

A NYSE spokeswoman said the decision represents a "troubling shift by the SEC" toward "regulatory overreach prioritizing the interests of powerful Wall Street interests," adding the exchange didn't believe the decision would withstand its challenge. Nasdaq said in a statement that it was "disappointed" by the ruling and would appeal in federal court. "This decision represents the latest in a 20-year-long series of attempts to over regulate the best capital markets in the world, in order to benefit the largest financial institutions," it said.

Brokers, including those that serve retail-oriented investors such as mutual funds and pension funds, say they are essentially required by SEC rules to buy the exchanges' data. Those costs, brokers say, act as a tax on the industry, which they either swallow or pass on to customers.

The SEC's Republican commissioners faulted the exchanges for providing regulators with only a cursory basis to judge the fees. The exchanges, Hester Peirce and Elad Roisman wrote in a statement, have never explained which traders need such data and what other options they have for obtaining it. Absent such information, they wrote, the SEC can't judge whether the fees are so high they keep some traders out of the market, a form of discrimination that public exchanges aren't allowed to practice.

Data has emerged as a lucrative business for the three big exchange groups that dominate the U.S. stock market: NYSE parent Intercontinental Exchange Inc., known as ICE, Nasdaq and Cboe Global Markets Inc. Until the 2000s, exchanges made only a small share of revenue from data and sometimes even gave data away free. Now, revenues from ICE's and Nasdaq's various data-related businesses rival what the companies make from trading.

That shift coincided with an explosion in demand. The importance and sheer volume of market data has grown in the past few decades due to the widespread adoption of electronic trading and the rise of ultrafast traders who need lightning-quick information about price moves.

Exchanges sell data on current stock prices and recent trades, as well as on how much supply and demand there is for stocks at different price levels. High-frequency traders use such data to power their computerized trading strategies. Brokerages, including banks UBS Group AG and JPMorgan Chase & Co., use it to ensure they are giving their clients hedge funds, pension funds and other big investors the best price on each trade.

Building on their core equities-data business, exchanges have pushed into related areas, such as bond-price data and market-analysis software. From 2014 to 2017, total annual revenues from market-data services for the big three exchange companies surged 45% to $2.3 billion, according to an analysis by the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, a research group whose members include big banks and asset managers.

Exchanges said the analysis overstates the size and growth rate of their data business. Disclosures from ICE, Nasdaq and Cboe show their combined stock-market data revenues were around $560 million in 2017, although that doesn't include connection fees that traders and brokers must pay to access such data. The figure also excludes sales of options and futures data.

"There is absolutely no evidence that anyone would benefit from harmful government price-setting intervention, other than the Wall Street interests that continue to perpetuate these myths in a self-interested bid to further lift their profits," a NYSE spokeswoman said before the SEC ruling.

So far, small investors haven't seen much impact from rising data costs, and their overall trading costs have generally fallen in recent years. Well-known names in retail investing have nonetheless joined Wall Street banks in complaining about fee increases. Charles Schwab Corp., Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price Group Inc. were among 24 companies that signed "https://www.wsj.com/articles/traders-want-to-know-what-exchanges-earn-from-market-data-1512592201".

Clearpool Group Inc., a startup electronic brokerage whose office is just a few blocks from the Big Board's historic headquarters in lower Manhattan, said its yearly outlays for NYSE equities data climbed to $343,000 in 2015 from $212,000 in 2013, a 62% increase. Since then, Clearpool's NYSE data expenses have dropped, because it stopped paying for the priciest data feeds, the company said. "What we've seen is a steady increase in the pricing," said Clearpool CEO Joe Wald.

The SEC's ruling will likely make it tougher for exchanges to raise fees for data and related charges for connecting to their computer systems. The SEC has already started to scrutinize such fee increases more closely, in a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-commissioner-calls-for-regulators-to-bolster-market-oversight-1537299243", according to regulators and traders involved in the fight.

A federal appeals court said last year that the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/appeals-court-orders-sec-to-reconsider-options-industry-fee-plan-1502213910" and ordered the agency to improve its oversight. The court ruling "has raised the bar for the commission on our review of [exchange] filings," Brett Redfearn, the SEC's director of trading and markets, said at an industry conference on Oct. 4.

U.S. stock exchanges have long used their status as pillars of American capitalism to get their way in Washington. From 2016 through September, the SEC didn't reject any of 95 exchange proposals related to connection fees, according to an analysis by Mr. Jackson, the SEC commissioner.

The SEC's Sifma ruling reopens fundamental questions about the role of exchanges. Should they be utilities working for the good of markets, or, as for-profit companies, should they focus on making money for shareholders?

The NYSE's metamorphosis into a Big Data company started in the 2000s, after new SEC rules aimed at breaking the decades-old NYSE-Nasdaq duopoly took effect. Founded in 1792, the NYSE dominated U.S. stock trading for most of American history. As recently as the 1990s, it handled more than two-thirds of U.S. equities trading on a dollar basis.

The rise of rival exchanges and electronic trading platforms eroded the Big Board's market share. Today the NYSE handles about 23% of U.S. stock-trading volume.

As it battled low-cost competitors, the exchange's traditional business suffered. From 2008 to 2017, the NYSE's net revenue from transaction fees fell by more than 40% to $196 million, according to an analysis by Equity Research Desk, a research firm.

Seeking to lift its flagging fortunes, the NYSE turned to its trove of trading data. On an average day, around 1.7 billion shares change hands on the NYSE's markets. Vast volumes of digital messages zip around the Big Board's 400,000-square-foot data center in Mahwah, N.J., each of which represents a trade or a pending order to buy or sell stocks. The NYSE compiles those messages into high-speed electronic feeds that it sells to brokers and traders.

The NYSE also broadcasts stock prices through a cheaper, slower public data feed, called the securities information processor, or SIP. This is used by retail brokers such as TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. and internet search engines like Google and Yahoo.

Banks and electronic-trading firms say the SIP is too slow to be useful. Sifma has accused the NYSE and other exchanges of underinvesting in the SIP to steer big-ticket customers to pricier data feeds. The NYSE and other exchanges deny that contention.

Wall Street veterans, including former NYSE executives, say the Big Board stepped up its focus on data after its conversion to a for-profit company in 2006. They add that the process accelerated after Atlanta-based ICE completed its takeover of the NYSE in 2013.

ICE's latest focus is amassing control of crucial financial data flows. Last year, 45% of the company's net revenues came from market-data sales and related fees, up from 9% in 2011. That includes the sale of data from its exchanges as well as from nonexchange businesses.

ICE has said that sales of real-time stock-market data account for just 2% of its annual revenue and haven't been growing quickly.

Chief Executive Jeffrey Sprecher has rejected allegations in the past that ICE abuses its market power to make outsize profits from data. "That's a false narrative," he told The Wall Street Journal in an interview last year, stressing that the Big Board's customers were free to buy less-expensive data feeds.

Brokers say part of the problem is well-intentioned SEC regulations that were designed to protect investors but ended up providing a profit opportunity for the exchanges.

Under a rule adopted in 2005, brokers must send customer orders to whichever exchange is displaying the best price for a stock. Brokers say that means they have to buy price data from all 13 U.S. exchanges currently in operation. All but one of those markets are now owned by the NYSE, Nasdaq and Cboe. The other, IEX Group Inc., doesn't sell premium data feeds and has attacked its larger rivals for their data practices.

The SEC requires brokers to give their clients the best execution possible on orders. Regulators have said that requires brokers to use the exchanges' fastest and deepest data feeds to price customer orders, if the brokers also use that data for any of their own trading.

Data is among many costs facing brokers, and it helps determine how much they charge their customers, including mutual funds and pension funds. Richard Johnson, an analyst with research firm Greenwich Associates, says rising data costs help explain why the average brokerage commission paid by financial institutions has held steady at about 2.6 cents per share since 2010, after dropping for the three decades before then.

High-frequency trading firms say they have also been hammered by the mounting cost of exchange data. Such firms use powerful computer algorithms to zip in and out of stocks in fractions of a second. If a firm can get information about a move in stock prices slightly faster than its rivals, it can use that to beat the competition. That's a big incentive to upgrade to the fastest available data feeds and connections.

In 2012, Nasdaq introduced a new version of its Totalview-ITCH data feed that traders say was just two millionths of a second faster than the next-best version. The cost was an additional $25,000 a month, but many high-speed firms paid up.

"We're in a competitive market," said Adam Nunes, head of business development at Hudson River Trading LLC, a high-speed trading firm. "We need to buy it in order to compete with other trading firms."

The Security and Privacy Trends That Could Disrupt Cyber

By Tom Loftus

ORLANDO, Fla. -- Let's play business news headlines Mad Libs: "[Company Name] caught flat-footed by [A Nationality] hackers exploiting [A Vulnerability]. [A group of authority] demand answers. [Another group] plans lawsuits." Why is it so easy to write such cybersecurity headlines? Because, ironically, cybersecurity is not. While businesses face a host of security challenges, from overcoming internal communication problems to surfing an ever-shifting regulatory and geopolitical landscape, the bad guys only have one challenge: Finding a way in. And they often do.

Speaking Monday at the Gartner Symposium/ITxpo, Peter Firstbrook, Gartner Inc. vice president and analyst, combed through the mess of factors derailing cybersecurity efforts to identify several strategic shifts that could have significant impact over the next couple years.

Better, more efficient talk between senior business executives and security. News headlines can't help but spark more conversation between the board and the security team, but there remains much room for improvement. "Security is not speaking the language of business and business not speaking the language of security," he said. Security teams can bridge that gulf by hiring from the business side such internal communicators can be a great bridge to the board. Together the two groups can establish service levels that align with business risk.

Understand impact of data regulatory mandates on digital plans. As business demand for data increases, driven in part by automated processes and machine learning, entities including the European Union and the state of California are taking cues from changing public attitudes toward business use of their information, to consider laws that make business more liable for misuse of personal data. Companies can protect themselves first with a better understanding of what their data is worth, not just from a product-enabling perspective, but also what it could cost them if it were breached. He suggested companies eliminate or offload data when liability exceeds value.

Think cloud tools. Why? Cloud-based security can be more agile, according to Mr. Firstbrook, and with access to huge amounts of real-time data, cloud tool vendors can use machine learning to mine for new insights and behaviors, he said.

Think machine learning also, but know its limits. Machine learning provides value for simple tasks and spotting suspicious events, but CISOs should be mindful of the technology's occasional tendency to create false positives. Its biggest value is in providing assistance to humans, he said.

Be mindful of the new global landscape. Business are now caught up in a cold war between nations involving the acquisition and management of data. China and more recently, India, are demanding that data generated in their countries remain there. Meanwhile Washington, D.C. has prevented certain Chinese tech companies from selling to U.S. firms. Add to this the practice of various national security agencies installing backdoors into popular software packages, and the range of cybersecurity factors outside the control of a business has increased dramatically.

The bigger the concentration of data, the bigger the target. Slowly businesses and individuals are recognizing the potential risk of entrusting data to a handful of sources, whether it's the two providers of digital certificates most businesses use or the handful of computer giants. These data monopolies not only make bigger targets, but when they get hacked, the pain can spread among parties -- as may be the case with the recent Facebook Inc. hack, in which tens of millions of digital keys were stolen. Slowly, change be afoot, says Mr. Firstbrook, most notably in the emergence of blockchain and increased interest in rebooting encryption and identity for the digital age.

After the Hack, What Next?

By Kim S. Nash

DANA POINT, Calif.   Many factors dictate how a company should, or even can, respond to a breach. Priorities differ by business, geography and type of incident and regulatory jurisdiction, said experts at the WSJ Pro Cybersecurity Small Business Academy.

A lack of preparation compounds the pressure businesses face, said Rusty Sailors, chairman and chief executive of Secure Smart Office, which specializes in security technology for small and medium businesses. Business leaders have some idea of how to respond to a cybersecurity incident but haven't practiced it or written it down, he told the audience here. "They say,  we know what we want to do but it's not documented,'" he said.

About 75% of organizations don't have a documented response plan, according to Wendi Whitmore, global partner and lead at IBM X-Force Incident Response and Intelligence Services. "Get those names on paper," she advised, referring to the company leaders who will take active roles in case of a hack.

Conference speakers and attendees discussed steps to take in the hours and days after an attack. Here are highlights:

Call legal. Inform internal or external attorneys about an incident so they can advise immediate next steps. Often regulatory authorities must be notified but their deadlines and requirements differ. One state might define "breach" as an unauthorized intrusion. Another might say that a breach occurs only when there is evidence that information has been stolen, Mr. Sailors said. Involving the legal team at the start can help define information that falls under attorney-client privilege, helping a company control what becomes public, he added.

Be smart about data backup. One attendee relayed a story of being targeted in a ransomware attack three times in short succession. In the aftermath, executives discovered that the company's backed-up data wasn't current, leading to having to restore four years' worth of information from hard copies. Haphazard backup and storage practices increase the stress on an organization after a cybersecurity problem, Ms. Whitmore said.

Prepare public statements. "It's not the breach itself that an organization is judged by but the communication [about it]," Ms. Whitmore said. She pointed to the immediate response by the CEO of A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S after the shipping company was hit in the international NotPetya attack last year. Within hours, he made statements saying that he had let employees know that they are authorized to make decisions about what's best for clients and that the company would accept the costs associated with the problem, she said.

Facebook to ban misinformation about voting. Facebook Inc. plans to ban false information about voting before next month's U.S. midterm elections, Reuters reported. The company's moderators will enforce the new rule as part of Facebook's community standards policy. It will apply to posts that exaggerate voting requirements or report false claims of violence at polling stations, which could affect voter turnout. Facebook's head of cybersecurity policy Nathaniel Gleicher told Reuters the company is also considering a ban on hacked material. Facebook has so far stopped short of promising to remove all posts that spread false information. Tessa Lyons, product manager for Facebook's News Feed, told Reuters, "We don't believe we should remove things from Facebook that are shared by authentic people if they don't violate those community standards, even if they are false."

India's data localization law takes effect. The Reserve Bank of India warned Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc. and American Express Co. last week that it would take action, and possibly impose fines, if the companies do not comply with India's new data localization law that took effect on Monday, the New York Times reported. The law, approved in April, requires payment data for domestic transactions to be stored in India. India's banking regulator had rejected the companies' requests for more time to meet the legal requirement, the Times reported. Multinational payment service companies have lobbied against the legislation. Facebook's WhatsApp is the only major American company that said it was prepared to comply with the law by Monday, the Times reported.

Facebook removes Myanmar military pages. Facebook Inc. confirmed in a blog post Monday that it has removed 13 pages and 10 accounts connected to Myanmar's military. The New York Times reported Monday that hundreds of military officials had used fake Facebook accounts for half a decade to incite violence against Muslims. The company said the pages and accounts violated its misrepresentation policy by misleading users and spreading military propaganda. In August, the company banned the user page of the Myanmar's military commander-in-chief and other officials.

Department of Defense investigates data breach. The Department of Defense is investigating a breach of travel records that could have affected up to 30,000 U.S. military and civilian workers, the Associated Press reports. The Pentagon last week confirmed the incident, which it said compromised credit card and personal information but no classified data. Cybersecurity staff reported the incident to department leaders on Oct. 4. A Pentagon spokesman said the breach involved one vendor but didn't name it, the AP said.

Dearth of data makes tracking diversity tough

When Black-Rock, the world's largest fund manager, took companies to task for the lack of women on corporate boards earlier this year, it struck a chord with Julie Gorte.

A senior vice-president of Pax World Funds, Ms Gorte had spent nearly 20 years making that very point with the companies in which she invests. Progress has been slow. Less than a quarter of blue-chip board seats are held by women in the US, according to data from proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services, trailing the greater progress seen across many European countries.

If efforts to increase gender diversity have been slow to take effect, addressing other areas of diversity has proved even harder, as Ms Gorte and others have discovered. This includes analysing boards' mix on ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability and social background. Yet investors often draw a blank with their research.

They say they lack the basic data to judge how companies are faring on increasing diversity across their organisations and some are now actively pushing companies to disclose more information.

"If you see a Hispanic name or black face, you can say yes this board has an ethnic minority on it," Ms Gorte says. "But you are never really sure   does that person think of themselves as Latino? Are they there to represent that group? Making a determination often can be quite difficult."

The shift is being propelled by the more progressive public US pension plans, as well as advisers to city retirement and investment funds in New York and Chicago. Big money managers, such as BlackRock and State Street, which hold hefty sway in proxy contests, have also responded to the call.

Investors have come to appreciate the value of boardroom diversity, both as a social imperative and a way to improve the mix of decision makers at the top of a company. Diverse boards are viewed as a way to mitigate against groupthink and legal risk.

Moreover, progressive workplace policies are an important tool to recruit and retain employees, says Jackie VanderBrug, the head of sustainable and impact investment strategy in Bank of America's wealth management division.

There is also arguably a financial imperative for companies. Research from Bank of America this year showed that businesses with women in top roles and broad diversity policies generally saw lower earnings volatility and higher returns on equity.

"There is clear evidence that having women on boards provides broader perspectives," agrees Christopher Greenwald, head of sustainable investment research at UBS Asset Management. "It is important to have an effective and well-managed board with a range of skillsets [and] range of perspectives to question management in the long-term interest of shareholders."

Yet very few companies in the US disclose the ethnic make-up of their boards, according to John Roe, head of ISS Analytics.

The company compiles its own data based on assessments of corporate boards. It shows that about 15.1 per cent of S&P 500 board seats were held by someone non-white in 2018, up from 13 per cent five years earlier. By contrast, census data show minorities make up roughly two-fifths of the US population. Smaller companies have fewer still. Just 8.5 per cent of board seats at small-cap companies in the S&P 600 are held by minorities, versus 7 per cent in 2013. In the UK, meanwhile, 8 per cent of FTSE 100 board seats were held by people of colour in 2017, against 14 per cent in the broader population.

The New York City Comptroller, the chief fiscal officer of the city, has taken a direct approach. It asked the boards of 151 companies to detail their demographic breakdown, including sexual orientation, race and age. Generally, of companies that already provide diversity data, most tend to detail their board's age and ethnicity. Some companies, however, such as insurer and asset manager Prudential Financial, and electric utility operator Edison International, have started to include sexual orientation data in their breakdowns.

Investors often have to turn to alternative sources to find out what companies are doing to promote diversity. Some look at how companies score on the Human Rights Campaign's annual equality ranking   a scorecard for how groups are faring on policies   or seek news reports that highlight harassment and discrimination at a given company. "The data is a challenge," says Linda Giuliano, head of responsible investment at AllianceBernstein. "Do people want to be [asked about] their sexual orientation? ... It creates a real dilemma. "It matters ... but on the other hand it doesn't feel right that we have to get that personal about an individual. " Asset managers are trying to establish more sophisticated methods to guide their investment decisions. Kurt Summers, the treasurer of Chicago who manages the city's $8bn investment portfolio, together with his team scores each investment decision across 200 factors relating to diversity, the environment and corporate governance. The data come from index providers such as MSCI as well as via its own research.

Chicago and several other pension funds have told their Wall Street counterparts how they select investments. "You have the entire broker-dealer community taking notice and adjusting their market pitches based on what we and other ... institutional investors are saying are [our] priorities," Mr Summers says. "You have the ability to have a significant market impact, more so than any individual conversation with a company."

'Do people want to be asked about their sexual orientation? It creates a real dilemma'

Good day. Accelerators are booming. With the prominence of Y Combinator, Techstars and others, funding is pouring into the sector as limited partners look to get an early piece of the next Airbnb or Dropbox.

Meanwhile, early-stage venture investors often say they don't worry about volatility in the public market. But the steep drops in the global markets last week had to have some VCs checking their phones. The good news: Anaplan priced its IPO at the top of its range, then rose 43% in trading Friday.

We also have a Take on the rewards and perils of investing in startups focused on synthetic biology.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Accelerators rising: Accelerators have doubled the funding raised so far this year compared to 2017. In the third quarter alone, investors put $35.1 million into accelerator programs like Techstars, up from $7.4 million at the same time last year. In the wake of Y Combinator, Techstars and 500 Startups, dozens of accelerators have cropped up across the country in recent years. WSJ Pro's Heather Mack has more.

IPO window holding open: The trading debut of Anaplan Inc. offered a hopeful sign that recent market stress wouldn't squelch that red-hot IPO market. Shares of Anaplan, a business-planning-software company, rose 43% in their first day of trading on Friday to close at $24.30. The increase coming after the company priced the shares late Thursday at the high end of an upwardly revised range shows that two days of harrowing market declines earlier in the week have had a limited impact on demand for new issues. WSJ's Maureen Farrell and Kimberly Chin have more.

Dot-dom dj-vu: Tech startups, and their valuations, are booming in China. But where some investors see dynamic exuberance, others see a market increasingly threatened by a confluence of forces including onerous domestic regulations and global trade tensions. The biggest risk? Another dot-com reckoning, the Chinese version of a cycle that erased billions of dollars of value from America's tech sector in the 2000s and chilled tech investment for years. WSJ's Phred Dvorak and Liza Lin have more.

Mack's Take: Some Synthetic-Biology Startups Thrive, But Many Struggle

By Heather Mack

Investor dollars are swarming to synthetic biology startups, which apply engineering techniques to organisms to produce microbes that can go on to form drug compounds, renewable energy sources, or meat alternatives.

However, not all of these startups are the same. Startups that provide services to create synthetic biology for clients have seen a clear path to growth, but those that aim to create synthetic-biology products themselves have faced challenges.

That's because selling and scaling sector-specific materials like cultured meat, sustainably produced building material and biofuels is still a costly and labor-intensive endeavor.

Instead, the companies that have managed to find customer traction and revenue are those that provide the facilitating tools, such as Twist Biosciences' large-scale DNA synthesis platforms and Ginkgo Bioworks Inc.'s customized microbe engineering services.

Read Mack's Take.

Exits

Chinese cancer drug developer Innovent Biologics Inc. is pushing ahead with an initial public offering in Hong Kong, despite a global markets rout and the recent poor performance of other biotechnology startups that have listed in the city. The company is trying to raise up to $423 million in a stock sale that could value the Suzhou-based upstart at more than $2 billion, according to people familiar with the situation. Read more.

RealPage Inc., a publicly traded provider of software and data analytics to the real-estate industry, has agreed to acquire Rentlytics Inc. for an initial purchase price of about $57 million in cash. San Francisco-based Rentlytics provides cloud software that visualizes rent, occupancy, delinquency rates and other data to real-estate portfolio managers. The company had raised $13 million in funding from investors including Trinity Ventures, Rincon Venture Partners and Grey Wolf Venture Capital.

Publicly traded Alliqua BioMedical Inc. and Adynxx Inc. have entered into a merger agreement to create a Nasdaq-listed company focused on developing non-opioid therapies for the treatment of pain. San Francisco-based Adynxx earlier secured funding from TPG Biotech and Domain Associates. The combined company will be named Adynxx.

Online gaming startup Roblox Corp. has acquired PacketZoom Inc., a mobile app performance technology provider, for an undisclosed amount. PacketZoom was backed by Baseline Ventures, First Round Capital, Tandem Capital, Founder Collective and Arafura Ventures. Last month, Roblox landed $150 million in Series F funding led by Greylock Partners and Tiger Global Management, with participation from investors including Index Ventures, Meritech Capital Partners and Altos Ventures. Both companies are based in San Mateo, Calif.

VC Funds

Micron Technology Inc. said it would invest up to $100 million in startups with a strong focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning through its Micron Ventures arm. The Boise, Idaho-based chipmaker said it would earmark 20% for startups led by women and other underrepresented groups. Launched in 2006, Micron Ventures invests in technology startups aligned with Micron's strategic interests.

Rhythm Venture Capital has held the first close of its new fund, Rhythm Fund X. The venture firm, with offices in New York and Los Angeles, provides seed and Series A investments in the digital health, health-care services, biotech and life sciences sectors. The amount wasn't disclosed.

New Money

Berkeley Lights Inc., a biotechnology startup that makes devices and software for the development of cell-based therapeutics, has raised $95 million in Series E financing. Japanese electronics company Nikon Corp. led the round. Existing investors including Walden-Riverwood Ventures and Sequoia Capital participated alongside new investors Cota Capital, KTB Network and others. The financing brings Berkeley Lights' total raised to date to $225 million. Read more.

Purplebricks Group PLC has entered into a joint venture with Axel Springer SE to jointly take a 25.9% stake in German online estate agent Homeday, Dow Jones Newswires reported. Purplebricks said the NewCo JV will invest  25.4 million ($29.4 million) in Homeday.

Cyberpsychologist Says Companies Must Rethink Approach to Cyber Defense

By Catherine Stupp

Amid the endless analysis, there's one dimension of cybersecurity that companies overlook: the role of psychology. Cyberpsychologist Mary Aiken looks at the internet in terms of human behavior, taking into account motivation and conduct, and comparing how they differ in the online and physical worlds.

Dr. Aiken, who holds a doctorate in the little-known research field of forensic cyberpsychology, introduced her theories to a broader audience when the TV show "CSI: Cyber" aired in 2015, featuring a character based on her. This was just before the rise of large-scale cyberattacks, such as last year's WannaCry and NotPetya viruses. The show ended in 2016 and Dr. Aiken continues to raise alarm about the unique risks of the internet for incubating dangerous activity.

"Human behavior mutates online, driven by the power of anonymity, driven by the online disinhibition effect," she said in a phone interview from Dublin. She is an adjunct associate professor at University College Dublin. The internet can make it easier for people with antisocial tendencies to find one another, facilitating and normalizing aberrant behavior, according to Dr. Aiken.

A leading expert in the psychology of cybercrime, Dr. Aiken has worked with an eclectic mix of clients, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, European police agency Europol, and the cybersecurity-focused private-equity firm Paladin Capital Group.

The FBI declined to comment on its work with Dr. Aiken. Philipp Amann, head of strategy at Europol's cybercrime center, said that Dr. Aiken advised the agency on analyzing factors that draw young people to online crime. "There are a lot of questions that we need to understand when it comes to combating cybercrime that require input from academics like Mary. How do people behave online? How is that different from their normal behavior?"

Internet brings out potentially bad behavior

Companies may use artificial intelligence to monitor suspicious activity, such as attempts to access their systems. But Dr. Aiken says that common AI tools don't analyze human behavior for signals that crime is imminent. And that, she says, is critical to building effective cybersecurity defenses.

It's trickier to pick up on likely hackers before they commit crimes and, failing that, to identify them after they carry out attacks. Dr. Aiken says that's where cyberpsychologists come in. There are international conferences and universities offering degrees in the field, but cyberpsychology hasn't received wide attention outside of academia.

As cyberattacks become more frequent and damaging, Dr. Aiken warns that the biggest threats come from how the internet shapes human psychology, bringing out new patterns of criminal behavior.

Dr. Aiken views the internet as an environment in which users might be more willing to break the law because they feel there is no authority policing them, and it's easy for them to find other people who want to commit crimes, making their own behavior seem common. That applies to employees who might commit cybercrimes as well as outside hackers, she said.

Disgruntled employee or hacker from North Korea?

When Dr. Aiken studies a hacker's motivation, her theories often don't line up with mainstream assessments.

She contends, for example, that an upset employee was most likely behind the 2014 hack of Sony Corp., and that the release of thousands of emails from the studio's then co-chairman Amy Pascal was not the work of a North Korean hacker whom the U.S. government indicted earlier this year. Dr. Aiken said the fact that Ms. Pascal was targeted suggests the attacker was a staff member who sought revenge.

If North Korea had ordered the hack to prevent the studio's release of the movie The Interview, as prosecutors alleged, the attacker would have instead published emails from the film's actors or the director, she said.

"If you looked at who paid a price, Amy Pascal lost her job, that's it. Then you work back," Dr. Aiken said.

"She comes at it from so many different perspectives that we often just completely miss and overlook," said Ralph Echemendia, an entrepreneur based in Estonia who Dr. Aiken advised on the development of a security app, Seguru, that evaluates users' behavior and informs them about cyber risks.

Mr. Echemendia said he drew on Dr. Aiken's understanding of behavioral anomalies in designing the app's algorithm. She also warned him that criminals might use the app to hide their identities online.

"There's no doubt that Mary has been useful in helping us identify and reduce how even Seguru may be used inappropriately," he said.

Profiling employees

Applying psychology to get to the root of a cyber incident is new territory for many business leaders but doing so, she said, could help companies sidestep attackers from outside and inside.

She described categories of employees who may be insider threats, including people who ignore security rules, intentionally sabotage the company or collude with outside criminals.

Corporate security officers looking for sophisticated measures to counter such threats could hire cyberpsychologists to develop tests to monitor employees' online behavior. They could build personality profiles using questionnaires and logs of their workplace internet activity and flag potential motivation to commit crimes, she said.

A tool backed by AI could measure these indicators and determine if they signal feelings of depression, anxiety, anger or guilt, she said.

Traditional threat exercises, in which employees pose as hackers to test their colleagues' reactions to phishing emails and other attacks, fall short, she warned. Employees who only play hackers lack real motives and don't fear being caught, she said.

"What you want is AI systems that are actually designed to model human irrationality," she said. "There isn't anything like that at the moment."

Banks Hire Undercover Researchers to Gather Threat Intelligence

By Jeff Stone

Banks' cybersecurity teams are trying to make more informed decisions about threats with help from researchers who go undercover online to find intelligence on pending attacks or customer information for sale.

These researchers-for-hire can navigate the Dark Web in ways corporate cybersecurity teams can't, often drawing on foreign language skills and backgrounds in the intelligence community. They sometimes pose as cybercriminals, using tactics that corporate security professionals must avoid because of regulatory or reputational concerns, said Anton Chuvakin, an analyst at market researcher Gartner Inc.

"They have expertise in infiltrating forums and have different techniques for getting credibility in those forums," said Jason Witty, chief information security officer at U.S. Bancorp. Most companies wouldn't use such techniques, he said.

U.S. Bancorp, Wells Fargo & Co. and other banks use vendors to gain an insight into attackers' activities, ferreting out information about distributed denial-of-service attacks and new malware.

Corporate security teams integrate this data with threat information from other sources, such as the U.S. government and the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, said Rich Baich, CISO at Wells Fargo.

Some contractors have access to threat information that banks don't and provide it to clients within hours or days, Mr. Witty said.

Potentially crippling attack avoided

U.S. Bancorp several years ago used information discovered by a threat-intelligence company to protect its website from a distributed denial-of-service attack that appeared to be in the planning stages by activist cybercriminals against U.S. financial firms, he said. The vendor provided U.S. Bancorp with technical details, such as which network ports would be targeted. U.S. Bancorp's security team plugged that information into an anti-DDoS security tool within four minutes, blocking the attack as it began, he said.

Typically, the security team would activate defenses after a DDoS attack was underway, he said. With the Dark Web intelligence, the situation played out differently. "We were able to do that before the attack started," he said.

Mr. Witty declined to say when the incident occurred, citing concerns about being targeted again by the same group. He also declined to name the vendor.

Without prior warning of the attack, the DDoS attack could have disrupted U.S. Bancorp's website for up to an hour, he estimated, judging from the amount of traffic the attackers planned to direct at the bank, he said.

Banks must navigate a crowded field of intelligence providers to determine which vendors offer the most relevant information. There are many small providers specializing in specific forums, languages and threats, said Mr. Chuvakin. Companies often use more than one provider, collating the information and deciding how to respond, he said.

Wells Fargo uses more than 50 intelligence sources to inform its security decisions. The group includes Dark Web firms, the FS-ISAC and the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team, said Mr. Baich.

Hiring vendors for such services can help companies overcome a shortage of employees qualified to assess the urgency of emerging threats, he said.

"There are skill shortages, so you have to decide how much of that you want to do," he said. "The more credible intelligence sources we can get, the more refined our analysis."

********************************

Specialized Security Researchers Plumb the Dark Web

Companies can hire security vendors to prowl the Dark Web on their behalf, hunting for breached customer data for sale or illicit activity aimed at specific businesses.

These specialized vendors offer capabilities difficult for corporate cybersecurity groups to build on their own.

For example, among the roughly 200 people on staff at Digital Shadows Ltd., more than 20 languages are spoken, including Russian, Spanish, Portuguese, and various Chinese dialects, said Rick Holland, chief information security officer. Linguistic skills allow these security researchers to infiltrate obscure forums where cybercriminals hang out, he said.

"For large organizations to build up their capabilities to engage with threat actors and understand all their slang takes time," he said. "It might be an investment they don't want to make."

Dossiers help assess threats

Digital Shadows employees interact with cybercriminals and build portfolios about data sellers. The profiles can help a company's security team assess whether a hacker is a true threat, said Mr. Holland.

An extortionist might email a bank threatening to take down its website unless it pays a bitcoin ransom, he said. "It's helpful to have a dossier on their capabilities to see if that person actually can take down a tier-one bank or it's some 18-year-old who doesn't have the skills."

Digital Shadows, with offices in London and San Francisco, counts more than 100 customers in the financial industry, up by 200% in the past three years, he said.

Other Dark Web intelligence includes technical details on the latest malicious software, said Andrei Barysevich, director of advanced collection at vendor Recorded Future Inc. The Somerville, Mass.-based company uses machine learning and natural language processing technologies to analyze traffic and activity at underground forums.

Mr. Barysevich's researchers have infiltrated forums where cybercriminals hire spammers to distribute new forms of ransomware, he said. Researchers pose as criminal hackers, asking forum members to vouch for them, he said.

"We then get the ransomware sample and take it apart and share the relevant indicators with our clients," he said. This could include the malicious code in a strain of ransomware and details such as how hackers launched an attack, he said.

"The same way police use undercover agents and connections in the underworld, we do the same with hackers," he said.

More Cyber News

Facebook lowers breach estimate to 30 million. Facebook Inc. said fewer users than it initially thought were impacted by hackers in the largest-ever security breach at the social-media giant two weeks ago, the Journal reports. The company in a blog post Friday cut its estimate from 50 million users affected to 30 million. Attackers accessed location data, relationship status, religious beliefs and some search history on 14 million of the affected 30 million users, the company said.

FDA warns of medical device vulnerabilities. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Oct. 11 issued an advisory about equipment from medical technology company Medtronic PLC, CyberScoop reported. The programming equipment doctors use to check cardiac devices has software flaws hackers could exploit to adjust the settings on a pacemaker, the FDA said. Medtronic said it has disabled the relevant software and that the equipment will need to be updated manually, according to CyberScoop.

U.K. calculates WannaCry costs. The U.K.'s Department of Health and Social Care in a new report determined the WannaCry ransomware attack last year that infected more than 200,000 machines worldwide cost Britain's National Health Service 92 million ($121 million), according to the Register. The report said it cost 73 million ($96 million) to fix the information technology systems affected by the attack, which the U.S. government blamed on North Korea. About 19 million ($25 million) was lost business due to disrupted NHS services, the report found.

Italy challenges cyber sanctions. The Italian government opposes proposed European Union sanctions to penalize nation-states for launching cyberattacks, according to Reuters. Other EU states support the plan, with diplomats saying it is meant to prevent cyberattacks from Russia, China and North Korea, Reuters said. Italy repeatedly has called for relaxing sanctions against Moscow, according to Reuters.

FIRST REPUBLIC BANK

Loan Growth

Proves Strong

First Republic Bank's third-quarter loan growth is a positive surprise for analysts.

Wedbush Securities says it is "encouraged that very strong loan growth continues to drive solid net interest income growth."

The company reported average loans grew by 4.7% on a linked-quarter basis to $71 billion.

"Within its core home lending franchise, supply constraints and competitors loosening standards remain the biggest headwinds to future loan growth, but [First Republic's] target market continues to expand at a high clip and its industry-leading net promoter score is evidence that it is likely to continue to capture a high level of new clients," Wedbush said.

Companies are on a roll but it remains to be seen whether policymakers have done enough to ensure long-term growth

 We turned crisis into opportunity,  says Francisco Riberas.  We did two big acquisitions of German companies during 2010 and 2011 that almost doubled the company size. We have kept investing during hard times to stay as a reliable supplier. 

Mr Riberas runs Gestamp, a Spanish manufacturer of automotive components with a turnover of  8.2bn in 2017, four-fifths of it from outside the company s domestic market. Since the financial crisis, which hit Spain particularly hard, Gestamp has added two countries to the 19 in which it was already present. It is set to start operations in Japan and, next year in Morocco, and has seven industrial plants under construction worldwide.

Profitability has risen by nearly 44 per cent since 2012, fuelled by buoyant demand from the big carmakers. The company has also diversified its sources of finance away from Spanish banks to the global banking system, the corporate bond market and in 2017 a public listing in Madrid.

Mr Riberas is not the only company boss in Europe feeling positive. The political noise   around the UK s exit from the EU, a populist government in Italy and fears of a global trade war   risks drowning out the fact that the region s businesses are on a roll. There has been a robust recovery from the gruelling crisis in most parts of the EU: gross domestic product rose by 2.3 per cent in the euro area last year; in the EU28 it was 2.4 per cent, its fastest pace this decade. The crisis has left its surviving businesses financially stronger and focused on new growth opportunities.

Questions are being raised, however, over how sustainable this growth is, and what the longer-term prospects are for corporate Europe. With confidence starting to fall, policymakers are being challenged over whether they have done enough to make businesses more resilient and genuinely able to compete with global rivals.

 There is still good positive momentum, and we have made a lot of improvements in Europe, and companies are investing,  says Pierre Gattaz, president of regional lobby group BusinessEurope.  But institutional reform has been slow and much more must be done. 

Last year was exceptional for Europe Inc in terms of growth, profitability and business expectations. After years of flat demand in their home markets, the region s companies were finally able to take advantage of rising consumer spending at home, as well as robust demand abroad.

With record flows of foreign direct investment into Europe, most macroeconomic indicators were back to their pre-crisis levels, or even higher. According to Eurostat, investment rose by 3 per cent during the year, while household consumption was up by 2 per cent.

 In Germany and many other European economies, the economic expansion at home and the pick up in global trade since 2017 are still solid factors. Domestic investment has finally picked up across all of Europe,  says Klaus Gnter Deutsch, head of research at the BDI, Germany s largest business federation.

Although some indicators have slowed in 2018, business confidence is still close to the very high levels it reached last year. And the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate in the euro area was 8.2 per cent in July 2018, the lowest level since November 2008. Overall, economic fundamentals are much stronger than the political disruption would suggest.

 In Europe the alignment of the political narrative and the economy has dislocated,  says Andy Baldwin, managing partner for Europe, Middle East and Africa at EY.

Backed by the European Central Bank s continuing easy money programme and a banking sector which, on the whole, has emerged from the crisis stronger, Europe s businesses, particularly its smaller ones, are feeling bullish. In stark contrast to the years immediately after the financial crisis, there are few complaints from companies that they lack access to funding.

 Non-performing loans have fallen dramatically, balance sheets have been restored and banks are overflowing with liquidity and competing with each other to lend,  says Eric Chaney, an adviser to Institut Montaigne, a Paris think-tank.

The story differs by country, but the overall trend is the same. In Spain, restructuring in the banking sector has helped companies access funding for overseas expansion, particularly in Latin America and the Middle East. Spanish and Portuguese companies are competing fiercely for business outside their domestic economies.

Exports from Germany and Spain continue to grow strongly, while in France, President Emmanuel Macron s reforms, although currently hitting a sticky patch, are shifting the dominant national narrative to one that supports business.  Macron likes business, he likes the entrepreneur,  says Mr Gattaz.  He has made reforms that some of us have been suggesting for 30 years. 

Ireland s economy is booming and, even in Italy, where a populist coalition took power in June and markets have seesawed since, politicians  animus against business is overstated.  The business community has a long history of getting on with it despite what s going on in Rome,  says one Italian business leader.

Meanwhile, the UK s imminent departure from the EU, while damping investor sentiment towards the country, has been a boost to others. Paris, Berlin, Frankfurt, Dublin and Luxembourg are all benefiting from a shift in financial services jobs and increased investment.

To be clear, corporate optimism is not flourishing despite the financial woes of a decade ago, but because of them. Europe s economic crisis, which peaked in 2013 with one in 10 people of working age in the EU28 unemployed and record levels of bankruptcies, was enormously painful. The companies that survived did so by becoming leaner and more efficient, often turning their gaze beyond the single market.

This was especially true in Spain, where companies also had to move away from their cosy financing arrangements with regional banks, the cajas, to a more professionalised and demanding relationship with lenders. Construction companies are a good example. Flattened by the crisis, many have been making inroads not just into the rest of Europe but further afield in Latin America and the Middle East.

Although Germany was insulated from the worst effects of the crisis   and consequently, some argue, failed to reform its banking sector as much as it needed   its Mittelstand companies have also focused their efforts on expansion outside Europe.

Emco is typical of this trend. A family-owned company founded just after the second world war which employs 1,350 people and has its biggest operations in Lingen, north-west Germany, it makes bathroom fittings, construction and air-conditioning technology. It had a record turnover of  160m last year. Christian Gnass, its chief executive, says domestic revenues now account for less than two-thirds of the total.

 The financial crisis was a signal to us to broaden our customer base and make sure not to depend on one single market and one single product,  says Mr Gnass, whose company has expanded into Turkey and other countries while building a new research and development centre at home.

Mr Baldwin at EY says Emco s story is being replicated across Europe.  There is a real sense that middle-market businesses in Europe have finally shaken off the last of the effects of the financial crisis,  he says.  They have strengthened their balance sheets, are embracing new opportunities presented by digitisation and recognise the central role of innovation and purpose in driving growth and attracting talent. 

A recent survey by EY of 642 executives at businesses with annual revenues of  1bn- 3bn found that nearly half are expecting to increase revenues by between 6 and 10 per cent in the year from September, while a quarter were anticipating growth of more than 11 per cent. A fifth of executives in the 12 European economies surveyed said entry to new markets and mergers and acquisitions are the top growth priorities.

Dealmaking, much of it cross-border, has been buoyant. With nearly $785bn in announced deals during the first half of 2018, European M&A increased by 97 per cent compared with the same period in 2017, according to Refinitiv (formerly Thomson Reuters).

Colm Donlon, head of mergers and acquisitions for Morgan Stanley in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, says a series of factors have converged to feed the record pace of activity, including a focus on consolidation in corporate Europe and a targeted return to dealmaking in the region by Chinese and Japanese companies.

The ability to expand outside the single market has been a key driver of corporate recovery in Europe.  Cross-border activity within the single market, whether exporting or deals, makes you very comfortable to then export outside the EU,  says Mr Baldwin.

Despite the evidence of strong corporate activity, concern is rising that growth is at risk from developments both inside and outside the EU that have hit business confidence. The prospect of a global trade war in the wake of US president Donald Trump s imposition of tariffs on China, the unstable coalition in Italy, oil price rises and Brexit are all putting a damper on investment.

 There is still good positive momentum, but we have to be careful because of geopolitics,  says Mr Gattaz.  Trust is 50 per cent of business. If you have trust, you invest. 

An additional challenge is the lack of workers with the required skills, particularly in digital sectors. BusinessEurope says labour constraints are at their highest since it began keeping records in 1985. Salaries in the specialist areas most in demand are soaring, with artificial intelligence experts most highly sought after, followed by software engineers and mobile app designers, according to recruitment companies.

 After a very strong 2017, businesses are increasingly concerned that growth is peaking and about to slow down. European companies increasingly see a shortage of skilled labour, which can hinder their expansion plans,  says Emma Marcegaglia, chair of Italian energy group Eni and a former president of BusinessEurope.

Business groups and analysts also warn that policymakers have not taken the opportunity they had after the easing of crisis conditions to put in place policies which both protect business from a future crisis and provide the conditions for sustained long-term growth.

 The EU hasn t fixed the roof while the sun has been shining over the past few years,  says Mr Baldwin.

The BDI s Mr Deutsch describes policy change in Europe in the key areas of innovation, digitisation and higher productivity as  sluggish , with progress on many reforms stalled in the face of national resistance.

The failure to reform capital markets is particularly critical. There were hopes that Europe s companies would diversify their sources of funding away from an over-dependence on bank lending, and that policy changes would help deepen and broaden the continent s capital markets. This has not happened.

Research this year by the think-tank New Financial showed EU capital markets have fallen relative to GDP by 8 per cent in the decade to 2016. US capital markets, meanwhile, are nearly three-times larger on this measure than those in Europe.

 This has been one of the failures of post-crisis reform,  warns Mr Chaney.  The doom loop between government bonds and Europe s banks has not been cut. 

Europe s corporate comeback

The FT examines why corporate Europe is leaner, meaner and fitter following the global financial crisis. The series includes:

Part one

Introduction

Part two

Italy: luxury

Part three

Germany: Mittelstand

Part four

Spain: infrastructure

Part five

France: recruiters

The failure to push critical reforms forward could be exacerbated by next year s change at the top of the EU s executive, with the replacement of Jean-Claude Juncker, whose agenda was focused on jobs and growth, by a European Commission president with different priorities. In addition, national governments will have little fiscal or monetary policy space to stimulate the economy when the cycle eventually turns.

Meanwhile, R&D spending lags behind that of Asia and the US. This, allied to a workforce ill-equipped for the 21st century, may prove a long-term drag on growth that could fuel unemployment and populist trends.

 Populism will sell you a dream for free,  says Mr Gattaz at BusinessEurope,  that there will be more jobs, more purchasing power. Business can provide a concrete dream, a real one. If you have a good economy, you can give more money to the people. This is why we need to explain to people why populism is not the solution and why we have to protect business.

Michael Katchen first tasted investing at age 12 when he won a stockpicking contest. Since then, the 30-year-old Canadian technology entrepreneur who runs Wealthsimple has taken a keen interest in managing his personal portfolio of stocks, mutual funds and exchange traded funds.

He recognises, however, that for his generation this is a niche hobby.

Mr Katchen worked at 1000memories   a website that let people organise, share and discover old photos   when it was sold to Ancestry.com in 2012. He and his co-workers made money from the deal and several asked Mr Katchen how to invest it. He realised the need for a service to introduce millennials   people in their 20s and 30s   to investing.

 Traditionally unless you had a lot of money, you couldn t get access to great financial tools and advice,  he says.  This meant that a lot of people, younger people in particular, were largely ignored by the financial services industry. 

Mr Katchen is one of several entrepreneurs trying to create an industry by solving a big asset management problem: how to attract young investors.

Many new services employ the technology that millennials use as second nature   smartphone apps and chatbots powered by artificial intelligence   and they are intended to create a savings habit.

They have attracted millions of users. While initial investments made by younger people are small compared with older savers, the start-ups  growth trajectory and the economic power of millennials is posing a significant threat to the traditional sales strategies of large asset managers.

 These tools had been dismissed by some asset managers based on the belief that once the investor has  real  money they will seek out a full-service relationship, so existing distribution arrangements will come back into play,  says Gabriel Altbach, founder of Asset Management Insights, an investment industry consultancy.

 That assumption underestimates both the comfort that digital natives have with technology as well as how far the tech has advanced and will continue to do so. 

One feature used by several fintech companies to encourage millennials to save is  round-ups . These round up the payments that users make and put the difference into an investment or savings product. For example, when a user buys a cup of coffee for 2.20, an additional 80p is automatically deposited into their investment portfolio, taking their total outlay to 3.

So often are cups of coffee used to illustrate this mechanism that one provider, Moneybox of the UK, uses the image to market its app. Charlie Mortimer, co-founder of Moneybox, says younger consumers have mostly been ignored by traditional financial institutions, but round-ups ease them into investing regularly.

 A whole generation was growing up without the tools and information they need to build their financial future,  says Mr Mortimer.  Wealth managers tend to help people with wealth to manage, while banks try to sell products like mortgages but don t help young people build up their deposits. Younger people often feel alienated. 

He says:  Our research shows that round-ups resonate with younger people. It s a good way to break that inertia. 

Moneybox has more than 125,000 investors on its platform, who typically put away 1,000 a year each. The average age is 31. The app offers three products: a Vanguard global equities fund, a Janus Henderson money market fund and an iShares global property equity fund, which charge 0.22 per cent to 0.24 per cent. Moneybox has a 0.45 per cent platform fee plus a 1-a-month subscription after three months.

Mr Mortimer says the focus has been on finding cheap options with low tracking error, meaning they closely follow their benchmark index. He says Moneybox is reassessing its investment options and expects to offer cheaper funds in the coming weeks, as well as providing an ethical product.

Ben Stanway, Mr Mortimer s co-founder, began his career at Fidelity International, while Daniel Godfrey, who ruffled industry feathers when he was chief executive of the Investment Association, is a non-executive director.

Mr Mortimer insists they did not set out to disrupt traditional players. Instead, Moneybox is helping big managers access the younger investors that they struggled to attract.

 The people we are bringing to the market would probably have eventually started investing, but not for another 10-15 years,  he says.

Mr Katchen, who launched Wealthsimple in 2014, says big money managers should view start-ups such as his as a complementary service, not a threat.  Eighty-five per cent of our clients are under 45   that s the inverse of traditional asset managers,  he says.  We are growing the pie, attracting new consumers to investing and extending the market. 

Wealthsimple has 100,000 users in Canada, the US and the UK, investing C$3bn (1.74bn). It assigns an investment portfolio to each user based on their risk appetite, goals and values, including socially responsible investing options.

A collection of index funds and ETFs underline the portfolios, with 12 from BlackRock, three from UBS, two from Vanguard and one each from Amundi, Lyxor, Pimco and Legal & General Investment Management. They charge between 0.14 per cent and 0.32 per cent, while users also pay a platform fee of 0.5-0.7 per cent to Wealthsimple.

A handful of financial advisers are on hand to take calls from Wealthsimple s users, 40 per cent of whom are first-time investors.

Wealthsimple is backed by Power Financial, a Canadian investment company that has so far provided $165m of capital. Mr Katchen expects his company to grow rapidly as millennials inherit family wealth in coming decades.  They will not take that money to traditional players. They will go to the platforms they are comfortable using, that charge for investments in the way they are used to,  he says.

One of Wealthsimple s fastest-growing client groups is parents of millennials. They sign up after hearing from their children who have compared fees for similar products from traditional providers.

Two other financial planning services that are popular with millennials are entering the investment market. Plum, a robo-adviser tool that works over Facebook s Messenger service, rolled out six investment funds to its 200,000 users last month. Revolut, which has more than 2.6m users across Europe, plans to offer exchange traded funds soon.

As with Moneybox and Wealthsimple, Plum has chosen funds by Vanguard, the $5.2tn US investment manager that has built its reputation on the value of its low-cost products. Vanguard also sells its products through several other similar services, including Nutmeg, Scalable Capital, MoneyFarm, MunnyPot and ETFmatic.

Vanguard does not say how much of its business comes via app channels as the start-ups are often hesitant to make their data public. The information is not shared with Vanguard.

 It is flattering that other digital platforms choose to use Vanguard funds,  says Neil Cowell, Vanguard s head of retail sales in the UK. He says start-ups typically approach Vanguard when they are in the early stage of development and not yet on its radar.

He would not be drawn on whether he views the services as direct rivals or competitors with the company s other sales channels.

 We know that millennial investors are attracted to a digital sales process so it s good there is a choice available to them,  he adds.  We are seeing both adviser firms and apps adapting their propositions to cater to this growing demand for a paperless option. 

The success of some fintech start-ups has given rise to speculation that the established financial services providers will rush to buy them. Indeed, Goldman Sachs  acquired Clarity Money in April. Some traditional wealth managers have launched their own products.

Mr Altbach, a former executive at Pioneer and Amundi, does not expect fund companies to move into this market. 

Most asset managers, apart from mega-players like BlackRock, Vanguard and Fidelity, can t begin to contemplate building their own solution, given the costs and uncertain prospects,  he says.

 Even if they did, there s the issue of biting the hand that feeds them, as it could be seen as [competition] to their core distribution partners. 

Mr Katchen expects to see acquisitions but denies he is looking for a buyer.  We will see consolidation and we hope to be one of the consolidators,  he says.  We would love to partner with more firms like BlackRock but there is no need for us to be acquired to do that. 

Raiz is an investment app that has proved popular in Australia, where more than 1 per cent of the population has accounts. In the 30 months since its launch, it has attracted more than 375,000 users, with a third of them making regular investments. More than 90 per cent of users are under age 40.

The service, which charges A$1.25 a month (0.65) to users with less than A$5,000 and 0.275 per cent for those with more, offers six investment portfolios based on nine ETFs from State Street, BlackRock, Russell and BetaShares. These have fund charges of 0.07-0.4 per cent.

 A lot of the traditional fund managers haven t really noticed us because we have gone after clients they have not bothered to go after before,  says George Lucas, chief executive of Raiz, which is about to launch in Malaysia and Indonesia.

 One day they will wake up and wish they had spent more time trying to win these clients.

Business
In China, a Dot-Com Dj-Vu; Welcome to the land of 'unicorns' and super-cheap meals. The rewards are rich, as are valuations. And the risks are rising. How it will play out depends upon whom you ask.

Corrections & Amplifications

China's 109 unicorns are worth $535 billion in total. An earlier version of the story and its accompanying graphics incorrectly cited the value as $557 billion. (Oct. 15)

We've seen it before: the crazy spending, the stratospheric valuations. Twenty years later, it looks like the dot-com boom all over again, but this time the players are much bigger and Chinese.

A Beijing-based startup that lets consumers order coffee via smartphones raced into so-called unicorn territory a $1 billion valuation in seven months from launch. The value of another firm, billed as an "Uber for trucks," has soared to 300 times 2017 revenue; Uber Technologies Inc. itself is worth only about 10 times revenue.

But where some investors see dynamic exuberance, others see a market increasingly threatened by a confluence of forces including onerous domestic regulations and global trade tensions. The biggest risk? Another dot-com reckoning, the Chinese version of a cycle that erased billions of dollars of value from America's tech sector in the 2000s and chilled tech investment for years.

There are already signs of such a shake-out as China's publicly traded tech companies were buffeted this past week by a global tech-stock selloff and jitters from the escalating trade spat between Beijing and Washington. While the broad Shanghai Composite was down 7.6% this past week, the tech-heavy Shenzhen market lost 10.1%.

Also, Washington recently accused Beijing of tech-related spying and raised concerns about human-rights violations. Potential U.S. sanctions against Chinese tech companies could result in the disappearance of a major market for their products.

Between government pressure at home, tensions with the U.S. abroad and stock-price falls, China's internet giants, which support a good deal of the country's tech growth, "now somewhat suddenly find themselves between a rock and a hard place," says Paul Triolo, a technology analyst at think tank Eurasia Group. "These problems are only going to get worse."

For now, the boom times continue in the startup arena. Not only are China's 109 unicorns worth more than the 127 U.S. billion-dollar-plus startups $535 billion in total compared with $478 billion but they also became unicorns considerably faster than their U.S. peers, data from Dow Jones VentureSource shows.

Sequoia Capital, among Silicon Valley's most prestigious venture-capital firms, may for the first time invest the bulk of its newest global fund, up to 60%, in China, people familiar with the fund say. That fund is expected to be $8 billion, Sequoia's biggest ever.

For the first time, Chinese startups are getting more money than their U.S. counterparts $71 billion versus $70 billion so far this year, VentureSource data shows. The pace, with investment volume 18 times what it was five years ago, hasn't been seen since the 2000 tech-stock bubble, feeding the perception that China is on its way to overtake Silicon Valley as the world's tech hub.

But the threats to Chinese tech dominance are mounting as Beijing has grown wary of the clout of private tech firms and many of the biggest players burn through cash in punishing price wars with hardly a hint of when they might become profitable.

Outlays on discounts to gain market share can pay off big in a market as large as China's. But there can be a hangover even for winners: Consumers treated to freebies tend to peel away when subsidies end.

There could be global reverberations as around 45% of the investment in Chinese startups this year came from outside China. Some investors have already gotten burned.

For a glimpse of the potential pain, consider Chinese bike-share companies. Only last year, they couldn't spend fast enough. After putting millions of cycles in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities, several looked to conquer metropolitan areas in the U.S. and Europe.

Now, cash-flow problems are setting in. Mobike recently sold itself for nearly $1 billion less than it was valued after its last funding round, people familiar with the matter say. Ofo is reversing course on its international expansion and the No. 3 bike-sharing company, Bluegogo, collapsed late last year.

Another wild card is the regulatory environment in Beijing. The advances of Chinese tech giants were long a point of a national pride. And while China's leaders still encourage innovation, they have tightened the grip on many of the country's biggest players, including Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. even shutting down or blocking products they don't like.

In June, China's official People's Daily newspaper warned investors against a rush of capital into tech startups that could turn investing into a "gamble." Smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. had to scale back ambitious listing plans, eventually going public in July at a valuation of $54 billion, about half of what it initially hoped.

Still, money keeps flowing in. In September, Chinese investment firm Hillhouse Capital Group unveiled a new $10.6 billion fund the largest-ever capital raise by a private-equity firm in Asia, topping a $9.3 billion fund set up by KKR & Co. last year. The fund was "heavily oversubscribed," it said.

Days earlier, food-delivery giant Meituan Dianping, which has lost at least $8.5 billion since 2015, went public in Hong Kong at a market capitalization of around $53 billion.

One company that has seen its valuation skyrocket is Manbang Group, the truck-hailing firm whose apps let Chinese truckers contract with shippers for cargo.

The company approached investors this year looking for around $300 million in funding. By April, so many had expressed interest that Manbang raised nearly $2 billion, added plans for a fleet of electric-powered, self-driving trucks, and was valued at around $6 billion.

Manbang has more than six million users and has deployed around 3,000 young staffers across China to sign up more.

One recent Sunday, two of those marketers hit up a dusty parking lot on the outskirts of Beijing, offering baskets with shampoo and toothpaste to get truckers to download the apps. Truckers say they see teams every day.

"I'm almost bothered to death by you guys," one driver said.

But most of Manbang's users aren't paying. It has gotten around 200,000 shippers to fork over around $250 a year in membership fees and is aiming to break even next year, said a person familiar with the matter. But it isn't yet charging truckers, and many are already complaining that the apps are pushing down shipping prices.

Recently, Manbang has started looking for an additional $1 billion at a valuation of $10 billion. This time investors are skeptical, people familiar with its plans say. Manbang didn't respond to requests for comment.

Other major startups are slugging it out with as many as a hundred or more competitors. Some are going to extremes.

Every day during the height of China's bike-share frenzy last year, says Ben Cavender, an analyst at China Market Research Group in Shanghai, workers from Ofo would rearrange bikes near his office so they completely surrounded those of rival Mobike. Ofo says it has never instructed its bike marshals to block competitors' bikes.

Luckin Coffee, the startup that surpassed $1 billion in value seven months after launching in January, has been spending furiously to open 2,000-plus outlets and subsidize giveaways like half-priced snacks. As Starbucks Corp. responds with its own delivery service, Luckin is again raising funds.

Its co-founder said Luckin is still losing money, but the market potential is great.

Then there are companies like Didi Chuxing, which raised about $24 billion over the past six years in large part to help it defeat rivals. Even after coming out on top in a battle with Uber two years ago, it has yet to turn a profit. It now finds itself fighting a fresh batch of competitors, including Meituan, which expanded into ride-hailing last year.

In March, Meituan started offering short rides in Shanghai for less than a U.S. cent, resulting in a surge in users taking cars for distances they'd normally walk. Didi responded with its own subsidies.

Stephen Zhu, Didi's chief strategy officer, says competition in China is fiercer, partly because its markets are less developed. In the U.S., services like ride-hailing are "more like dessert," he says, while in China, where car ownership is still relatively low, "it's your main course."

Lately, Didi has moved into food delivery the main source of revenue for Meituan, as well as for Ele.me, a company Alibaba bought in May.

In April, Didi flooded streets in the central Chinese city of Wuxi with scooter-riding delivery staff, offering them monthly salaries and bonuses sometimes more than double Wuxi's average wage, and gave restaurants bonuses for filling orders on its app.

It also subsidized meals, including a one-time coupon for 25 yuan ($3.67) to anyone ordering on its app. Meituan and Ele.me fired back with their own big discounts. Delighted diners posted screenshots of meal receipts on social media.

"It's a pity you're not in Wuxi, hahahahahaha," wrote one user on China's Twitter counterpart Weibo, attaching a screenshot of an order via Meituan for fried chicken, orange juice and milk tea that after discounts cost 0.01 yuan about a 10th of a U.S. cent.

Song Yunyi, the boss of a box-lunch kitchen called Mr. Bento, says Meituan marketing staff warned him not to work with Didi. After he listed on Didi anyway, he says, Meituan's app started describing his shop as closed. Other restaurateurs have complained to Wuxi's government Meituan blocked them on its app after they listed with Didi. Meituan declined to comment.

After the government ordered the companies to stop the craziness, things calmed down for a while.

Since then, Didi has pushed food-delivery services into at least three more cities, and is plowing funds into bike-sharing and automated driving. It lost more than $580 million in the first half of this year.

Didi is looking for more money and next year "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-ride-hailing-giant-hits-accelerator-on-talks-for-potential-ipo-1524553831" at a valuation of as much as $80 billion, people familiar with Didi's plans say.

Meanwhile, Meituan is pushing into bike-sharing and grocery delivery. "You need to jump-start the market" with spending on inducements sometimes, says Chief Executive Wang Xing.

Ele.me's parent, Alibaba, is merging the company with an affiliate and has raised $3 billion for the combined business at a possible valuation of $25 billion, partly from investors like Japan's SoftBank Group Corp. This summer, Ele.me spent $440 million the bulk of its previous quarter's revenue on discounts and other enticements.

"At the start, yes, you are virtually treating consumers to free meals," says Wang Lei, chief executive of Ele.me. But, he says, at some point, spending "often will get more logical." When? "It's really hard to say."

Backers of China's tech boom say the risks are worth it.

"For many outsiders, they think Chinese companies are raising money too fast, and the valuations are very high," says Richard Peng, a former executive at Tencent whose fund, Genesis Capital, invested in the latest round of Manbang Group, the truck-hailing firm compared to Uber.

"But No. 1: The potential is huge. And No. 2: The Chinese companies' growth is much faster than their peers out of China."

The gold standard is Alibaba, whose 2014 initial public offering was the biggest in history, making a mint for investors like U.S. venture-capital firm GGV Capital. When GGV invested in Alibaba in 2003, it was valued at around $180 million, says managing partner Hans Tung. Since then, Alibaba's value has increased more than 2,000-fold.

"Alibaba was expensive in every single round," he says. "But it's become a half-trillion-dollar company and it'll get to a trillion very soon."

Alibaba said its e-commerce business continues to charge ahead with sales up 61% in the latest quarter, despite worries about a Chinese economic slowdown. But the company warned its profit will be pressured by continued heavy spending on new businesses.

There is now so much money chasing companies that it's sometimes becoming hard to justify valuations by traditional measures. Some startups are calculating potential revenue from markets that haven't yet developed, bankers say.

A dearth of investment options in China's still-restricted financial markets likely channels money to startups that in a more open economy may have had other destinations.

And Beijing's recent actions to tighten control over champions like Alibaba and Tencent show that tech companies' business prospects can change quickly, depending on how their technology aligns with broader government ambitions, whether in leading the world in cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence or in building a web of digital surveillance at home. Tencent's social-messaging app WeChat, for example, has been used to police speech and monitor crowds.

Analysts estimate that Tencent lost $1.5 billion in sales in the second quarter after regulators delayed approvals of some of its videogames. Before that, authorities forced Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial to sideline a potentially lucrative credit-scoring business in favor of a government-backed system.

Bytedance Ltd., a $30 billion unicorn backed by Sequoia Capital and others, has recently found itself in regulators' crosshairs. Authorities ordered the demise of its joke app Neihan Duanzi over what they said was too much vulgarity and temporarily removed Bytedance's best-known product news aggregator Jinri Toutiao, with 120 million daily users from app stores because it didn't like the content.

Nonetheless, Bytedance "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-startup-woos-softbank-at-75-billion-valuation-1538128269" to raise $3 billion from investors like Japan's SoftBank and U.S. private-equity firm KKR at a valuation of as much as $75 billion, people familiar with the matter say, which would rank it above both Uber and Chinese ride-hailing powerhouse Didi Chuxing Technology Co. as one of the world's most valuable tech firms.

Health leaders: don't wait for the patient to pay

Healthcare Advances in treatment will be lost without changes to funding, says Andrew Jack

From the rich and ageing population of Tokyo to the youthful poor of New Delhi, a cry is going up: provide universal health coverage to ensure broader medical support for people around the world.

Much of the potential benefit of advances in treatments in recent years, as well as of technological revolutions under way in areas from drugs to big data, will be lost without changes in the way healthcare is funded. Many see healthcare coverage for all   free at the point of care to patients   as pivotal.

Without sufficient funding, new and often expensive therapies cannot be purchased, and existing resources are stretched by an ageing population with ever more chronic conditions.

Without a system to ensure access to medical services for all, those without the ability to pay will be excluded, creating inequity that sparks social and political tensions.

That is not just the view of officials or doctors. "You can't make healthcare transactional and wait for the patient to pay," says Frans van Houten, chief executive of Philips, the Dutch group that has restructured itself as a healthcare business spanning diagnostics to data.

"It's essential to build primary and secondary care."

In richer countries such as the UK, there are debates about overall levels of funding, and the scope for preferential access for the small minority of the population that have private health insurance in addition to the universally available National Health Service.

More fundamentally in many poorer countries, patients are often excluded from the system entirely or condemned to limited second-class care because they are required to pay "out of pocket" which soon extends beyond their means. Lower-cost sub-standard care with inappropriate medicines, or patients unable to afford a complete course of treatment, often reduces productivity and creates a wider cross-border health threat to others: drug resistance.

A study last year estimated that at least half the world's population still lacks access to essential health services. Some 800m people spend more than 10 per cent of their household budget on healthcare, and almost 100m are pushed into extreme poverty each year by out-of-pocket health expenses.

The report's two institutional backers reflected growing international focus on universal health coverage, the World Bank, led by Jim Yong Kim, a former health specialist, has made the sector (alongside education) a top priority for economic and social development.

The World Health Organisation, is headed by Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, a former Ethiopian health minister elected director-general in 2017.

Both men have pressed the economic case for universal coverage not just with health ministers but national finance ministers who hold the purse strings.

The Japanese government, notably through its ministry of foreign affairs, has strongly supported efforts to focus leaders' attention on health coverage.

But the greatest revolution is taking place within countries, with politicians increasingly accepting the case for universal health coverage. Some models for universal coverage have long existed in middle income countries like Thailand.

Others, such as Kenya with its new health financing strategy unveiled late last year, are following suit. Narendra Modi, India's prime minister, this year pledged moves towards what some have dubbed "Modicare".

Critics point out that coverage will be largely for more specialist secondary and tertiary care; they warn too that its implementation mainly by a private medical sector could lead to spiralling costs. Yet a number of India's regional administrations, including Delhi itself with its Mohalla clinics for basic community care since 2015, have moved still further ahead.

"It's partly a function of affluence," says Rob Yates from the Centre on Global Health Security at the think-tank Chatham House in London. "As countries get richer, they spend more on health. Universal health coverage is like a country growing up   citizens recognise that the country is at an income level where people should not die in the streets."

He argues that there is still too much divisive debate about "angels on a pinhead"when the principles of universal health coverage are clear.

On service delivery, many are agnostic on the role of state compared with private sector provision.

But on funding, whether through tax or social financing, Mr Yates makes the case for a public mechanism to cover an entire population so the wealthier subsidise the poor, and the healthy the sick. Others disagree, notably in the US, where President Trump pledged to unwind even the incremental benefits of Obamacare, even though he was ultimately unable to follow through on this pledge.

Yet even in the US, politicians in a number of states   such as Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant-governor of California   are calling for a single-payer system in which the state, rather than multiple insurers, fund healthcare. The debate is far from over.

'As countries get richer, universal health coverage is like a country growing up'

Financial services Group is making a name for itself as a turnround and tech specialist

Abu Dhabi Financial Group was launched in January 2011 as the Middle East became consumed by the events of the Arab spring.

So the group, founded by wealthy Gulf investors, shifted tack from its original intention of becoming a growth-oriented private equity fund into a more opportunistic vehicle.

"It made us focus on special situations," says chief executive Jassim Alseddiqi. "ADFG made its niche being opportunistic."

ADFG presents itself as agnostic on sectors and geographies. It has so far focused on financial services and real estate, though it also has investments in energy and education.

Over the past seven years, the group has grown and says it now manages $20bn in assets. It has become a prominent investor in distressed firms and a developer of prime property in central London.

ADFG says its home market of the UAE, as well as large regional economies such as Egypt and Saudi Arabia, will form the bulk of its future expansion.

"There are more opportunities in the region, so we will go heavy on the region, and from here we will go outside," Mr Alseddiqi says.

The group has also jumped on the technology bandwagon, developing solutions via its platform Algorythma and start-up incubator Krypto Labs that it can sell on or roll out through its portfolio.

"Tech for us is very important to see how it can affect the conventional sectors we are investing in and how we can go for a quantum leap," he says.

Without input from artificial intelligence and big data, sectors such as property and financial services will fail to secure strong growth over the next decade, Mr Alseddiqi predicts.

As well as accelerating companies locally, ADFG branched out into Silicon Valley through the acquisition of a major stake in venture capitalist firm 500 Startups.

One of its most prominent initiatives has been the $400m Goldilocks fund, which seeks to deliver returns by working with boards and management to execute turnround strategies.

The activist fund has delivered a 188 per cent return since its formation in 2015, outperforming its benchmarks with the market capitalisation of its portfolio companies up $2bn during the period, says Mr Alseddiqi.

Shuaa Capital and GFH Financial Group have received significant investments from the Abu Dhabi group as it seeks to build a regional investment banking platform.

The lesson learnt, says Mr Alseddiqi is that "businesses can be turned around and investors can be compensated".

He adds: "It is possible to turn around businesses. It is happening."

Given the group's emerging reputation as a distressed asset and turnround specialist, it is perhaps unsurprising that ADFG has emerged as a bidder for Abraaj's regional funds as liquidators break up the Dubai-based emerging markets specialist.

"It is disappointing, what has happened with Abraaj, because it casts a shadow on the industry," says Mr Alseddiqi. "But no one is immune."

How To Thrive in Early Retirement; The rare Americans who happily quit working before 50 rely on a mix of frugal living, smart financial planning and the occasional relocation

When Tom Thoms's family food distribution company was sold, it was in economic terms, a "liquidity event." In personal terms, it was a crossroads: The 40-year-old chief executive of the firm suddenly had the money and freedom to retire early.

Today, Mr. Thoms, 56, spends several months a year at the roughly 5,400-square-foot, stone, glass and steel contemporary home he built with his brother in Peninsula Papagayo, Costa Rica. The house sits on a 1,400-acre master plan development overlooking the Pacific Ocean that also houses a Four Seasons resort and a golf club. Since retiring, Mr. Thoms, who lives the rest of the year in Rock Island, Ill., lost 50 pounds, became an avid runner, hiker and bicyclist, and got deeply into nonprofit work.

Early retirees like Mr. Thoms are the rarest of Americans: Fewer than a million Americans retire by the age of 50, said Ken Dychtwald, the founder of Age Wage, an Emeryville, Calif., think tank on aging. The median retirement savings per household headed by someone aged 50 to 55 is just $11,000, according to the Economic Policy Institute, making an early departure from the workforce all but unthinkable for most people.

But while it is unusual to retire early, it has definitely become popular to fantasize about it: A blog called Mr. Money Mustache, by a Colorado-based ex-engineer who retired at 30, attracted nearly 2.5 million page views in the past month, according to Google Analytics data, and has inspired dozens of similar blogs and books. There are now online communities and physical retreats for people in a community called FIRE an acronym for "financial independence, retire early."

For the few who find a way to pull it off, the journey from hard-charging careerist to early retiree raises questions about finances, identity and where to make a home.

Here's a look at how several early retirees figured it all out.

Out of Office

The former chief executive of a beer distribution company his parents started, Carlos de la Cruz, Jr., sold the firm at the age of 45. Then he turned his attention to nonprofit work and nature.

"I think today, the greatest luxury of all is nature," said Mr. de la Cruz, Jr., now 55, who next month will become chairman the Everglades Foundation, which works on restoring Florida's tropical wetlands.

In 2014, he bought a $1.6 million home on Brays Island Plantation, a 5,500-acre, hunting, golf and boating community in the South Carolina Low Country, about an hour's drive from both Charleston and Savannah. Mr. de la Cruz, Jr., and his wife Claudia expanded the five-bedroom house, adding two bedrooms.

The couple, who both work on a number of charitable causes, lives in Key Biscayne, Fla. and spends about a week a month on Brays, where Mr. de la Cruz Jr.., bicycles, boats and shoots skeet, he said. The community combines a sense of being in the wilderness with services like an office from which he can print and notarize documents, he said.

In the past year, six homes about the size of the de la Cruzes have sold on Brays for between $1.95 million and $2.15 million, said Hank Gulbrandsen, vice president of real estate for the community, which charges roughly $28,000 in annual dues and assessments.

About 25% of Brays owners are in their 50s or younger, and roughly a third of those are retired from their primary career, said Mr. Gulbrandsen. In the South "many young people aspire to own a farm or a plantation, but simply don't have the time or inclination to manage it themselves," he said.

Outdoor activities, fitness and games have replaced golf in the hearts and minds of most retirees, according to a 2018 study by John Burns Real Estate Consulting, which surveyed 24,000 new home shoppers. Only about 10% of all retirees wanted a golf course home; 73% wanted walking trails, 29% craved bike paths and bocce and pickle ball were in high demand. Early retirees also wanted tennis courts and workout courses.

Do the Math

Lynn Frair, a 40-year-old nurse in Bothell, Wash., gave notice at the end of August. Her husband Carl, 45, retired two years ago from his job as a school-district cook. Ms. Frair said she has diligently saved about 60% of her family's after-tax income since 2008, and invested that money into low-cost index funds. After she retires in January, the couple may dabble in work, Ms. Frair said, but they don't need to.

A big part of the plan depends on the 2,460-square-foot house they bought in Bothell in 2012 for $382,000, which keeps their cost of living low.

Ms. Frair sees herself as "part of the financial independence community." She attended Camp Mustache, a four-day retreat over Memorial Day weekend outside Seattle for fans of the Mr. Money Mustache blog. She also listens to a podcast by ChooseFI.

A successful financial independence blogger, 41-year-old Sam Dogen retired from investment banking at 34. Throughout his brief career, he saved 50% to 80% of his after-tax income, he said, enabling him to build a portfolio of income-producing stocks, bonds and real estate. His wife also retired young, at 34, from a career in fund administration.

Mr. Dogen bought a family home in San Francisco for $1.24 million, and a condo near Lake Tahoe for $718,000, which he both uses and rents out. Mr. Dogen's blog, Financial Samurai, which provides details on how he finances his early retirement, has become a big moneymaker though advertising: "It surpasses what I used to earn in banking," he said.

Stay Home

Early retirees are more likely to stay close to where they have lived than older retirees, according to the John Burns study: 43% said they planned to buy in their same ZIP Code, compared with 29% of older retirees. Early retirees are more likely to have children, which is why they often remain in the same area, said consultant Mikaela Sharp.

Lynn Friar (see "Do the Math") can relate. She could sell the family home for big gains and play "geographic arbitrage," a popular concept in FIRE circles in which the nest egg is stretched in another state or foreign country with a low cost of living. However, "we've cultivated a life we love," with great neighbors and a strong public school system for their 3- and 5-year-old daughters.

Mr. Dogen, now a decade into his retirement from investment banking, is also thinking about community. When his toddler son hits preschool age, he plans to move from San Francisco to where his parents live.

Fortunately for Mr. Dogen, the family plan shouldn't dampen the fun he's having too much: His parents live in Honolulu.

Redefining Self

After the sale of his company, Mr. Thoms's first thought was, "I'm only 40. I'm too young to retire," he said. So he took a job as the chief executive of a robotics company.

Although his career was fulfilling in some ways, "I didn't relish all the pressure," and after two years, he left that role. For a while, he hedged when people asked him what he did, telling them he was "selectively employable." After a few years, he accepted and admitted that he was retired, he said.

Identity can take a hard knock in retirement. In a 2013 Age Wave survey of nearly 1,500 retirees over the age of 45, 34% said they miss "social connections," more than they missed reliable income and health insurance. Replacing work with other meaningful activities, including volunteer work and cherished hobbies, can be key to making a successful transition, said Mr. Dychtwald.

Today, Mr. Thoms said he spends "80% of my day" raising money for a child-abuse organization, a group that supports teen girls and a local community foundation. In 2011, he and his brother competed the design and building of their Costa Rica house, which Lisa Farrell, an agent with Re/Max Los Tres Amigos said would likely sell for about $4 million today.

They take turns using the house for visits and vacations; when they are not using the house, the brothers rent it out for a $2,500 a night off-season and $6,000 in peak season.

Leif Dahleen, a 42-year-old anesthesiologist in Brainerd, Minn., plans to retire by August. Though it took 12 years of higher learning to enter his profession, he didn't build his identity on it, he said. Once he became aware that he was in a financial position to retire, he realized the job carried significant stress.

Instead, he plans to base a new life on family, adventure and travel. Two months ago, he bought 7 acres on Grand Lake in Michigan for $170,000, and is planning to spend about $350,000 building a 2,400-square-foot house. When he moves with his wife and two young sons, they may home-school the children and spend time traveling in Central and South America as well as Asia.

"I could end up with $10 million if I kept working for 20 years," said Dr. Dahleen. "But I haven't built my ego around that."

How to End the Rat Race

A growing number of "financial independence" gurus and blogs, including Mr. Money Mustache, Mr. Dogen's Financial Samurai and Dr. Dahleen's blog Physician on FIRE, promote the idea that anyone can retire if they have a small enough budget and a big enough nest egg. Though the advice varies in the details, these are the broad strokes that fire the FIRE movement.

STEP 1: Reduce living expenses to a bare minimum.

STEP 2: Save all income not required for basic living.

STEP 3: Invest in a portfolio that will grow at a yearly average of at least 7%.

STEP 4: Once savings is equal to at least 25 times annual expenses, retirement is an option.

STEP 5: Pull no more than 4% annually from the portfolio, indexing the first year figure for inflation each year.

Rob Williams, vice president of financial planning at Charles Schwab, sees the approach as generally sound. The longer the retirement, however, the lower the withdrawal rate should be, and as with any investing, there are risks, he cautioned.

The model assumes annual living expenses won't rise beyond inflation, and it is possible to generate consistent returns averaging at least 7% annually.

SEC Chair Jay Clayton Says Quarterly Reporting Won't Change  Anytime Soon'; President Trump asked regulators to study move to semiannual reports for companies

WASHINGTON In the near term, public companies won't get a break from quarterly earnings reporting, an idea that President Trump "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-directs-sec-to-study-six-month-reporting-for-public-companies-1534507058".

The Securities and Exchange Commission may weigh the idea of moving to six-month reporting for smaller firms, but "I don't think quarterly reporting is going to change for our top names anytime soon," SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said Thursday.

In August, Mr. Trump asked regulators to review the decades-old requirement that public companies release earnings quarterly, a change some executives support to promote longer-term planning. But some investors worry such a move could reduce transparency into corporate performance.

Mr. Trump had said the change would help ease regulatory costs and spur growth. He said the idea came from a prominent chief executive: PepsiCo Inc.'s Indra Nooyi. She raised the issue at a dinner Mr. Trump held with 13 corporate executives at the president's golf course in Bedminster, N.J., in the context of improving growth, people familiar with the matter said at the time.

The White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Federal securities rules have required quarterly reporting since 1970, when the SEC mandated it as part of a formalization of stock-exchange practices that preceded the agency's creation in 1934.

Speaking at an event in Washington, Mr. Clayton said quarterly earnings aren't "the sole driving factor" of some companies' short-term focus.

"It's not just a question of whether we require quarterly reporting or not," Mr. Clayton said at the Bipartisan Policy Center. "What does the market expect?"

The SEC chairman told reporters after the event that many investors seem satisfied with quarterly reporting and that less frequent disclosure could be jarring.

Mr. Clayton added, though, that Mr. Trump's tweet raised a valid concern. "The president did touch on a nerve, which is are people running their companies too much for the short term in response to pressures?"

"We've been hearing that for a while," he said.

He added that in some countries where public companies don't have to report earnings every three months, the firms still provide that information.

The SEC chairman told the conference there "may be" a class of smaller public firms for which it would make sense to back away from quarterly disclosure. For firms valued under $1 billion, providing less frequent disclosure could work if shareholders don't overwhelmingly want or need quarterly information, Mr. Clayton added.

"I'm not going to move in any quick direction, but it's a good question," he said.

A person familiar with the regulator's plans said in August that the SEC would issue a document seeking input on how to promote a long-term focus among public companies and investors. Two months later, the report still hasn't been made public.

Since Mr. Trump made his request, Mr. Clayton has further indicated his own faith in the system that governs financial reporting for public companies.

Speaking in September on a panel that discussed steps to reduce the risk of financial fraud, Mr. Clayton said audited financial statements are the best tool "in terms of separating the speculative from the less speculative." Mr. Clayton at the time didn't comment on the frequency of disclosure.

Also last month, the SEC announced enforcement penalties against five public companies that failed to have an auditor review their quarterly financial results. The SEC said it was the first time it had punished public companies for this reason. The SEC didn't allege that the companies misstated results.

The five companies paid penalties ranging from $25,000 to $75,000.

Some accounting experts say less frequent reporting could have the opposite effect from what some CEOs hope.

Instead of giving companies a reprieve from quarterly expectations, the move could make it harder for firms to meet the earnings guidance they give shareholders, said Brad Mroski, a director at advisory firm AlixPartners LLP who was formerly an assistant chief accountant in the SEC's enforcement division.

"You could make the argument there is more incentive to manage earnings because it's harder to hit that" farther-out target, Mr. Mroski said.

Lawrence Summers, a former Treasury Secretary under Democratic administrations, wrote recently that less frequent reporting would favor professional investors, who benefit from meetings with management, over retail shareholders. "In an age of big data and transparency, moving towards less would be a very odd step," Mr. Summers wrote.

Greenbriar Equity Group, a midmarket private-equity firm focused on logistics and transportation, has acquired vehicle intelligence provider Spireon Inc. from fellow private-equity firm Bertram Capital Management.

Spireon, of Irvine, Calif., produces software and technology using artificial intelligence that cater to fleet managers, car dealership franchises, auto lenders and other logistics companies.

Its products include FleetLocate, which helps logistics companies track and monitor their fleets; Goldstar, a GPS technology for used-car dealers and auto lenders; and Kahu, a technology that helps car dealerships manage their lots and their customers track and monitor their vehicles.

During the first half of 2018, the company reported a 65% increase in device shipments to franchise auto dealers, a 36% increase in revenue from its trailer segment, and a 45% increase in device shipments to the small-and-medium business fleet market, according to a press release announcing the deal.

Bertram originally formed location-based services company ProconGPS Inc., in 2011 before changing the company's name to Spireon in 2012. During Bertram's ownership, the company completed a strategic add-on deal in 2015 with the acquisition of GPS recovery software provider Inilex.

The sale of its stake in the company marks Bertram's fifth exit so far in 2018, according to a press release issued by the firm.

Although Greenbriar didn't disclose terms of the deal, the firm typically invests $75 million to $150 million of equity in companies with anywhere from $100 million to $1 billion or more in enterprise value, according to the firm's website. The New York-based firm is pitching its fourth fund, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/greenbriar-raises-608-million-so-far-for-latest-transportation-fund-1539200086", according to regulatory filings.

Bertram Capital, of San Mateo, Calif., closed Bertram Growth Capital III LP and Bertram Growth Capital III-A LP in February "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bertram-raises-500-million-for-fund-iii-1518717513?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=11"of capital commitments.

The Take: Retailer Brand Names Remain Winners in Bankruptcy

By Lillian Rizzo

Brick-and-mortar stores may be closing at near-record rates, but the brand names behind retailers are still very much alive.

Last week two retailer brand names Brookstone Inc. and Toys "R" Us Inc. got renewed leases on life. The news comes as nearly 3,840 stores were closed in the first half of 2018, according to data from consulting and advisory firm BDO USA LLP. BDO said in a recent report that it expects retail store closures to continue at a fast pace.

The saga of Brookstone's sale came to an end last week, with the specialty retailer's brand garnering a premium. Bluestar Alliance LLC and Apex Digital Inc. walked away with a winning joint bid from an auction that spanned about five days. Read Rizzo's Take.

Edison Partners Closes Largest Fund Yet

Edison Partners has closed its ninth and largest-ever fund to invest in financial-technology, health-care technology and enterprise-software companies, the growth-equity firm announced Thursday.

The vehicle, Edison Partners IX LP, collected $365 million, exceeding its $300 million target as well as the hard cap, the firm said. The sum also surpassed the $276 million collected by the predecessor fund, which closed in 2016.

Edison Partners launched fundraising for the ninth fund about a year ago, WSJ Pro Private Equity "https://www.wsj.com/articles/edison-partners-seeks-300-million-for-ninth-fund-1509018300?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=4&mod=article_inline". Limited partners that back Fund IX include the New Mexico Educational Retirement Board, Rutgers University, Hirtle Callaghan & Co., American Family Insurance Group and Renaissance Venture Capital Fund, the firm says.

Founded in 1986, Edison Partners backs companies with $10 million to $20 million in revenue and annual revenue growth rates of 30% to 50%, said Managing Partner Chris Sugden, who leads the Princeton, N.J., firm. It usually invests about $10 million at a time, and makes about 75% of its investments in Series A rounds, with the remainder in Series B rounds.

For the new fund, Edison deliberately kept the fund size in line with its previous vehicles, despite the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/technology-fundraising-haul-shows-no-letup-1538080098?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=2" for growth-equity and technology funds, said Mr. Sugden.

"It's the right size for the company's capital formation strategy and the value-add that we wanted to have for each deal," he said.

Edison Partners finished investing its eighth fund a couple months ago, backing Bento Technologies Inc., which does business as Bento for Business and makes payment cards for companies to manage employee expenses. The firm has made four deals from the new fund, including marketing platform "https://www.wsj.com/articles/edison-partners-leads-funding-round-for-sigstr-1537270200?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=5" and employee-survey-technology company "https://www.wsj.com/articles/coopers-take-looking-to-indiana-for-software-deals-1537484484?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=3".

Several of these recent investments have been located in the Midwest, which is not an accident, Mr. Sugden said. "Underserved markets" areas outside of the main venture-investing hubs "are a really important part of our investment thesis," he said. "I think the Southeast and the Midwest are really big bastions of talent."

Edison Partners intends to commit the new fund in the same sector proportions as previous vehicles, with roughly 40% in fintech, 40% in enterprise software and 20% in health-care information technology, said Mr. Sugden. Within fintech, the firm has made numerous investments around the theme of the "democratization of financial services," and expects to do more, he said. Within software, Mr. Sugden sees promise in the Internet of Things, machine-learning and artificial-intelligence subsectors, and the firm recently added partners with experience in those areas.

Edison Partners also has been building out its team alongside the fundraising, and has recently added five new partners with operating experience, bringing the total number of partners to 12, Mr. Sugden said.

Banking & Finance: Storm Threatens Large Investors

Pension funds, endowments, wealthy families and other large investors could be on the hook for a portion of damages caused by Hurricane Michael, which intensified Wednesday.

The exposure for these large investors stems from their ownership in catastrophe bonds, which are issued by insurers or entities seeking insurance. The investors receive interest payments but can lose their principal if certain disasters occur.

About $15.7 billion in outstanding catastrophe bonds have potential exposure to Florida, where Michael made landfall, according to reinsurance broker Aon Securities.

In addition to cat bonds, some of these investors also have exposure to hurricane risk through other types of insurance-linked securities.

Analytics firm CoreLogic estimated Wednesday that Michael would cause $2 billion to $4.5 billion in wind and storm surge damage. The majority of the estimated loss is residential, CoreLogic said.

The insurance industry is less on edge ahead of Michael than it was in September 2017, when Hurricane Irma looked like it could make landfall near Miami. Irma ended up turning up Florida's west coast.

"If you have a large category storm bearing down [near Miami], there's going to be a lot more exposure than if you have something that goes into a less populated or less dense part of the state," said Paul Schultz, chief executive of Aon Securities.

Large investors have piled into cat bonds in recent years as they sought diversification and higher returns. The risk to bondholders is they can lose their principal if certain events occur, like hurricane winds above a certain speed or damages that exceed a certain dollar threshold.

There are now nearly $30 billion of these securities outstanding, up from roughly $26 billion a year ago, according to Aon.

Insurance companies typically cover losses up to a certain amount, then use reinsurance or securities such as cat bonds to help cover losses above that amount. That means many cat bonds that include exposure to Florida wouldn't be triggered unless the storm causes significant damage.

Many property insurers in Florida rely heavily on reinsurance and in part on cat bonds to manage their risk.

Almost $1 billion in cat bonds and insurance-linked securities is exclusively exposed to Florida catastrophe risk, according to data provider Artemis.

Following large losses from hurricanes in 2004 and 2005, many large home insurers shrank their presence in the Florida market. Florida's home-insurance market is now dominated by small to midsize carriers.

The biggest home insurers by market share in Florida are Universal Insurance Holdings Inc., State Farm and Tower Hill Group, according to ratings firm A.M. Best.

Insurers have historically focused on the wind damage caused by hurricanes, as standard home-insurance policies don't cover flood damage. Homeowners in flood-prone areas are typically required or encouraged to purchase separate flood insurance from the federal government.

But some insurers and investors are more exposed to flood damage than in the past, as the U.S. government's flood-insurance program has purchased reinsurance since last year and issued its first cat bond this year.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency's cat bond would cover up to $500 million of the National Flood Insurance Program's losses for a single event, but only if those losses exceed $5 billion. The NFIP paid nearly $10 billion in claims following hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in 2017.

Former Bain, DFJ Investors Form New Team at Point72 Ventures; The pair will co-lead a new focus area for the firm

Two former investors at DFJ Growth and Bain Capital Ventures have left to co-lead a team at Point72 Ventures, the venture arm of Steven A. Cohen's Point72 Asset Management.

David Dubick, a former principal at DFJ Growth, and Noah Carr, a former principal at Bain Capital Ventures, will co-lead Point72's enterprise investing, focusing on infrastructure, cybersecurity and applications.

Before DFJ, Mr. Dubick worked at Lightspeed. He worked on investments including Handshake, Velo3D Inc., Anjuna Security Inc., Planet Labs Inc., Cylance Inc. and Docker Inc. He earlier worked in engineering and product management at Palantir Technologies Inc. and Lookout Inc.

Mr. Carr while at Bain Capital Ventures worked on investments including DocuSign Inc., Evident.io Inc., Awake, LeapYear, ShieldX Networks Inc., Attivo Networks Inc. and BetterCloud Inc. He earlier worked in Deutsche Bank's technology investment-banking group.

Point72 Ventures has two existing focus areas: fintech and artificial intelligence related to enterprise automation. Investments have included Quantopian Inc., inVia Robotics Inc. and Acorns Advisers LLC. The new enterprise team will form its third area.

Point72 Ventures, unlike Point72, is funded exclusively by Mr. Cohen. The firm was started a little over two years ago to invest in early-stage deals. The firm, which has done about 40 deals, doesn't have a traditional fund but can lead Series A or B deals.

"Given the capital we have overall, we can see companies through their entire life cycle," said Matthew Granade, managing partner of Point72 Ventures. "We're not constrained by the lifetime of a fund or the size of a fund."

The firm's venture team benefits from its public-market investors and vice versa, Mr. Granade said, such as autonomous-vehicle technology and how it relates to large auto companies. "The quality of conversations across our two groups are very powerful," he said.

Mr. Carr and Mr. Dubick, who are based in the San Francisco Bay Area, will focus on cloud-native infrastructure, data-focused startups, cybersecurity and "infrastructure for the future," including the internet of things, space, genetics and infrastructure for autonomous vehicles, Mr. Dubick said.

Point72 Ventures provides resources to support founders and knows enterprise technology as a buyer, Mr. Dubick said. "You pair that with the reach of Point72, and we're one of the largest buyers of enterprise tech," he said.

Rock star of French finance struggles for a hit

Carmignac needs all his charisma to engineer a turnround as investors pull out of funds following a prolonged weak run

In January Edouard Carmignac hosted one of his legendary annual concerts in Paris. The fund manager's clients, friends and employees enjoyed a private performance by Eric Clapton.

The rock star departed straight after the show, leaving a pile of unsigned CDs. But that did not matter   Mr Carmignac gladly stepped in and began signing copies himself as slightly bemused members of the audience looked on. Resourceful, self-assured and loving the limelight, Mr Carmignac has positioned himself as a rock star of French finance. However, the billionaire may need all his charisma to keep his clients after a long period of underperformance and a 10 per cent fall in assets under management to  50bn.

Carmignac's founder and chief investment officer has built it into one of Europe's largest independent fund management houses over three decades. His silver mane and slim figure honed on the polo field belie his 71 years of age.

Mr Carmignac is bombastic about his investing prowess. "I could be Warren Buffett's son," he told the Financial Times a few years ago. The invitations to his "Licence to thrill" party this summer were sent with a postage stamp emblazoned with Mr Carmignac's portrait on the envelope. A rival asset manager in Paris says: "He was the first to think about investing globally and selling funds all over Europe. He had a real vision."

Yet these are testing times for Mr Carmignac. Last month, the firm said he was stepping back from overseeing Carmignac Investissement, a  4bn international equities fund that he has run since its inception three decades ago. He is also ceasing to manage the equities portion of the group's largest fund, Carmignac Patrimoine, which invests in bonds, equities and currencies, and has  17.8bn under management.

The changes follow a long period of underperformance in which both funds have lagged behind their respective benchmarks over one month, three months, one year, three years, five years and 10 years, and are in the bottom quartile of peer performance in each of these time periods, according to the firm's website. Patrimoine is down 4.8 per cent so far this year, against a 3.5 per cent gain in its benchmark.

Mr Carmignac admits performance has been "disappointing" and explains that it is broadly because of three reasons: the anomalous behaviour of financial markets, adverse currency moves, and being slow to expand the investment team.

He is speaking from the firm's opulent offices in Paris's Place Vendme, opposite the Ritz Hotel. The Andy Warhol portraits of Lenin and Mao that once hung above his desk are on loan to his new modern art foundation on Porquerolles, a tiny island off Provence. His family foundation also supports the  50,000 Carmignac Photojournalism Award to investigate human rights violations.

"We've been trying to protect the value of our holdings over the past five years maybe too aggressively," says Mr Carmignac. "The behaviour of financial markets since 2012 has been a massive anomaly, especially in Europe. Investors have been encouraged by central banks to take ever greater risks and ignore the real economy. Rightly or wrongly, Carmignac Patrimoine took no real advantage of this flaw."

Mr Carmignac believes that as central banks withdraw quantitative easing the fundamental analysis that is the backbone of active management will be able to thrive again and "will put us back where we used to be".

He denies he has been losing money from "trading" foreign exchange but says that managing currency exposure is an important part of risk management. In 2017 the fund was hurt by the rapid rise in value of the euro, which depressed the value of the non-eurozone investments that make up twothirds of both Patrimoine and Investissement's investments.

Carmignac's relatively expensive fee structure may make it harder to retain assets at a time when active fund management is under pressure from lowcost passive funds. In response to the EU's new Mifid II rules on investor protection, Carmignac has decided to pass on its research costs to clients rather than absorbing them itself. Its funds also charge clients a commission de mouvement, essentially a small commission every time securities are bought and sold.

Mr Carmignac believes he has been "too slow in expanding the investment team" because it is hard to find the right people. He is seeking to redress that and recently hired Raphael Gallardo from Ostrum Asset Management as chief economist. David Older, head of equities, has taken over the management of Carmignac Investissement from the eponymous founder. Mr Carmignac says his role "will be that of risk manager, focusing on getting the large directional calls right".

The Frenchman admires President Emmanuel Macron for helping change the attitude towards business in the country. "I think it's very important that the animal spirits come back on the entrepreneurial side," he says. "As a Frenchman it's very invigorating when you travel abroad to see that France's image has improved."

At times, Mr Carmignac appears bored by the minutiae of risk management and fund performance, preferring instead the bigger picture. He is vague when asked about the size of the flagship Patrimoine fund, saying: "As Charles Saatchi used to say, I'm not a bean counter, so I don't check the assets under management on a daily basis". As to whether the firm made money on its investment in Altice, the telecoms and cable group that lost half of its value last year, he says: "I'd be surprised if we didn't make money on it."

The management changes at Carmignac and its founder's age invite questions about succession. Mr Carmignac likens his role as chief investment officer to that of the conductor of an orchestra. So what does he think about the future of the business? "You mean what happens after douard Carmignac vanishes one day?" he asks with a laugh.

"I have always had real admiration for what the Johnson family had done at Fidelity [Investments], so that's pretty much what I had in mind," he says. Fidelity, the $2.4tn asset manager, has remained independent and is now run by the third generation of the founding Johnson family.

Of Mr Carmignac's five children, only one, Maxime, works for the family fund management business. She has run its London office since 2013 after an "OK but not outstanding" period as fund manager, says her father. His daughter is a potential successor but "she will have to prove her colours", he says.

Shorter term there is the challenge of rebuilding its performance. Mr Carmignac is hoping for a downturn like the one that helped the group boom a decade ago. "It's a question of when rather than if," he says.

"When the markets turn around I think if we manage to negotiate that downturn properly we will again make a difference and people will accept the fact of having gone through less exciting times for a number of years."

douard Carmignac made his name by taking a contrarian bet in 2008 after identifying the fragility of the US banking sector and positioning his fund defensively, allowing it to avoid losses when markets crashed and its benchmark index lost 12 percentage points.

Clients were impressed. Assets poured in, largely from individual investors that Carmignac has targeted through a network of private banks and independent financial advisers. Overall, about 80 per cent of Carmignac's assets under management are from Europe, notably Italy and France.

The firm is now positioned with a high exposure to shares, mainly in the US. A majority of equity investments are in the technology sector   areas such as digital consumption, artificial intelligence and big data   and the firm is adding exposure to the healthcare and consumer goods sectors. It is also upbeat about the prospects for Chinese internet stocks in ecommerce and social networks.

In fixed income markets, Carmignac is playing on the divergence of monetary policy between the US and the European Central Bank.

Universal health care: don t wait for the patient to pay

Advances in treatment will be lost without changes to funding

From the rich and ageing population of Tokyo to the youthful poor of New Delhi, a cry is going up: provide universal health coverage to ensure broader medical support for people around the world.

Much of the potential benefit of advances in treatments in recent years, as well as of technological revolutions under way in areas from drugs to big data, will be lost without changes in the way healthcare is funded. Many see healthcare coverage for all   free at the point of care to patients   as pivotal.

Without sufficient funding, new and often expensive therapies cannot be purchased, and existing resources are stretched by an ageing population with ever more chronic conditions.

Without a system to ensure access to medical services for all, those without the ability to pay will be excluded, creating inequity that sparks social and political tensions.

That is not just the view of officials or doctors.  You can t make healthcare transactional and wait for the patient to pay,  says Frans van Houten, chief executive of Philips, the Dutch group that has restructured itself as a healthcare business spanning diagnostics to data.  It s essential to build primary and secondary care. 

In richer countries such as the UK, there are debates about overall levels of funding, and the scope for preferential access for the small minority of the population that have private health insurance in addition to the universally available National Health Service.

More fundamentally in many poorer countries, patients are often excluded from the system entirely or condemned to limited second-class care because they are required to pay  out of pocket  which soon extends beyond their means. Lower-cost sub-standard care with inappropriate medicines, or patients unable to afford a complete course of treatment, often reduces productivity and creates a wider cross-border health threat to others: drug resistance.

A study last year estimated that at least half the world s population still lacks access to essential health services. Some 800m people spend more than 10 per cent of their household budget on healthcare, and almost 100m are pushed into extreme poverty each year by out-of-pocket health expenses.

The report s two institutional backers reflected growing international focus on universal health coverage, the World Bank, led by Jim Yong Kim, a former health specialist, has made the sector (alongside education) a top priority for economic and social development.

The World Health Organisation, is headed by Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, a former Ethiopian health minister elected director-general in 2017.

Both men have pressed the economic case for universal coverage not just with health ministers but national finance ministers who hold the purse strings.

The Japanese government, notably through its ministry of foreign affairs, has strongly supported efforts to focus leaders  attention on health coverage.

But the greatest revolution is taking place within countries, with politicians increasingly accepting the case for universal health coverage. Some models for universal coverage have long existed in middle-income countries like Thailand.

Others, such as Kenya with its new health financing strategy unveiled late last year, are following suit. Narendra Modi, India s prime minister, this year pledged moves towards what some have dubbed  Modicare .

Critics point out that coverage will be largely for more specialist secondary and tertiary care; they warn too that its implementation mainly by a private medical sector could lead to spiralling costs. Yet a number of India s regional administrations, including Delhi itself with its Mohalla clinics for basic community care since 2015, have moved still further ahead.

 It s partly a function of affluence,  says Rob Yates from the Centre on Global Health Security at the think-tank Chatham House in London.  As countries get richer, they spend more on health. Universal health coverage is like a country growing up   citizens recognise that the country is at an income level where people should not die in the streets. 

He argues that there is still too much divisive debate about  angels on a pinhead  when the principles of universal health coverage are clear.

On service delivery, many are agnostic on the role of state compared with private sector provision.

But on funding, whether through tax or social financing, Mr Yates makes the case for a public mechanism to cover an entire population so the wealthier subsidise the poor, and the healthy the sick.

Others disagree, notably in the US, where President Trump pledged to unwind even the incremental benefits of Obamacare, even though he was ultimately unable to follow through on this pledge.

Yet even in the US, politicians in a number of states   such as Gavin Newsom, the lieutenant-governor of California   are calling for a single-payer system in which the state, rather than multiple insurers, fund healthcare. The debate is far from over.

Treasury Spells Out New Rules on Foreign Deals Involving U.S. Technology; Regulations provide first window into Trump administration's interpretation of new Cfius law targeting Chinese investment

Treasury officials Wednesday issued new rules requiring all foreign investors in certain deals involving critical U.S. technology to submit to national-security reviews or face fines as high as the value of their proposed transactions.

The new regulations, which implement a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/congress-to-step-up-curbs-on-chinese-deals-with-sweeping-changes-to-u-s-foreign-investment-reviews-1532025093", are more expansive than some had advocated and are likely to bring an unprecedented number of transactions into the purview of the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/beyond-broadcom-u-s-scrutiny-frustrates-other-foreign-deals-1520377639", known as Cfius.

The Treasury-led interagency committee will now require foreign investors to alert it to all deals giving them access to critical technology across 27 industries including semiconductors, telecommunications and defense that the committee believes could threaten U.S. national security and technological superiority, according to Cfius officials.

Previously, Cfius focused more narrowly on deals where foreigners took controlling stakes in U.S. businesses, and filing for reviews was optional. Investors were historically incentivized to file and seek Cfius approval because, if they didn't, the committee might choose to review their deal anyway and recommend the president block or unwind it, creating substantial risk.

In recent years, however, lawmakers and officials came to believe that many deals involving important U.S. technology were flying under the committee's radar, creating national-security risks. They have been particularly concerned about a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/treasury-to-use-national-security-laws-to-shield-u-s-tech-from-china-1522244695".

A February 2017 report by the Defense Department's Defense Innovation Unit, which was influential in the crafting of the Cfius measure, mapped out various ways Chinese investors participate in U.S. technology deals in the valley, including through investments made by Chinese venture-capital and private-equity firms and by Chinese tech giants Baidu Inc., Tencent Holdings Ltd., Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.com Inc.

The new rules expand Cfius's mandate to noncontrolling U.S. business investments giving foreigners access to material nonpublic technical information, membership or observer rights on the company's board of directors, or any involvement -other than through the voting of shares in making major decisions for that business regarding critical technology, Treasury officials said. "Critical technology" refers to items on U.S. export controls lists, which are also being updated.

"This significantly changes the importance of Cfius for foreign investors because it is now a mandatory process for a broad swath of technological acquisitions," said Nova Daly, an adviser at law firm Wiley Rein LLP and a former Treasury official who once ran the Cfius process.

The new rules mean that a range of foreign investors who made early-stage investments in areas such as artificial intelligence and autonomous driving in Silicon Valley without having to file for Cfius reviews could be required to do so for such deals in the future, said Ivan Schlager, who runs the national-security practice at law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP.

In August, President Trump signed the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/congressional-committees-set-to-advance-major-bill-to-curb-chinese-deals-1526571592" as part of a broader annual defense-authorization bill. Led by Sen. John Cornyn (R., Texas) and Rep. Robert Pittenger (R., N.C.), the Cfius initiative received broad, bipartisan support, but some businesses and free marketeers in Congress worked to keep the measure's scope as narrow as possible because they worried it could unnecessarily stifle foreign investment, which the U.S. has long welcomed as a source of economic growth and jobs.

Lawyers representing deal makers before Cfius have said that, while the measure's passage represented a sharply different approach to foreign investment, the true scope of the new rules and how they would practically affect businesses would be revealed only in the lengthy regulation-writing process left to the executive branch.

For example, the legislation specified that investors would now also be required to file abbreviated notices for reviews of noncontrolling investments if the deals were backed by foreign governments and involved critical technology, but it left the committee discretion to determine what other types of transactions deal makers would have to submit for Cfius review, according to an initial assessment of the measure by law firm Covington & Burling LLP.

The new, temporary regulations take effect in a month and will be superseded by permanent regulations some 15 months later. Under the new regime, even nongovernment-backed foreign investors involved in such technology deals would have to file.

And the pilot regulations don't specify "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-blocks-china-backed-fund-from-buying-u-s-chip-maker-lattice-1505335670" for review, as House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) and ranking member Maxine Waters (D., Calif.,), whose committee has jurisdiction over Cfius, had asked in a September letter to the Treasury that sought favorable treatment for allies.

Typical venture-capital and private-equity funds led by U.S. general partners will be exempt from filing for Cfius reviews as long as any foreign limited partners don't gain access to material nonpublic technical information or the powers enumerated under the pilot program, the new regulations indicate.

New Firm Base10 Taps Into Value of Diversity to Invest Debut Fund; Firm has invested in transportation, logistics and real estate.

There's a new venture firm in San Francisco, and it's off to the races with $137 million to invest.

Base10 Partners was started by serial entrepreneur and former angel investor Adeyemi "Ade" Ajao as well as TJ Nahigian, who also has substantial investing and startup experience.

Notable in size for any first-time fund, what distinguishes the firm further is that Mr. Ajao, an investor with Afro-European roots, is part of a growing movement of investors from under-represented backgrounds now leading venture firms with significant funding.

Base10 Partners

Founders The firm was launched last year by managing partners Adeyemi "Ade" Ajao and TJ Nahigian to invest in technologies that are automating processes in sectors such as transportation, real estate and logistics.

Select Portfolio Companies Pill Club, a subscription-based online contraceptive marketplace; mortgage lender Ethos Lending LLC; and RoadSync Inc., the maker of a payment app for logistics businesses.

Deal Size The firm's investments have ranged from $500,000 to $5 million.

Mr. Ajao, 36, had an entrepreneurial track record that he could use to market the fund to limited partners, which include university endowments, large family offices, foundations and funds of funds.

He rose to prominence in his native Spain, where he cofounded and sold local Facebook Inc. competitor Tuenti to Telefnica SA for $100 million.

He later co-founded human-resources startup Identified Inc., which sold to Workday Inc. Mr. Ajao wound up leading Workday's venture investment arm. He also incubated Cabify, a competitor to Uber Technologies Inc. in Spain.

Mr. Nahigian co-founded Jobr Inc. and sold the company to Monster Worldwide Inc. He previously was an investor at Coatue Management and Accel.

Base10 started investing last year, when it first began raising its fund. The firm has been writing $500,000 to $5 million checks for early-stage companies, particularly in categories such as transportation, logistics and real estate.

Mr. Ajao said he hopes to earn a reputation as one of the hardest-working early-stage venture capitalists. He also believes his ethnic background can be an edge to seize mass-market opportunities since his social circle isn't limited to an elite group.

Being both Spanish and Nigerian is "an absolute competitive advantage," Mr. Ajao said. It "allows you to spot trends that you otherwise wouldn't see."

Base10's "focus is in the real economy in sectors that are large and often unsexy," he added. "Those are problems that affect 99% of people."

Lo Toney, a black limited partner in Base10 through his firm Plexo Capital, called Mr. Ajao "representative of the next generation of the funds that are going to be the household names as they pass the baton to a new generation of managers."

Brendan Wallace, co-founder and managing partner at Fifth Wall Ventures, worked with Mr. Ajao as a co-founder at Identified. He said his former colleague "has an incredible mind for A.I. and machine learning."

Just a few short years ago, there were few black co-founders at venture firms. But Mr. Ajao is now one of at least a dozen of them.

Earlier this year, Connecticut-based New Voices Fund, cofounded by Richelieu Dennis, announced $100 million to invest in startups. Unlike Base10, which plans to invest in founders of all backgrounds, New Voices explicitly backs entrepreneurs who are women of color.

Other sizable funds with founders from under-represented groups include Ulu Ventures, which has a $66 million fund and was co-founded by Miriam Rivera, who is of Puerto Rican descent. There is also 645 Ventures, which recently closed a $40 million fund and was co-founded by Aaron Holiday and Nnamdi Okike.

BlackRock and Its CEO Are Making A Private Equity Bet; The asset-management giant is pledging to invest up to $400 million of client money with Gallatin Point Capital

BlackRock Inc. and Chief Executive Laurence Fink agreed to invest with private-equity firm Gallatin Point Capital, part of a push by the world's largest asset manager to become bigger in alternative investments.

The fund giant pledged to invest up to $400 million of client money alongside Gallatin's investments, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Fink is also investing some of his own personal money with a fund maintained by the Greenwich, Conn.-based private-equity firm, founded in 2017 by former BlackRock alternative-investment chief Matt Botein and former U.S. Treasury official Lee Sachs.

The commitment gives BlackRock a new foothold in privately held companies, one of the few corners of Wall Street not currently dominated by the giant investment firm.

It also illustrates the pull of private capital markets, which have "https://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-roster-of-public-companies-is-shrinking-before-our-eyes-1483545879" by some measures to become the more popular way for companies to raise money in the U.S.

The growth of the private markets is fueled by companies eager to raise money without the regulatory burdens of going public and by investors looking for new ways to score large payouts outside of the stock and bond market. It is transforming how companies grow and cutting off a huge swath of companies from the reach of mom-and-pop investors.

The $400 million pledge BlackRock made on behalf of clients will comprise about 1/3 of the roughly $1.2 billion raised by Gallatin Point for deals as the private investment firm seeks stakes in lenders, insurers, financial institutions and financial assets such as loan pools. It is unclear how much Mr. Fink personally invested.

BlackRock is now a major player in everything from stock and bond trading to software that helps financial institutions assess their risks. It is also one of the biggest beneficiaries of a decadelong investor shift to cheaper funds that mimic stock and bond indexes, giving it a total of $6.3 trillion in assets as of June 30. Roughly two-thirds of those assets are in index funds or exchange-traded funds based on indexes.

Its push into alternative investments is an effort to bulk up on products where BlackRock can charge higher fees, lock in investor capital over a period of years and promise pension funds, endowments and other clients higher returns. BlackRock is also trying to raise money it can use to buy and hold direct stakes in companies.

These holdings   which include private equity and infrastructure   amounted to over $100 billion as of June. That is roughly 2% of the investments BlackRock managed as of that date, but the holdings reeled in roughly 10% of the company's fee revenues during 2017.

Mr. Botein was in charge of that business while at BlackRock. He started with the firm in 2009 and launched a group that made illiquid, or infrequently traded, investments. One of his first tasks when he became head of the firm's alternative assets group in 2010 was to knit together disparate groups BlackRock had amassed from acquisitions of companies like Barclays Global Investors and Merrill Lynch Investment Managers.

He stepped down last year to launch Gallatin Point with Mr. Sachs, a former top aide to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner who was in charge of a team that responded to the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Sachs has also worked as chief executive of Alliance Partners, an asset manager for financial institutions that attracted a BlackRock investment in 2011.

BlackRock and Mr. Botein are maintaining close ties on a number of fronts. BlackRock has the option to get a piece of any deal Gallatin Point makes so long as BlackRock's stake in those businesses are under 24.9%. It can also opt out of any investment. The client money being committed by BlackRock will go into a separately managed pool that will co-invest in Gallatin Point's deals.

BlackRock, which is part owned by Pittsburgh bank PNC Financial Services Group Inc., has avoided going above a 24.9% ownership threshold with any financial services company to stay away from added regulatory burdens.

Gallatin Point has also tapped BlackRock's risk analytics group to evaluate some deals, said the people familiar with the matter. Mr. Botein is also an adviser to some older funds of his past firm.

Some of Gallatin Point's early investments range from a pool of student loans to an insurance firm called Canopius and various financial businesses managed by family conglomerate Hunt Companies. BlackRock participated in these deals, according to the people familiar with the matter.

Startup Studio Atomic Raises $150 Million for Second Fund; Firm says it turned away some $250 million from interested LPs

Atomic Management LLC, a venture firm that exclusively backs companies it develops in-house, has raised $150 million for its second fund.

Founded in 2013 and backed by investors including Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen, the San Francisco firm launched 10 companies out of "https://www.wsj.com/articles/atomic-with-first-fund-looks-to-upend-venture-capital-model-1485174603". It plans to form about 25 startups with the second, said co-founder and Managing Partner Jack Abraham.

At a time when sources of venture capital funding are at all-time-high and there has been a proliferation of new seed funds, Atomic tries to differentiate by testing out company ideas before attempting to build them.

The firm spends about $100,000 building prototypes, then will commit $2 million to $3 million to develop a team and product for the best companies. Successful companies have gone on to raise Series A and B rounds with prominent investors including Khosla Ventures, Peter Thiel's Founders Fund and Felicis Ventures.

Mens' health startup Hims is perhaps Atomic's best-known startup. Officially launched in 2017, Hims quickly gained tens of thousands of customers and millions in revenue, and the company has now raised nearly $100 million. Other companies include co-living marketplace startup Bungalow Living Inc. and Terminal, an online platform for hiring and staffing engineering talent remotely.

The firm's portfolio spans industries including health care, housing, enterprise software and artificial intelligence. The firm has six offices across North America, but all of Atomic's current companies are headquartered in San Francisco and often collaborate with one another. For example, Bungalow leverages the platform of Terminal.

Quick customer and revenue traction for several portfolio companies as well as an exit earlier this year for Atomic's voice analytics startup TalkIQ made raising the second fund relatively painless, said Mr. Abraham. The firm's limited partners include university endowments, sovereign wealth funds, individuals and family offices.

"We turned away about a quarter of a billion dollars from other people who wanted to invest," said Mr. Abraham, who added limited partners were attracted to the 20% to 30% ownership in Atomic companies.

Even with the relative success and popularity with LPs, Atomic hasn't been immune to regular startup woes. In March, Atomic's Wi-Fi marketing startup Zenreach Inc. laid off 20% of its staff and Mr. Abraham stepped aside as chief executive. The company, which was one of Atomic's first to be launched, had raised $80 million to date.

Still, Mr. Abraham believes the Atomic model can de-risk much of the process of building a startup. The prototyping, shared in-house resources and talent enabled the firm to grow companies like Bungalow and secure assets normally only available to later stage companies. The year-old company made its public debut in August with $64 million in financing, of which $50 million was debt.

"Testing allows us to kill off a lot of ideas that could otherwise waste a lot of time and money," said Mr. Abraham, who noted the amount of data, decks and modeling for presentations on Bungalow convinced asset managers on Wall Street the early stage company could handle debt financing.

Tresata Inc. said it has raised a $50 million growth round that valued the analytics software company at $1 billion.

The investment from GCP Capital Partners is Tresata's first outside funding from an institutional investor since its founding in 2011, according to the company.

Based in Charlotte, N.C., Tresata said its AI-powered automation software can help companies address complex data problems, such as anti-money laundering, population health issues and omni-channel marketing.

GCP is the successor to Greenhill Capital Partners, the merchant banking business of Greenhill & Co. The firm makes middle-market private-equity and growth-capital investments from three active funds with $1.4 billion in committed capital.

Rock star of French finance struggles to stay in tune

douard Carmignac needs all his charisma after investors pull out of his funds

In January this year, douard Carmignac hosted one of his legendary annual concerts in Paris. The fund manager s clients, friends and employees enjoyed a private performance by rock star Eric Clapton.

The singer departed straight after the show, leaving a pile of unsigned CDs. But that did not matter   Mr Carmignac gladly stepped in and began signing copies himself as slightly bemused members of the audience looked on.

Resourceful, self-assured and loving the limelight, Mr Carmignac has positioned himself as a rock star of French finance. However, the billionaire may need all his charisma to keep his clients after a long period of underperformance and a 10 per cent fall in assets under management to  50bn in the third quarter.

Carmignac s founder and chief investment officer has built it into one of Europe s largest independent fund management houses over three decades. His silver mane and slim figure honed on the polo field belie his 71 years of age.

Mr Carmignac is bombastic about his investing prowess.  I could be Warren Buffett s son,  he told the FT a few years ago. The invitations to his  Licence to thrill  party this summer were sent with a postage stamp emblazoned with Mr Carmignac s portrait on the envelope. A rival asset manager in Paris says:  He was the first to think about investing globally and selling funds all over Europe. He had a real vision. 

Yet these are testing times for Mr Carmignac. Last month, the firm said he was stepping back from overseeing Carmignac Investissement, a  4bn international equities fund that he has run since its inception three decades ago. He is also stopping managing the equities portion of the group s largest fund, Carmignac Patrimoine, which invests in bonds, equities and currencies, and has  17.8bn under management.

The changes follow a long period of underperformance in which both funds have lagged their respective benchmarks over one month, three months, one year, three years, five years and 10 years, and are in the bottom quartile of peer performance in each of these time periods, according to the firm s website. Patrimoine is down 4.8 per cent so far this year, against a 3.5 per cent gain in its benchmark.

Mr Carmignac admits performance has been  disappointing  and explains that it is broadly because of three reasons: the anomalous behaviour of financial markets, adverse currency moves, and being slow to expand the investment team.

He is speaking from the firm s opulent offices in Paris s Place Vendme, opposite the Ritz Hotel. The giant Andy Warhol portraits of Lenin and Mao that once hung above his desk are on loan to his new modern art foundation on Porquerolles, a tiny island off the coast of Provence. His family foundation also supports the  50,000 Carmignac Photojournalism Award to investigate human rights violations.

 We ve been trying to protect the value of our holdings over the past five years maybe too aggressively,  says Mr Carmignac.  The behaviour of financial markets since 2012 has been a massive anomaly, especially in Europe. Investors have been encouraged by central banks to take ever-greater risks and ignore the real economy. Rightly or wrongly, Carmignac Patrimoine took no real advantage of this flaw. 

Mr Carmignac believes that as central banks withdraw quantitative easing the fundamental analysis that is the backbone of active management will be able to thrive again and  will put us back where we used to be .

He denies he has been losing money from  trading  foreign exchange but says that managing currency exposure is an important part of risk management. In 2017 the fund was hurt by the rapid rise in value of the euro, which depressed the value of the non-eurozone investments that make up two-thirds of both Patrimoine and Investissement s investments. A Paris-based financier says:  Carmignac tries to position itself as an equities house but it s more of a global macro fund. 

Carmignac s relatively expensive fee structure may make it harder to retain assets at a time when active fund management is under pressure from low-cost passive funds. In response to the EU s new Mifid II rules on investor protection, Carmignac has decided to pass on its research costs to clients rather than absorbing them itself. Its funds also charge clients a  commission de mouvement,  essentially a small commission every time securities are bought and sold.

Mr Carmignac believes he has been  too slow in expanding the investment team  because it is hard to find the right people. He is seeking to redress that and recently hired Raphael Gallardo from Ostrum Asset Management as chief economist. David Older, head of equities, has taken over the management of Carmignac Investissement from the eponymous founder, and has been named co-manager of Carmignac Patrimoine. Mr Carmignac says his role  will be that of risk manager, focusing on getting the large directional calls right .

As well as the drag on financial performance, reputationally Carmignac also prompted concern when Muhammed Yesilhark, a portfolio manager who joined from hedge fund SAC in 2014, left two years later. Mr Yesilhark s departure for  personal reasons  followed an internal investigation into his private investments that were connected to the contentious German entrepreneur Lars Windhorst and his investment firm, Sapinda.

Mr Carmignac says the firm has  very sophisticated compliance systems  but equally  I want to make sure that we keep an entrepreneurial spirit . This is one of several references that Mr Carmignac makes to  animal spirits  or  entrepreneurial spirits .

He admires French president Emmanuel Macron for helping change the attitude towards business in the country.  I think it s very important that the animal spirits come back on the entrepreneurial side,  he says.  As a Frenchman it s very invigorating when you travel abroad to see that France s image has improved. 

At times, Mr Carmignac appears bored by the minutiae of risk management and fund performance, preferring instead the bigger picture. He is vague when asked about the size of the flagship Patrimoine fund, saying:  As Charles Saatchi used to say, I m not a bean counter, so I don t check the assets under management on a daily basis . As to whether the firm made money on its investment in Altice, the telecoms and cable group that lost half of its value last year, he says:  I d be surprised if we didn t make money on it. 

The management changes at Carmignac and its founder s age invite questions about succession. Mr Carmignac likens his role as chief investment officer to that of the conductor of an orchestra. So how does he think about the future of the business?  You mean what happens after douard Carmignac vanishes one day?  he asks with a laugh, widening his eyes for dramatic effect.

 I have always had real admiration for what the Johnson family had done at Fidelity [Investments], so that s pretty much what I had in mind,  he says. Fidelity, the $2.4tn asset manager, has remained independent and is now run by the third generation of the founding Johnson family.

Of Mr Carmignac s five children, only one of them   Maxime   works for the family fund management business. She has run its London office since 2013 after an  OK but not outstanding  period as fund manager, says her father. His daughter is a potential successor but  she will have to prove her colours , he says.

Mr Carmignac and the family own some 70 per cent of the company and he believes its future rests as an independent entity.  The key is that the firm should retain its independence. In this industry there have been very few if any successes of a firm that has been bought by an institution and managed to preserve its track record. 

Shorter term there is the challenge of rebuilding its performance. Mr Carmignac is hoping for a market downturn like the one that helped the group boom a decade ago.  It s a question of when rather than if,  he says.  When the markets turn around I think if we manage to negotiate that downturn properly we will again make a difference and people will accept the fact of having gone through less exciting times for a number of years. 

Business built on 2008 contrarian bet

douard Carmignac made his name by taking a contrarian bet in 2008 after identifying the fragility of the US banking sector and positioning his fund defensively, allowing it to avoid losses when markets crashed and its benchmark index lost 12 percentage points.

Clients were impressed. Assets poured in, largely from individual investors that Carmignac has targeted through a network of private banks and independent financial advisers. Overall, about 80 per cent of Carmignac s assets under management are from Europe, notably Italy and France.

The firm is now positioned with a high exposure to shares, mainly in the US. A majority of equity investments are in the technology sector   areas such as digital consumption, artificial intelligence and big data   and the firm is adding exposure to the healthcare and consumer goods sectors. It is also upbeat about the prospects for Chinese internet stocks in e-commerce and social networks.

In fixed income markets, Carmignac is playing on the divergence of monetary policy between the US, where the Federal Reserve is tightening rates, and the European Central Bank, which is not expected to raise rates before the middle of next year. It is cutting exposure to flagging emerging market bond markets.

Chrysalix Turns Focus to Industrial Tech; Shifting from cleantech, the firm has held a first close on a new fund

Chrysalix Venture Partners has caught up with the new buzzwords.

The Canadian firm, which used to focus on backing renewable-energy companies, said it now invests in "AI, data analytics, sensors and components, IoT, robotic systems and blockchain" for industrial applications.

The Vancouver, British Columbia-based firm, founded in 2001, has gone through a challenging period when the clean-technology market suffered from a lack of exits and other challenges. The firm closed its last fund in 2010, an unusually long time between funds.

Chrysalix has closed on almost half of its $120 million target for a new fund called Chrysalix RoboValley Fund, according to a representative for the firm. The fund will invest in technologies that improve efficiencies of industries such as energy, chemicals, mobility, materials and mining.

Portfolio companies falling under that rubric include MineSense Technologies Ltd., which provides sensor-based data to mining companies about the productivity and efficiency of their operations. Chrysalix initially invested in MineSense in 2013.

Several corporate and institutional limited partners are backing the new fund, including Teck Resources Ltd., Mistletoe Venture Partners International, Petronas, Severstal, Delft University of Technology, Mitsubishi Corp. and Golden Properties, according to the firm.

Chrysalix started raising the RoboValley fund in 2016, after several of its portfolio companies went out of business. Those included carbon-capture tech company Akermin Inc., fuel-cell startup Lilliputian Systems Inc., and lighting technology startup Light-Based Technologies Inc., according to PitchBook Data.

Still, Chrysalix has performed better than most of its peers.

The firm's 2008 vehicle, Chrysalix Energy III US LP, had a net investment rate of return of 1.1%, according to the most recent data from California Public Employees' Retirement System.

That compares poorly to other venture funds from that vintage year, according to Cambridge Associates data. But the fund outperformed all but one of the 13 funds in Calpers' Clean Energy and Technology Fund; the rest are in negative territory.

Chrysalix is one of several venture firms that have adjusted to the difficulties facing cleantech by looking to less capital-intensive technologies that can more immediately serve various industries.

The team at Kleiner Perkins' Green Growth Fund, for instance, launched a new firm called G2VP with a focus on manufacturing, logistics, transportation, agriculture and energy. G2VP partners said they wouldn't invest in science-based tech or even use sustainability as a primary criteria for deals.

Similarly, Braemar Energy Ventures has started looking at transportation and the sharing economy, and Silver Lake Kraftwerk also has widened its aperture.

JPMorgan Chase is putting hundreds of new investment bankers and asset managers through mandatory coding lessons in a sign of Wall Street's heightened need for technology skills.

All 300 analysts joining JPMorgan's asset management division this year have been through mandatory coding training under a new pilot scheme. About a third of the analysts and associates at JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank were also put through the programme.

With technology   from artificial intelligence trading to online lending platforms   shaping the future of banking, financial services firms are developing software to help boost efficiency, create products and fend off the threat from start-ups and tech giants.

Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have both declared they are technology firms, not banks. JPMorgan Chase spends $10.8bn a year on tech   more than any other Wall Street group   and technologists account for about a fifth of its 252,000-strong workforce.

"Coding is not for just tech people, it is for anyone who wants to run a competitive company in the 21st century," said Mary Callahan Erdoes, head of JPMorgan Asset Management, who learnt to code at university. "These are skillsets of the future ... By better understanding coding, our business teams can speak the same language as our technology teams, which ultimately drives better tools and solutions for our clients." The mandatory training may also ultimately be expanded to other parts of JPMorgan Chase's junior population, complementing the more than 7,000 coding classes JPMorgan Chase offers around the world.

Other big banks have also introduced coding training, though generally on a more limited basis. Citi's markets graduates began undergoing Python programming training this year.

Hundreds of new investment bankers and asset managers undergo mandatory training

JPMorgan Chase is putting hundreds of new investment bankers and asset managers through mandatory coding lessons, in a sign of Wall Street s heightened need for technology skills.

All 300 analysts joining JPMorgan s asset management division this year have been through mandatory coding training under a new pilot scheme. About a third of the analysts and associates at JPMorgan s corporate and investment bank were also put through the programme.

With technology, from artificial intelligence trading to online lending platforms, shaping the future of banking, financial services groups are developing software to help them boost efficiency, create innovative products and fend off the threat from start-ups and tech giants.

Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have both declared they are technology groups, not a banks. JPMorgan spends $10.8bn a year on tech, more than any other Wall Street group, and technologists account for about a fifth of the company s 252,000-strong workforce.

 Coding is not for just tech people, it is for anyone who wants to run a competitive company in the 21st century,  said Mary Callahan Erdoes, head of JPMorgan Asset Management, who learned to code at university.  These are skillsets of the future 	. 	. 	. 	By better understanding coding, our business teams can speak the same language as our technology teams, which ultimately drives better tools and solutions for our clients. 

The coding training for this year s juniors was based on Python programming, which will help them to analyse very large data sets and interpret unstructured data such as free language text. Next year, the asset management division will expand the mandatory tech training to include data science concepts, machine learning and cloud computing.

The corporate and investment banking division has not yet made a decision on how coding will feature in the training offered to next year s analysts and associates.

The mandatory training might also ultimately be expanded to other parts of JPMorgan s junior population, complementing the more than 7,000 coding classes the company offers around the world.

Other big banks have also introduced coding training, though generally on a more limited basis. Citi s markets graduates began undergoing Python training this year, but the graduates for other parts of its corporate and investment bank were not given the training.

Bank of America Merrill Lynch does not require its analysts to undergo coding training; Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley would not confirm details of their training programmes.

VCs Placing Startup Bets Based on New 5G Networks; Reducing latency and boosting real-time communications across a range of applications

With the first next-generation "5G" networks coming online this year, a few venture firms are already braving the waters with bets on startups that will rely on a leap forward in broadband services.

Despite a potentially slow rollout, these investors say, the networks are expected to be powerful enough to usher in an array of new possibilities. Still, there are risks that come with betting on what could be an expensive and time-consuming deployment of the upgrade.

New Enterprise Associates Inc. joined a $20 million Series B round this year into artificial intelligence railroad sensor startup Konux Inc. and co-led a $3.5 million seed round in Aquabyte Inc., which is bringing machine learning to fish farming by analyzing footage and information about eating habits in real-time.

Both startups are operating on current networks but they'll need 5G for market expansion, said partner Greg Papadopoulos. He said NEA has made at least a dozen such deals, adding he's now at the point where he would consider investing in startups that are fully banking on 5G implementation to operate.

In September, Fraser McCombs Capital led a $5 million seed investment in Lunewave Inc., an autonomous driving sensor startup. FMC partner Mark Norman calls 5G the "key ingredient." The sensors would take advantage of 5G's reduced latency  the lag between when a request for a website or video is made and when the network responds to communicate in real-time with other vehicles on the road.

Social Capital was part of a $52 million round for machine-learning and 5G enabled chip startup Groq Inc. Social Capital also backed a seed round in satellite startup Swarm Technologies Inc., which aims to provide 5G-based internet service in remote areas.

5G promises peak download speeds of about 100 times faster than current 4G LTE networks, using radio waves that travel closer together to boost capacity. However, the waves can't travel very far, so thousands of new cell towers will need to be built before the networks can spread across the country.

But building out that network is expected to entail prohibitive costs and will lead to a slow and spotty rollout, giving some VC's pause.

Placing bets on startups whose product or service requires a powerful 5G connection would be like "building train tracks before the bridge gets built," said Accel partner Rich Wong.

Previous generations of wireless networks, he said, took roughly a decade for each to become ubiquitous.

Cowen & Co. analyst Colby Synesael said backing 5G dependent startups is still a potentially premature play. He said 2027 was the "sweet spot" for 5G networks coming to fruition.

Technology consultant Chetan Sharma adds that while the first 5G enabled smartphones are likely to hit the market next year, the first iterations of the networks likely won't be powerful enough to fulfill the more lofty promises.

"There are too many uncertainties on the timing of the 5G rollout and the pervasiveness of coverage," said Derek Au, principal at the venture arm of French telecom company Orange.

Some VCs are backing startups developing 5G infrastructure. Berkshire Partners joined a Series C round in Vapor IO Inc., focused on building small data centers close to users and cell towers to help 5G realize its speed potential. Edge Micro, a similar data center company, raised $3 million this year in a private placement seed round, according to co-founder Greg Pettine.

Corporate venture funds are also placing stakes. More than half of the investments made this year by the venture fund of Verizon Communications Inc. have been 5G-related, said director Jeffrey Black, particularly in the virtual and augmented reality sector.

Leading chipmaker Qualcomm Inc. has made similar investments.

"You're investing in what 5G is going to enable," Qualcomm spokesman Pete Lancia said.

ETF Terminology, in English; Exchange-traded funds have a vocabulary all their own. Here's a guide for the curious investor.

Corrections & Amplifications

The first name of ETF.com's Lara Crigger was misspelled as Laura in an earlier version of this article. (Oct. 8, 2018)

When it comes to exchange-traded funds, the most difficult part for investors may not be deciding which strategy to pursue. It may be understanding the language that describes those strategies.

Smart beta. Multifactor. Quantitative. Self-indexed. What do any of those even mean?

In the interest of bringing the ETF world and the English-language world together, here are some common terms, and what they refer to.

 " Smart beta: Mostly a marketing term, a play on the financial term "beta," which measures a security's volatility relative to a benchmark, usually one representing an entire market, geography or sector.

Because there was never an agreed-upon definition in the ETF world, however, smart beta has come to represent any ETF that weights holdings by something other than just market capitalization. That includes not only funds that weight holdings based on factors such as a company's size, book value and trading momentum, but also those focused on a security's volatility, dividends or corporate-earnings quality or any other investing idea.

"The term has been a constant source of confusion among investors," says Michael Venuto, chief investment officer and co-founder of New York-based Toroso Investments. "It lumps in too many things."

Morrison Warren, a partner at Chapman & Cutler LLP, tells investors: "Lean on the prospectus or summary prospectus. Check the index. Read the white paper."

 " Factor: Spawned by research out of the University of Chicago, factors are attributes of a security that indicate it has the potential to provide a higher risk-adjusted return than the overall market. Early on, attributes such as size, value and momentum were identified as factors that could lead to outperformance, which gave rise to index funds and eventually ETFs that weighted holdings based on such attributes.

However, with endless computing power and limitless data, academics began testing every possible investment statistic for a link to returns, and factor investing evolved into a zoo, University of Chicago economist John Cochrane said in a 2011 address.

Research Affiliates, an early adopter of fundamental investing, has gone so far as to declare that most so-called factors can be ignored. "The sheer variety seems to serve the purposes of publication for [academic] tenure and product creation more than better investor outcomes," Research Affiliates partners Jason Hsu and Vitali Kalesnik wrote in 2014.

 " Multifactor: A stock strategy that attempts to derive returns by including more than one factor. Some of the ETFs that engage in this strategy are fixed, meaning they try to constantly exploit the same two factors; others, such as the $139 million Oppenheimer Russell 1000 Dynamic Multifactor ETF (OMFL), try to shift with the economic tides by weighting value, momentum, quality, low volatility and size based on economic expansion, slowdown, contraction and recovery. How should multifactor ETFs be used? "Carefully," said ETF.com's Lara Crigger in a May article that analyzed the over 300 ETFs in the FactSet "multifactor" universe. "Their performance leaves something to be desired, but they appear to meet their promises when it comes to lower volatility and risk reduction," she wrote.

 " Tilt: A more-roundabout way into factor investing that starts with a market-cap-weighted index, and then slightly overweights stocks in the index with certain characteristics. In the case of the $1.3 billion FlexShares Morningstar U.S. Market Factor Tilt Index Fund (TILT) from Northern Trust, there is a "tilt" toward small-cap and value stocks. The term "tilt" is also used by active managers to describe a preferred style of investing such as value or growth, says Mr. Venuto.

 " Quantitative: A strategy in which technology and mathematical formulas drive investment decisions.

"It's a lot of different things," writes diligence consultant Tom Brakke at his blog the Research Puzzle. In fact, some say the term could be used to describe any fund that tracks an index.

While factor investing rules the roost in this category, quantitative strategies also include "the emergent areas of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning," says Mr. Brakke, which have led to two actively managed "AI powered" equity ETFs. At their core, however, many quantitative strategies employ methodologies that aren't transparent, as opposed to published index methodologies that can be tested and replicated (though few try).

 " Self-indexed: Asset managers, attempting to remove as many costs as possible from their investment strategies, are sidestepping name-brand index firms, such as S&P Dow Jones Indices, MSCI or FTSE Russell, and bringing out comparable products without licensing fees. This is how Fidelity Investments brought out several zero-expense-ratio funds in August. Mr. Warren says, however, that the SEC is taking a deeper look at the role of index firms, including self-indexers, and related disclosures.

 " Leveraged and Inverse and Inverse Leveraged: These types of products generally use core holdings (think the S&P 500) and futures contracts or swaps to provide daily multiple returns of an individual index or sector. Because they reset every day the goal is to magnify a single day's returns, long or short, every day the results can be confusing, and long-term investors are advised to stay away. According to research firm XTF, leveraged ETFs run from 1.25 times to 4 times; inverse ETFs attempt to deliver minus 1 time the daily index performance, while inverse leveraged ETFs can run from minus 0.5 time to minus 4 times. Got it?

 " Thematic: A step beyond industries and sectors, thematic investing is the flavor du jour in ETF land, especially for equities in up-and-coming industries. Often but not exclusively index-based, thematic investing looks across sectors for companies that are being affected by a market shift or disruptive technology such as robotics or AI. Funds in this arena include ARK Genomic Revolution Multi-Sector ETF (ARKG) and the $1.9 billion First Trust Cloud Computing ETF (SKYY). Proponents say thematic funds can be a cheap and easy way to harness an emerging trend or innovation, but pay attention to the range of holdings and weights.

 " Hedged: A general term to imply some level of risk control, often using short selling, options, futures or swaps. A few years ago, ETFs that attempted to capture international equity returns while eliminating short-term currency fluctuations were all the rage. Now, the hot trend is fixed-income products that manage interest-rate and duration risk.

Then there are the old reliables, but even they are getting harder to define:

 " Active: This term generally implies an old-fashioned investment strategy, where managers research and pick securities to try to outperform a benchmark index or manage downside risk. Unfortunately for investors seeking clarity, a series of ETFs from Goldman Sachs Asset Management dubbed ActiveBeta might leave some questioning what "active" really means. The ETFs in this case engage in a multifactor strategy combining value, momentum, quality and low volatility.

 " Passive: A catchall term for index-tracking funds and ETFs, "passive" is also used to describe other products and strategies that generally remove day-to-day discretion by a fund manager. The barrier between active and passive for ETFs is breaking down, however. In this summer's proposed ETF Rule, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it would no longer differentiate between active and passive fund applications.

The Price of Financial Advice Is, Finally, Falling; As the rest of Wall Street cuts all kinds of fees in a race to zero, financial advisers have been the exception. That is changing.

Mutual-fund and index-fund fees keep falling. Trading is free, depending on where you do it. Even hedge funds have started to drop their notoriously high charges.

The only holdouts in the race to rock-bottom fees have been traditional investment advisers. Now that is starting to change.

Technology is reshaping the wealth-management industry, bringing down the cost of delivering advice and putting pressure on traditional fee models. At the same time, the massive, continuing transfer of wealth from baby boomers to their children means heirs are re-evaluating their financial relationships and putting advisers on the defensive.

The result: Some big players such as Morgan Stanley have begun to trim fees for traditional advice. What's more, some of those big names are launching automated systems called robo advisers, which offer investors simple guidance at extremely low prices. Vanguard Group charges 0.3% of assets annually for its robo adviser, for instance, while Charles Schwab Corp.'s offering has no management fees.

"The tipping point is now," says Jay Shah, chief executive of Personal Capital. "Advice is being delivered at less than 1%."

That is a huge change. Currently, the bulk of investors with $1.5 million or less pay human advisers between 1% and 1.5% of their assets annually, according to Boston-based research firm Cerulli Associates.

Two reasons the decline has so far been slow-moving is a lack of disclosure and the fragmented nature of the business. There isn't one set rate that any firm or adviser charges clients advisers have leeway in what they charge from one client to the next.

"People don't know what they pay," says Denise Valentine, an analyst at research firm Aite Group.

No one suggests that financial-advice fees will go literally to zero soon. Many investors will always pay because they think it's worth it. And some investors will always value a relationship with an human adviser enough to pay a bit more than what they otherwise might for digital advice or to manage their own investments.

But "there is significant change occurring, and the types of changes we see point to lower fees," says Devin Ryan, brokerage analyst at JMP Securities LLC.

Here's a closer look at the factors that are starting to drive down the cost of investment advice.

Technology opens up options

From robo advisers to digital tools that make human advisers more efficient, technology will keep disrupting the industry's way of doing business.

Traditional advisers are still at the top of the heap, but robo advisers are slowly gaining share. Cerulli Associates estimates that the robo-advice industry had more than $200 billion in assets at the end of 2017 up from $80 billion a year earlier and will have $600 billion by the end of 2022, eating into the $20.3 trillion asset base of traditional brokerage firms.

So, even the biggest firms have given in to pressure to modernize their wealth-management operations with lower-cost options in order to be more competitive.

Financial firms are exploring other types of tech, too. Morgan Stanley in particular has invested big in artificial intelligence meant to let brokers take on more business by freeing them from certain daily tasks, such as automating some client communication on volatile days. The idea: By boosting efficiency, firms and advisers can make up for a lower-fee future by taking on a higher volume of accounts.

More scrutiny from heirs

Traditionally, the investment-advice business has been built on relationships, and fees have lacked transparency, says Mr. Ryan of JMP Securities.

But that will change as the children of boomers inherit their assets, a transfer of wealth estimated at $30 trillion, Mr. Ryan says.

When an heir receives an inheritance, he or she will review the parent's adviser relationship, Mr. Ryan says. Younger investors in particular are often more comfortable with digital advice than a human, a reality that will prompt some advisers to cut fees to remain competitive.

"Millennials are asking a lot more questions about 'what you're doing for me,' " says Ms. Valentine.

At Voya Financial Inc.'s Voya Financial Advisors, roughly 2,100 advisers charge up to around 1.5% of assets, says Tom Halloran, president of the Voya unit. But some have started charging 0.9%, he says, to be more competitive and retain customers considering lower-cost alternatives.

When Morgan Stanley late last year launched its robo adviser with a fee of 0.35% annually, executives said that it was meant to attract a new generation of clients. Many of these new clients are likely to be the children of existing customers now positioned to inherit significant wealth.

Meanwhile, executives at Morgan Stanley have lowered the maximum fee that human advisers can charge clients to 2% of assets from 2.5%.

New arrangements for services

As advisers work to justify asset-management fees of 1% or more, many are pitching clients on their ability to offer financial advice that goes beyond investment allocation.

Some say they can handle taxes, advise on business, prepare clients for retirement years and plan for their children's educations, as well as deliver more specialized services. For instance, Mr. Halloran says Voya advisers are being trained to work with clients who have children with special needs.

Still, some experts warn that investors will want their advisers to offer those services a la carte, letting clients pay for what they want and leave what they don't, Ms. Valentine says.

"Going forward, there will be greater pressure to prove value, and [advisers] will have to have reasons to substantiate their fee," Ms. Valentine says.

(END)

When it comes to exchange-traded funds, the most difficult part for investors may not be deciding which strategy to pursue. It may be understanding the language that describes those strategies.

-- Active: This term generally implies an old-fashioned investment strategy, where managers research and pick securities to try to outperform a benchmark index or manage downside risk. Unfortunately for investors seeking clarity, a series of ETFs from Goldman Sachs Asset Management dubbed ActiveBeta might leave some questioning what "active" really means. The ETFs in this case engage in a multifactor strategy combining value, momentum, quality and low volatility.

-- Passive: A catchall term for index-tracking funds and ETFs, "passive" is also used to describe other products and strategies that generally remove day-to-day discretion by a fund manager. The barrier between active and passive for ETFs is breaking down, however. In this summer's proposed ETF Rule, the Securities and Exchange Commission said it would no longer differentiate between active and passive fund applications.

U.S. News: Massachusetts Candidate Eyes Endowments to Fix Gridlock

Massachusetts is home to some of the best colleges and universities in the world -- and some of the worst traffic jams.

A Democratic gubernatorial candidate is betting residents of the Bay State will be willing to tax the former to alleviate the latter.

Jay Gonzalez is building his long-shot campaign around a levy on the endowments of nine private schools that would create revenue to invest in public transportation and relieve Boston-area congestion, among other things. Boston drivers spend 14% of their time driving in congestion, the worst of any U.S. city, according to the INRIX, a transportation-analytics company.

The 1.6% annual tax, which would be levied only on private, nonprofit schools with endowments that exceed $1 billion, would generate nearly $1 billion, including $563 million from Harvard University and $210 million from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

"I think it's fair to ask the wealthiest among us -- including major institutions that have accumulated enormous wealth in part thanks to their exemption from taxation -- to contribute to our greater community," Mr. Gonzalez said.

The idea has been kicking around Massachusetts progressive circles for at least a decade, but it has met resistance. Critics argue that taxing endowments would undermine the brainpower engine that gives Massachusetts a competitive advantage.

The state's colleges employ more than 100,000 residents, spend more than $9 billion in salaries and personnel expenses and bring in $2.5 billion in research funding each year, according to Richard Doherty, president of the Association of Independent Colleges and Universities in Massachusetts, which opposes the tax.

"Taxing endowments is bad for students, bad for our economy and bad for Massachusetts," Mr. Doherty said. "The Pandora's box of endowment taxes was opened by the Congress in December."

Last year, President Trump and the Republican-led Congress passed a 1.4% annual tax on investment income earned by private-college and university endowments with at least 500 students and at least $500,000 in investments per student. The change was driven by congressional Republicans, who say colleges that build up large, tax-favored endowments should use more of that money to reduce tuition and support low-income students.

Across the U.S., 97 colleges and universities have endowments of at least $1 billion, according to a 2017 study by the National Association of College and University Business Officers and Commonfund, an asset-management firm. The federal tax will cost Harvard around $43 million, according to recent endowment totals -- 8% of what Mr. Gonzalez is proposing, since he wants to tax the entire endowment.

Republican Gov. Charlie Baker, who leads Mr. Gonzalez by 27 points less than six weeks before the election, condemns his opponent's plan. "When President Trump proposed this idea, I thought it was a bad idea then, and I still think it's a bad idea," Mr. Baker said last month.

Harvard owns 214 acres of land across Cambridge, Mass., but pays taxes on just 22 -- those not used for educational purposes, according to the city. The school's endowment is now at $37 billion. A capital campaign just raised $9.6 billion more.

In addition to $6 million in property taxes, Harvard in fiscal 2018 sent Cambridge $4.1 million in something called payments in lieu of taxes, according to the school. The institution paid an additional $11.5 million to the city of Boston.

"The University believes strongly in the rationale behind the tax exemption and is proud of the work that underlies it," the school said in a statement.

Marc McGovern, the mayor of Cambridge, said the school should do more.

"Maybe it made sense hundreds of years ago to exempt these institutions from paying taxes but no one envisioned endowments in the billions of dollars," said Mr. McGovern. a Democrat.

"It is now time that those who have the most do more to support those who need it," Mr. McGovern said.

Investing in Funds & ETFs (A Special Report) --- The Pros and Cons of a New Kind of ETF: The third generation of exchange-traded funds is 'active ETFs;' Here is what investors need to know about them

There is a new exchange-traded fund in town, and it could have advantages over older funds.

Actively managed ETFs, available in increasing numbers from a range of investment companies, combine the most desirable features of actively managed mutual funds and index funds. They charge lower management fees than most actively managed mutual funds and trade through the day, like other ETFs. But, unlike traditional ETFs, they follow a focused objective other than tracking an index. Their portfolios can change daily as their managers buy and sell securities to take advantage of market moves.

Actively managed ETFs first appeared about 10 years ago, but with an insignificant amount of assets. Now, Morningstar lists 263 ETFs as actively managed. These have $66 billion in total assets, albeit a small corner of the more than $3.6 trillion ETF market in the U.S. The bulk of ETF assets are in fixed-income funds.

But actively managed ETFs also are more complex than their predecessors. With other ETFs, the portfolio changes little and infrequently. In an actively managed ETF, the manager or managers can change the portfolio on any given day.

Here are things investors need to understand about active ETFs before plunging in.

1. What exactly are actively managed ETFs?

They are a third generation of ETFs. The earliest ETFs sought to match the returns of a market index by owning a basket of securities similar to the index. The second wave, "smart beta" funds, aimed to beat the broad market by tweaking instead of mirroring index holdings -- owning only stocks of companies in the index that consistently boost dividends, for example.

Next came actively managed ETFs, which also try to beat the market. Instead of relying only on an alternative weighting, they hand over some responsibility for doing that to a manager or managers. There can be many. Northern Trust's FlexShares Ready Access Variable Income Fund (RAVI), a conservative income-generating active ETF, bases its portfolio on Northern Trust's views of the economy and rates as an institution, says strategist Abdur Nimeri.

It can be frustrating for an investor looking for actively managed ETFs to find one easily, since few bill themselves as "active" in their names. If the description states that an ETF doesn't closely follow an index or benchmark, it's probably active.

"Investors deserve choices," says Todd Rosenbluth, who heads ETF and fund research at data provider CFRA. "Now they have more."

2. Where will I see them?

Most investor money in actively managed ETFs so far has flowed into fixed income. Among some of the more popular strategies in this sector are funds that focus on very-short-maturity bonds, aimed at investors who want more income than they could get from a money-market fund. Pimco Enhanced Short Maturity Active ETF (MINT), with $10 billion in assets, is one of the largest.

Active ETFs in equities are less common so far, largely because of a regulatory requirement that ETF portfolios must be disclosed daily, which scares off managers who don't want their strategies exposed. But more actively managed equities ETFs have been appearing. In February, Vanguard launched six.

Some newcomers offer outlier strategies. San Francisco-based EquBot in June offered its AI Powered International Equity ETF (AIIQ), which invests in non-U.S. developed markets. It uses IBM's Watson supercomputer and artificial intelligence to sort through millions of public filings, news releases and social-media posts to find those with the best capital-appreciation prospects.

3. Will I see them in my 401(k)?

Not yet, and probably not soon.

Companies that sponsor 401(k) plans typically are cautious about adding newer strategies to menus of funds available to participants because of concerns about pushing up administrative costs and because of the perceived risk of including strategies that haven't been thoroughly time-tested. Many active ETFs are less than three years old.

4. Why would I want to buy them?

Anyone who likes active management and owns mutual funds could trim portfolio expenses by adding active ETFs. While mutual funds often charge more than one full percentage point a year of assets in management fees, many active ETFs charge 0.3 to 0.7 point.

Active ETFs provide access to specialized and uncommon strategies. ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) focuses on companies that disrupt markets with new technologies, such as 3-D printing and gene therapy.

Another outlier is Vanguard U.S. Liquidity Factor ETF (VFLQ), which owns stocks that trade less often. While there is "some degree of risk" in owning such stocks, Vanguard says that the approach offers capital-appreciation potential because lower-liquidity stocks can be slower to react to constructive news, says John Ameriks, who heads Vanguard's quantitative equity group.

5. Are they better for certain strategies?

Maybe for bonds. "With rates rising in the U.S., investors who hold a passive, fixed-income ETF could be exposed to a lot of risks, including interest-rate risk," says Patrick O'Connor, who heads ETFs globally at Franklin Templeton. "Because an active bond ETF doesn't have to track an index, its manager isn't forced to own risks for which investors aren't being adequately compensated."

Some advisers believe an active ETF is a better way of investing in emerging-markets stocks, a survey by Brown Brothers Harriman found. Because emerging markets trade less efficiently, it is thought that an active manager can find undervalued securities more easily there than in developed markets and beat an index, says Shawn McNinch, an ETF specialist at the firm.

6. Why wouldn't I want to buy them?

People who already own purely passive ETFs would end up paying more in management fees if they invest in active ETFs. Equity index funds from Charles Schwab and State Street charge as little as 0.03 point in fees. Active ETFs likely will draw more investors away from mutual funds than from passive funds, says Brian McCormick, ETF analyst at Commonwealth Financial Network.

Active ETFs also aren't for investors who hate research. Analyzing one thoroughly requires about the same due diligence as looking at a traditional mutual fund, says Michael Iachini, who heads manager research for Charles Schwab Investment Advisory.

Investing in Funds & ETFs (A Special Report) --- The Price of Financial Advice Is, Finally, Falling: As the rest of Wall Street cuts all kinds of fees in a race to zero, advisers have been the exception; That is starting to change

By Lisa Beilfuss

Mutual-fund and index-fund fees keep falling. Trading is free, depending on where you do it. Even hedge funds have started to drop their notoriously high charges.

The only holdouts in the race to rock-bottom fees have been traditional investment advisers. Now that is starting to change.

Technology is reshaping the wealth-management industry, bringing down the cost of delivering advice and putting pressure on traditional fee models. At the same time, the massive, continuing transfer of wealth from baby boomers to their children means heirs are re-evaluating their financial relationships and putting advisers on the defensive.

The result: Some big players -- such as Morgan Stanley -- have begun to trim fees for traditional advice. What's more, some of those big names are launching automated systems called robo advisers, which offer investors simple guidance at extremely low prices. Vanguard Group charges 0.3% of assets annually for its robo adviser, for instance, while Charles Schwab Corp.'s offering has no management fees.

"The tipping point is now," says Jay Shah, chief executive of Personal Capital. "Advice is being delivered at less than 1%."

That is a huge change. Currently, the bulk of investors with $1.5 million or less pay human advisers between 1% and 1.5% of their assets annually, according to Boston-based research firm Cerulli Associates.

Two reasons the decline has so far been slow-moving is a lack of disclosure and the fragmented nature of the business. There isn't one set rate that any firm or adviser charges clients -- advisers have leeway in what they charge from one client to the next.

"People don't know what they pay," says Denise Valentine, an analyst at research firm Aite Group.

No one suggests that financial-advice fees will go literally to zero soon. Many investors will always pay because they think it's worth it. And some investors will always value a relationship with an human adviser enough to pay a bit more than what they otherwise might for digital advice or to manage their own investments.

But "there is significant change occurring, and the types of changes we see point to lower fees," says Devin Ryan, brokerage analyst at JMP Securities LLC.

Here's a closer look at the factors that are starting to drive down the cost of investment advice.

From robo advisers to digital tools that make human advisers more efficient, technology will keep disrupting the industry's way of doing business.

Traditional advisers are still at the top of the heap, but robo advisers are slowly gaining share. Cerulli Associates estimates that the robo-advice industry had more than $200 billion in assets at the end of 2017 -- up from $80 billion a year earlier -- and will have $600 billion by the end of 2022, eating into the $20.3 trillion asset base of traditional brokerage firms.

So, even the biggest firms have given in to pressure to modernize their wealth-management operations with lower-cost options in order to be more competitive.

Financial firms are exploring other types of tech, too. Morgan Stanley in particular has invested big in artificial intelligence meant to let brokers take on more business by freeing them from certain daily tasks, such as automating some client communication on volatile days. The idea: By boosting efficiency, firms and advisers can make up for a lower-fee future by taking on a higher volume of accounts.

Traditionally, the investment-advice business has been built on relationships, and fees have lacked transparency, says Mr. Ryan of JMP Securities.

But that will change as the children of boomers inherit their assets, a transfer of wealth estimated at $30 trillion, Mr. Ryan says.

When an heir receives an inheritance, he or she will review the parent's adviser relationship, Mr. Ryan says. Younger investors in particular are often more comfortable with digital advice than a human, a reality that will prompt some advisers to cut fees to remain competitive.

"Millennials are asking a lot more questions about 'what you're doing for me,' " says Ms. Valentine.

At Voya Financial Inc.'s Voya Financial Advisors, roughly 2,100 advisers charge up to around 1.5% of assets, says Tom Halloran, president of the Voya unit. But some have started charging 0.9%, he says, to be more competitive and retain customers considering lower-cost alternatives.

When Morgan Stanley late last year launched its robo adviser with a fee of 0.35% annually, executives said that it was meant to attract a new generation of clients. Many of these new clients are likely to be the children of existing customers now positioned to inherit significant wealth.

Meanwhile, executives at Morgan Stanley have lowered the maximum fee that human advisers can charge clients to 2% of assets from 2.5%.

As advisers work to justify asset-management fees of 1% or more, many are pitching clients on their ability to offer financial advice that goes beyond investment allocation.

Some say they can handle taxes, advise on business, prepare clients for retirement years and plan for their children's educations, as well as deliver more specialized services. For instance, Mr. Halloran says Voya advisers are being trained to work with clients who have children with special needs.

Still, some experts warn that investors will want their advisers to offer those services a la carte, letting clients pay for what they want and leave what they don't, Ms. Valentine says.

"Going forward, there will be greater pressure to prove value, and [advisers] will have to have reasons to substantiate their fee," Ms. Valentine says.

Everything You Need to Know About a New Kind of ETF; The pros and cons of 'active ETFs,' which fans say combine the best of actively managed mutual funds and index funds

They charge lower management fees than most actively managed mutual funds and trade through the day, like other ETFs. But, unlike traditional ETFs, they follow a focused objective other than tracking an index. Their portfolios can change daily as their managers buy and sell securities to take advantage of market moves.

Investors who want to take advantage of a particular strategy or manager thus can place bets that their active ETF will outperform the market or related benchmark, and at costs below those of traditional mutual funds.

Actively managed ETFs first appeared about 10 years ago, but with an insignificant amount of assets. Now, Morningstar lists 263 ETFs as actively managed. These have $66 billion in total assets, albeit a small corner of the more than $3.6 trillion ETF market in the U.S. The bulk of ETF assets are in fixed-income funds.

More than 60 firms offer them, including such household names as Franklin Templeton, State Street, Fidelity Investments, J.P. Morgan, BlackRock's iShares unit, WisdomTree, Pimco and Vanguard. Advisers have been pushing some firms that offer popular traditional mutual funds to clone them in active ETF versions, which can save perhaps a half percentage point or more on fees while giving the adviser an easily traded, transparent and more tax-efficient strategy to use for clients.

But actively managed ETFs also are more complex than their predecessors. With other ETFs, the portfolio changes little and infrequently, so it's easier to anticipate what you are investing in over time. In an actively managed ETF, by contrast, the manager or managers can change the portfolio on any given day. So, over time, investors in a fund may be surprised to see the portfolio start to look different from when they bought it. This is particularly an issue in equities, because managers of stock funds are paranoid about telling investors what they are doing for fear that a competitor will copy it.

Here are things investors need to understand about active ETFs before plunging in.

1. What exactly are actively managed ETFs?

They are a third generation of ETFs. The earliest ETFs sought to match the returns of a market index by owning a basket of securities similar to the index. The second wave, "smart beta" funds, aimed to beat, rather than match, the broad market by tweaking instead of mirroring index holdings owning only stocks of companies in the relevant index that consistently boost dividends, for example.

It can be frustrating for an investor looking for actively managed ETFs to find one easily, since few bill themselves as "active" in their names. The websites of some fund firms may clarify whether certain ETFs are active, in terms of how they label the categories of funds they have. Beyond that, investors may need to either call the firm and ask, or look at the description of the fund on the website. If the description states that an ETF doesn't closely follow an index or benchmark, it's probably active.

"Investors deserve choices," says Todd Rosenbluth, who heads ETF and fund research at data provider CFRA. "Now they have more."

Pimco Enhanced Short Maturity Active ETF (MINT), with $10 billion in assets, is one of the largest of these. It aims to beat the average money-market mutual fund's performance by holding "a hodgepodge" of short-term, investment-grade debt securities, Pimco says.

Active ETFs in equities are less common so far, largely because of a regulatory requirement that ETF portfolios must be disclosed daily, thus scaring off managers who don't want their strategies exposed. But more actively managed equities ETFs have been appearing. In February, Vanguard launched six, including one that targets momentum stocks or those with strong recent performance and a multifactor fund focuses on stocks of various cap size that score highly on the basis of attractive valuation, momentum and quality.

Some newcomers offer outlier strategies. San Francisco-based EquBot in June offered its AI Powered International Equity ETF (AIIQ), which invests in non-U.S. developed markets. It uses IBM's Watson supercomputer and artificial intelligence to sort through millions of public filings, news releases and social-media posts to find those with the best capital-appreciation prospects. The firm was established in early 2017 by a group of business-school students at the University of California at Berkeley.

3. Will I see them in my 401(k)?

Not yet, and probably not soon.

Companies that sponsor 401(k) plans typically are cautious about adding newer strategies to menus of funds available to participants because of concerns about pushing up administrative costs and because of the perceived risk of including strategies that haven't been thoroughly time-tested.

Maybe for bonds. "With rates rising in the U.S., investors who hold a passive, fixed-income ETF could be exposed to a lot of risks, including interest-rate risk," says Patrick O'Connor, who heads ETFs globally at Franklin Templeton. The main bond benchmark, the Bloomberg Barclays Aggregate Bond Index, tilts heavily toward rate-sensitive government bonds, he notes.

"Because an active bond ETF doesn't have to track an index, its manager isn't forced to own risks for which investors aren't being adequately compensated," Mr. O'Connor adds. Franklin Templeton offers seven actively managed fixed-income ETFs, including two that invest in municipal bonds and one that holds higher-yielding floating-rate securities.

Some advisers believe an active ETF is a better way of investing in emerging-markets stocks, a survey by Brown Brothers Harriman found. Because emerging markets trade less efficiently, it is thought that an active manager can find undervalued securities more easily there than in developed markets and beat an index, says Shawn McNinch, an ETF specialist at the firm.

Actively managed ETFs also aren't for investors who hate doing research. Analyzing one thoroughly requires about the same due diligence as looking at a traditional mutual fund, says Michael Iachini, who heads manager research for Charles Schwab Investment Advisory.

It is important to delve beyond performance figures and read fund literature, such as the prospectus, to learn what an active ETF manager is trying to do and what risks that involves, Mr. Iachini adds.

7. Anything else I need to know about them?

The beauty of many actively managed ETFs is that they may give investors access to the same strategies that are used by popular mutual funds, but in a lower-cost ETF version, says Ben Johnson, director of global ETF and passive strategies research at Morningstar. He cites Davis Advisors, which recently launched several active funds. These include Davis Select Worldwide ETF (DWLD), similar to its strongly performing Davis Global mutual fund (DGFAX).

But it is important to keep in mind that in actively managed ETFs, investors are relying much more on manager skill than with older ETFs, where the strategy is embedded in the design of an index.

In some respects, investing in an actively managed ETF isn't any different from owning a traditional mutual fund, Mr. Johnson says. "You are relying on the judgment of an individual or group of managers to find securities that they think will have greater price appreciation than others."

Lunch with the FT Helena Morrissey The investment manager, campaigner and mother of nine children is one of the most high-profile women in the City. Over salmon at The Ned, she talks to Brooke Masters about juggling work and family, backing Brexit   and why there is more to diversity than getting women on boards

ow do you have lunch with Superwoman? Helena Morrissey has a full-time job running Legal & General's personal investing business, spearheads a highprofile diversity campaign, sits on the board of Eton and, oh yes, has nine children between the ages of nine and 26. She served as chief executive of Newton Investment Management for 15 years, cranked out a book called A Good Time to be a Girl during her leave between positions, and last year was made a dame of the British empire. And despite all those natural births, and recently becoming a grandmother, the 52-year-old is stickthin, elegant and wearing cute pumps with gold heels that are to die for.

It's all very exhausting to think about.

I find two kids, a job and a dog more than enough to handle. Arriving at the lunch, I wondered whether I would be intimidated, even faintly resentful of Morrissey as one of those miracle women who makes life hard for the rest of us by making it look so easy to have it all.

Indeed, when the waitress comes, Morrissey oozes efficiency, decisively ordering salmon with sauce vierge. She would have stopped there but adds a haddock souffl starter when I point out that two courses would give us more time to talk. I opt for the tomato soup and copy her salmon, mostly because I haven't had time to read the rest of the menu and don't want to hold her back.

But as we begin chatting, Morrissey's ramrod-straight posture eases and she starts talking with her hands. She excitedly pulls out her phone to share a graphic she finds illuminating. When she learns I have ordered sparkling water, she laughs: "Let's live a little."

We are meeting at The Ned, London's elegant new members' club, where 10 restaurants and a five-star hotel are now found in the refurbished Midland Bank building. In the past year this towering marble edifice decked out in 1920s style has become one of the City's go-to places for flashy parties, important meetings and glamorous fundraisers.

Millie's Lounge, a buzzy place in the main lobby, is a favourite of hers for breakfast. Not only is it right on her commuting route, but it shares a name with her third daughter. She also really likes the symbolism of a women's power lunch in a place that was once home largely to men in bowler hats.

We perch on two velvet banquettes at right angles and have to bend forward to hear over the chatter all around us. In our brightly coloured print dresses, we could be two traditional ladies who lunch. Our conversation does touch on catering, managing the schedules of busy children and even briefly on fashion. But this is 2018 and Morrissey is a multitasking high-flyer with a much wider agenda.

Just in the week of our meeting, she was part of the Institute for Public Policy Research panel including trade unionists and the Archbishop of Canterbury that produced a provocative report calling for a radical rethink of the British economy; she helped launch the "Equal Lives" research into barriers that prevent men from being caregivers; she fronted a report from the Financial Reporting Council urging companies to treat diversity as a business strategy; and she spoke at a conference on the use of artificial intelligence and chatbots to give investment advice.

She confidently swats aside the critiques of her panel's report on rethinking the economy. "If you're worried about the people you offend then you'd never do anything." But for all her super-alpha persona, she is, it transpires, as prone to uncertainty as any of us. In particular, she is having doubts about the lasting success of her drive to get companies to appoint more women to top jobs. "There's a real sense of fatigue," she says. "I think one of the reasons is because it looks like it's only about me, me, me, the women, women, women, and that's not very attractive."

That's a remarkable admission coming just as the 30% Club, the campaign to get more women in top corporate jobs that she founded in 2010, finally hit one of its main targets. As she tweeted last month, "FTSE100 boards reached 30% women on boards for the first time   30.4% to be precise!" Women lower down the ladder still struggle to advance and balance careers with domestic responsibilities, she worries, and men, with the best will in the world, face barriers at work when they try to be more involved with childcare.

"I think it's quite tough being a modern man today. What does it mean? And so there's pressure to be a dad, a great parent and to be hands-on and look after your elderly relatives and do stuff for the community ... and then also to be an alpha male and [make] lots of money and be at the top of your career."

She was reflecting recently that the impetus for diversity seemed to have stalled, "and my husband said: 'I don't know what you'd expect, really.' He wasn't having a go but he was saying, if you have a diversity programme on top, but everything else just carrying on the same, how could that ever change anything?" "You have to change everything," she tells me. "You have to change the way you recruit, the way you promote, work together."

When the haddock souffl arrives, Morrissey is talking too fast and enthusiastically to do more than pick at it. I manage not to spill tomato soup on my dress. Seeing that she is resolutely ignoring the bread basket, I do the same and sit back and listen to her account of her journey through the traditional preserves of masculine authority.

Born into a family of teachers, she survived "merciless teasing" as the only girl in her advanced maths class at school and won a spot at Cambridge, an experience she credits with helping her thrive in the testosterone-heavy atmosphere of 1990s financial services. She met her husband Richard while at university, where she studied philosophy.

It was at the New York office of the venerable UK asset management firm Schroders that she had the then "quite anomalous" experience of working with "two really amazing women who were running all the business development. [They] were calling all the shots." And then she came crashing down to earth. Back in London, she found herself the only woman in a team of 16 fund managers. "That was a bit of a shock to the system," she says.

The next few years were frankly difficult as she and her husband tried to balance children with their careers during a recession that left them underwater on their mortgage. Although they had a reliable nanny, there were constant discussions over who would stay at home when the kids were sick, and pressure to make sure everything was done.

Finally, when she was 32 and pregnant with Millie, their fourth, the couple decided it was time for a change. Richard was not enjoying his work as a journalist, while Helena was by then thriving at Newton   a few years later she would be named chief executive. So they made the decision that he would stay at home. "It wasn't suddenly that my whole world was solved, but because it was a different dynamic, I didn't have the same anxieties about just functioning," she explains.

D efying gender norms has not always been easy. Even now, every September or whenever the children change classes, the Morrisseys have to remind schools and parents' groups that Richard, not Helena, is the first port of call.

Morrissey also receives hate mail   just that morning she had received an angry letter taking issue with an interview she had done with the Guardian that detailed, among other things, her use of a whiteboard to track her children's activities. And she is regularly tweaked in the tabloids for her full plate.

She was hurt when one news outlet noted that it was glad she "found time" to attend her oldest daughter Florence's wedding. The jibe particularly rankled because she had organised much of the festivities. Last year, for her oldest son Fitz, she even baked the wedding cake   a multi-tiered tower of meringue and fruit that required a wedding-day assembly line to produce.

Along the way, she concedes, she has not always done as much as she could to help other women emulate her success. At first, she was struggling herself, and later she was so busy that she didn't have time to respond to all the requests for coffees and heart-to-heart chats.

She also admits she was, as a manager, a product of her time: too focused until recently on traditional measures of output such as having workers present at the office. That has changed, she says. "Now I definitely measure people's performance on their results ... I now do this agile working in my team so in theory I can be sitting in London on my own while my team are at the digital place down in Cardiff."

The switched-on City financiers at the tables on either side of us are a bit too close for comfort. I think the woman just off my right shoulder is posturing about her ability to sell derivatives but it's hard to tell amid all the acronyms.

At our table, the atmosphere is lighter. Over the salmon, which turns out to be in a delicious tomato and basil sauce, I volunteer stories about my decision to switch from maths to history as an undergraduate, and we compare notes about dropping children off at university. I decide to take Morrissey to task about two things that have recently bothered me and other women I know: the title of her book and the name of the fund she recently started.

The L&G Future World Gender in Leadership fund invests in companies with higher-than-average gender diversity in their top ranks   the logic behind it is that companies that make an effort on such things are likely to have better governance and ultimately better results. The theory is supported by research from McKinsey, among others.

But it bugs me that she chose to make the scheme's official nickname the "Girl fund"   doesn't that trivialise the value of diversity? Similarly, it feels Pollyanna-ish to be so positive about being female when women in many countries are still denied access to education and basic necessities. Even in the west, the hearings on US Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and the #MeToo movement have highlighted the continuing prevalence of sexual assault and harassment.

Morrissey acknowledges that there have been complaints about the Girl fund, but argues that it is mainly middleaged women who find the name reductive, while young people don't care. As for the book title, she says she chose it because "I feel in danger of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory if we don't celebrate the progress".

Girls have many more opportunities than they once did, she points out, even if it is not always easy to be a grown woman. What about her three sons, I ask. Is it a good time to be a boy? That is a tougher question. She believes that one of her sons failed to win a prize at school because the teachers were keen to show that two girls, rather than one student of each gender, could be winners, and statistics do show that the students who do worst in Britain are white, disadvantaged boys. "I worry about positive discrimination. Women's progression is not about replacing one form of discrimination with another," she says. "I think we lost sight of the fact that gender equality has got two sides to the equation."

The waitress comes to clear the salmon and Morrissey waves hers away, only half-eaten. (It is big, though: I am an inveterate plate-cleaner and only threequarters of the way through.) I realise that we have been talking for more than 90 minutes without mentioning Brexit. That's a surprise, because one of the other things for which she is well known is her avid and early support of the UK's departure from the EU.

We order coffee   espresso for her, decaf latte for me   and I broach the subject. "Brexit. OK. Save the best to last," she says in a downbeat tone that suggests that it is anything but.

Well before the June 2016 vote, when most in the City of London were either silent or ardent Remainers, Morrissey loudly advocated cutting ties to the EU. She says her support was "predicated on actually wanting to have more decisionmaking closer to us" and that she spoke out because so few other people did.

"Behind closed doors, a lot more people were progressive but in the public domain [they were silent]," she recalls. "I thought, 'Isn't this where we went wrong in the financial crisis, because nobody said what they really thought?' " Now that the leaving negotiations are mired in confusion and finger-pointing, I wonder whether she has changed her position. "We're all unified: Remainers, Leavers, everyone is wishing it was handled better," she says. "We keep making this bizarre mistake of agreeing a position amongst ourselves before we've checked it out with the other side of the negotiating table."

Though she is disheartened by the lack of progress and the growing threat of no deal, Morrissey remains adamantly opposed to a second referendum. "What would it clear up?" she asks. "I thought Geoffrey Boycott the cricketer said it really brilliantly: it's like a cricket captain losing the first toss about who goes out to bat and saying ... can we make it the best of three? And then the best of five? "We can't call it the People's Vote when the people have already voted."

Instead, she thinks UK negotiators should press ahead and seek a stepping stone deal rather than trying to tie all of the loose ends up at once. "Let's be pragmatic [and] get through it," she says. "Because everybody needs to get on with the rest of their lives."

Now that we are back on policy, Morrissey's posture has stiffened and she sounds much more assertive. This is the impressive, intimidating woman who commands attention on conference platforms and more than holds her own on radio and television.

Looking around The Ned, the mood seems very upbeat. While Morrissey is pensive about the state of financial services 10 years after the crash, she worries that others are not. "We've lulled ourselves into a false sense of security. We know there's more leverage in the financial system. We know we've still got a lack of diverse thinking. We know we still don't allow people to disagree very easily."

And then she is off. When you have as much to accomplish as she does, every minute counts.

Kraft Heinz Launches $100 Million Venture Fund; Fund will back broad range of food tech

Kraft Heinz Co., the giant behind some of America's most recognized foods like Oscar Mayer hot dogs and Mac and Cheese, has launched a venture capital fund to invest in a broad range of food-focused startups.

With $100 million for the first fund, Chicago-based Evolv Ventures will back companies at multiple points in the food chain, from alternative protein providers to new snack categories to agriculture technology.

"We're looking at everything from the industrial side of getting food from farms to factories and bringing it to retail, to new models of supply chains and companies that develop predictive analytics for better consumer data marketing" said Evolv Ventures General Partner Bill Pescatello.

Evolv is the latest example of a major food corporation emulating Silicon Valley tactics to keep up with fast-changing consumer spending and eating habits.

As ecommerce has transformed the grocery store experience and consumers look to healthier, higher-quality foods, many big food companies have struggled to keep up with innovation.

Campbell Soup Company, Tyson Foods Inc. and General Mills all formed venture arms in recent years, in part to harness the flexibility of startups and recoup some of those losses. Kraft Heinz also launched an incubator, Springboard, which operates separately from Evolv.

Mr. Pescatello, who was the founding member of NBC Universal's venture capital fund Peacock Equity Fund, said Evolv will invest in Series A through C rounds and write checks averaging $4 million to $5 million. He said he was attracted to the Evolv role based on his experience in strategic corporate investing as well as his previous experience at Lightbank, the venture capital firm launched by Groupon co-founders Eric Lefkofsky and Brad Keywell.

"Kraft Heinz has $26 billion in sales and spends $400 million in advertising per year. You can really use that huge footprint and the better efficiency of tech companies to your advantage," said Mr. Pescatello.

Cures for the crisis hangover

Complexity and Scale

A decade on from the banking implosion of 2008, law firms remain in demand to navigate the fallout, writes Laura Noonan

The 10th anniversary of the collapse on September 15 2008 of US bank Lehman Brothers stirred painful memories for many bankers, traders and investors   particularly those who lost their job, their savings or their peace of mind in the ensuing chaos.

The date has different connotations for the many lawyers who remember the bank's collapse as the start of a boom that endures to this day   one that has arisen from the demands of governments, investors and banks themselves on the best way to navigate the fallout from the crisis.

With dizzyingly high sums, and so many first-of-a-kind answers to Europe's banking problems, it is not hard to see why the past 10 years have been fertile ground for innovative approaches by corporate lawyers.

The past year has been no exception, although predictably the work has centred on how best to deal with the legacy of crisisperiod actions, such as bank nationalisations, promised divestments and asset sales, rather than new initiatives.

The UK, whose bank bailout bill was topped only by that of the US and Germany, was home to some of the most notable recent action. The disposal of Royal Bank of Scotland's Williams & Glyn retail and small and medium-sized enterprise book is one of the most prominent examples of a crisis hangover finally being dealt with in the past year.

Nilufer von Bismarck, head of financial institutions at law firm Slaughter and May, explains that after several failed efforts to sell or float Williams & Glyn, the firm had to find and implement an answer with "the same effect" as the disposal demanded by the EU as a condition of RBS's 2008 bailout. That solution was to pay other banks to take the Williams & Glyn smallerbusiness customers. "We set up a fund making offers to Clydesdale, Santander, Virgin Money [and others]," she says. As well as offering grants to challenger banks and fintech companies that wanted to build SME servicing capabilities, RBS will also fund "incentives" to entice smaller-business customers to move.

Paying a competitor to take your clients had not been done before in a state aid divestment, possibly because it sounds like a crazy idea that most companies would resist.

"By then RBS had spent so much money trying to get rid of this business one way or another and hadn't managed to do it that they thought, well if we give this money now, we will solve the state aid issue and we could spend the money at some point one way or the other," says Ms von Bismarck.

There is another route: the bailed-out Bank of Ireland repeatedly failed to fulfil the EU's demand that it sell its life insurance arm; Brussels ultimately gave up. But RBS did not fancy running that gauntlet and had its eye on a bigger prize. It knew selling Williams & Glyn would "bring lots of other benefits", Ms von Bismarck says, including lifting restrictions on dividend payments and enabling the government to begin selling its stake.

The UK passed another big post-crisis milestone last year by pulling offone of Europe's largest government asset sales with the 11.8bn disposal of a loan portfolio from collapsed bank Bradford & Bingley to insurer Prudential and private equity firm Blackstone. Bradford & Bingley had been on the UK balance sheet since its 2008 implosion. The country's top six banks had been paying for its rescue through an annual levy to the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS).

Adam Fogarty, finance partner at law firm Linklaters, who advised the six banks on the deal, said its size led the Treasury to believe it could not sell the portfolio without also offering financing to its buyer.

The UK sold a 13bn portfolio of collapsed bank A race against time in Portugal Lawyers in Portugal have had to deal with a more recent banking problem than Lehman Brothers, and to a tighter timeframe.

Banco Esprito Santo, one of Portugal's oldest and biggest banks, collapsed in 2014. To contain the fallout, the Bank of Portugal, the country's central bank, created a "bridge bank", Novo Banco, to take over the "good" assets. The European Commission required the sale of Novo Banco by 2017. Chinese insurer Anbang eventually became the preferred bidder, but the sale collapsed at a crucial point in negotiations.

Jorge Bleck and his team at law firm VdA, which advised the Bank of Portugal, kicked offanother process. By the time private equity firm Lone Star became the preferred bidder in January 2017, Novo Banco was in better shape, but there was still significant disagreement between buyer and seller on loan valuations.

Mr Bleck says there had been a "huge fight against time" to create Novo Banco when Banco Esprito Santo crumbled. As a result "there were certain assets transferred to the good bank which should never have been transferred because they were not good".

Lone Star said Novo Banco's assets were worth  3.9bn less than the Bank of Portugal's figure. In a normal commercial transaction, Mr Bleck says, the seller would have pumped in the additional capital. Portugal, which had just exited an EU-International Monetary Fund bailout, could not afford to do that. Nor could it guarantee  3.9bn of losses, since Eurostat, the statistical office of the EU, would have added the guarantee amount to Portugal's deficit, exceeding targets agreed with the EU.

Instead, lawyers came up with an innovative contingency structure that required Portugal to put more money into the bridge bank only if losses from bad loans pushed its capital ratios below an agreed level. "This allowed the accounting treatment to be completely different," says Mr Bleck, adding that Eurostat did not consider the contingency to be part of Portugal's deficit.

The structure also cut potential payments by Portugal, since any loss on the bad loans would first be offset against profits on loans that perform better than expected, before crystallising into a hit to the bank's capital ratio that Portugal would have to make up. For Lone Star's part, Mr Bleck believes it accepted the contingency to get the deal done.

Northern Rock to private equity house Cerberus in 2015 without staple financing, but since the 11.8bn Bradford & Bingley sale was to be followed swiftly by a 6bn disposal of similar assets, the Treasury did not think bidders could finance the deals independently. Instead, the six banks were called on to provide "staple financing", or pre-packaged funding, for the loans' buyers.

"The mere use of staple finance for a transaction of this size was, at the time, almost unheard of," says Mr Fogarty, adding that banks had an incentive to participate because they were "on the hook to pay the cost" of the Treasury/Bradford & Bingley debt via the FSCS levy.

Mr Fogarty is aware of "another very large transaction, in Cyprus" where a vendor staple is being used. But, he adds, the mix of "size and scale, the incentive of the FSCS levy for banks to participate and provide the staple, and the presence of a government seller with the ability to influence the banks and persuade them to be involved, are hard to replicate".

Managing Complexity and Scale Rank Law firm Originality Leadership Impact Total Standout Slaughter and May Worked with HM Treasury's state-owned financial assets arm to devise the "virtual sale" of Royal Bank of Scotland's Williams & Glyn division, after all alternative sale options had been exhausted. The firm helped design the virtual sale, persuaded the European Commission it would comply with EU rules and designed a regulatory framework for the implementation of a new regime for UK business banking. Commended: Nilufer von Bismarck Orrick Advised oil drilling contractor Ocean Rig on its precedentsetting $3.7bn restructuring, enabling the company to avoid Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which would have required a critical interruption to subsidiaries. Lawyers shifted Ocean Rig's centre of main interest from the Marshall Islands to the Cayman Islands, where it had built a new insolvency regime for the restructuring. VdA Devised a new guarantee structure that achieved the sale of Novo Banco. The Portuguese bank's financial situation meant prospective buyers refused to invest without a state capital guarantee, opposed by the European Commission. The firm designed a "contingent capital mechanism" that allowed for possible cash injections by the Portuguese government within state aid rules. White & Case Led the acquisition of the struggling United Arab Shipping Company by Hapag-Lloyd. UASC was co-owned by Qatari and Saudi sovereign wealth funds, with minority stakes held by Kuwait, Iraq, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. The merger was carried out at a time of challenging relations between Qatar and its neighbours. Lawyers amended the UASC's financing agreements, redomiciled the company, squeezed out small shareholders that had not engaged with the company for decades, and disposed of UASC's chemical-carrying operations. Highly Commended Aequo Internationalised the Ukrainian non-performing loans market by drafting new regulations to allow foreign investors into the market and lowering the measure at which loans are considered non-performing to make more available to investors. The new regulations give better protection against graft   the use of a politician's authority for personal gain   and have the potential to help Ukraine's recovery in the wake of its 2014-15 financial crisis. Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft Advised the senior noteholders   a class of creditors   on the complex bankruptcy of spirits business Roust, putting the company through a prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy prepared in co-operation with the creditors, despite it having minimal operations in the US. Paul Hastings Advised the committee of noteholders on the 700m recapitalisation of the Co-operative Bank. This involved redesigning the pension fund arrangements for the 90,000 current and former Co-op Group and bank workers, a reworking of the business arrangements between the bank and the Co-op Group and the creation of a new governance structure to ensure the preservation of the organisation's ethics. Herbert Smith Freehills Represented Royal Bank of Scotland in a shareholder rights litigation involving claims by nearly 40,000 shareholders and damages of 4bn. The firm devised a staged approach to settlements with different groups, and a new use of digital case management tools. Linklaters Advised Lloyds Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland on the ring-fencing of their retail businesses from their investment banking and other non-consumer arms in a complex restructuring that affected around 150,000 employees of the combined banks. The firm helped create a new bank, Lloyds Bank Corporate Markets, and developed new software tools to assist in ring-fencing compliance. Slaughter and May Acted for manufacturer GKN on its hostile takeover by Melrose, preparing a white knight defence comprising a sale of GKN's Driveline business to US competitor Dana. This was the biggest ever agreed disposal to form part of a defence in a UK public takeover battle and was put together in days from conception to agreement. Weil, Gotshal & Manges Assisted oil company Paragon Offshore on its $2.3bn restructuring during negotiations with creditors. Paragon, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, then transferred the process to a UK prepack administration, the first time this has been done. 9 9 9 27 7 8 9 24 9 7 8 24 8 8 8 24 7 8 8 23 7 8 8 23 8 8 7 23 6 8 8 22 7 7 8 22 7 9 5 21 6 7 8 21

Ellex Protected the Republic of Lithuania against proceedings brought in a Russian arbitration court by the former co-owner of collapsed Lithuanian bank Snoras. Ellex, together with White & Case, successfully argued that the Arbitration Court of Moscow refer the matter to Lithuania by referencing a rarely used bilateral 1992 agreement between the two countries. Stephenson Harwood Resolved a 14-year dispute between the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and construction company IPCO (Nigeria) relating to the building of the Bonny export terminal in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. The law firm persuaded the UK Supreme Court to import the case to the UK because of extensive delays and alleged fraud in the original arbitration proceedings in Nigeria.

Lawyers are expanding their skills to develop some novel technologies, writes Cat Rutter Pooley

It is a late summer's day in Hoxton Square, close to the heart of London's technology district. In an industrial-style building typical of the city's start-up scene, teams from insurer Aviva are working on some of the company's more out-there projects.

Some are developing hardware products; others are tackling software or technological answers to problems. One is a digital piggy bank for children, dubbed Aviva Penny.

Due to be launched later this year for sale on the high street, the concept is not entirely original to Aviva. Santander, the high-street bank, is developing a similar product called Money Monsters, while New Zealand's ASB Bank already offers Clever Kash, an elephant-shaped cashless money box.

For Aviva, the product is aimed at filling a gap in its market, ultimately by encouraging a habit among young people of saving with the company and using its services for the rest of their life.

Aviva Penny was not dreamt up by an innovation lab separate from the rest of the business. Rather, it is the result of an internal competition for Aviva employees, called the Customer Cup. Teams suggest an idea to solve a loosely defined problem, then go through increasingly challenging rounds to determine the winner. In Aviva Penny's case, the winning team was led by the company's in-house lawyers.

In for the long run: the hackathon trend gathers pace as firms look to foster innovation and collaboration Lawyers have latched on to the tech world's hackathon trend and are using one-offcompetitions to generate ideas. In the UK last year, the Courts and Tribunals Service and the Judiciary of England and Wales hosted such an event to design tools to support online courts.

Peter Lee, founder of legal engineering consultancy Wavelength.law, whose joint team with the Law Society of England and Wales won the event, says he is increasingly asked to run similar events for law firms and universities. "It's a really good way of getting people with different skills together," he says. "Within the hackathon environment, millennials really thrive and older partners can see what their skills are."

Law firm Pinsent Masons has hosted several events, including the London chapter of a global legal hackathon. Pinsents partner Alison Laird says the format encourages an agile and collaborative way of working that "continues long after a hackathon ends", adding: "We're already seeing more experimentation without the fear of failure."

Meanwhile, law firm Mills & Reeve has tried "innovation weeks" to keep lawyers motivated with a break from the daily grind. Last year, teams earned Lego bricks for solving problems and the team that built the tallest tower with them won. "The innovation weeks have been really successful at generating ideas and driving engagement," says partner Paul Knight.

The competitive format shows how innovative lawyers can be in developing new products when pushed out of their comfort zone. One team member, Andrea Lloyd, is not a technology expert but an in-house lawyer in the UK life insurance team. She says the competition played to lawyers' strengths: "As a lawyer, you are constantly having to think about all angles   you can't just think about something from one angle."

At law firm Freshfields, meanwhile, Feargus MacDaeid and Nnamdi Emelifeonwu had a different spur for their technological innovation. When Mr MacDaeid, who is registered as blind, started studying to be a lawyer as a new chapter in a career that had included a stint at Microsoft, the technology available did not make it easy. His wife had to read him the law textbooks needed for his studies.

As a newly qualified lawyer at Freshfields, the first trainee he worked with on a deal in his banking and finance team was Mr Emelifeonwu, who was fascinated by the way his colleague worked. "We started thinking, how could you make the job easier?" Mr MacDaeid says. "In a dream world, what would you do?" The result was Define: a software plug-in that helps lawyers access definitions in documents more easily without having to flick through lots of pages. It allows lawyers   including Mr MacDaeid   to quickly review defined terms in context, speeding up the drafting process.

The product, which has been piloted with Freshfields lawyers, has potential applications beyond law firms. "One person's problem became everyone's solution," says Mr MacDaeid. "[Define] creates time savings and efficiencies generally. It is very easy to see it as a niche product, but it naturally touches on all sorts of sectors   they use defined terms in fields such as engineering and medicine."

While Define was initially a self-funded side project for Mr MacDaeid and Mr Emelifeonwu, with external developers to help, the pair left Freshfields in August 2017 to work on it fulltime. The firm provided access to office space and kept them close to their target users, so they could continuously refine the program. They have just raised their first funding round of 150,000.

Lawyers at Bird & Bird have also moved into software development. Senior associate lawyer Matt Noble teamed up with Jane Mutimear and Richard Vary, partners in the law firm's intellectual property practice. They worked with their client, technology group Nokia, and a cast of economists, academics, statisticians and technical specialists for two years to develop a tool to value portfolios of patents accurately. The aim was to find a more effective approach than the traditional one of manually reviewing a handful of patents to form an idea of the value.

The tool, Pattern, was developed initially with Nokia and the smartphone patent wars in mind. "Pattern started work as a project within our normal practice area," says Ms Mutimear. "We were working with external economists to find a way to value a very large patent portfolio for our client."

Recognising that it would be impossible to review every patent manually, "we started by using some relatively simple tools to generate spreadsheets containing details on every patent in the relevant industry", she says. "It was a small step to hire some IT consultants to assist us with bringing in additional bibliographic information for each patent."

This achieved their aim but was time-consuming, she says. When the next project came along, the team looked unsuccessfully for off-the-shelf technology to help. "It made sense to do it in-house because we were the only people who had the knowledge of what we needed and how to achieve it   we just needed input in certain discrete areas," says Ms Mutimear.

The early version was limited, but Pattern has since emerged as a sophisticated tool with many possible uses. Hosted in the cloud and using big data, it contains details of every patent ever published, allowing it to be employed as a valuation tool for mergers and acquisitions or client portfolio management as easily as in litigation and infringement proceedings. The firm rolled Pattern out to clients under the firm's TwoBirds Client Solutions brand in 2017.

"We didn't imagine we would create something so ambitious. We got to where we are today by a series of smaller steps, accruing knowledge and building our expertise at each stage," says Ms Mutimear. "If we had imagined creating Pattern from the beginning, we may have been intimidated by the scope of the project and assumed we needed a nonlawyer to run [it]." That they did it themselves shows how adaptable the current generation of lawyers are.

Can the U.S. Keep Its High-Tech Edge? America still leads the world in innovative start-ups, but other countries are gaining fast. If we don't act, the next big thing will come from Beijing or Berlin.

While recent headlines have blared about the Trump administration's multi-front trade war with Canadian dairy farmers, Chinese manufacturers and the European Union's steel, aluminum and automotive industries, a much larger economic threat has gone virtually unnoticed. The high-tech startups that have provided the U.S. with a powerful edge in fields such as computers, software, mobile devices, biotech, the internet and an array of digital platforms now face rapidly increasing pressures from foreign competition.

This looming crisis of American innovation could undermine the nation's long-running global advantage in bringing to market the next new technology, the next new industry, the next big thing. It may well be the gravest challenge yet to America's century-plus hold on global economic hegemony.

For decades, the U.S. held a near monopoly on high-tech startups. From advanced aeronautics to the personal computer, from biotech to big data, social media, e-commerce, smartphones and the cloud, these small, ambitious companies, backed by venture capital, gave America an overwhelming advantage in key new industries and supercharged our economy. Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Netflix and Google all of them venture-backed startups within recent memory are now among the most valuable publicly traded companies in the world. Amazon, Netflix and Microsoft alone accounted for more than 70% of S&P 500 returns in 2018.

When we crunched the data on global venture capital investment over the past couple of decades, we found a startling decay in America's once-sturdy advantage. As late as the mid-1990s, the U.S. was home to roughly 95% of all venture capital investment in the world; today its share has dropped to just over 50%. About half of this two-decade decline has occurred in the last five years alone.

Venture capital activity in the U.S. continues to grow, with investments in American startups reaching around $90 billion in 2017. That total marks a 160% increase since 2010, and it beats all previous years except 2000 the peak of the dot-com boom. But venture capital investment in the rest of the world has grown more than twice as fast, by 375%, during the same seven-year period. It now totals about $80 billion. China gained the most ground, attracting nearly a quarter of all global venture capital investment in recent years, with India, the U.K., Germany, France, Israel, Singapore, Sweden and Japan together accounting for almost another fifth.

It would be a mistake, however, to see China or any other nation alone as America's singular rival. What we are experiencing instead is a collective, multilevel assault on our high-tech dominance from scores of places principally large, global cities. Venture capital now flows into Shanghai, Beijing and London at a rate that rivals New York and Boston. And other cities, such as Berlin, Paris, Stockholm, Singapore, Bangalore, Delhi, Mumbai and Tel Aviv, are rising fast; they are already on par with Seattle and Austin. This past year, the much sought-after startup Sidewalk Labs (Alphabet's urban innovation company) selected Toronto over a raft of American cities to build out a mixed-use, technologically enabled, experimental neighborhood.

Part of the challenge is that other nations have gotten better and smarter at playing the high-tech game. Over the past decade or so, they have increased their investments in research and innovation, strengthened their universities, worked hard to improve their own entrepreneurial ecosystems and dramatically upped their efforts to retain and attract the world's best and brightest talent. In just the past few years, more than 20 nations have launched startup visa programs designed to attract global entrepreneurs and innovators.

An even larger part of the problem is self-inflicted. America's innovation economy was long a beacon to the most talented and ambitious people in the world, who came in search of educational and economic opportunities. A third of U.S. venture-backed startups have at least one foreign-born founder, and that figure jumps to as much as half in Silicon Valley. But the U.S. has become much less welcoming to foreign talent in recent years a long-running trend that has come to a head with the Trump administration's efforts to restrict student and work visas and to clamp down on immigration.

Add to these developments the growing unaffordability and inequality of leading tech hubs such as San Francisco, Boston, New York and Seattle. High-tech entrepreneurialism thrives in dense, diverse urban environments. But America's leading tech hubs have become victims of their own success, increasingly unaffordable for the innovators and entrepreneurs who create new technologies and launch startups. It's hard to innovate and build new businesses when the proverbial "garage" that has launched so many startups costs a million dollars or more.

All is not lost, to be sure. The U.S. still punches well above its weight in high-tech entrepreneurship. Our share of global startups and venture capital investment is much larger than our population and economic output alone can account for. But we can no longer rest on our laurels. High-tech entrepreneurs from other countries can, and increasingly will, build their tech startups at home. It is no longer necessary for them to come to the U.S.

What can be done to turn things around?

For one, we must double down on talent and innovation. We need to continue to invest in our leading universities, to pump out new research and attract the brightest people from around the world. And we must ensure that global talent can stay in U.S. after graduating. We need to be tearing down walls instead of trying to build them up, by making more visas available for students, skilled workers and foreign-born entrepreneurs.

We also need to bolster the local tech ecosystems that enable homegrown entrepreneurs and startups. And we must relax our overly restrictive zoning and building codes to ensure that innovators, entrepreneurs and creatives can afford to build and launch their new companies in our leading tech hubs.

The first step on the road to recovery is to acknowledge that you have a problem. In just two decades, our lead in tech entrepreneurship has been cut in half, and that erosion is accelerating rapidly. If this continues, the next big thing, or things, will be launched in Shanghai, Bangalore, Berlin or Tel Aviv, not somewhere in America.

These are not partisan or ideological issues. If the U.S. continues to lose its edge in innovation, our living standards will eventually decline. It's time to stop being distracted by economic and political sideshows and to do what's necessary to ensure that the startup companies propelling the global high-tech economy into the future are American ones.

Recruiting startup ZipRecruiter Inc. said it has raised $156 million at a valuation of more than $1 billion.

The Series B round was co-led by Wellington Management and existing investor IVP.

Ian Siegel, chief executive and co-founder of ZipRecruiter, declined to say whether the deal included a secondary component.

Founded in 2010, the Santa Monica, Calif.-based company said it has raised $219 million in total.

ZipRecruiter's software for job seekers and hiring employers uses artificial intelligence to match candidates with jobs by identifying candidates with skills across a range of industries who might not have otherwise been considered for a specific job.

In addition, ZipRecruiter has focused on access to its service on mobile devices, where many candidates are job hunting, Mr. Siegel said.

"Everything we do is to provide quality candidates to employers and send quality jobs to job seekers," Mr. Siegel said.

More than 100,000 companies use ZipRecruiter's service, he added. Recruiters can create a job listing and simultaneously send it to a wide range of job sites using ZipRecruiter. More than 10 million job seekers a month use the service, he said.

Gormley's Take: An IPO Puts Humble Urology Market in the Limelight

By Brian Gormley

Urovant Sciences went public on Thursday in a deal that highlights a large market that has drawn little venture investment until recently.

The company, a spinoff of SoftBank-backed Roivant Sciences, is developing a drug to treat an overactive bladder, a condition that affects millions of Americans and is a serious public-health burden. Yet venture funding for this and other urological treatments has been sparse. In recent years the number of venture rounds completed in urology each year has typically been in the single digits, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

Diseases that are life-threatening have won more of the attention from venture firms. Overactive bladder may not shorten lives, but the frequent urination and incontinence patients suffer harms their quality of life. And because it is frequently seen in elderly people, it will likely command more attention as the population ages.

Mack's Take: VCs Are Putting Women's Health on the Agenda

By Heather Mack

It took a while for venture capitalists to see the allure of health-tech startups, and even longer to take a chance on those that focus specifically on women.

But investors are placing more bets on these companies, reflecting an increase in the number of women as both entrepreneurs and investors, and a move by employers to offer more benefits like fertility and maternity services.

Kate Ryder, founder of Maven Clinic, said her telemedicine company has seen solid growth over the past year because businesses are seeking better family-leave policies and supportive services for new or prospective parents.

"Employers are starting to realize what the definition of maternity actually is," said Ms. Ryder, whose company just raised a $27 million round led by Sequoia Capital and Oak HC/FT. "It's a long, 15-month process that is extremely stressful and costs a lot to employers."

The U.S. private sector added 230,000 jobs in September, more than economists were expecting, with midsize businesses and the service sector continuing to dominate those gains, according to a report.

Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal were expecting the report to show the private sector added 185,000 jobs.

Of the 230,000 jobs the private sector added in September, 99,000 were for medium-size businesses, or firms that employ between 50 and 499 workers, according to payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody's Analytics.

Large businesses, which have at least 500 employees, added 75,000 jobs and small businesses, with 49 employees or less, added 56,000 jobs.

Most of the jobs were in the service sector, which added 184,000 jobs. In that sector, the professional and business services category added the most, followed by the education and health services category.

The goods-producing sector added 46,000 jobs, the most of which were in construction.

"At the current pace of job creation, unemployment will fall into the low 3%'s by this time next year," Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said in prepared remarks.

A Hotter Planet Reprices Risk Around the World --- Insurance industry is at the vanguard of evaluating a warmer future

When a wildfire engulfed the Canadian oil-sands boomtown of Fort McMurray two years ago, it hit insurance company Aviva PLC out of nowhere.

The British firm had been active in Canada since 1835. Its actuaries long believed wildfire risk to homes in the area was almost nonexistent, it says. Yet flames on the town's outskirts roared across an area larger than Delaware, forcing 100,000 people to evacuate and leaving insurers with $3 billion in damages to cover.

"That is not a type of loss we have experienced in that part of the world, ever," says Maurice Tulloch, the Toronto-based chief executive of Aviva's international insurance division. "The previous models wouldn't have envisioned it."

Aviva studied the incident and concluded the wildfire was an example of how the earth's gradually warming temperature is changing the behavior of natural catastrophes. Aviva increased premiums in Canada as a result.

The effects of the planet's slow heating are diffuse. Predictions of the fallout are imprecise, and the drivers are debated. But faced with the prospect of a warming planet, the world of business and finance is starting to put a price on climate change.

The price of homes on the U.S.'s eastern seaboard battered by fiercer storms and higher seas is lagging behind those inland. The price of farmland is rising in North America's once-frigid reaches, partly because of bets it will become more temperate. Investors are turning fresh water into an asset, a wager in part that climate change will make it scarcer.

Insurers are at the forefront of calculating the impact. "We don't discuss the question anymore of, 'Is there climate change,' " says Torsten Jeworrek, chief executive for reinsurance at Munich Re, the world's largest seller of reinsurance -- insurance for insurers. "For us, it's a question now for our own underwriting."

For the most part, insurers are acting on climate change by building models that aim to better estimate the impact. That leaves the industry with the tough question of how to reflect in premiums the new understandings of the underlying risk.

"It takes a lot of premium, a lot of margin, to account for this increased uncertainty, and I'm not sure we're doing a good job of reflecting this and charging appropriately for it," said Marc Grandisson, chief executive of insurer Arch Capital Group Ltd., at an industry conference Thursday. "We need to incorporate a greater range of possible outcomes into our pricing."

Arch has written less property-catastrophe reinsurance in recent years as prices have dropped and as industry results have been volatile, in part due to losses attributed to climate change, Arch spokesman Donald Watson says.

After the Canadian wildfire, Aviva's changes to its risk models filtered into its home-insurance premiums in Canada, which increased by roughly 6% since 2016, partly because of its research into catastrophe risks.

For most insurers, rates aren't rising -- yet. A flood of capital into the industry from pension and hedge-fund investors, driven by low interest rates, has increased competition and pushed down property-catastrophe reinsurance prices in the past decade.

And property insurance and reinsurance contracts typically last one year, so an insurer can recalibrate yearly as risks change. "Global warming may be occurring. Probably is," says Warren Buffett, chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which has a major reinsurance business. "But it hasn't hurt the reinsurance industry. And people are pricing still as if it won't, on a one-year basis."

If reinsurance contracts covered 30 years, he says, "I'd be crazy not to" include the risks.

Understanding how weather is changing is laborious and plagued by the same uncertainty that prevents weekly forecasts from being precise. The genesis of a major hurricane, say, depends on factors such as wind shear -- the wind pattern that gives hurricanes a whirling shape -- not just the warming surface temperature that fuels it. One changing factor may make a storm more likely to be dangerous, but another could shift it on a path away from land or cities.

Big insurers are expanding teams of in-house climatologists, computer scientists and statisticians to redesign models to incorporate the effect of the warming earth on hailstorms, hurricanes, flooding and wildfires. Insurers such as Swiss Re Group say hurricanes like Harvey and Florence, which caused widespread flooding, could represent a more common occurrence in the coming decades.

Climate change may be gradual, but the effects are volatile, meaning a company could become exposed to a large, unexpected hit if it doesn't understand the changing risks, says Junaid Seria, head of catastrophe-model research and development and governance at Paris-based reinsurer Scor SE.

"We're in the camp that believes you can have an increased potential for an outsized loss in a single year," he says. "There's a cost for inaction."

The industry has historically changed after big disasters. Natural-catastrophe modeling took off after Hurricane Andrew struck Florida on Aug. 24, 1992, causing an estimated $15.5 billion of insured losses. Thirteen insurance companies were ordered liquidated, according to ratings firm A.M. Best Co.

Catastrophe models -- computer algorithms that analyze disasters and property data to predict losses -- grew more sophisticated over time. Their secret sauce was building databases of weather events going back decades.

Climate change upends that strategy because scientists broadly believe the future is likely to be very different from the prior decades that are the basis for these models. The climate has grown about 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit warmer since the late 19th century. A consensus of scientists puts blame substantially on emissions of greenhouse gases from cars, farms and factories.

The team of 35 scientists and engineers at Swiss Re who test and update its internal catastrophe models found that the decades of torrential rainfall that had long been a part of the model were no longer useful for predicting risks in some regions, because rain now falls so much more heavily and frequently there. They now use just the past 25 years, Swiss Re says.

Using a shorter observation period has shown a higher rate of torrential downpours resulting in property damage in many parts of the world. That has made rainfall a higher-priority peril for Swiss Re, the company says.

AIR Worldwide, a unit of Verisk Analytics Inc. that sells catastrophe models to insurers, since about 2010 has limited many of its models to the most recent 30 to 35 years of data, says director of meteorology Peter Sousounis. It previously used data going back to as early as 1951. For capturing both longer-term and shorter-term trends, he says, "we feel that that's a good compromise."

There has been an acceleration of studies over recent years by university and government researchers using statistical techniques -- broadly called attribution science -- that show the correlation between the changing climate and the characteristics of individual weather events. They use the same techniques to show the burning of fossil fuels can be a driver of those results.

Insurers such as Munich Re are analyzing those studies and conducting research to focus on the potential for increased losses to the insurer that could reduce its profits. "We can only accept risk and put risks on our books if we understand them properly," says Ernst Rauch, Munich Re's global head of climate and public-sector business development. That, he says, is "why we are so interested in climate change."

Munich Re researchers found a significant increase in storms with hailstones larger than a penny in diameter between 1979 and 2016 in central and southern Europe, causing higher losses during that period. Munich Re concluded such storms will get worse, something previous models didn't show. "We believe there is a strong indication that climate change is a driver of this trend," Mr. Rauch says. Those conclusions, he says, led Munich Re to order a redesign of the risk model for hailstorm-insurance losses that helps set the price of its premiums. "This might entail many things," he says, "in some regions also an adjustment in price."

A 2015 study from professors at Princeton University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found the warming planet is increasing the chance a major hurricane could enter the Persian Gulf, home to hundreds of billions of dollars of petroleum equipment and assets.

Such cyclones periodically hit Oman and Yemen but have never been observed in the Persian Gulf, climate researchers say. The researchers found that, with new conditions due to warming, some cyclones could enter the Gulf in the future and could also form in the Gulf itself.

"Climate change makes the historical record of extreme weather an unreliable indicator of the current risk," says Stephen Pacala, a board member at Hamilton Insurance Group Ltd. and a Princeton professor, who wasn't involved in the study. "So, what's the insurance industry to do? No hurricane has ever threatened the massive unarmored oil and gas infrastructure in the Persian Gulf."

Markus Stowasser, head of catastrophe research and development at Allianz SE's reinsurance unit, says computer simulations show an increase in the probability of "extreme gray swan events," expected but rare phenomena such as hurricanes, forming in the Persian Gulf. ("Black swan" events are both unexpected and rare.) The simulations show such events still don't seem likely near-term.

Insurers' most immediate climate peril is water. More heat means more moisture held in the atmosphere and greater precipitation. Melting ice is pushing up sea levels. A 2013 study in the journal Nature projected average flood losses for the world's 136 biggest coastal cities could rise from $6 billion a year in 2005 to $52 billion a year by 2050 due to increased population and development. When taking climate change and a sea-level rise into account, flood losses could exceed $1 trillion a year by 2050, the study concluded, unless the cities invested about $50 billion annually in adapting.

Hurricanes historically caused wind damage. But Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas in August 2017, spent weeks absorbing 33 trillion gallons of water, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It dumped more than 60 inches of rain and caused tens of billions of dollars in flood damage.

The probability of a Texas storm dropping about 20 inches of rain was about 1% a year between 1981 and 2000, but will likely increase to 18% a year by 2100, according to a 2017 study by Kerry Emanuel, an MIT professor of atmospheric science who says changing climate conditions are driving the trend.

"As the atmosphere warms, we see great rainfall rates," says Marla Schwartz, atmospheric-perils specialist at Swiss Re. Referring to Harvey, she says: "We might expect to see something more often like that in the future."

Hurricane Florence, which hit North Carolina last month, behaved similarly to Harvey and dropped more than 30 inches of rain on parts of the state.

Increased flood damage also presents an opportunity to insurers. As more regions become exposed to flooding, insurers expect the market for flood insurance to grow. Much of Harvey's flood damage wasn't covered, insurers say, because the industry has historically excluded floods from residential policies. "What we call the protection gap is still huge," says Edouard Schmid, group chief underwriting officer at Swiss Re. "We of course want to offer solutions around risks, including climate risks."

Changing risk probabilities may make some areas uninsurable altogether, or at least so risky the cost would be prohibitively expensive for insurance buyers, executives say.

Allianz, one of the world's largest insurers, says it sold the retail business of U.S. insurer Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. in 2015 in part because climate change is increasing the risk of losses to coastal homes in California and Florida.

"Coastal flooding will clearly become a bigger issue in the long term," Swiss Re's Mr. Schmid says. "We can offer protection for hurricane losses or flood losses or other perils, but if certain coastal areas are so exposed, insurance becomes no longer viable. It becomes even uninsurable."

British banks shudder at Goldman Marcus launch

New US player offers savings account 3x more generous than the established banks

Marcus, Goldman Sachs s new online-only consumer bank, has crossed the Atlanticand caused a stir on the notoriously stingy British high street by launching a savings account three times more generous than the established players. All eyes are on where the Wall Street giant takes Marcus next.

Created from scratch two years ago,Marcusis set to follow the same playbook it did in the US, where it has grown into a $26bn retail business that now also refinances expensive credit card debt for customers and is starting to use AI to cross-sell other financial products. It already generates $1bn in revenue helping Goldman diversify away from investment banking.

Insiders at the American groupsay that in the long term it'sinterested in expanding into unsecured consumer lending and credit cards in Britain. It is even considering branching out into home loans and car finance. A Goldman mortgage, anyone?

Styled like a perfume    Marcus, by Goldman Sachs    the bank is trying to gain an initial UK foothold by offering a market-leading rate of 1.5 per cent for a no-fee, instant-access account. By comparison, high street stalwart HSBC offers a 0.55 per cent rate for a similar product, which drops to 0.1 per cent any month a withdrawal is made.

Building Marcus from scratch means Goldman is unencumbered by creaking legacy computer systems and can moreeasily branch out into new products, for example ones that target wealthy clients   something that already has British rivals tracking its progress nervously.

 We need to watch them closely, if they get the retail banking business working successfully, they ll soon be looking to move into other areas, which is bad news for European wealth managers,  says Julian Chillingworth, chief investment officer of Rathbone investment management.  They will be a dangerous competitor with their firepower. 

While Marcus has been consciously branded differently to its investment banking cousin, its executives have been typically bullish, saying they have  no ceiling  on their ambition and want to pick off customers from Britain's big-four lenders, not only the smaller challenger banks. Competitors have already responded by jacking up their own interest rates.

 Goldman Sachs is a well-known name so its arrival is highly visible and throws down the gauntlet to the rest of the industry,  says Shakila Hashmi of consumer website Compare the Market.  We expect a high degree of interest in switches to Marcus. 

However, it will be more difficult for Goldman to repeat its US success in the UK, a notoriously competitive market with stricter regulations around use of deposits. British bank customers are also stubbornly loyal   even TSB only suffered a net reduction of 6,000 current account customers in the three months after its IT meltdown in April.

In the US, Marcus was launched in part to provide a new way to fund Goldman s traditional investment banking operations. In Britain, banks are no longer allowed to use such methods and have spent billions in recent years separating their retail and trading operations.

If and when Goldman hits the so-called  ringfencing  threshold of 25bn it will be forced to do the same, an expensive and time-consuming process that also means it can t use deposits to cross-subsidise the securities and trading side of the business.

There are other drawbacks. For example, Goldman hasn t developed an app yet   customers have to access Marcus on a web page  and since the launch on Thursday only about 2,000 people have signed up, a good but not exactly a stellar performance for the market-leading product.

The real prizes lie beyond the savings market, according to analysts. Goldman recently bought a US personal financial management app called Clarity Money, which builds a picture of a customer s overall financial situation and provides  actionable prompts    such asreal-time and location-based adverts  using machine learning and artificial intelligence.

 It s not hard to grow deposits when you re offering rates at the top of the market, so you cannot judge Marcus s success in terms of volume,  says Keith Horowitz, analyst at Citigroup.  The big key for Goldman ultimately is customer data, that s the holy grail for banking, creating an open financial marketplace platform that can also utilise their huge balance sheet. 

Further fintech fascination

Eastern pioneersJapan will this month become the first major economy to launch a domestic payments system based on blockchain technology when three Japanese banks start offering customers free real-time money transfers via a new mobile app. The launch of the MoneyTap system, which secured approval for its licence from Japan's ministry of finance last month, could be an important step in helping Japan to achieve its goal of reducing the use of cash, which still accounts for 80 per cent of transactions in the country. The new platform has been developed by SBI Ripple Asia, a joint venture between Japan s SBI Holdings and US blockchain specialist Ripple.Meanwhile,more than 75 big banks are joining a JPMorgan-backed blockchain project to fight the threat of new cross-border paymentrivals in what will be the regulated banking industry s largest application of the technology.

Mining maniaBitmain Technologies has filed to list its shares in Hong Kong in what could be the world s largest cryptocurrency initial public offering. The Chinese company s prospectus details three years of phenomenal growth, with revenues surging ninefold to $2.84bn in the six months to the end of June. However, Lex says the moment has already passed forthe world s biggest bitcoin-mining equipment maker as bitcoin prices are crumbling, scything the cost of its equipment.

Payments pay-offStripe, the online payments provider for companies including Uber and Spotify, is now worth more than $20bn after its latest funding round, during which it raised $245m to grow in Asia. Eight years old, Stripe is the brainchild of Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison, who have expandedinto a broader range of services to support businesses operating online, including handling things such as business incorporation, issuing credit cards and billing.

Unicorn checkedFunding Circle priced its initial public offering at the bottom end of its range in London, a sign enthusiasm for the UK's biggest peer-to-peer lending platform had faded somewhat. Still, while it missed its target valuation by 300m, it s still worth 1.5bn  not too shabby for founders Samir Desai and James Meekings, especially since the eight year old company has yet to make a profit.

Bits and bobs

Spanish insurrectionMirroring Marcus, BBVA s US digital bank Simple has started offering a 2.02 per cent interest rate for on-demand savings in a move likely to heap pressure on larger banks to follow suit. The Spanish lender s move will attract attention considering the average rate on deposits in US checking accounts is only 0.08 per cent.

Swiss start-upA pair of former UBS bankers has raised 80m to set up a regulated  crypto investment bank  in Switzerland. SEBA Crypto AG is one of a number of start-ups hoping to become the region s first regulated cryptocurrency bank. It plans to apply for a traditional banking and securities dealer licence from the Swiss financial regulatorand it hopes to have one by the middle of next year.

Fraud chargesRenaud Laplanche, a pioneer of the online lending industry in the US, has been banned from the securities industry as part of a settlement with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. The SEC has charged Lending Club Asset Management, and Mr Laplanche as its former president, with fraud. LCAM is an investment management subsidiary of Lending Club, the peer-to-peer lender that Mr Laplanche helped found and where he served as chief executive until 2016.

Life after the boardFormer Standard Life chief executive Sir Sandy Crombie has joined the board of LendingCrowd, the Edinburgh-based fintech lender that s arranged 45m of loans,reports the Scotsman. Mr Crombie, who is also a former non-executive director of Royal Bank of Scotland, joined Standard Life in 1966 as a trainee actuary and was appointed head of Standard Life Investments in 1994.

China's shadow banking curbs set to boost mutual funds with 'great wall of capital'

Asset management

China's clampdown on risky wealth management products and a push by global asset managers to sell funds in the country is set to channel about $6tn of capital into the mutual fund market over the next five years, according to a new report.

A "great wall of capital" has formed in China as a result of a rapidly growing, wealthier and ageing population, although a lot of this money is sitting in deposits and bank portfolios, consultancy firm McKinsey said.

However, a recent crackdown by Chinese regulators to curb off balance sheet lending by banks, and initiatives to spur the development of the asset management industry by allowing foreign asset managers to set up operations on the mainland, is expected to result in a flood of capital into mutual funds.

Earlier this year, China's securities regulator ruled that foreign asset managers could control 51 per cent of a local securities joint venture, further opening the gate for overseas mutual fund companies to set up onshore. Foreign asset managers' efforts to establish businesses in mainland China have historically been hampered by numerous regulatory restrictions, which are increasingly loosening. Chinese authorities at the end of last year tightened rules to stop banks from offering retail investors wealth management products marketed as higher yielding alternatives to deposits.

The regulation will mean trillions of dollars sat in these products will "be looking for a home over the next couple of years", the McKinsey report said.

"The big opportunity is China," said Jacob Dahl, a senior partner at McKinsey, based in Hong Kong. "About 40 per cent of Asia assets under management is currently in China."

China has seen strong inflows from foreign investors despite the trade war with the US.

Figures from Z-Ben Advisors, a data and analytics company, show that foreign ownership of Chinese equities and bonds has grown 64 per cent to $435bn over the past 12 months.

Asia more broadly has the fastest growth in the number of wealthy individuals globally. Hong Kong recently surpassed New York City as the place with the highest concentration of ultrarich people, according to a report by data firm Wealth-X. Asia's wealth market, comprising personal finance assets that are largely held with banks and insurance groups, is poised to more than double by 2025 to $30tn, overtaking the US and Western Europe.

McKinsey said that wealthy individuals, rapid GDP growth and the rise of entrepreneurs were "producing a strong affluent cohort".

Although the opportunity is lucrative, foreign fund managers face numerous challenges. One is the need for a local distribution partner in China, in order to have brand traction among domestic investors.

"I do see there being more partnerships between assets managements and some of the Chinese technology platforms," said Mr Dahl. "Tech firms such as Ant Financial, Ping An and Tencent have had successes so far in money market and deposit products," he added. Global asset managers are also nervous about taking the plunge, given the uncertainty over the trade war with the US, and the cost of resources needed to enter the market.

Cyber Daily: Fines, Settlements Await Companies Caught in Cybersecurity Mishaps

Regulators Hold Voya, Uber Accountable for Cybersecurity Missteps

By Adam Janofsky

Federal and state regulators this week announced settlements with two multibillion-dollar firms over separate alleged cybersecurity failings.

The penalties, for incidents at Voya Financial Advisors Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc., are a sign that regulators--which have updated guidance and lobbied for stricter data breach notification laws in recent months--also are aggressively investigating firms and enforcing these policies, cybersecurity experts said.

"Regulators have the resources to carry out these investigations, the qualified people to do the work, and seeing this as a one-off warning shot is not the way to look at it," said Alan Brill, senior managing director at risk-consulting firm Kroll Inc.

On Wednesday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced that Voya would pay $1 million to settle charges regarding "failures in cybersecurity policies and procedures" that allegedly contributed to a breach that compromised the personal information of at least 5,600 customers. The settlement was the first SEC enforcement action involving the Identity Theft Red Flags Rule, which went into effect in 2013 and is designed to protect confidential customer data.

Raj Badhwar, the chief information security officer at Voya Financial Inc., the parent company of Voya Financial Advisors, said at a cybersecurity conference Thursday that the financial industry must adopt machine learning and artificial intelligence technology to combat the growing issue of fraud.

"There's a lot of financial fraud that goes on. The problem is not that we can't detect it, but the volume of fraud is so high now that you have to have the capability figuring out the false positives," said Mr. Badhwar, speaking at New York Institute of Technology's Cyber Security Conference in New York. "That's what I think is an actual challenge for us & figuring out what is the fraud, who did it and what is the risk, because I don't want to spend $1 million for fraud that is $100."

Mr. Badhwar, who was speaking about the state of the industry as a whole and not about Voya or the SEC settlement in particular, joined Voya in July. He was previously global head of information security for American International Group Inc.

In the incident at Voya Financial Advisors in April 2016, an individual or group impersonated unspecified Voya contractors, called the company's technical support line and requested three passwords to access the firm's web portal, according to the SEC. In two of those instances, the impersonators used phone numbers that Voya previously had found to be associated with fraudulent activity. Additionally, three hours later, an impersonated contractor told Voya he received an email confirming a password change he didn't request.

Voya responded to the incident, but did not kick the intruders off the accounts "due to deficient cybersecurity controls and an erroneous understanding" of the web portal contractors used to access Voya customer data, including personally identifiable information, according to the SEC.

"Having great standards for cybersecurity isn't enough. What the Commission is saying is that yes, you have to have those standards, but they also have to be appropriate and you have to actually do what it says," said Mr. Brill.

Voya did not admit or deny the SEC's findings.

"Voya promptly addressed and reported the incident when it occurred two years ago, and we notified the individuals who were involved," a company spokesman told WJ Pro Cybersecurity in a statement. "No personal information was downloaded from our systems, and there was no evidence of financial harm. We have also enhanced our measures so that a similar situation does not reoccur."

Also on Wednesday, Uber and New York's Attorney General said the company would pay $148 million to settle allegations with all 50 states and the District of Columbia that it intentionally concealed a data breach in 2016, The Wall Street Journal reported. Last November, Uber said it paid hackers $100,000 to conceal the incident, which involved names email addresses and mobile phone numbers belonging to about 57 million riders and drivers.

Both settlements were with regulators that have made cybersecurity a focus in recent years.

In February, the SEC updated its guidance, asking companies to disclose more details about cybersecurity risks and incidents. In March, Alabama and South Dakota became the last two states to pass data breach notification laws. Other states, such as Arizona and Colorado, have updated their laws to include stricter timelines for notifying victims and expand the definition of personal information.

Big Number: 60%

Percentage of 664 security professionals at large enterprises who expect their security budgets to rise in the next year, according to the 2018 IDG Security Priorities Survey by International Data Group Inc. This is up from 42% who predicted spending increases in 2017.

*************************************

Facebook uses phone numbers to target ads. Facebook Inc. confirmed to TechCrunch it uses the phone numbers users provide for two-factor authentication purposes to target advertisements. The revelation comes after Gizmodo reported that Facebook uses information about users taken from friends' contact lists. Researchers told Gizmodo that Facebook was using data "that was not directly provided by the user, or even revealed to the user."

Hacker says he'll try to delete Zuckerberg's Facebook. A teenager in Taiwan said he will livestream this Sunday his attempt to hack Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook Inc. page, Bloomberg reports. Chang Chi-yuan works as a bug bounty hunter, detecting vulnerabilities in corporate software in exchange for rewards, Bloomberg said. But it is unusual for researchers to broadcast their work in real-time, which he plans to do starting at 6:00 p.m. local time, according to Bloomberg.

Apple hacker sentenced. An Australian court sentenced a teenager to eight months of probation after he pleaded guilty to hacking into Apple Inc. systems over several months and downloading sensitive data, Bloomberg reported. The hacker's name was withheld because he was a juvenile, age 16, when the hacking began. He used a virtual private network to bypass Apple's firewalls and remove data, including internal security policies and authentication keys, according to Bloomberg. Apple detected the intrusion in November 2016 and alerted the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Port of San Diego hit with ransomware attack. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were investigating a ransomware attack affecting the information technology systems at the Port of San Diego, Reuters reported Thursday. The cyberattack has disrupted services including park permits and public records requests, Reuters reported. Boat traffic and public safety operations haven't been interrupted. Port officials declined to reveal the amount of money hackers demanded to unlock IT systems.

Most U.S. routers need updates. About 83% of the routers in U.S. homes and offices are vulnerable to cyberattacks because their firmware isn't updated often enough, according to CyberScoop. The finding is part of a study by the nonprofit American Consumer Institute Center for Citizen Research, which discovered more than 32,000 vulnerabilities in a sample of 186 routers, according to CyberScoop. Twenty-eight percent of the problems were classified as "high-risk" or "critical." The Federal Bureau of Investigation in May warned that Russian hackers could compromise hundreds of thousands of routers to carry out cybercrimes.

Vietnam jails Facebook user for alleged anti-government posts. A Vietnamese court sentenced a Facebook Inc. user to two-and-a-half years in prison for writing posts critical of the Communist Party government, according to Reuters. Bui Manh Dong, 40, was convicted of "abusing democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests of the state," Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security said, according to Reuters. The conviction comes amid opposition in Silicon Valley to a Vietnamese law that could require U.S. technology companies to store data in Vietnam, Reuters said.

Blackstone Group LP has bolstered the senior bench of its recently launched insurance investment management platform with two new hires.

The firm said it has appointed Tsana Nobles to the role of chief risk officer and Molly Sheinberg as head of marketing for the new insurance team.

Ms. Nobles, who previously worked as head of global strategy and investments at reinsurer company XL Catlin Ltd., will be in charge of assessing investment and insurance risks. She will also be responsible for developing the insurance business's risk and analytics framework, Blackstone said. Prior to joining XL Catlin, Ms. Nobles served as chief risk officer of Investments at insurance company Axis Capital Ltd.

Ms. Sheinberg, former executive director in J.P. Morgan Asset Management's global fixed-income team, has joined Blackstone as head of marketing. Ms. Sheinberg previously worked in a number of roles at insurer American Insurance Group Inc.

Blackstone, which had $439 billion of assets under management as of June 30, launched the insurance investment management platform in January and hired a squad of senior executives to develop the new business.

The new unit, Blackstone Insurance Solutions, advises insurers on investment-grade private credit, private equity, real estate, and hedge funds, the firm said on its website.

Blackstone recruited Chris Blunt, former president of New York Life's Investments Group, to lead the new unit as chief executive and senior managing director. Blackstone Senior Managing Director Martin Alderson Smith joined the insurance arm from the firm's corporate development group in January, the firm said in an earlier statement.

Other executives in Blackstone's insurance firm include Michael McRaith, former director of the U.S. Department of Treasury's Federal Insurance Office; Erich Schram, former chief investment officer at Guggenheim Life and Annuity Co.; and Kevin Relihan, former managing director in Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s asset-management insurance business, Blackstone said.

Founded in 1985, New York-based Blackstone is the world's largest private-equity firm by assets under management. It has businesses across its flagship buyout, real-estate and credit strategies, according to its website.

Stripe payments company hits $20bn valuation

San Francisco-based group raises $245m in latest fundraising as it eyes global expansion

Stripe has joined the top ranks of private technology groups with a valuation of $20bn, more than double what the US payments company was judged to be worth when it last raised money less than two years ago.

The San Francisco-based company acts as the online payments backbone for a growing list of customers that recently expanded to include Uber and Spotify. It said it would use the money from its latest fundraising to expand faster around the world, especially in Asia.

Its latest $245m investment round puts Stripe alongside shared office company WeWork and data analytics concern Palantir in terms of valuation, and makes it one of only five private US tech companies that have reached a value of at least $20bn.

Stripe was founded eight years ago by the Irish brothers Patrick and John Collison, who saw the chance to build a simpler payments infrastructure for the growing number of businesses that were coming to rely on online commerce. It has since expanded into a broader range of services to support businesses operating online, including handling things such as business incorporation, issuing credit cards and billing.

The valuations of some other online payment companies have also soared recently as investors have bet on those thought to have the best chance of becoming wider platforms supporting ecommerce.

Square, co-founded by Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey, has seen its stock market value balloon to $39bn this year, compared to only about $3bn at the time it went public three years ago. Meanwhile PayPal, part of an earlier wave of tech start-ups, benefited from a re-rating on Wall Street last year, boosting its value to more than $100bn.

Tech companies targeted in mission to develop new spy tools

Intelligence agencies look to invest in private sector with 85m venture capital fund

Technology companies are to be offered the chance to help developthe next generation of spy tools as part of an 85m venture capital fund backed by intelligence chiefs.

The National Security Strategic Investment Fund (NSSIF) was announced by chancellor Philip Hammond in last year s budget to boost investment in the UK s security technology sector.

This week, the government-owned British Business Bank, which is running the fund, will begin to encourage private fund managers to promote the programme with a view to raising additional money from fund managers and private investors.

It is thought to be the first time the UK s main intelligence and security agencies, led by the foreign intelligence service MI6, have actively looked to invest in the private sector.

After decades of producing top secret espionage technology and equipment in-house, analysts said Britain s spy agencies had been overtaken by the private tech sector in developing encryption, surveillance and data research software.

 Whereas in the past the kind of technologies needed by intelligence agencies were produced by government agencies, the commoditisation of these technologies now means that the private sector is the major source of technical innovation,  said Nigel Inkster, an analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a think-tank, and a former director of operations and intelligence at MI6.

However a UK security official insisted the move  would not usurp sovereign research and development capabilities , adding:  This is about marrying with and supporting what s there. 

A briefing document published by the British Business Bank in July, said the scheme was designed to combine  the best expertise from the public and private sectors to foster the growth of high potential UK companies and at the same time contribute to the national security mission . It is hoped any new tools developed as a result of the fund will also have use in the commercial sector.

To guide companies considering applying for funding, the government has set out 11  technology areas  that are of greatest interest to the UK national security community, which also includes the domestic security service MI5, digital and signals intelligence agency GCHQ and the National Crime Agency.

These include data analytics and artificial intelligence, technologies to track financial information and new computing tools that highlight or obscure identifying information about individuals and groups.

In the wake of the Edward Snowden leaks in 2013, which revealed the extent of online surveillance and data collection by US and UK intelligence agencies, spy chiefs will be aware of public nervousness over the deeper use of new technologies and the potential for security breaches.

As part of the NSSIF application process companies and their directors will undergo strict national security vetting.

Close collaboration between the intelligence community and the private sector is more common in the US, where the CIA set up a Silicon Valley venture capital company, InQtel, to work with tech start-ups in the 1990s.

The Home Office announced in February it had invested 600,000 in a new artificial intelligence tool to target Isis propaganda videos, developed by London-based tech firm ASI Data Science.

ASI s chief executive Marc Warner said last week there was nevertheless  an aversion among civil servants to working with start-ups for fear they will fail .

Writing in the Telegraph, Mr Warner added:  Singapore and Norway have shown it is possible for governments to act more like venture capitalists, using sovereign wealth funds to back innovative new players.

JPMorgan s $11bn fintech bazooka

Scale of bank s spending on fintech has spooked some rivals

How do you sign off on an $11bn fintech budget? According to JPMorgan Chase's chief financial officer Marianne Lake, you do it one dollar at a time.

In an interview with the FT, the finance boss of the bank with the greatest technology spending power on Wall Street, said she doesn t sign off on the bumper package in one go. Instead, she said:  We sign off at the first dollar and every dollar thereafter. 

The resulting$10.8bn tally for this year   which is roughly split 50/50 between  change the bank  and  run the bank  spend   has helped JPMorgan position itself at the vanguard of innovation and to instil awe and envy in many rivals.

 We have never felt constrained by dollars on budgets,  said Ms Lake.  Our budget is set by the opportunity to derive shareholder value. 

JPMorgan s fintech spend has to, of course, be viewed in the context of its size. Only the big Chinese banks and HSBC   which recently announced plans to spend $15bn-$17bn over three years mostly on technology   can match JPMorgan s $2.6tn of assets.

"$11bn is a lot in dollar terms, but it is about 10 per cent of revenues, which is what large and complex institutions like JPMorgan are spending on technology,  said Betsy Graseck, a banks analyst at Morgan Stanley.  It is table stakes in an extremely competitive market. 

Still, the scale of the spending has spooked some rivals whichcan never hope to deploy similar resources.

Spending on technologyby banks in the Americas, Europe and Asia-Pacific is forecast to increase 4.2 per cent this year to just over $261bn, of which 45 per cent is in North America and only 32 per cent in Europe, according to research group Celent (chart below).

Banks in Europe are particularly attuned to how heavily they are being outspent; Deutsche Bank s entire non interest cost base last year was less than $30bn, UBS s 2017 operating expenses were less than $25bn, Credit Suisse s were below $18.5bn, of which about $3bnis spenton technology.

Executives at Deutsche and Credit Suisse in particular, where cost cutting programmes are still in full swing, can scarcely remember a time when they were  not constrained by budget  much less imagine one in the future.

There is an argument about the value of being first   with all the costs that entails   versus being a fast follower or even a later adopter. Executives at some banks argue that novelty isn t worth the mammoth cost, and that big spends can lead to profligacy.

 People are not fast and loose with our money,  said Ms Lake.  There is a lot of judgment and discipline and approval processes around these investments that serve as a decent safety net. 

JPMorgan employs 50,000 technology specialists   or a fifth of its total workforce   and has claimed some eye-catching firsts, including using artificial intelligence to execute securities trades. Ms Lake described AI as  an important part of our spend  but  not large in the context of the overall investments we re making .

Investments in technology allowed the bank to launch alow cost digital share trading platform last month, which is helping it counter the threat from online brokerages like Charles Schwab and commission-free upstarts like Robinhood.

JPMorgan is also one of the three founding members of theInterbank Information Network, a pilot that uses distributed ledger technology   aka blockchain   to facilitate more efficient payments between banks and across borders   aiming to keep pace with the onward march of payments start-ups.

David Hudson, who heads up digital transformation at JPMorgan s corporate and investment bank, said the bank wanted to deliver solutions  regardless of whether we build them internally or deliver them through partnerships  and that the key was to make sure that JPMorgan can serve clients  wherever and whenever they want to transact .

 It s not about having the biggest technology spend on Wall Street, that s not what we think about,  said Ms Lake.  It s about identifying what is strategically important to our clients 	. 	. 	. 	It s never about bigger is better, it s about constantly driving our long term strategy. 

Further fintech fascination

Brexit RevolutionariesThe UK s fastest-growing fintech of scale is laying the groundwork to join the great Brexodus in case the UK s negotiations to leave the common market don t go smoothly. Revolut this week told the FT that it had applied for an e-money licence application in Luxembourg  just to be on the safe side  in case the banking licence it expects Lithuania to grant it next month does not cover all the bases in time. Meanwhile, new investment funds being launched by Revolut and its smaller rival Plum are designed to encourage more millennials to invest by appealing to the smartphone generation.

Paper over the cracksThe president of the Financial Action Task Force, Marshall Billingslea, said he is optimistic that at its plenary, due in October, the FATF will agree a series of standards that will close the anti-money laundering  gaps  that all nations face. He said the adoption of anti-money laundering standards and regimes pertaining to digital assets and virtual currencies is  very much a patchwork quilt or spotty process,  which is  creating significant vulnerabilities for both national and international financial systems .

Banking & Finance: Buoyant Markets Sting Bearish Hedge Funds

Nearly a decade into what feels like a never-ending bull market, it is getting awfully lonely for a group of maverick hedge funds betting on what they think will be a coming financial meltdown.

"If my analysis is right, we're past the point of no return," said Francesco Filia, founder of $500 million London-based Fasanara Capital, who has pivoted his $100 million macro fund to bet on a market crash. "Nothing else will do than having cash or shorts," he said.

So far, Mr. Filia's analysis has been painfully wrong. His fund has shrunk to around $100 million from around $160 million. Mr. Filia and his ilk believe a decade of central-bank bond buying, known as quantitative easing, has artificially inflated asset prices and created huge market distortions. Moves in the U.S. to raise interest rates and cut bondholdings and in the eurozone to stop QE could, they think, provide the catalyst for disaster.

It also has become an increasingly controversial trade as central banks have slowly tightened monetary policy without causing a crash.

Speculating against a widely held market consensus can mean a lonely -- and often painful -- road.

"Pretty much immediately when we went more bearish we started to see the funds going out," said Mr. Filia.

His bet lost money in some funds in 2016 and 2017 -- while the S&P has risen steadily. He blames a "sugar rush" as President Trump's tax cuts extended the bull market.

Crispin Odey, founding partner of Odey Asset Management, thinks the bull market is "old." He has been running an overall wager against stocks whereby his bets on falling prices -- including bets against Tesla and retail stocks -- have exceeded bets on rising prices by around 30%. That has contributed to three years of losses, including a loss of nearly 50% in 2016, although this year the fund is sharply up.

Clients have fled. His European fund, which was around 1.7 billion euros ($2 billion) four years ago, has shrunk to around 200 million euros.

Russell Clark, the main manager at London-based Horseman Capital, which runs more than $900 million, has been running a large position on falling U.S. stock prices including bets against technology and real-estate stocks. Quantitative easing is a "disastrous policy" because it can prove impossible to escape, he said.

Elliott Management Corp. told investors it was preparing for stocks and bonds to "take a notable dive."

But rather than talking about large outright negative bets, Elliott said it was preparing buy assets once they have fallen in price.

Mr. Filia became convinced around mid-2016 that risks in markets had grown. While the 2008 crash was centered around banks, risks today have moved to markets, Mr. Filia believes, which exist in a fragile state that is creeping closer to their breaking point. "Now we think the awakening from the QE sleep is going to be very violent."

His fund is positioned for a crash. One part bets on falls in stock and bond futures, while another two bet on stock and bond options. A fourth portion bets against exchange-traded funds, which he considers a key weak point in the financial system, when markets turn. A fifth part uses artificial intelligence to calculate when the market is likely to move sharply lower and then profit.

"I'm one of the few to be putting my money where my mouth is," he said.

Horseman's Mr. Clark thinks the U.S. corporate-bond market and volatility-selling markets are "unsustainable" and that investors' positioning in the face of slowing growth is "dangerous," according to letters to clients reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. He declined to comment.

Many investors have lost patience with performance. Mr. Clark was running $1.7 billion at the end of 2015. Redemptions have helped slash this to under $800 million.

Insecure overachievers and how to handle them

Growing awareness of the issue could accelerate corporate reform

I first met Gerry Grimstone in the late 1980s, when he was a banker helping to oil the wheels of Margaret Thatcher s privatisations. His career has since seen him win a knighthood and rise to chair Barclays bank and Standard Life Aberdeen. The Mail on Sunday called him  capitalism royalty . Nobody has ever accused him of being insecure.

Yet at 69, he works from 7am to 11pm, six days a week, and cheerfully admits to an irrational fear he may not have done enough.  You never feel you have got there,  he says in a BBC radio documentary broadcast on September 24.  There s always an element of dissatisfaction: if only I tried a little bit harder perhaps I could get to the next step. 

Another insecure overachiever, David Morley, former senior partner at law firm Allen & Overy, describes the excitement of participating in this vicious cycle as  like a drug .

It is an addiction law firms, consultancies and investment banks, in particular, have been happy to feed.

Dissatisfied, angsty high-performers are the perfect cannon fodder for client work.  The dynamics of the client relationship [are] well-suited to somebody who doesn t have a very good sense of self, is prepared to put the client s interests first but also does a very, very good job,  Sir Gerry tells Cass Business School s Laura Empson.

Prof Empson has explored insecure overachievers in her book Leading Professionals, which conveyed the anonymised hand-wringing concerns of anxious managing partners and strung-out senior consultants. When I wrote about her findings last year, my column was picked up and passed on by hundreds of readers. Young professionals copied in their Facebook friends at the Big Four professional services groups, consultancies and law firms ( Sounds familiar ,  You all over ,  Totally relate , and so on).

It is a small sign of progress that a few senior professionals are now willing to go on the record, albeit mostly after they have stepped down, to describe the trait and its dangers. Also positive are the institutional efforts by some firms to address the burnout and breakdowns that can be the consequence of self-imposed high expectations, stress and overwork.

Still, familiar criticisms of both diagnosis and treatment of insecure overachievement continue to surface.

One is that this is the ultimate first-world problem. The professional services firms are useless and parasitical. Their senior staff are relatively   sometimes exorbitantly   well paid. Therefore the issue is not worth addressing. Well, get real. Intermediaries are here to stay. While it is fine to scrutinise the firms  usefulness, they remain big employers and recruiters. Their dysfunctions have a disproportionately wide impact.

Others claim this is just an inevitable fact of corporate life, fuelled by irreversible globalisation and client demands. Mr Morley describes the Friday night call setting a Sunday deadline:  Your weekend is going to be trashed 	. 	. 	. 	you don t have much say about that, and it s relentless.  Another insecure overachiever, Jeremy Newman, former head of BDO, the accountancy firm, says:  We couldn t figure out a way you could avoid that without losing all [our] business. 

A third response is to insist individuals should drop out, be pushed out, or never be hired in the first place. But how to identify these weaklings? The evidence shows young recruits can soak up stress for a few years, but many ultimately have to resort to extreme regimes, including medication, to stay on top of their jobs.

Even assuming it could be done, weeding out the  weak  would restrict the diversity of thinking companies need to survive and prosper. In any case, if you try to deter insecure overachievers by warning them how stressful the job is, they will simply take that as a new challenge. Stepping down, by extension, comes to be seen as failure   and so the trap tightens.

Prof Empson disputes that the vicious circle is unbreakable.  It is not an immutable fact,  she told me. Growing awareness of the issue, generational change, even, perhaps, the use of artificial intelligence to tackle drudgework, could accelerate reform. Clients have a part to play. Some now insist on knowing how advisers treat junior staff before they appoint them.

Prof Empson advises overachievers to recognise what triggers their insecurity, to define success in their own terms   not just those of the organisation   to trust the evidence of their glittering record, and to enjoy the thrills that excellence brings.

As veteran overachievers  confessions suggest, there is no separate strain of unshakeably secure alpha-humans ready to lead the largest organisations. Better, then, that the system should recognise, adapt to, and accommodate future leaders  insecurities, for everyone s benefit.

Machines switch to disrupting property valuers

But will automated valuation methods lead to more rational housing markets?

Property investors appear to be the mirror image of Oscar Wilde s cynic: they know the value of everything and the price of nothing.

Everyone in property obsesses about theoretical valuations   developers, bankers, estate agents, insurers and ordinary housebuyers. But, as any homeowner desperate to complete a sale knows, the only true measure of a property s worth is the price someone else will pay for it. That is still mostly determined by those capricious emotional twins greed and fear.

The pioneers of big data are promising to revolutionise the property valuation business, nudging it further along the spectrum from art towards science. By providing quicker and more accurate valuations derived from masses of data sets, they claim to offer greater confidence for all. A better informed market should be a more rational and efficient market.

Some appraisal companies, such as Hometrack in the UK, have been providing banks with near-instant automated valuations for residential properties for years. This has enabled banks to cut costs and improve customer service by offering quicker mortgage decisions, sometimes within two minutes.

GeoPhy, a Dutch start-up, has the daunting ambition of providing near real-time valuations of all commercial and residential properties around the world.  The crazy volatility in property values is due to a lack of information,  says Teun van den Dries, GeoPhy s founder.  We are aiming to provide a continuous flow of information. 

GeoPhy started by valuing all 8.6m properties in the Netherlands. It drew on data from the Land Registry, threw in all recorded transactions, and then meshed it together with several hundred other relevant data sets, including satellite imagery. It has extended its mapping to 48.5m properties in the UK and 147m in 48 states in the US. It aims to go global, although it may be stymied by lack of data in some countries, notably China.

At present, about 82,000 appraisers are employed in the US property valuation business, which is worth about $12bn a year. This may be yet another area where the human is gradually replaced by the machine. Some of the biggest property companies are already experimenting with automated valuations, due to the lower costs, frequency and reliability of reporting, and reduced fraud.

For example, GeoPhy is supplying Fannie Mae with monthly valuations on the 19m properties to which it is exposed. The US mortgage provider has been used to revaluing its portfolio every three years.

Property experts say the worth of automated valuations will only be proven over the economic cycle. Some valuation companies privately admit the industry s methodology remains a work in progress, although it is constantly being improved with new data.

Commercial properties are inherently harder to value because of the lack of transparency over lease terms and income streams. A property owner s own financial condition and access to capital can also be critical determinants of price.

The history of the Broadgate development in London is a striking example of how prices can fluctuate. As the aftershocks of the global financial crisis rocked the commercial property market in 2009, British Land sold half the development to Blackstone for 77m (although it also offloaded half of its outstanding Broadgate debt of 2.1bn). Four years later, Blackstone flipped that holding to GIC of Singapore for 1.7bn.

Phil Clark, head of property investment at Kames Capital, says that automated valuation holds a lot of promise but should be regarded with caution.  Nirvana does not exist,  he says.

Property valuations will always rely on judgment as well as scientific method. Prestige properties, such as flagship stores in prime locations that only change hands every 30 years, are particularly tricky to value by automated methods because the data points are so scarce. Investors will also want a clear explanation for any given valuation.  There will always be a need for a valuer. We do not operate in a screen-based market,  says Mr Clark.

Perhaps the overarching question, though, is whether better valuation methods will lead to more rational markets. In a paper on the US housing bubble, the economist Dean Baker argued that the unprecedented run-up in prices in the 2000s  required an extraordinary degree of negligence  to miss. Yet missed it was, resulting in an $8tn collapse in housing wealth over four years. Sometimes, none are so blind as those who do not want to see.

Markets
Lonely, and Costly, Times for Hedge Funds That Bet on Collapse; These maverick hedge funds believe the end of easy money could provide the catalyst for disaster

Nearly a decade into what feels like a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-can-stop-this-bull-market-1534881350", it is getting awfully lonely for a group of maverick hedge funds betting on what they think will be a coming financial meltdown.

"If my analysis is right, we're past the point of no return," said Francesco Filia, founder of $500 million London-based Fasanara Capital, who has pivoted his $100 million macro fund to bet on a market crash. "Nothing else will do than having cash or shorts," he said.

So far, Mr. Filia's analysis has been painfully wrong. His fund has shrunk to around $100 million from around $160 million. Mr. Filia and his ilk believe a decade of central-bank bond-buying, known as quantitative easing, has artificially inflated asset prices and created huge market distortions. Moves in the U.S.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-economy-week-ahead-fed-policy-statement-gdp-estimate-and-other-data-1537718094" and cut bondholdings and in "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ecb-leaves-rates-on-hold-as-it-affirms-bond-taper-plan-1532605915" could, they think, provide the catalyst for disaster.

It also has become an increasingly controversial trade as central banks have slowly tightened monetary policy without causing a crash. The Federal Reserve began shrinking its balance sheet nearly a year ago. The European Central Bank has reduced new bond purchases already and plans to end them completely this year.

Speculating against a widely held market consensus can mean a lonely and often painful road.

"Pretty much immediately when we went more bearish we started to see the funds going out," said Mr. Filia.

His bet lost money in some funds in 2016 and 2017 while the S&P has risen steadily. He blames a "sugar rush" as President Trump's tax cuts "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-corporate-profits-soared-in-second-quarter-boosted-by-tax-cuts-and-economic-growth-1535559230".

Crispin Odey, founding partner of Odey Asset Management, thinks the bull market is "old." He has been running an overall bet against stocks whereby his bets on falling prices including bets against Tesla and retail stocks have exceeded bets on rising prices by around 30%. That has contributed to three years of losses, including an enormous near-50% loss in 2016, although this year the fund is sharply up.

Clients have fled: His European fund, which was around  1.7 billion ($2 billion) four years ago, has shrunk to around  200 million.

Russell Clark, the main manager at London-based Horseman Capital, which runs more than $900 million, has been running a large position on falling U.S. stock prices including bets against technology and real-estate stocks. He describes quantitative easing as a "disastrous policy," because it can prove impossible to escape.

These managers' bets echo bearish positions taken by a small group of managers before the financial crisis. They were ridiculed early on but once the full force of the market and economic damage was understood, they made a killing and were hailed as whizzes. This time, however, the market has so far given bears little reason for cheer.

Few investors have backed up bearish views with large negative bets.

Elliott Management Corp. told investors it was preparing for stocks and bonds to "take a notable dive."

But rather than talking about large outright negative bets, Elliott said it was preparing buy assets once they'd fallen in price.

Mr. Filia became convinced around mid-2016 that risks in markets had grown. QE is "a bit like the magic flute," he said. It leads investors into crowded trades bets on low volatility, rising prices and following trends that can go badly wrong if the market changes direction suddenly.

Whereas the 2008 crash was centered around banks, risks today have moved to markets, Mr. Filia believes, which exist in a fragile state that is creeping closer to the so-called "edge of chaos" their breaking point. "Now we think the awakening from the QE sleep is going to be very violent."

His fund is positioned for a crash. One part bets on falls in stock and bond futures, while another two bet on stock and bond options. A fourth portion bets against exchange-traded funds, which he considers a key weak point in the financial system, when markets turn (Mr. Filia profited from the collapse in volatility note the XIV in February). A fifth part uses artificial intelligence to calculate when the market is likely to move sharply lower and then profit.

"I'm one of the few to be putting my money where my mouth is," he said.

Horseman's Mr. Clark thinks the U.S. corporate bond market and volatility-selling markets are "unsustainable" and that investors' positioning in the face of slowing growth is "dangerous," according to letters to clients reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. He declined to comment.

Many investors have lost patience with performance. Mr. Clark was running $1.7 billion at the end of 2015. Redemptions have helped slash this to under $800 million.

"I have a natural tendency to attack consensus positions," he said.

Private Equity Turns to Big Data  to Find Deals; High-tech analysis is helping investors decide what to buy and how much to pay

Private-equity firms have long relied on human connections to find deals, sending partners to meet thousands of executives every year and turning to their professional networks for investment ideas.

But they're increasingly applying data science and algorithms to drive their investments. They're using software to scrutinize companies' strengths and weaknesses to spot potential investments. They're deciding what to pay for businesses by analyzing their past bids. And they're looking to use programs to figure out how companies will perform down the road.

"We as an industry spend a lot of time manually gathering data and manually doing predictions. And of course that's better done by technology," says Olof Hernell, chief digital officer at Swedish private-equity firm EQT.

Starting out

Private-equity firms are late to the party in their use of high-tech analysis. Venture-capital firms, which have deep roots in the tech business and Silicon Valley, have taken big strides in incorporating data science and predictive analytics into investment decisions.

Yet about 75% of private-equity surveyed in 2017 said they struggled to gauge how using data science could affect the value of portfolio companies, according to Ernst & Young LLP.

Now that capital has poured into private equity and competition for investments has intensified, these firms are starting to turn to data analytics to gain an edge in finding deals or ruling them out. About 94% of firms expect to use more predictive analytics within the next two years, according to Ernst & Young.

Some of the biggest firms in the field are getting in on analytics. Publicly traded Blackstone Group, for instance, disclosed on a February earnings call that it has built its own data platform to help inform its investment decision-making.

Using data science has already proved to be useful for other firms. Midmarket buyout firm Falfurrias Capital Partners developed its internal data-science platform, DealCloud, in 2010 before spinning it out as a separate company and selling it to software provider Intapp Inc.

Falfurrias, of Charlotte, N.C., uses data analytics for industry research or to find smaller businesses that it can acquire and merge into large companies it already owns. For instance, after Falfurrias officials met executives of SixAxis LLC in 2016, the private-equity firm used DealCloud to track the manufacturing-technology company's performance. Falfurrias opted to acquire the business last year.

When Falfurrias-backed Marquis Software Solutions Inc. bought DocuMatrix Inc. in 2017, Falfurrias used DealCloud to analyze the financial-software industry and measure DocuMatrix's strengths against that of its competitors. Falfurrias had already spotted DocuMatrix as an acquisition target, but DealCloud enabled the firm to better grasp its business model and its fit with Marquis.

In some cases, Falfurrias inputs data on its past bids and uses the analytics program to decide how much it should pay for assets, the firm says.

"Relationships are a big part of [private equity] and investment banking, but if you can overlay that with data, that becomes so much more powerful," says Rob Cummings, chief technology officer and managing director at Falfurrias.

Broader applications

Mr. Cummings sees broader applications for the technology. The firm eventually wants to apply the data to predict company performance and valuations to aid in selecting investment targets, he says.

EQT first launched its Motherbrain software platform roughly three years ago within its EQT Venturesdivision, a venture-capital unit that invests in young technology-driven companies, primarily in Europe. Today, nearly every investment EQT Ventures makes is at least partly sourced by Motherbrain. EQT's private-equity arm began to use the software more recently.

The platform combines information EQT has gathered about thousands of companies on its own with data from a range of traditional sources, including industry research reports and company websites to find patterns among successful companies.

The software then uses an algorithm to identify businesses with desirable characteristics such as a solid trajectory of growth and an ability to establish itself as a market leader that executives can then contact. It also allows the firm to prioritize its pipeline of potential investment targets, Mr. Hernell says.

"Out of all the companies you could potentially look at, it's pretty likely that we would like this company based on our [learning] and decisions we have made on the thousands of companies that we have already assessed," he says.

Still, widespread adoption of the technology across the private-equity industry may require a shift in mind-set. Some private-equity professionals say they see the value of integrating data analytics into their workflow, but question the necessity of investing in the technological infrastructure when they've had success by using their instinct and connections.

"This is a journey that we're just beginning, and while we've got a team, it'll take more investment in the team," Tony James, executive vice chairman of Blackstone, said during the company's February earnings call. "It'll take somewhat of a cultural change," Mr. James said. "It'll take education around our people."

Some private-equity investors say that finding the right balance between human judgment and machine learning will take time.

"I've never viewed it as an either-or," says Eric Bradlow, a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who founded data-research center Wharton Customer Analytics Initiative in 2006. Says Prof. Bradlow, "Analytics is a form of business intelligence."

Good day and welcome to the Private Equity Pro newsletter. PE is increasingly turning to big data to find deals. Also, the growth-investing bug has bitten even Blackstone Group LP, the largest private-equity firm on the block. Blackstone also may be soon exiting its stake in Gianni Versace SpA, and a judge signed off on Claire's Stores Inc.'s reorganization plan days after the retailer reached a settlement with Oaktree Capital Management LP.

Now on to today's news...

Today's Top Stories

Embracing machine learning: Private-equity firms have long relied on human connections to find deals, sending partners to meet thousands of executives every year and turning to their professional networks for investment ideas. But they increasingly are applying data science and algorithms to drive their investments, reports WSJ Pro's Jaewon Kang.

Bitten by the growth-investing bug: During its investor day on Friday, executives of Blackstone Group LP outlined how their new life-sciences division is part of a long-term shift to more growth and venture investing, writes WSJ Pro's Chris Cumming.

Fashionable exit: Michael Kors Holdings Ltd. is close to a deal to buy fashion house Gianni Versace SpA for around  2 billion ($2.35 billion), people familiar with the matter tell The Wall Street Journal. Blackstone Group LP, which owns 20% of Versace, is selling its stake in the business as part of the deal, one person said.

Retailer's restructuring is approved: Claire's Stores Inc. had its debt-restructuring plan approved by a bankruptcy court, reports WSJ Pro's Becky Yerak. A judge signed off on the plan days after the accessories retailer reached a settlement with junior bondholder Oaktree Capital Management LP.

The Take: Private Equity Strikes Up Its Own Machine-Learning Moneyball

By Laura Kreutzer

Private-equity firms are turning to machine learning to up their investment game. But some may want to take a lesson from another game: baseball.

Back in the early 2000s, then Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane embraced data analytics over traditional scouting methods to recruit talent for what was then a cash-strapped Major League Baseball team. His successful use of data science to build a winning team on a budget was popularized in Michael Lewis's 2003 book "Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game," which also inspired a major motion picture in 2011.

Once the secret was out, however, other major-league franchises also adopted the strategy, and the A's started to lose some of the competitive advantage they had gained. However, the team's analytics strategy changed the way baseball managers think about talent-building and revolutionized baseball scouting. Read Kreutzer's Take.

Deals

Capital Partners made an investment in Minimizer LLC, a maker and distributor of branded heavy-duty truck aftermarket accessories.

Invesco Ltd. is closing in on a deal to buy rival money manager OppenheimerFunds Inc. for more than $5 billion.

Oncap acquired a majority stake in Walter Surface Technologies Inc., provider of surface-treatment technologies.

Tech, Finance Firms Take On Apprentices

By Kate King

Apprenticeships have long been associated with manufacturing and construction jobs. But some New York City tech and finance companies have started to use apprenticeships as a way to train new hires and diversify their workforces.

While these efforts were growing in number, Mayor Bill de Blasio last year announced a new initiative to establish 450 apprenticeships in the industrial, health and tech industries by 2020. The city will use models already pioneered by some tech companies to encourage other businesses to hire apprentices.

Joshua Ortiz was always interested in computers, but after getting an associate degree in applied science, the Bronx native found even entry-level technology positions required certifications he couldn't afford.

A relative suggested he enroll at Per Scholas, a nonprofit technical school in the South Bronx, where he took a free, 15-week course that helped him get the qualifications he needed. In 2013, he landed a spot in Barclays PLC's first apprenticeship program in New York City, and two years later he was hired full-time in the firm's information-technology department.

"I was underqualified before coming here," said Mr. Ortiz, 26, who is now an engineer in the bank's IT department in Midtown Manhattan. "It was tough learning the infrastructure as a person without experience."

Apprenticeships generally last longer than internships and come with a job offer at the end, as long as the apprentice performs well. They are paid positions and typically offer gradually increasing salaries, according to a new report by the Center for an Urban Future, or CUF, an independent nonprofit.

Gregg Bishop, commissioner of the New York City Department of Small Business Services, said employers are looking to expand beyond their usual recruitment pools.

"If you're only going to one particular source, you're facing stiff competition," Mr. Bishop said. "It is becoming very difficult to not only find talent, because of the low unemployment rate, but you also want to have diversity in that talent pool as well."

New York state had 762 apprenticeship programs registered with the Labor Department last year, about 96% of which were in building or manufacturing, according to the CUF report. In New York City, 89% of the 94 registered apprenticeship programs as of June were in those trades.

But the actual number is likely higher because not all apprenticeship programs, particularly in tech, are registered with the state, the report says.

International Business Machines Corp. has rapidly expanded its apprenticeship program from its first class of 13 in October 2017 to more than 120 nationwide today, said Kelli Jordan, who oversees nontraditional hires at IBM. The company employs about two dozen apprentices in New York and plans to add an additional 12 this month.

The program was developed primarily to train employees in the specific skills needed for technology jobs at IBM, including software engineering, cybersecurity, data analytics, mainframe administration and product management.

"The fact is that there's just not enough workers with the right skills in the U.S. today," Ms. Jordan said.

IBM apprentices, who range from teenagers to people in their late 50s, receive more than 200 hours of classroom instruction as well as job experience under a mentor. In the New York area, they can earn $50,000-$70,000 a year depending on their area of expertise, and they stand to earn more after being hired full-time.

Barclays, which provided funding for the CUF report, established its first apprenticeship program in the U.K. in 2010 as a pipeline for technology jobs. The company expanded it to the U.S. three years later. More than 30 apprentices have participated in Barclays's two-year program in New York, and all have been offered full-time jobs in IT, said a company spokeswoman.

Wayne Kunow, director of cybersecurity and information-security governance at Barclays, said the apprenticeship program is a cost-effective way of recruiting beyond colleges and finding more diverse candidates.

"Financial-services firms are all competing for [graduates from] the same types of schools," he said. "We're looking for things that maybe other people were overlooking."

At Stack Overflow, a website for developers based in the financial district, an apprenticeship program was developed to help diversify a small engineering team, said principal developer Jon Chan.

"We want to bring in more diverse talent, especially from groups that are underrepresented in the industry," he said.

More than 600 people applied within one week for Stack Overflow's most recent apprenticeship program, Mr. Chan said. The company hired four apprentices, all women who had participated in coding boot camps but didn't have formal computer-science degrees.

Fintech pair aim to disrupt industry with investments for millennials

Europe s asset management industry is likely to have an abrupt wake-up call as two of the fastest-growing fintech companies, which aim their products at millennials, roll out new investment propositions.

Revolut and Plum have attracted close to 3m users in the past two years. They have their sights set on disrupting the industry with cheap and easy-to-use investments that suit customers traditional managers find hard to attract.

 The goal is not to be just another medium-size bank   we want to become the Amazon of finance,  said Chad West, head of marketing at Revolut, which is in the process of offering exchange traded funds to its 2.6m users across Europe.

Plum, a robo-adviser tool used via Facebook s Messenger service, has focused on helping its 200,000 users save money and reduce spending. Now, though, it has turned its attention to investments and is rolling out six funds to all its customers on Monday.

The start-up has partnered with Vanguard, Standard Life Aberdeen and Legal & General Investment Management.

A beta version of the offering, which was open to 2,000 customers, has been running over the summer and 500,000 has been invested so far.

Plum will offer three Vanguard funds designed for different risk profiles: conservative, balanced and growth. It will also provide access to three themed funds: an LGIM tech fund, an SLA ethical fund and a Vanguard emerging markets fund.

Victor Trokoudes, Plum chief executive, said the themes were chosen to appeal to the interests of millennials and that the company would consider rolling out funds focused on the environment, healthy eating and artificial intelligence.

 We are trying to open up investments to millennials,  said Mr Trokoudes, a former Morgan Stanley trader who launched Plum two years ago.  I think we will see this massive wave where people get more comfortable investing money and grow their funds over time. 

Plum will charge investors 1 a month as well as an annual fee of 0.15 per cent of their assets. Additional fund charges range from 0.22 per cent to 0.9 per cent.

Revolut, a challenger bank that adds up to 7,000 customers a day, is in the process of applying for an ETF broker licence. It has agreed a deal with an unnamed ETF provider to sell its funds and provide custodial services.

The ETF proposition will be part of a commission-free trading service for stocks and other securities that the bank plans to unveil in coming months.

Mr West said Revolut was following the lead of Robinhood, a commission-free investing app that sells ETFs in the US, but would do so globally. He said it planned to launch in the US, Canada, Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan this year.

Mr West added that, though Revolut s customers were typically aged 25 to 35, it was not a service just for younger investors.  A lot of 40-plus customers invest in stocks and ETFs,  he said.  We see this as a real opportunity to make this a service for all and not just for millennials. 

Bob Steers, chief executive of the $60bn US investment company Cohen & Steers, said traditional managers that did not provide strong returns and value for money were in for a rude awakening.

 With data becoming ubiquitous and younger generations doing everything on mobile devices, it s not hard to imagine in the not-too-distant future someone just turning on their phone and saying,  I want a manager with top quartile performance, bottom quartile fees and an environmental, social and governance overlay.  Those managers will be identified instantly,  he said.

 Having armies of salespeople and hundreds of products that mostly don t beat their benchmarks is not going to be worth anything.

Record profits for Europe s private banks

Profits for European private banks surged to an all-time high last year, a flattering result that masked continuing difficulties in winning business and controlling costs for wealth managers that serve some of the world s richest people.

Selling investment products and services to the world s growing number of millionaires is a lucrative business that generated record profits of  15.4bn in 2017 for 111 private banks in western Europe, an annual increase of 14.1 per cent, according to McKinsey, the consultancy.

UBS, the largest player globally, reported that adjusted pre-tax profits for its non-US wealth operations rose 15 per cent to just under SFr2.8bn ( 2.49bn) in 2017.

It has set a target of 10 to 15 per cent annual profit growth over the next three years after combining US and international wealth operations into a single unit at the start of 2018.

A key aim of the reorganisation is to improve the stubbornly high cost-to-income ratio of the enlarged wealth division to help UBS compete against rivals including BNY Mellon, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse.

The pool of profits generated by western European private banks has increased by about a quarter ( 3.1bn) over five years with most of the growth due to the strong performance of financial markets. In contrast, new business inflows of  1.4bn have provided less than half the industry s profit growth since the start of 2013.

Sbastien Lacroix, leader of McKinsey s European private banking practice, said the reliance on favourable market performance raised questions about the industry s ability to sustain profits growth.

 Private banks need to get back in the driver s seat. They need to redouble their efforts to build new inflows and to exert greater control over growth in the cost base,  said Mr Lacroix.

McKinsey s survey, published on Monday, noted that divergence between the performance of large players, those with assets of more than  30bn, and private banking arms of universal banks, has increased compared with the results achieved by smaller rivals.

Small private banks, those with assets of less than  10bn, have seen profit margins fall by almost a fifth in the past five years while asset growth has lagged well behind that of the largest competitors. Larger players have hired more client relationship managers and sold a wider range of services, helping them achieve stronger asset growth and a modest improvement in profit margins.

Smaller independent banks have also struggled more to control their costs, which have risen by about 6 per cent a year since 2013. Regulatory costs have risen significantly for all private banks, due in part to investments in the digital technologies needed to comply with anti-money laundering rules. As a result, failure to control rising costs is an industry-wide problem. Only a quarter of the 111 banks surveyed by McKinsey have succeeded in reducing absolute costs over the past five years.

 The industry needs a broad-based effort to control cost outlays,  said Mr Lacroix.

Cash holdings by clients of private banks have remained remarkably high since the 2007-08 financial crisis, accounting for about 30 per cent of portfolio holdings in spite of low interest rates.

At the same time, holdings of alternative assets, such as hedge funds, private equity and commodities, together account for just 8 per cent of client assets. McKinsey also said that many private banks had failed to embrace alternative investments as part of their services and it had also proved challenging to persuade enough clients to pay higher fees for more structured advice.

Mr Lacroix said independent boutiques could do more to distinguish themselves from their larger rivals but all private banks should aim to offer a wider range of services, depending on whether a client wanted a basic level of service or an all-encompassing programme.

Kinner Lakhani, head of European financials research at Deutsche Bank, said private banks were sitting on vast amounts of proprietary client information that could be utilised to provide business leads and to improve services.

 Wealth managers that succeed in fully exploiting data analytics opportunities can expect to achieve revenue uplifts of up to 20 per cent,  said Mr Lakhani.

Storm's Cost Nears $50 Billion

After a week of heavy rains and record flooding, initial estimates for the damage that Florence wrought on the Carolinas rank the storm among history's top hurricanes, but far below last year's trio of powerful cyclones.

Moody's Analytics on Friday estimated the economic cost of Florence to be between $38 billion and $50 billion including damage to property, vehicle losses, and lost output. At the upper end of that range, Florence would rank seventh among the biggest storms, just after Hurricane Andrew in 1992, according to Moody's estimates.

The widespread damage, however, is lower than last year's Hurricane Harvey, which smashed into Texas and inundated the state with rain for days. Harvey's bill for the insurance industry was $30 billion, according to Wells Fargo Securities, with its Category 4 winds causing more severe damage than the Category 1 winds of Florence.

Based on Moody's estimates, last year's three hurricanes each caused more damage than Florence: Harvey's tally reached $133.5 billion; Maria's $120 billion; and Irma's $84.2 billion.

Florence, which made landfall Sept. 14 and has claimed 41 lives in the Carolinas and Virginia, is continuing to wreak havoc. Rivers in the Carolinas are continuing to rise, and more than 600 roads were still closed Friday in North Carolina. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper warned it still isn't safe for many people to return home including the 3,700 who remain in shelters.

Part of the Cape Fear River is forecast to crest Saturday while the Waccamaw River at Conway, S.C., isn't expected to crest until Tuesday or Wednesday next week, according to the National Weather Service.

In a rescue Thursday night in the town of Kelly, N.C., more than 100 stranded people were plucked from harm by National Guard and Coast Guard helicopters, authorities said.

Private insurers are preparing for an estimated $1.7 billion to $5 billion in total costs from Florence. The estimates from catastrophe-risk modeling firms include damage to homes, cars and commercial property, and also include policy benefits like living expenses for homeowners and business interruption for companies, but typically exclude flood claims for individual homes.

"The big thing is getting our adjusters into areas that remain flooded," said Gina Schwitzgebel, general manager of the nonprofit Coastal Property Insurance Pool, which insures many houses in North Carolina near the ocean.

Coastal Property Insurance Pool, which is a state-created last resort option for insurance, has more than 32,700 claims in hand, Ms. Schwitzgebel said. The claims are largely for roof repairs, replacements of broken windows and some structural damage to homes from fallen trees.

Risk modeler Karen Clark & Co. said the cost to the insurance industry was held down because hurricane-force winds were experienced only along the North Carolina cost, with less powerful, tropical-storm-force winds elsewhere in the two states.

"This led to widespread low level damage," the firm said.

USAA, one of the biggest insurers in the Carolinas, is up to 38,000 Florence claims. It had roughly 49,000 claims from Harvey.

Its large number of claims so far is partly because it specializes in insuring military members, analysts said. Large Army and Marine Corps installations are located in the eastern part of North Carolina, and the Carolinas also are home to many military retirees. A spokesman for the insurance company, Richard Johnson, said "we have just been starting to get access to the area" hardest hit.

State Farm, the biggest home insurer by market share in North Carolina, said it had received about 12,400 homeowner claims and 1,900 automobile claims in North Carolina related to Hurricane Florence as of Sept. 20. Policyholders in South Carolina, where it also is a top insurer, had filed 1,610 home and 500 auto claims.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency's flood-insurance program has received some 8,000 claims for a program that allows policyholders to get $5,000 of their claim without having to get a visit from an adjuster.

The current estimates for the insurance industry's bill are dramatically lower than some of the figures discussed about when Florence was spinning offshore at Category 4 wind strength.

"Since the storm weakened from a Category 4 to a Category 1 at landfall, losses for the insurance industry were cut significantly -- to under $5 billion from a potential loss of $20 billion," Wells Fargo analyst Elyse Greenspan said.

Assuming $3.2 billion as the estimated industry cost, she expects big car and home insurer Allstate Corp. to post pretax catastrophe losses of $222 million, based on its market share of about 7% in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.

An Allstate spokesman said the insurer would release catastrophe figures at the end of the month. For now, the insurer is using aircraft, satellites and other technology to help size up damage and pay claims.

Much of the damage will be the responsibility of the federal government's flood-insurance program, but much also will hit people's pocketbooks directly because many homeowners don't own the policies.

"We need to do more to provide a functioning flood market," Verisk Analytics Inc. Chief Operating Officer Mark Anquillare said. Government flood maps "have been relatively narrowed as to where they've identified flood risk because there's a political influence in there. Politicians and a lot of people don't want houses in flood plains where it would potentially hurt home values."

Good day. A chunk of the $6 billion in equity and debt funding raised by WeWork will directly fund the company's own aspirations as a venture investor. We have an exclusive look at WeWork's "future of work" venture fund and who's running it.

Plus we'll revisit the Brazilian founders of credit-card startup Brex, which started last year and is already raising its third round this time seeking a $1 billion valuation.

And now on to the news...

Gormley's Take: Aesthetic Medicine Not Just Another Pretty Face

By Brian Gormley

Venture capitalists betting on the future of aesthetic medicine scored a win with the recent sale of Bonti Inc. to Botox maker Allergan PLC.

Botox has grown into a giant product thanks largely to older people seeking wrinkle treatments. Total sales of the treatment, which is also used for medical purposes, neared $1 billion in the second quarter.

Now corporations and venture firms aim to provide aesthetic products to younger consumers. Interest in aesthetic medicine is helping to lift overall venture investment in skin products. While Botox treatments take several days and are meant to last a few months, Bonti's product works in 24 hours and lasts two to four weeks, said Fauad Hasan, a former Allergan executive who co-founded Bonti in 2015.

The shorter duration could appeal to people who worry they won't like the effects of a Botox-like treatment.
