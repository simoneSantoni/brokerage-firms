Opinion
Why Illinois Got Out of the Hedges; These funds are hard to understand and have lousy returns.

Can anyone explain why Illinois continues to own this hopelessly complicated bunch of hedge funds? That's the question I asked the state's Board of Investment, which oversees $22 billion of pension assets, when I became its chairman two years ago.

I had been reviewing the board's portfolio and noticed a lot of holdings labeled hedge funds. They were run by something called a "hedge fund manager," whatever that was. Most bought and sold stocks but so did other funds we owned that showed up under the category "stocks" and were run by "equity fund managers."

One difference was that some of the hedge-fund managers showed up on television, winning publicity by waging shareholder proxy battles. But such fame didn't translate into better returns.

Not that it was easy to tell. Even though the hedge funds invested in stocks, their returns weren't benchmarked against the overall stock market. Instead their returns were compared with those of other hedge funds, a much lower bar. Once we applied the proper benchmark, their underperformance became apparent. We were paying them hundreds of millions of dollars, yet index funds were getting better returns. So we fired nearly all of them.

The few surviving stock-picking hedge funds were moved into our equity asset class, exactly where they belonged. But we weren't finished. We also owned hedge funds that bought and sold things other than stocks, portfolios with lots of trading bets using derivatives on currencies, commodities and other financial instruments.

Though these funds performed better than other hedge funds, absolute returns were disappointing, barely more than cash. Industry "experts" suggested we keep these investments to diversify our holdings and reduce overall risk. Yet we already owned bonds for that purpose. Our Procter & Gamble bonds made sense to us. I'm pretty sure my children will brush their teeth tonight. But I don't have a clue about that long-lumber, short-sugar trade.

These funds' managers also loved being on television. They talked about algorithms and artificial intelligence, subjects that might be fascinating but that didn't tell us much about returns.

Our board began to question the conventional wisdom. Did anyone at the table really understand what these hedge funds were doing? Should we be putting the retirement funds of Illinois state employees into investments that not a single trustee, consultant or staffer could explain?

If they had been earning double-digit returns, that might have motivated us to spend more time trying to understand their strategies and risks. But for 2% returns? That was less than investment-grade bonds were earning.

After firing these fund managers, our $1.5 billion hedge-fund asset class was reduced to zero. No more illogical benchmarks, no more illusory risk reduction. Now we understand what we own.

The $3 trillion hedge-fund industry will have to move on without us, though its investment strategies seem better suited to generating publicity than great returns.

Mr. Levine is chairman of the Illinois State Board of Investment.

China Watchers Get Another Way to Gauge Its Economy; Beijing has rolled out a composite gauge of business activity that covers both manufacturing and services

BEIJING China has rolled out another monthly reading of business activity intended to provide a fuller picture of the state of the world's second-largest economy, the government said.

The National Bureau of Statistics on Wednesday unveiled the composite purchasing managers index, which covers both the service and manufacturing sectors, alongside their usual separate readings. The new gauge's weightings of each sector are based on their respective shares of the domestic economy, the bureau said in a statement.

China's economy is in transition, becoming one driven more by services than by heavy industry. As the line between services and manufacturing has become blurry given the applications of big data, the mobile internet and other technologies, it is time for a "new perspective" to measure economic performance, the bureau said.

Economists have questioned the reliability of China's published statistics and economic indicators for decades. The central government has said that local governments have falsified data, usually to overstate their economic and fiscal performance. The provinces of Liaoning and Jilin, the city of Tianjin and parts of Inner Mongolia have acknowledged faking data.

Ning Jizhe, China's statistics chief, in January pledged to improve the quality of economic data by punishing offenses by local officials. He defended his bureau's statistics, saying they are reliable because the data are collected directly from companies and households.

The bureau said Wednesday that it had been compiling the new composite PMI for a year. January's reading stood at 54.6, which the bureau said was unchanged for the third straight month. It was well above the threshold value of 50 that separates expansion from contraction.

The traditional manufacturing PMI, a gauge of factory activity, showed sentiment at an eight-month low of 51.3 in January, compared with 51.6 the previous month. The nonmanufacturing PMI edged up to 55.3 from December's 55.0.

Economists said the downtick in manufacturing reflected softened demand after the Christmas and New Year's holidays in the West as well as factory disruptions from a pollution clampdown. The service sector was bolstered by solid demand ahead of February's Lunar New Year holiday, the statistics bureau said.

However, economists and analysts said it would likely take some time before the composite index is as closely watched as traditional indicators. Market observers typically favor economic data that have a long historical record, said Yang Zhao, an economist at Nomura Group, noting that the manufacturing PMI continues to get more attention than its newer services counterpart.

"I guess what the statistics bureau wants is to create a more representative indicator," Mr. Zhao said. Services now account for slightly more than half of China's economic output, with manufacturing contributing a third, according to official data.

The government's introduction of a composite PMI brings it in line with other countries that offer a similar gauge, the bureau said.

Private research firm Markit conducts both composite and sector-specific PMI surveys whose results are released after the official readings which offer China watchers a competing source of information.

U.S. Private Sector Added 234,000 Jobs in January; Economists had expected the addition of 193,000 jobs

Hiring at private U.S. employers grew more than expected in January, according to a report.

Firms across the country added 234,000 workers in January, according to payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody's Analytics.

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected the addition of 193,000 jobs.

"Service providers were firing on all cylinders, posting their strongest gain in more than a year," said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of ADP Research Institute, in the report.

The December figure was revised down to 242,000 from 250,000.

The ADP report is based on private-payroll data in addition to government data.

Still, the report raised concerns over employee shortages given the unemployment rate.

"The job market juggernaut marches on," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics. "If it falls short, it is likely because businesses can't find workers to fill all the open job positions."

Growth was driven by midsize and large companies while job growth at smaller firms slowed slightly.

The ADP report comes ahead of the monthly jobs report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday. Economists expect nonfarm jobs to rise by 177,000 for January, compared with 148,000 the prior month.

Thomson Reuters Sells Stake in Financial Unit to Blackstone-Led Group for $17 Billion; Consortium is taking a 55% stake, valuing the financial and risk business at $20 billion

Thomson Reuters Corp. struck a deal to sell a majority stake in its financial-information and terminal business for $17 billion to a group led by Blackstone Group LP, a significant bet by the private-equity giant on financial data.

Under the agreement, the consortium will take a 55% stake in the financial and risk unit, which will become a separate privately held firm, and Thomson Reuters will hold a 45% stake. The deal values the new firm, which serves banks, money managers and other financial institutions, at $20 billion, Blackstone and Thomson Reuters said.

The remaining Thomson Reuters business will receive $17 billion when the deal closes, funded by $14 billion of debt and preferred stock and a $3 billion equity contribution. The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Singaporean sovereign-wealth fund GIC Pte. Ltd. are investing in the new firm alongside Blackstone.

The deal marks a new chapter for Reuters, a storied news organization that traces its history back to the 1850s. A 2008 merger between Reuters Group PLC and Thomson Corp. represented a bet that combining the news operation with a financial data and analytics business would set it up to weather the storms in the punishing business of news publishing.

Now the news service will be split from the financial and risk business, albeit with a stable revenue line from the newly formed company. The remaining company will supply its news services to the new partnership in exchange for at least $325 million a year over a 30-year contract.

Thomson Reuters's financial and risk business has struggled to generate revenue growth over the years, hurt by cutbacks in spending by banks forced to contend with the fallout from the credit crisis. More recently, it has been hurt by uncertainty among financial institutions in Europe over the adoption of new regulatory rules known as the Market in Financial Instruments Directive, or Mifid II. That uncertainty has curbed spending.

In an interview, Thomson Reuters CEO James Smith said the deal with Blackstone better positions the financial services business "to accelerate growth faster than we can do on our own."

After noting that the business was at a crossroads, he said, "We've gone from declining revenues back to growth. We've moved to new and modern platforms, and improved reliability. Our focus is how to accelerate top-line growth."

For the news business, the agreement provides "a stable floor from the financial-services business that is predictable, with room for annual increases," he said. The news business also generates about $300 million of media revenue today from television stations, newspapers, and other media outlets around the world, as well as corporations that buy news feeds.

For Blackstone, the deal is one of the largest in its history, reflecting the private-equity firm's focus on the value of data. Blackstone has hired data scientists to help it evaluate ways it could profit from nontraditional sets of data. The financial and risk unit, which is a major provider of data to Wall Street trading floors, could become a platform for consolidating some of that data.

"Data distribution and analytics is a very fast-growing space," said Martin Brand, a senior managing director at Blackstone who led the deal, in an interview. "This is one of the very few data assets available at scale."

Private-equity firms typically buy companies and work to improve their businesses by cutting costs or finding new areas of revenue growth in order to sell them for a higher price down the line.

The deal would be the largest corporate buyout to be done out of Blackstone's private-equity funds. The only larger deals the firm as a whole has completed were done in 2007 by its real estate group: its buyouts of "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118350017119057127" and Equity Office Properties Trust for $26 billion and $39 billion, respectively, including debt.

Blackstone is one of the world's largest private-equity firms, with about $387 billion of assets under management. Blackstone's interest in the deal also underscores the pressure that large private-equity firms face to make bigger bets as they seek to deploy their cash hoards.

During a call with analysts, Thomson Reuters said the pending transaction will leave its news business in a strong position because of the revenue stream from the 30-year deal. After the deal closes, that business will have about $625 million in revenue, slightly higher than its cost basis, the company said.

Thomson Reuters plans to use proceeds from the deal to invest in its legal and tax-and-accounting units, pay down debt and repurchase $9 billion to $11 billion of its stock, it said. The company's market value stood at about $33.1 billion on Tuesday after a 7.1% stock-price increase amid reports of the deal.

Thomson Reuters is controlled by Canada's Thomson family. It competes with Bloomberg LP and Dow Jones & Co., owner of The Wall Street Journal, to sell data and analytical tools to traders of stocks and other securities.

? Staff vehicle could cut costs for 'all Americans' ? Shares in sector's big hitters battered

Amazon has announced plans to enter the US healthcare industry by teaming up with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase in a joint-venture dedicated to lowering costs, in a move that wiped billions of dollars from the value of the sector's biggest companies.

The online retail giant said it would join forces with the biggest US bank by assets and Warren Buffett's conglomerate to form a not-for-profit healthcare group charged with reducing bills for their almost 1m employees and "potentially all Americans".

The move comes after months of speculation that Amazon was about to enter the healthcare industry, which has weighed on the share prices of insurers, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacy benefits managers.

Shares in healthcare companies suffered further losses as investors responded to the news that Amazon plans to apply its disruptive force to one of the largest sectors of the US economy, in what could amount to the biggest shake-up of the industry in years.

"The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy," said Mr Buffett. "Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable."

He said the three companies believed that, by pooling resources, they could "in time" check the rise in family health costs and enhance patient satisfaction.

The stock prices of the country's five big health insurers   UnitedHealth, Anthem, Aetna, Humana and Cigna   dropped between 2.5 per cent and 6 per cent in early trading in New York.

The sell-off also hit PBMs, which act as middlemen that negotiate drug prices on behalf of insurers and employers but which have been accused of using the savings to bolster their own profits.

Express Scripts, the biggest standalone PBM, lost 6.4 per cent while CVS Health, the pharmacy group that operates the Caremark PBM, shed 4.8 per cent. Shares of big drugmakers also tumbled as investors fretted they would struggle to maintain premium prices, with Pfizer, AbbVie and Merck losing up to 4.2 per cent.

Amazon and its partners gave few details, saying only that the venture would at first focus on "technology solutions" to provide their US workers with "simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare at a reasonable cost". They said the effort would be pursued through an independent company "free from profitmaking incentives and constraints". A person recently briefed on Amazon's plans said the joint venture would initially focus on using big data analytics, software and apps to help employees cut their healthcare costs.

Average yearly premiums for employer-sponsored family coverage reached $18,764 last year, up 3 per cent from 2016, with workers on average paying $5,714 towards the cost and employers picking up the rest, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan join forces to shake up healthcare

Amazon announced plans to enter the US healthcare industry by teaming up with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase to form a company dedicated to lowering costs, in a move that wiped billions of dollars from the market value of the sector s biggest participants.

The online retail giant said it would join forces with the largest US bank by assets and Warren Buffett s conglomerate to form a not-for-profit healthcare group charged with reducing bills for their almost 1m employees and  potentially all Americans .

The move comes after months of speculation that Amazon was about to enter the healthcare industry, which has weighed on the share prices of insurers, drugmakers, wholesalers and pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs).

Shares in healthcare companies suffered further losses on Tuesday as investors responded to the news that Amazon plans to apply its disruptive force to one of the largest sectors of the US economy, in what could amount to the biggest shake-up of the industry in years.

 The ballooning costs of healthcare act as a hungry tapeworm on the American economy,  said Warren Buffett, chairman and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway. Our group does not come to this problem with answers. But we also do not accept it as inevitable. 

He said the three companies believed that by pooling resources they could  in time  check the rise in health costs and enhance patient satisfaction.

The stock prices of the country s five big health insurers   UnitedHealth, Anthem, Aetna, Humana and Cigna   had dropped by between 3 per cent and 7.2 per cent by the close of trade in New York.

The sell-off also hit PBMs, which act as middlemen that negotiate drug prices on behalf of insurers and employers, but which have been accused of using the savings to bolster their own profits.

Express Scripts, the largest standalone PBM, lost 3.2 per cent while CVS Health, the pharmacy group that operates the Caremark PBM, shed 4.1 per cent.

Shares of large drugmakers also tumbled, as investors fretted they would struggle to maintain premium prices, with Pfizer, AbbVie and Merck losing between 1.6 per cent and 5.3 per cent.

The announcement from Amazon and its partners contained few details, saying only that the new venture would at first focus on  technology solutions  to provide their US workers and families with  simplified, high-quality and transparent healthcare at a reasonable cost .

 The three companies, which bring their scale and complementary expertise to this long-term effort, will pursue this objective through an independent company that is free from profitmaking incentives and constraints,  they said in a statement.

Jay Gelb, analyst at Barclays said Amazon had  the best technical abilities of any company  while JPMorgan could help the consortium  tackle payment-related issues by leveraging its technology .

With 367,000 workers, Berkshire Hathaway is bringing the most employees to the consortium, as well as the ability to test initiatives in the disparate industries where it operates, from insurance to utilities and manufacturing.

One person who was recently briefed on Amazon s plans said the joint venture would initially focus on using big data analytics, software and apps to help employees cut their healthcare costs.

For instance, if a doctor prescribed an expensive brand-name medicine, a smartphone app could send the patient a push notification alerting them to the availability of a cheaper generic alternative.

However, the person said the effort could be a prelude to a more full-fledged venture that would see the three companies explore other options to lower costs, using their more than 950,000 employees and families as a testing ground for new initiatives.

One option would be to  self insure  their employees on a not-for-profit basis with the option of inviting more companies to join the initiative in the future, the person added.

Although some large companies, including carmakers Ford, General Motors and Fiat Chrysler, already fund their own insurance schemes by keeping the premiums and setting aside capital for potential losses, they tend to contract with profitmaking health insurers and PBMs to manage the plans.

Some analysts interpreted the $69bn takeover of insurer Aetna by pharmacy group CVS in December as a defensive move against the retail group s potential entry into the market.

In a series of statements, the chief executives of the three companies signalled the venture was still in its early stages but insisted they felt compelled to act by spiralling healthcare costs that were eating into family budgets.

Annual premiums for employer-sponsored family health coverage reached $18,764 last year, up 3 per cent from 2016, with workers on average paying $5,714 towards the cost of their coverage and employers picking up the rest, according to a report from Kaiser Family Foundation.

Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder and chief, said the healthcare system was complex and the companies were entering  into this challenge open-eyed about the degree of difficulty .

He added:  Hard as it might be, reducing healthcare s burden on the economy while improving outcomes for employees and their families would be worth the effort. 

Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said the bank s employees wanted  transparency, knowledge and control  when managing their healthcare, and that the three companies had  extraordinary resources  to offer services that benefited workers and their families.

The three companies said they would announce the formation of the joint venture soon and named a trio of executives to lead the effort: Todd Combs, an investment officer of Berkshire Hathaway; Marvelle Sullivan Berchtold, a managing director of JPMorgan Chase; and Beth Galetti, a senior vice-president at Amazon.

Blackstone in talks to buy stake in Thomson Reuters unit

Thomson Reuters is in advanced discussions for a sale of part of its financial and risk business, its largest unit by revenues, to US private equity firm Blackstone.

The company confirmed in a statement on Tuesday that it was considering a sale of a stake in the business to Blackstone but would retain an interest in the unit. It will also retain full ownership of Reuters News and its legal, tax and accounting businesses.

The talks with Blackstone were for a 55 per cent stake in the financial and risk business, valuing the unit at $20bn, a person with knowledge of the matter said.

Thomson Reuters  financial and risk unit provides data and analytics to investors and financial institutions. The unit contributed about $6.1bn in revenues to the company in 2016, accounting for more than half of total revenues that year, according to a financial statement.

One of the products within the unit, a data terminal called Eikon, has competed head to head with a similar terminal product from Bloomberg.

A memo to staff from Thomson Reuters president and chief executive Jim Smith, dated January 29, seen by the Financial Times, said a turnround in the financial and risk business had helped attract private equity interest in the unit.

 The progress we have made turning around the F&R business and its future potential are reflected by Blackstone s interest,  the memo said.

The statement from Reuters noted that the talks with Blackstone may or may not lead to a definitive agreement.

As of September, Blackstone managed a record $387bn in assets under management, a 7 per cent rise over the prior year period. At the time it also reported better-than-expected earnings results as its real estate portfolio appreciated.

Asset managers scramble for alternative data analysts to unearth trading hints

Equities

Investment groups have more than quadrupled their number of "alternative data" analysts over the past five years, as asset managers scramble to unlock the potential of trading signals contained in website scrapes, language analysis, credit card purchases and satellite data.

More than 160 big money managers   including Schroders, Fidelity, T Rowe Price, Neuberger Berman and Invesco, as well as scores of hedge funds   employ at least 340 full-time data analysts, scientists and engineers, according to a study by AlternativeData.org, an organisation that tracks the industry. That is up more than fourfold since 2012.

In the past, investment companies might supplement their analysis of economic data and corporate balance sheets by sending junior employees to count the number of visitors at a shopping centre, or hiring psychologists to analyse the body language of executives. This can now be automated and done instantaneously by using artificial intelligence to work through digital data sets. For example, money managers can use "natural language processing" to unearth patterns in analyst earnings calls, TV interviews or central bank speeches; "deep learning" on satellite images of car parks to guess footfall; or aggregate and analyse emailed receipts and credit card swipes to get an edge on consumer spending trends.

"Things have really accelerated over the past year, if not exploded," said Tammer Kamel, head of Quandl, one of the bigger alternative data providers. "Everyone gets this now."

Although there is still a lot of scepticism over how useful this new information will ultimately prove, many traditional asset managers are following the path originally trodden by hedge funds, and are hiring specialised "alternative data" analysts in droves to help them explore the potential. BlackRock is "using machine learning, AI and advanced data processing to drive new forms of alpha generation, from monitoring satellite data of big-box store parking lots, to analysing internet searches for consumer products   enabling us to predict sales volume or even national economic growth", the asset manager said in its last annual report.

As a result, the battle for talent is intensifying. A head of data at an asset manager can command a base salary between $250,000 and $1m, with a commensurate annual bonus on top of that, according to Options Group, a headhunting firm. An entry-level data analyst can expect a base salary of $80,000-$100,000.

However, Options Group's salary indications probably understate the real salaries in the industry by as much as 100 per cent, according to Pablo Cerrilla, editor of AlternativeData.org, given the shortage of data analysts with experience from the financial world.

"The demand for data scientists is evident in an escalating fight for talent," he said.

The study is based on going through LinkedIn profiles, Ipreo and AlternativeData.org's own network of industry members to identify individuals in the business.

BEIJING The sale of a company known for its popular casino-style games for smartphones has hit a regulatory hurdle that could potentially thwart the deal, say people familiar with the matter, and make it the latest high-profile deal to be affected by the country's clampdown on foreign acquisitions.

The company, Playtika, was sold by a unit of casino operator Caesars Entertainment Corp. in 2016 "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-investor-group-buys-israel-based-online-gambling-firm-1469966424" in cash to a Chinese consortium that included an offshore affiliate of Giant Interactive Group and a private-equity firm co-founded by Alibaba's Jack Ma. Giant said its publicly listed unit, Shanghai Giant Network Technology Co., would buy Playtika from the consortium for 30.5 billion yuan ($4.8 billion) in mostly stock pending regulatory approval.

The people familiar with the matter say the China Securities Regulatory Commission is reluctant to approve the sale to Shanghai Giant over concerns that Playtika's games promote gambling, which is illegal in China except for Macau. The CSRC didn't respond to a request for comment.

The people cautioned the acquisition hasn't been formally rejected and could still be approved.

Giant, one of China's largest developers of online games, said in a statement that Playtika remains under "normal review" and that regulators haven't raised specific objections to gambling themes. The company said Playtika's games don't meet the legal definition of gambling and aren't available in China.

Even so, Giant representatives met with regulators last year to explain how no money is won or lost in play, one of the people said.

Winning money isn't possible in Playtika's games, which can be played for free. Its popular slot-machine game, Slotomania, began as a Facebook game before migrating to online app stores run by Apple and Google. The game earns revenue from the small fraction of players who buy virtual coins, which they can bet and trade in for virtual prizes.

"Over the past six to nine months, Chinese regulators have said pretty clearly that gambling-specific-type companies are out of bounds," said Christopher Balding, a professor at the HSBC Business School in Shenzhen. "In 2016, this deal might have been waived through, but in early 2018, it wouldn't surprise me if it didn't."

China's securities regulator received the deal application on Nov. 10, 2016, making it the second-longest among 75 transactions currently in active review. The median time in active review was 75 days as of Jan. 26.

Industry analysts and people familiar with the deal say the long delay is a red flag, and a common tactic used by Chinese regulators to kill deals without taking formal action.

Playtika was founded in 2010 in Israel and acquired for $100 million the following year by Caesars. Slotomania accounted for one-fifth of global spending on social-casino games in November, the most recent data available, according to SuperData Research Inc.

Slotomania is a top-grossing app on mobile platforms run by Google and Apple, according to analytics firm App Annie. This month, it briefly became the third-highest grossing app in the Google Play U.S. store and the ninth-highest in Apple's U.S. App Store, according to App Annie.

Chinese authorities have recently stepped up scrutiny of outbound investments, in particular media and entertainment assets, which tend to be volatile and difficult to price. Amid the clampdown, Dalian Wanda Group abandoned its $1 billion takeover of Golden Globes producer Dick Clark Productions in March 2017. Outbound investments announced by Chinese companies fell by a third last year to $217 billion in deals, according to Dealogic.

Vote on Regulatory Rollback Likely Delayed Until March

Dozens of banks are counting on a bipartisan Senate plan to loosen financial regulations. But they may wait a bit longer than the bill's backers had expected before the measure comes up for a vote on the Senate floor.

At issue is bipartisan legislation introduced by Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R., Idaho) in November that eases postcrisis rules for regional banks, representing the biggest step to ease the financial rule book since Republicans took control of Washington last year. The bill now has some two dozen co-sponsors from both parties and is expected to easily obtain the 60 votes necessary to clear the chamber when it eventually comes up for a vote.

But at this point, that's not likely to happen until March. Republican leaders had hoped to advance the measure through the Senate in early February, according to people familiar with their thinking. That tentative timetable has now slipped, since lawmakers must first grapple with more-urgent legislation to fund the federal government after the current stopgap spending bill expires Feb. 8, as well as try to hammer out a deal on immigration, these people said.

Staff for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) have recently told lobbyists tracking the legislation that the timing for the bill's floor consideration has slipped until after lawmakers return from the weeklong Presidents Day break, one of the people said.

The House will also need to act on the plan. Congressional staff said the House would likely make changes to the bill and send it back to the Senate. Lawmakers are unlikely to reconcile the Senate bill with a broader plan to undo the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act that passed the House last year, called the Financial Choice Act.

To be sure, the regulatory rollback is still on a path to become law. But the longer it takes for the Senate to find the week or so of floor time needed to approve the measure, the more difficult it will become to pass the bill in an election year when much of Washington is expected to shut down in late summer ahead of the midterms.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Banks Pay Big Bucks for Top Billing on College Campuses

By Melissa Korn and Christina Rexrode | Photographs by Emily Wilson for The Wall Street Journal

Colleges and universities are in the business of education. Increasingly, they are also in the business of banking.

Banks like Wells Fargo WFC 0.43% & Co., PNC Financial Services Group Inc . PNC 0.54% and U.S. Bancorp USB 0.22% have signed scores of deals with schools nationwide that essentially make the universities their sales representatives.

The banks get to set up marketing tables at campus events, advertise their products in mailings to students and are promoted as the school's preferred banking option.

In return, the banks pay the institutions royalties, sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars annually and often based on the number of new accounts. Some schools also get paid each time students use their debit accounts, or earn a cut of the ATM fees. With the deals, banks permeate campus life even more than they can with high-profile athletic sponsorships, while schools tap a new revenue stream.

Such comprehensive agreements have been in place for years, but complete deal terms are just coming to light. By Jan. 1, schools had to post details of the payments they get from their banking partners, as well as the number of student accounts and fees.

A Wall Street Journal review of fee and compensation disclosures found that 112 colleges around the U.S. received nearly $18.7 million in fiscal 2017 from banks for consumer finance deals. Much of that is in the form of royalties. Some of those schools, and others, also have other contracts with banks that rent space on campus for ATMs; those agreements are often worth tens of thousands of dollars annually.

Some payments were meager, like the $2,000 Holy Family University in Pennsylvania received from PNC. At the top, University of California, Berkeley , received roughly $1.7 million under its contract with Bank of the West .

The Journal review of those disclosures and more than 150 contracts found that students at community colleges and regional public universities tended to pay the highest average fees in fiscal 2017, sometimes more than $70 a year for things like overdrafts.

At many of the nation's larger schools, where tens of thousands of students have checking and debit accounts with partner banks, average fees were generally under $30 a year.

Twenty-two of the 30 highest average fees The Journal reviewed were at schools with Wells Fargo contracts. Twenty of the 30 lowest were connected to PNC.

Wells Fargo said some students have "more complex banking needs, such as sending wires or purchasing more checks." The bank added, "By establishing relationships with young adults early we are helping them build healthy financial habits."

Nick Certo, who runs PNC's university banking program, said the bank is investing in potential customers and their communities. And, he added, "schools are looking for funding."

Some of the agreements are notable for their sheer size.

The University of Illinois system gets $936,000 in annual royalty payments from PNC and can earn another $200 per account if more than 4,680 new accounts are opened in a given year. Illinois confirmed the contract details.

Banks and universities say the programs offer an optional convenience, allowing students to link their campus identification cards to banking services.

Consumer watchdogs say a bank's presence on campus or co-branded marketing materials could lead students to think it is their best or even only option for banking at school.

The new disclosure requirement came from a 2015 U.S. Department of Education regulation, which some banks and schools resisted.

The Education Department said schools must ensure the accounts they market are "not inconsistent with the best financial interests of the students opening them," including conducting "reasonable due diligence" at least every two years to review whether fees are in line with market rates. They aren't required to share those comparisons with students.

Bank trade groups say the campus accounts could be cheaper than offerings available to the general public, when used appropriately.

Sometimes schools get a cut of the banks' fees. For example, University of Nevada, Las Vegas , can receive a share of the fees charged to non-customers who use a U.S. Bank ATM on campus.

Artesia Graham, an 18-year-old freshman at UNLV, was reluctant to sign up for a U.S. Bank account because she already banked with Wells Fargo . But she wanted the convenience of using her student ID to pay for purchases and using U.S. Bank's campus branch.

Ms. Graham said she didn't know about the financial arrangement between UNLV and the bank. "I don't know the word to use," she said, "but it's maybe kind of odd."

A UNLV spokeswoman said the school looked at how other universities set up their bid processes for vendors and determined industry standards with a focus on what would best serve its students.

A U.S. Bank spokeswoman said the firm wants to build long-term relationships with students "by providing them with the best student banking account in the marketplace." She added that linking student IDs to a debit account helps schools offset the cost of running their ID-card programs.

Banks sometimes sponsor financial-literacy seminars and advertise their debit accounts in college-acceptance letters and tuition bills. They can require that schools link to their websites and kick other banks' ATMs off campus.

Phil Schuman, director of financial literacy at Indiana University Bloomington, said having prime tables at campus events and offering free food can go a long way in attracting student customers.

Mr. Schuman said he has declined offers to have banks host financial wellness seminars: "We don't want to be in the business of telling students,  We know what's best for your finances,'" he said.

The partnerships have a complicated history. A decade ago, some financial aid offices were caught steering students to loan packages that provided administrators kickbacks. Later they were investigated for pitching special credit cards with high interest rates and minimal consumer protections.

New laws have quashed most of that behavior, but they generally don't extend to checking or debit accounts.

In light of the heightened scrutiny and new disclosure requirements, some schools have begun to opt for flat-fee payments rather than earnings based on account volume.

Washington State University moved to a flat $275,000 annual payment when it renegotiated its contract with U.S. Bank in spring 2016, a shift that the bank says it supports. Washington State spokesman Phil Weiler said it was done "to avoid any appearance that WSU staff had any incentive to pressure students to bank with U.S. Bank."

Global Stocks Roar Into 2018, Making Some Investors Even More Nervous

By Steven Russolillo

Stocks around the world have staged one of the best-ever starts to a year, a synchronized rally that has only gained momentum following 2017's sharp gains.

In the U.S., the S&P 500's 7.5% rise in January is its biggest since 1987. In Asia, the Shanghai Composite has already surged 7.6%, surpassing last year's gain. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index is up 11%, rising on all but two days this month. And in Europe, the German DAX and France's CAC 40 are up 3.3% and 4.1%, respectively.

Strong corporate earnings and improving economic growth world-wide have fueled the gains, with the new U.S. tax law, which cuts corporate rates to 21% from 35%, bolstering optimism. The weaker U.S. dollar has been a boon to emerging markets and the recent pickup in Treasury yields has prompted a rotation out of bonds and into stocks, further propelling equity markets, investors say.

The gains have also put some investors on edge, intensifying analysts' concerns about the rising price of buying into a bull market almost nine years old. The rallies have also drawn comparisons to the 2000 Nasdaq peak, when a mania for technology stocks drove the index to a level that it wouldn't recapture for more than a dozen years.

While U.S. stocks have been generally expensive relative to historical norms in recent decades, Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Group, pointed out last week that the median price-to-earnings multiple for stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, Nasdaq and American Stock Exchange has reached a record high.

"For the first time in this recovery, the stock market has finally become expensive based on its  new valuation range,'" Mr. Paulsen said in a note to clients, referring to that record-high price-to-earnings multiple.

Overall, the MSCI All Country World Index, which captures equity returns from 23 developed and 24 emerging markets, has rallied 6.9% so far in January, on pace for its best monthly start to a year over the past three decades.

"I figured we'd rally again in 2018, but I wasn't expecting a full-year's worth of gains in the first few weeks of January," said Andrew Clarke, director of trading at brokerage firm Mirabaud Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong.

The surge in U.S. stock indexes this year has extended a roaring postelection rally that few analysts predicted, taking the S&P 500 index to 14 record closes in 2018, alongside 13 in the Nasdaq Composite Index and 11 in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

Stocks and Treasurys are in the midst of what Goldman Sachs calls the most "extreme" start to a year ever. The bank says its cross-asset risk indicator, a measure of how investors are positioned across various asset classes like stocks, bonds and credit, is at its most bullish since inception in 1991.

"Risk appetite is now at its highest level on record," Goldman analysts wrote to clients, "which leads to the question of what future returns can be."

The investing environment has made billionaire investor Howard Marks nervous. The co-founder of Los Angeles-based Oaktree Capital Management, which has about $100 billion of assets under management, said investors shouldn't get caught up in the rallies and be defensive.

"Most valuation parameters are either the richest ever or among the highest in history," Mr. Marks said, referring to U.S. equity valuations. "In the past, levels like these were followed by downturns. Thus a decision to invest today has to rely on the belief that  it's different this time.'

"I'm convinced the easy money has been made," he said.

Cash has recently started to pour into equity markets at a record-setting pace. Buyers committed a net $58 billion to mutual funds and exchange-traded funds that invest in global stocks over a four-week stretch through Jan. 17, the most inflows for any comparable stretch in records going back to 2002, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

In its monthly summary of market positioning, the bank said that investors' allocations to equities had jumped to a two-year high, whereas positioning in bonds had fallen to a four-year low.

But for some investors, that is evidence of a long-awaited rotation into equities, one that might only be just beginning of more cash supporting stock markets.

"I'm not yet observing that we're at peak optimism," said Samuel Le Cornu, co-head of Asian equities at Macquarie Investment Management in Hong Kong. "I could definitely understand if the market continued to rally from here."

Analysts and investors remain upbeat about emerging markets. "We think emerging market macro fundamentals are the best they've been in 20 years," said Ajay Kapur, head of Asia Pacific and global emerging market strategy at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, pointing to indicators such as current account balances, lending metrics and currency fluctuations. "Out of 17 countries we monitor, not one is sick. That's a very rare thing."

He predicts the MSCI Emerging Markets Index a broad measure of emerging-market equities will double in two years, supported by a weak U.S. dollar and valuations that are cheaper relative to developed markets.

Much of his optimism is due to China, which Mr. Kapur says is the firm's biggest overweight in emerging markets. With Chinese economic growth accelerating again and memories of the 2015 stock-market crash fading, he said conditions are ripe for more gains.

"There are a lot of skeptics out there, but you don't really hear much from them these days," Mr. Kapur said. "They're burrowed into some caves."

Bankers at Davos: Can Anything Stop the Good Times?

By Jenny Strasburg, Liz Hoffman and Thorold Barker

DAVOS, Switzerland Bankers and executives at the World Economic Forum are celebrating a growing economy and rising markets. They see a continuing string of deals flowing their way, cost-saving new technology and a boost from U.S. tax cuts.

But underlying worries persist despite an upbeat economy in practically all corners of the world, said delegates on the sidelines of the event. Among them: The market's ascent has been eerily, steadily calm.

"It does feel to me a little bit like 2006," said Jes Staley, chief executive of British lender Barclays PLC. " Maybe we've solved the riddle of economic cycles' that's what we were all saying. We really got that wrong."

One concern, Mr. Staley said, is investors have become complacent with low market volatility. "The system is geared. When there's a reversal, it could be fast."

Investors' portfolios have chugged steadily higher in value. "The whole world is going up in a straight line," said Michael Lavelle , who runs Citigroup Inc .'s investment bank in the U.K. "But for how long?"

Mark Hantho, Deutsche Bank AG's chairman of global capital markets, said he sees the ratio of optimism versus caution this year at 70-30. "Markets have run very quickly. People are asking, how can it be this good? What am I missing?"

But banking clients don't want to miss out on deals or securities issuance and regret that later, he said. "There's a little bit of fear of being left behind."

Some are roundly bullish. "I've been coming since 2010. I've never seen a Davos more positive," said Manuel Falco, Citigroup 's head of corporate and investment banking for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Behind the optimism is fundamental strength in corporate earnings, commodity prices and accommodative central bank policies, said James Amine , head of investment banking and capital markets at Credit Suisse Group AG .

"The market will dip. It won't be a straight line up through December 31st. I still feel good," said Mr. Amine. He added that days packed with Davos meetings bolstered his view that CEOs are more confident than they've been since 2006-2007.

"There's always things to worry about but not a lot until the middle of 2019," said Mary Callahan Erdoes , CEO of asset and wealth management at JPMorgan Chase & Co.

She said Europe is one of the most attractive areas for investment, and "there is an insatiable appetite for private equity right now."

Artificial intelligence, blockchain and other developing technologies permeated Davos presentations, and also meetings among bankers and company executives. Technology is driving deals but also presents risks, they said.

European companies recognize they've lost the battle for the online consumer to big U.S. technology companies. "Their attention is now turned to the business consumer," said Wolfgang Fink, co-head of Goldman Sachs Group Inc .'s German and Austrian business.

"There's an acute anxiety among European companies to protect their edge," Mr. Fink said. European companies are pausing in some cases when considering deals involving manufacturing technology and internet solutions.

Zurich Insurance Group Ltd. CEO Mario Greco said he doesn't see big financial risks in the system not in inflation nor rising rates. More likely threats are political, social or ecological, he said. That's a change from last year, when concerns such as China's economy were pronounced. Cybersecurity ranks high among bankers as a potential cause for a market downturn.

Some big investors feel the froth has gone too far, even with still-low interest rates. Canada's PSP Investments, which manages C$140 billion in retirement assets, has shifted some money from stocks to fixed-income assets. They are "the lesser of two evils," said CEO Andre Bourbonnais.

For banks, the mood is partially dulled by investment-banking businesses grappling with new competition, pressure on fees and other long-term declines.

The lack of volatility is hurting bank trading operations, which make money by seizing on price swings in stocks, bonds and other assets. Trading revenues fell sharply in 2017 at big banks.

"From an economic standpoint, it is blue sky," said Andrea Orcel , who runs investment banking at UBS Group AG . "From an asset-price standpoint, blue sky. But investors are not trading. There is no in-and-out."

Merger and acquisition volume is running at a level well above the historical average. Cheap debt and sky-high stock prices give companies plenty of currency for deals. With the U.S. tax changes, "CEOs have high confidence in the economy to be more acquisitive," said Daniel Pinto , who runs JPMorgan 's corporate and investment bank.

Blockchain and bitcoin have been topics in just about every Davos venue, including a prominent street-front meeting spot in town. Payments executives expressed optimism about the technology's prospects to reduce costs and transaction times.

But to some economists it looks a lot like a bubble. Robert Shiller, Yale University professor and economics Nobel Prize winner, said buyers who missed out on the housing and stock-market boom are flocking to bitcoin. They're drawn in by "the existential meaninglessness of life when you're not invested in anything," he said.

SEC Alleges Insider Trading Ahead of Sanofi 's Purchase of Bioverativ

By Dave Michaels

WASHINGTON U.S. securities regulators on Friday sued to freeze the profits of people who are alleged to have scored a windfall this week by trading on illegal tips about Sanofi SA 's $11.5 billion purchase of hemophilia drugmaker Bioverativ.

The Securities and Exchange Commission filed the suit in federal district court in Manhattan and said the traders' identities is unknown. The lawsuit seeks an order that would force Credit Suisse , which processed the trades through an account in Zurich, to disclose the traders' names.

The traders paid about $170,000 for the options and earned about $4.9 million in profit after Bioverativ's price skyrocketed 61% on Monday, when the deal was announced. The SEC said the trades are "highly suspicious" because the bullish option contracts were purchased from Jan. 12 to Jan. 19, one business day before the disclosure that French drugmaker Sanofi would acquire Bioverativ for $105 a share.

The SEC alleged the traders didn't have a prior history of significant trading in Bioverativ options and benefited from inside information to reap their profits. The regulator is seeking that the defendants disgorge their trading gains and pay fines.

Hedge Funds Go Bullish on Bitcoin Futures

By Alexander Osipovich

Hedge funds have swung their bitcoin-futures bets to the bullish side for the first time, a marked turn around from a few weeks ago, according to figures released on Friday.

The data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission suggests a shift in sentiment among so-called "leveraged funds," a category that includes hedge funds. Ever since late December, when the CFTC began publishing weekly reports on the new bitcoin-futures market run by Cboe Global Markets Inc ., data had shown that these funds were bearish on bitcoin, unlike smaller investors who are overwhelmingly bullish.

Futures are a type of derivative that allow traders to bet on whether the price of an asset will rise or fall. Long positions in bitcoin futures profit if the price of the digital currency rises, while short positions pay off if it falls.

The most recent CFTC report showed leveraged funds with 1,142 long positions in bitcoin futures, more than double the 518 short positions they held.

That data was current as of Tuesday, Jan. 23, although it was only released Friday. By comparison, as of Dec. 26, hedge funds' short positions in Cboe bitcoin futures outnumbered their long positions by more than 4 to 1, CFTC data show.

The shift in hedge-fund sentiment came as the price of bitcoin slumped by 31% over that period, according to data from research site CoinDesk. Bitcoin was trading at $10,898.99 late Friday afternoon, according to CoinDesk, after having approached $20,000 mark in December, when heavy retail investor interest pushed the digital currency to record highs.

Since then, a crackdown on digital-currency trading in South Korea, one of the largest markets for bitcoin, helped fuel the selloff.

Chicago-based Cboe was the first regulated U.S. exchange operator to launch bitcoin futures in December, followed by its larger crosstown rival, CME Group Inc .

Still, bitcoin futures remain a relatively small market compared with bitcoin itself, making them an unreliable bellwether for trends in the digital currency, traders say.

Japanese Cryptocurrency Exchange Coincheck to Pay Back Customers After Hack

By Peter Landers

TOKYO Japanese exchange Coincheck Inc. said Sunday it would spend up to 46.3 billion ($426 million) to pay back customers after it was hacked and lost cryptocurrency worth some $530 million two days earlier.

In a release on its website, Coincheck said customers holding the cryptocurrency NEM would be paid back in Japanese yen at a rate of 88.549 yen per NEM. The company said it lost 523 million NEM after the cyberattack, meaning the payments would amount to 46.3 billion. It said about 260,000 customers hold NEM.

Coincheck didn't say when customers would get the yen. It said it would use its own funds for the payments, but didn't say whether it had that much yen cash on hand.

The rate being used by Coincheck reflects the fall in NEM's price in yen after Coincheck's problems became known on Friday. Some Twitter users criticized Coincheck's rate, saying it should compensate customers at the earlier, higher rate or pay them back in NEM rather than in yen.

Coincheck has described itself as Japan's largest bitcoin exchange based on trading volume. On Friday, it halted withdrawals of all cryptocurrencies and yen after the hack.

The losses in the apparent heist, if confirmed, would likely go down as the largest in the nine-year history of bitcoin and digital currencies.

On Sunday, Coincheck said it was working to restore service and still wanted to get a license from Japanese authorities to operate as a cryptocurrency exchange. Japan started requiring bitcoin exchanges to be licensed last year, but some exchanges such as Coincheck that were already operating and had applied for a license were allowed to stay in business.

Japan's other major case of cryptocurrency losses took place nearly four years ago at Mt. Gox , then the world's largest bitcoin exchange. The exchange operator tried to stay in business after initially discovering the losses, which amounted to about $450 million based on bitcoin's price at the time, but it ended up in bankruptcy court liquidation. The court process is continuing and Mt. Gox customers are still awaiting compensation.

BNP Paribas Reaches $90 Million Settlement With Justice Over Forex

By Allison Prang

BNP Paribas USA Inc. said Friday it has reached a settlement with the Justice Department after an investigation into whether the bank engaged in efforts to manipulate currency rates.

The company, which is the U.S.-based subsidiary of France's BNP Paribas SA , will pay a fine of $90 million and plead guilty to violating the Sherman Antitrust Act, it said in a news release Friday.

The investigation was related to the company's conduct from 2011 to 2013.

The New York State Department of Financial Services as well as the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors had also looked into the bank's foreign-exchange practices, the company said. BNP Paribas USA said the settlement completes those investigations.

Last year, the company was fined by both regulators.

The company said it "deeply regrets the past misconduct that led to this settlement, which was a clear breach" of its standards.

American depositary receipts in BNP Paribas SA were up 0.2% to $42.30 in late Friday morning trading.

Wall Street to Vanguard: We're Not Your Doormat

By Sarah Krouse

Wall Street is fighting back against Vanguard Group.

In the past year, large financial firms including Fidelity Investments , TD Ameritrade and Morgan Stanley have all made changes to their fees or product lineups that make it more expensive for some customers to invest in Vanguard's funds. In some cases, these firms have even made it impossible to invest in Vanguard mutual funds at all.

The changes made so far are small and have occurred in several different corners of the investing market, but they represent a stark shift for an industry that has struggled to manage being both Vanguard's partner and competitor.

Vanguard has pulled in record levels of new cash in recent years as investors plowed money into lower-cost index-tracking funds. It now manages nearly $5 trillion in assets, up from $1.4 trillion 10 years ago.

That growth was aided for years by Wall Street as many wealth managers and brokerage firms sold inexpensive Vanguard products to their customers. More recently, rival money managers have tried to better compete on price, slashing their fees.

Now, rival asset managers, brokerage firms and retirement-plan administrators are fighting back more aggressively.

Fidelity, the largest 401(k) plan administrator in the country, will now charge some new corporate customers that hire the firm to run their 401(k) plans a fee of 0.05% on assets invested in Vanguard funds. That new fee covers administrative services that Fidelity provides as a 401(k) record-keeper, a spokeswoman for the Boston firm said.

"A small number of fund families have not compensated Fidelity for certain services, and this pricing change is designed to address that disparity with the intention of providing fairness across all of our business relationships," she added. "This is about leveling the playing field."

Fidelity explicitly requires employers to pay the fee, rather than passing it off to plan participants, a person familiar with the matter said. Companies and plan participants typically share 401(k) plan administration costs, however, which means savers could bear some or all of the new cost if an employer sought to recoup the new expense in a less explicit way, retirement industry executives say.

The fee is small but could add up over time.

For example, an investor who put $10,000 into a mutual fund that charges 0.1% and achieves a 5% annual return would have $41,942 after 30 years, according to Bankrate.com. An additional 0.05% fee on those assets would mean the investor earns $626 less over that period.

Executives from the two firms have been in talks for years over Vanguard's refusal to pay the servicing costs. In December, leaders from both firms met at Vanguard's Pennsylvania headquarters, and Fidelity executives pressed the firm to reconsider its stance, according to people familiar with the matter. Fidelity ultimately put the fee change in place without notifying Vanguard, the people said.

"It's definitely unusual; we haven't seen any other charge like this," said Emily Wrightson, director at Cammack Retirement Group, Inc., adding that it could deter companies considering whether or not to hire Fidelity if their employees prefer Vanguard funds. "I don't think it's going to help" Fidelity win new business, she said.

Fidelity is by far the largest 401(k) record-keeper in the U.S., according to consulting firm Cerulli Associates, with a nearly 30% market share and about $1.4 trillion in assets in the plans it administers. Of those assets, 13% are in Vanguard products, according to research firm BrightScope Inc .

The recent move by Fidelity's retirement business, which was first reported by InvestmentNews, is unconventional because it appears to only affect Vanguard and because of the scale of the fee, industry executives say. The 0.05% charge on assets in Vanguard funds amounts to more than 40% of the average expense ratio across Vanguard's mutual funds.

Fidelity's additional fee makes comparably priced funds with similar investment mandates it offers even more competitive with Vanguard's funds.

In 2016, Fidelity slashed prices on more than two dozen index-tracking funds, putting them on par with or below those of comparable products offered by Vanguard. Across the industry, there are now 571 mutual funds that charge investors 0.1% or less, compared with 425 at the end of 2012, according to Morningstar Inc . At Vanguard, the average expense ratio of its funds is 0.12%.

One reason Vanguard has been able to offer such low fees for so long is the structure of its business: It is owned by its fund shareholders. The Malvern, Pa., money-management giant also allows investors to buy mutual funds directly from it unlike many of its rivals and trade its exchange-traded funds commission-free.

The new 401(k) fee at Fidelity won't apply to existing clients with assets in Vanguard funds. Large companies that currently offer Vanguard funds in 401(k) plans run by Fidelity include International Business Machines Corp . , according to the most recent regulatory filings available from the Labor Department.

Fidelity isn't alone in targeting Vanguard. Other brokerage platforms have also taken steps that make the index giant's products less appealing than comparably priced funds sold by rivals.

TD Ameritrade late last year overhauled its commission-free ETF trading lineup, dropping all 32 Vanguard products it had previously included. That overhaul increased the total number of ETFs that could be traded commission-free.

Morgan Stanley last year decided to ban its financial advisers from selling clients new positions in Vanguard mutual funds, the Journal reported. Merrill Lynch has long had such a policy for its advisers.

Moves to deter the use of Vanguard funds have at times stalled.

Morgan Stanley , for example, considered changing the compensation calculation for its financial advisers to discourage them from keeping clients in Vanguard funds, but ultimately decided against it, according to people familiar with the matter. The change mooted would have excluded client assets in mutual funds that don't pay for distribution when calculating financial-adviser compensation.

While some moves have made rival funds relatively less expensive, they have so far done little to halt the tidal wave of new cash flowing into Vanguard's products and in some cases risk driving investors loyal to Vanguard to the firm's own retirement administration and brokerage businesses.

Essay: My 10-Year Odyssey Through America's Housing Crisis

By Ryan Dezember

After looking at several houses along Alabama's Gulf Coast, we decided the sunny cottage on Audubon Drive in Foley was the one so long as the seller came down a little on the price.

It had two bedrooms, two bathrooms, an attached garage, a tidy shed that was painted picnic-table red and a pair of towering longleaf pines. It sat in an oval subdivision of cookie-cutter homes on a lot roughly the size of a basketball court. There was just enough room for the dog to run in the backyard without trampling the vegetable garden we envisioned.

It was convenient to my newspaper office in Foley and to the school in Gulf Shores where my wife taught kindergarten. The beaches along the Gulf of Mexico were a short drive away, but far enough to pardon us from flood insurance. The Realtor walked us over to see the neighborhood playground.

A week before Thanksgiving in 2005, we signed the papers to buy the house for $137,500. We painted the walls and hung blinds in time to have friends over for the holiday.

Twelve years later, little about my life remained the same. I'd left Alabama to take a job at The Wall Street Journal. I was no longer married. Pierre, the dog, had died of old age. But I was still sending mortgage payments each month to a bank in Alabama.

I would have sold the house long ago, and in fact I tried. But when the U.S. housing market collapsed in 2007, the property's value fell far below the amount I borrowed to buy it.

Walking away was never an option. I'd signed papers promising to pay the money back and I intended to do so one way or another. In case my moral compass ever needed a shake, laws in Alabama, as in many states, allow lenders to pursue the difference between the mortgage debt on a property and what it fetches in a foreclosure sale.

For much of the past decade that number kept growing. At one point, it would have been nearly $70,000.

Housing collapse

When I bought the house, I was a newlywed three years out of college, believing I had achieved a signature goal of most young Americans. Instead, I set myself up to pursue an inverted version of the American dream. Most young people aspire to buy their first home. I spent a decade trying to get rid of mine.

Ten years ago, the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression roared to life. The collapse of the U.S. housing market wiped out some $11 trillion in household wealth.

Almost eight million people would lose their homes to foreclosure. At its depths, more than 12 million Americans were "underwater," meaning their homes were worth less than the balances remaining on their mortgages.

The collapse was particularly brutal on Alabama's Gulf Coast, which was in the midst of an anything-goes building boom when prices crashed. The region fell into a deep funk prolonged by the Deepwater Horizon oil spill and the opioid epidemic. In Audubon Place, my subdivision of starter homes, close to a third of its 109 houses were foreclosed. One of them twice.

Among underwater homeowners, I was fortunate. The house, and the mortgage, were modest. I was in the early stages of my career, with greater earnings potential ahead. And I was single again, not yet 30 and had no children to support.

Millions of homeowners moored to underwater properties had it worse, suffering in ways more subtle than those who lost houses. Many of these homeowners couldn't relocate for better jobs, move growing families into bigger houses or enroll their children in better schools or at least do so without draining savings. They probably couldn't refinance their homes to take advantage of interest rates that were kept historically low in response to the collapse.

Then, early last year, my situation began to brighten. For years I had been renting the house at a loss to help cover expenses while waiting for the market to rebound. Every so often I'd scan local listings and sales data to see how far I had to climb. Performing this routine one day last February, I saw a rental ad for a nearly identical house down the street listed for much less than what I was charging.

My tenants saw the ad, too. They asked the company that managed both rentals if they could break their lease with me to move to the cheaper place.

To most landlords this would have been a bad break. But in my upside-down situation, it was great news.

Home prices in the subdivision had not fully recovered from the crash, but they had crept higher. Meanwhile, years of mortgage payments had worn down the balance of my debt.

Now that it was empty, a Realtor in Alabama with whom I had been consulting for several months said that if I fixed up the house and listed it in the spring, when buyers were out and the yard was in bloom, I might be able to get $115,000 for it. That was $22,500 less than I'd paid, but it would be enough to wipe out the mortgage debt and cover most of the sale expenses.

In late March I took a week off work, packed a rental car with tools and a sleeping bag and headed south.

Speculation

When I was looking for my first home, many Americans were thinking about houses in a new way less as shelter and more as investments.

This prompted huge price increases, speculation and harried construction. Few places embraced the frenzy as enthusiastically as the Gulf Coast, a region known both derisively and romantically as the Redneck Riviera.

Hurricane Ivan's direct hit in 2004 had cleared land along the shore for new development. Insurance money poured in and zoning laws were rewritten. The next year, Hurricane Katrina kicked up demand for housing when it wiped out entire towns in neighboring Mississippi and Louisiana.

Oceanfront condominium projects that were little more than watercolor renderings and building permits sold out in minutes. Investors got their hands on paper condos for as little as a letter of credit from their bank, and flipped the units to others while the glassy towers went up. A local real-estate agency ran late-night commercials touting riches to be made flipping.

Everyone made money in the condo game the developer, the lenders, the brokers and as many as a half-dozen flippers on a single unit, who could trade with almost no money down before the building was finished and the sale had to be closed. The only requirement was the existence of someone else willing to pay a higher price.

One group of developers proposed a residential building overlooking a swim-with-the-dolphins attraction that would be the centerpiece of a giant go-kart facility. Another group hired a band and set up a dance floor in a furniture store parking lot to pitch $450,000 lots in the woods along a man-made shipping channel.

Construction created plenty of overtime for anyone with a strong back. Clerks quit jobs at the outlet mall to become real-estate agents and mortgage brokers. Monthly house payments were suddenly within reach for many low-wage workers.

My job at the Mobile Register, where I covered the boom, could not have been going better. My 1,000-square-foot cottage was shaping up nicely, too. I installed French doors that swung open to a backyard planted with azaleas and several saplings. I spruced up the front with oleander and ferns in a bed lined with decorative stones.

The marriage was another story. After two years, in the summer of 2007, my college sweetheart and I split up and agreed to sell the house as part of our divorce.

Unfortunately, the market had unraveled before our marriage.

New worries

Housing had turned from a source of profits and jubilation on Wall Street to one of worry.

That June in New York, as home prices began to fall and mortgage delinquencies rose, about a dozen anxious creditors gathered at a Park Avenue office tower to meet with executives from Bear Stearns . Of particular concern was the faltering performance of two of the bank's hedge funds, which had bet more than $20 billion on mortgages granted to home buyers with poor credit.

For decades, the steady growth of U.S. home prices had attracted investors from all over the world to securities known as collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, which pooled large numbers of individual mortgages into single securities. If borrowers paid their bills, investors made money.

As demand surged during the housing boom of the 2000s, mortgage underwriters began to cut corners. Borrowers with sketchy, or subprime, credit were lured with low teaser rates that ballooned over time. Some were approved without anyone verifying their income. These loans were folded into securities that were given ratings on par with those assigned to U.S. government bonds.

Investment firms also sold credit default swaps, which were essentially insurance against losses in CDOs, as well as synthetic CDOs used to bet on the performance of actual CDOs. As a result, a single ill-advised mortgage might play a role in the performance of dozens of securities. Former Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner once said sorting it out was as tough as untangling "cooked spaghetti."

In all, the trillions of dollars invested in securities backed by subprime mortgages represented a bet on U.S. housing that was considerably higher than the value of the actual property involved.

A timeline of the crisis prepared by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis points to Feb. 27, 2007, as an early sign of the brewing calamity, when the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp . announced it would no longer buy the riskiest type of subprime mortgages.

For me, the first hint was the smell of hot garbage wafting over the hedge. It was coming from the house next door. The young couple who owned it were gone. They paid $153,000 for their house around the same time we'd bought ours, setting a new high-water mark in Audubon Place. Now it was as if they had vanished. There was no note, no for-sale sign. They hadn't even bothered to take out the trash. Inside, a half-eaten pizza festered on a countertop.

As the abandoned pool in their backyard filled with roof shingles and palm fronds, I prepared to sell our house. To cover sales commissions and other expenses, we'd have to sell it for more than we'd paid for it.

The Realtor who had sold it to us didn't think it was even worth the trouble to try. Instead, I turned to a co-worker's wife who had just become a real-estate agent and was eager for a listing. On Nov. 19, 2007, we listed the house for $149,000 with the understanding we'd accept much less.

She hosted open houses, pounded arrows into the subdivision's entrance to point the way and tied balloons to the yard sign. She baked cookies and wrote her mother's name in a guest book so that it would not be empty for the first arrival.

Her foray into real estate was as ill-timed as ours. Not even the cookies got a nibble. After a few fruitless months she moved on. I stuck a for-sale-by-owner sign in the yard, hoping for a quick rebound.

 Perfect storm'

As 2008 began, a full-blown crisis was unfolding in New York. Big banks rang in the New Year by reporting tens of billions of dollars in mortgage-related losses.

Bear Stearns , near bankruptcy, fell into the arms of JPMorgan Chase & Co . in March. Five months later, the U.S. Treasury took over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the more than $5 trillion in mortgages they held or had guaranteed. Lehman Brothers Holdings , the country's oldest investment bank, filed for bankruptcy protection a week later, and Merrill Lynch was forced to sell itself to Bank of America Corp .

The U.S. government bailed out American International Group , which had sold about $79 billion of protection against losses from mortgage-related securities without putting nearly enough cash aside to cover the obligations. Citigroup Inc . had to be bailed out later.

The Federal Reserve chopped interest rates to try to slow the bleeding, but it was no use. Foreclosures swelled as droves of underwater homeowners walked away.

In April 2009, early in his first term, President Barack Obama said a "perfect storm of irresponsibility and poor decision-making that stretched from Wall Street to Washington to Main Street" had brought a "day of reckoning."

On the Gulf Coast, condo buyers balked and home prices plummeted. Subdivision developers disappeared and cranes idled at surfside towers. Jobs vanished. It was a bonanza for bankruptcy lawyers.

A pivot from go-karts to water park couldn't save the swim-with-the-dolphins condo project, and the men who wanted to build a town center along the Intracoastal Waterway were bankrupted by their own misadventures in condo flipping. The woman who promised flipping riches on TV was convicted of fraud in federal court and sent to prison.

In my neighborhood, luxury cars were repossessed, foreclosures piled up and opioids moved in.

To save money, my newspaper, the Mobile Register, shuttered the small office I'd been assigned to and told me to work from home. The front bedroom of my house, where I set up shop, offered a prime view of the neighborhood going to seed.

Some mornings when I fetched the newspaper from the driveway, I was greeted by neighbors who were already drinking beer. A young woman who was renting next door lost custody of her children and began shuffling in her pajamas to a party house down the street. Sometimes I wouldn't see her for days. I tossed wadded-up slices of bread over the fence for the dog she left tied up in a dusty corner of the yard.

She came home once when I was spraying a hose over the fence to fill the dog's empty bowl. She said nothing and walked inside.

Another neighbor died from a drug overdose. Her corpse was wheeled out of the house as the afternoon school bus pulled up. On another occasion, the police arrived at a suspected drug den down the street to investigate the death of an 11-month-old boy.

One afternoon, I had to interrupt a phone interview that I was conducting to chase two fighting men from my front yard. They were flinging decorative stones from the flower bed at each other while they argued over a soured sale of pain pills.

After I shooed them away, one of the combatants slunk back and rang my doorbell to beg for a ride home. His buddy had peeled away after an old woman who lived at the house where the fracas began shot out the truck's windshield.

On a Friday morning in early June 2010, I walked outside to grab the newspaper and noticed an acrid smell. I looked over the hedge, hoping to find someone tarring the roof on the abandoned house next door. Nobody was there.

The odor, I soon learned, was emanating from the Gulf of Mexico, 6 miles to the south, where huge rafts of toxic goop from BP PLC 's Deepwater Horizon oil spill weeks earlier had begun to splash ashore.

By July, all 32 miles of beach between Mobile Bay and the Florida Panhandle had been fouled, and tourism ground to a halt.

Waiters, hotel clerks and beach attendants lost their jobs. The for-hire fishing crews who normally chased cobia and red snapper resorted to scouting for crude as part of the cleanup effort. Shrimp boats dragged oil-absorbent boom through the water instead of nets.

The Register, already battling competition from online advertising, suffered, too. As it laid off co-workers and slashed salaries, I started looking for a new job. Home prices continued to fall.

Distressed sales

Selling the house wasn't an option.

Though Washington policy makers had bailed out banks to keep them lending, pushed interest rates to historic lows and initiated programs for borrowers in danger of losing their homes, there weren't many options for someone in my situation, which was getting worse with each new foreclosure on Audubon Drive.

By the summer of 2010, there had been 17, including the one that had been abandoned next door. A unit of Citigroup held the mortgage when it soured, and the New York bank bought the property from itself on the courthouse steps in February for $80,100. By October, the home had become the possession of Freddie Mac , which unloaded it to an Indiana woman for $44,900.

Distressed sales, such as courthouse auctions, don't factor into appraisals. I wish they did. Instead, it was the second, even lower sales, that set the value of my home.

A September appraisal of my house came back at $76,000, down about a third from two years earlier.

When I landed a job with the Journal in Houston, my only option was to rent the house until the market improved.

Determined to lower the payments, I drove to the bank where I had taken out the mortgage five years earlier and asked for the banker who had made my loan. I was told he no longer worked there and was handed a 1-800 number. I spoke to one call-center worker after another, spending hours on hold, restarting the conversation with each transfer or disconnection. There was a comical amount of faxed correspondence.

The lawyers, real-estate agents and mortgage brokers I consulted shook their heads. A few bank employees told me, candidly, to skip a payment or two and feign distress to draw the bank to the negotiating table. I tried that once. Almost immediately, I was inundated with threatening calls.

Renting the house presented another obstacle. Though my ex-wife hadn't been involved with the property for years, her name remained on the deed. To enroll it in a rental program with a local property manager, I needed her signature, which she declined to give, for a variety of reasons.

In order to move on with my life, I had to do something absurd. To rent out my house, I had to buy it from us, repaying the existing mortgage to sever her ties to the property.

I drained my recession-battered 401(k) to pay closing costs and make up the difference between what I owed and the $122,500 that the bank was willing to lend me anew. Because the new price was still higher than the property's appraised value, part of the loan was at 10.05%, closer to a credit-card rate. That made the prospect of breaking even more unlikely, but I had no choice if I wanted to move on in my career. Plus, I'd already moved to Texas.

So began my turn as a reluctant and wildly unprofitable landlord.

Problem renters

My first tenant was a single mother with a young son. She paid $650 a month, which covered about half my monthly expenses. She agreed to keep up the yard with the mower I left behind.

Before long, the rent checks stopped coming. She invited relatives to move in, and they refused to leave. I hesitated to evict them around the holidays, hoping that her ability or perhaps willingness to pay rent might change in the New Year. It did not.

On a lark, I checked the county jail's booking website. There I saw my tenant, in a fresh mug shot. She and her family left only after I filed eviction paperwork and they learned that sheriff's deputies would be by to see them out.

Another renter asked permission to break her lease to take a better job out of state. Knowing what it was like to be trapped, I agreed to let her go. When she moved out, she took the microwave, washer and dryer and just about everything else that wasn't nailed down. She even swiped the smoke detectors, which were hard-wired to the house and out-of-reach without the ladder. She took that, too.

But I was able to nudge the rent higher with each new tenant. Over time, a respite from major hurricanes reduced my insurance premium, and the property tax bill dwindled with the value of the property, which county assessor's appraised in 2011 at less than $60,000. In good months, my losses could be less than $300. When rent went unpaid or costly repairs popped up, my losses could have a comma.

From afar I could only imagine what was going on in Alabama. The few clues I received painted a grim picture.

There was the jail mug shot. A curious line item on a repair invoice following that first tenant's particularly destructive tenure read: "pressure washed garage floor due to fish odor." Citations from the neighborhood homeowners association alerted me to mysterious piles of vegetation piled out front and a big boat that had been parked in the driveway.

In one letter to homeowners, the association threatened to close the communal playground because of the used condoms, lighters and graffiti turning up. Another called for volunteers to help repair a breach in the perimeter fence that residents of a nearby trailer park were using as a shortcut to the dollar store.

"What trailer park?" I wondered. "What dollar store?"

Investors pounce

The housing collapse wasn't bad for everyone. Several of my friends bought their first homes on the cheap.

In 2011, when the national inventory of foreclosures swelled to nearly 1.6 million, Wall Street investors pounced, snapping up tens of thousands of homes at rock-bottom prices. Some paid banks a pittance to acquire batches of nonperforming loans.

The roughly $40 billion that institutional investors spent on foreclosed homes was concentrated in a few of the country's hardest hit areas, including Atlanta, Miami and Phoenix, supporting prices in those markets. Unfortunately for me, these investors weren't buying in south Alabama.

Toward the end of 2011, the Journal moved me to New York to write about Wall Street financiers. In that role I spoke in late 2013 with Stephen Schwarzman , co-founder and chief executive of Blackstone Group LP, about his firm's huge bet on rental houses. Following the foreclosure crisis, Blackstone spent some $10 billion buying and renovating about 50,000 properties.

At a private dinner the firm hosted with reporters at Manhattan's Smith & Wollensky steakhouse, I joked with Mr. Schwarzman about being a tiny competitor of his. He made the bull case for owning rental homes.

Then he leaned over, pointed at the ceiling and said, "Don't sell your house."

"Steve," I thought, "that won't be a problem."

A few months later, I opened a letter and learned that county tax assessors had valued my property at $52,200, less than half what I owed the bank, and less than half what my insurance company deemed the house to be worth.

Seven years after the U.S. housing market collapsed, at a time when millions of others had put the economic calamity behind them, I was still stuck. The house I owned would be twice as valuable on fire than on the market.

Fresh paint

I pulled up to the house in the early morning hours of April 1, 2017, for the first time since 2010. I was spent from the 20-hour drive from New York, but pleasantly surprised by what I saw.

The house was in better shape than I had expected, though it had changed enough that it no longer felt entirely mine. The front door was painted the same slate blue, but the first room beyond it was a new yellowy white. Small trees and shrubs I'd planted, which couldn't have walked off by themselves, had gone, roots and all.

On the bright side, two cypress saplings the size of pencils when I planted them a decade earlier had grown some 30 feet.

For three days and nights I painted, planted bushes and repaired leaky faucets. I made so many trips to Lowe's for mulch and electrical outlets that one of the cashiers expressed interest in renting the place if I couldn't sell it. I rattled the windows with music as I worked and slept a few hours each night in sleeping bag on the floor of my old bedroom.

Audubon Place had perked up since 2010. Older couples seeking bargain retirement homes near the beach had moved in and tidied up several of the neighborhood's problem properties. The trash-filled pool next door had been filled in and sodded over.

Hints of seedy days remained. As I dragged my tenants' abandoned possessions to the curb, a neighbor came by and asked if my renters had left anything good behind. There were Halloween decorations, art supplies, a couple of baby photos, trade school brochures, a Nintendo and a few dirty movies, I told him.

"Any pills?" my neighbor asked.

In the conversation that followed I learned that my house had been a place to score painkillers.

Before I'd finished working, my Realtor called to say he'd received an offer. It was a lowball bid from an out-of-towner. I turned it down, but the quick interest bode well.

As I packed up my tools and prepared for the drive home to New York, I walked around back and took in the yard as the sun set. Despite all the trouble the house had caused, there were things I would miss about the place.

I spent much of the ride back making calculations in my head. What is the lowest offer I could accept? How long could I afford to leave it vacant and on the market? If it didn't sell soon, I'd have to rent it again, postponing escape for at least another year.

The deal closes

Within a week, a retired couple from Minnesota agreed to pay $112,000. They waived an inspection and my Realtor volunteered to cut his commission to help make the deal happen.

The appraisal hit the mark, no termites turned up and the deal closed in May.

From the original purchase in 2005 to last year's sale, I lost $25,500. My losses as a landlord? At least $35,000. Whatever the sum, it no longer mattered. I was free.

At a staff meeting last summer, my editors at the Journal put out a call for stories to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the housing crash. One colleague pitched a story about young Wall Street types who viewed the crisis as a historical event. Such a story would have never occurred to me. As far as I was concerned, the housing crisis had ended just a few weeks earlier.

About 2.5 million American homes are still worth less than their mortgage debt, according to estimates by CoreLogic . That is about double what it should be in an otherwise healthy market, said Frank Nothaft , CoreLogic 's chief economist.

Those of us who have emerged from underwater missed the chance to buy low. Home prices in many markets now exceed their 2006 peaks.

Investors such as Mr. Schwarzman who amassed thousands of houses to rent have bet more than $40 billion wagering that the crisis was so traumatic for people like me, and so destructive to our finances, that we'll be renters forever. They may be right.

At a wedding I attended recently, I met a real-estate broker who touted the riches to be made by buying units in the glassy residential towers popping up along the waterfront in Brooklyn, where I live. No matter how slapdash the construction, she said, prices have only one direction to go.

I had sunglasses on. She didn't see me rolling my eyes.

Lured by Market Records and Hot Bets, Individual Investors Dive In

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/lured-by-market-records-and-hot-bets-individual-investors-finally-dive-in-1516997957", individual investors are finally pouring in.

Discount brokerages TD Ameritrade Holdings Corp ., E*Trade Financial Corp . and Charles Schwab Corp . reported surges in client activity at the end of 2017 that have accelerated in January. The firms attributed much of the activity to retail, or individual, investors who are opening brokerage accounts for the first time, some of them lured by the boom in cryptocurrency and cannabis investments.

"There's pent-up activity and some element of the fear of missing out," said Devin Ryan, a brokerage analyst and managing director at JMP Securities LLC, especially among younger investors as the stock market continues to hit highs.

This rise in interest in some of the riskiest new areas highlights investor optimism that is spurring more trading activity across age demographics and markets. And analysts say the strong trading activity from Ameritrade , E*Trade and Schwab results reminiscent of their heady days during the tech-stock boom suggests the market rally is entering a "melt-up" stage that is bringing in once-skeptical investors.

"Financial services is one of the least vulnerable sectors to Brexit as much of the sector is already highly globalised and therefore displays a low dependence on [European Union ] markets," according to an "http://bit.ly/2GsI4sf" by The UK in a Changing Europe. The research organization, funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and based at King's College London, used global trade patterns across 54 industries to calculate a Brexit risk-exposure index. For the U.K's financial-services industry, the loss of EU market access "appears to be almost entirely negligible," the group finds.

Money-Fund Bill Is Misguided

A bill that recently passed the House Financial Services Committee would dismantle a useful overhaul put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-next-money-fund-bailout-1517181835". The legislation from Rep. Keith Rothfus (R., Pa.) would allow certain money-market mutual funds to report a $1 net asset value, or NAV, even if the market value of the underlying assets falls, the board writes. "Republicans like to complain about the bank bailout of 2008, but the best way to avoid a bailout is to prevent a run by giving investors an accurate picture of market risks. A floating NAV is part of that crucial project," the editorial says.

Loss of Mortgage Data Could Hurt Fair-Lending Policies

Federal policies to reduce lending inequality require the collection and use of high-quality data, but a recent decision by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau delivered a "significant setback" to collecting mortgage data, according to "https://www.brookings.edu/research/cfpbs-retreat-from-collecting-mortgage-data-should-sound-alarm-bells/" by Makada Henry-Nickie and Aaron Klein of the Brookings Institution . CFPB Acting Director Mick Mulvaney said the agency wouldn't fine anyone for errors in 2018 lending data and signaled the possible elimination of some data points, they write. "The omission of some predictive variables e.g. applicant creditworthiness and loan terms has reduced" the utility of fair lending policies and could lead to "improper conclusions about discrimination," they say.

The Massachusetts state gambling regulator, which granted a casino license to Wynn Resorts Ltd . in 2014, said "https://www.wsj.com/articles/massachusetts-gambling-regulator-opens-review-of-wynn-resorts-1517000231" following an article in The Wall Street Journal that reported allegations of sexual misconduct by Chief Executive Steve Wynn .

Asset management s fight for  alternative data  analysts heats up

Asset managers bolster ability to analyse alternative sources such as satellite data

Investment groups have more than quadrupled their number of   alternative data  analysts over the past five years, as asset managers scramble to unlock the potential of trading signals contained in website scrapes, language analysis, credit card purchases and satellite data.

More than 160 major money managers   including Schroders, Fidelity, T Rowe Price, Neuberger Berman and Invesco, as well as scores of hedge funds   now employ at least 340 full-time data analysts, scientists and engineers, according to a study by AlternativeData.org, an organisation that tracks the industry. That is up more than fourfold since 2012.

In the past, investment companies might supplement their analysis of economic data and corporate balance sheets by sending junior employees to count the number of visitors at a shopping centre, or hiring psychologists to analyse the body language of executives. These days, this can be automated and done instantaneously by using fields of artificial intelligence to pore through vast digital data sets.

For example, money managers can use  natural language processing  to unearth patterns in analyst earnings calls, TV interviews or central bank speeches;  deep learning  on satellite images of car parks to guess footfall; or aggregate and analyse millions of emailed receipts and credit card swipes to get an edge on consumer spending trends.

 Things have really accelerated over the past year, if not exploded,  said Tammer Kamel, head of Quandl, one of the bigger alternative data providers.  Everyone gets this now. 

Although there is still a lot of scepticism over how useful this new information will ultimately prove, many traditional asset managers are following the path originally trodden by hedge funds, and are hiring specialised  alternative data  analysts in droves to help them explore the potential.

BlackRock is  using machine learning, artificial intelligence and advanced data processing to drive new forms of alpha generation, from monitoring satellite data of big-box store parking lots, to analysing internet searches for consumer products   enabling us to predict sales volume or even national economic growth , the asset manager said in its last annual report.

As a result, the battle for talent is intensifying. A head of data at an asset manager can command a base salary between $250,000 and $1m, with a commensurate annual bonus on top of that, according to OptionsGroup, a headhunting firm. An entry-level data analyst can expect a base salary of $80,000-$100,000.

However, OptionsGroup s salary indications probably understate the real salaries in the industry by as much as 100 per cent, according to Pablo Cerrilla, editor of AlternativeData.org, given the shortage of data analysts with experience from the financial world.  The demand for data scientists is evident in an escalating fight for talent,  he said.

The study is based on going through LinkedIn profiles, Ipreo and AlternativeData.org s own network of industry members to identify individuals in the business. The number of dedicated alternative data analysts is likely higher, given that some will not be registered on these networks, or their titles might not explicitly make their responsibilities clear.

Health Startups Angle to Build on Apple's Data-Sharing App; Smartphone capability could create new business opportunities and risks

For years, dozens of software companies have tried but fallen short at creating technology people can easily use to corral into one platform all of their personal medical data pulled from multiple care providers.

But in one fell swoop, Apple Inc. set out to do just that last week with the unveiling of an app feature offering health-records access.

Venture investors in the health-care industry said that despite Apple's achievements, plenty of market opportunity remains for other software tools stitching together ways to let patients share their data with doctors, hospitals and insurers.

Apple's new feature "does move the ball forward in terms of federating data, but that's step 1 of 1,000" said Yumin Choi, managing director of Bain Capital Ventures, which backed data startup Sansoro Health LLC. "What do you build on top of that distribution that makes it meaningful?"

He said technology that can bridge the gaps between where data is stored and where it can be analyzed by physicians and health plans means several health-software startups will still have room to complement Apple, rather than compete against it.

Startups like Sansoro and Redox Inc., backed by Flybridge Capital Partners, aim to allow the transfer of health-care data from a variety of sources including electronic medical records and digital health applications for analysis and management purposes.

Others, like Benchmark-backed Stitch Health Inc., provide data-sharing for coordination between health-care organizations. Evidation Health Inc. aims to aggregate and analyze patient data to help physicians make treatment decisions.

Apple has said it doesn't plan to generate revenue through its health-records feature, and investors said it's unlikely that any startup will try to compete with a similar offering.

But Apple's arrival into the industry's conversation could raise some startups' profiles among investors by underscoring the valuable role they can play in advancing the cause of health-care data portability.

"This could be good in that it will challenge companies to really think about what use they are providing, because the businesses that are trying to collect large amounts of data and provide predictive analytics are still very useful," said Lisa Suennen, senior managing director of health-care investing at GE Ventures.

Only Apple knows whether it eventually will just try to do that itself.

Over the last few years, Apple has gradually moved into health records following the launch of HealthKit, CareKit and ResearchKit. That raises the question of whether it may take part in other segments of health care, from care coordination and analytics to appointment booking and pharmacy services.

"It's Apple," Ms. Suennen said. "Maybe there is a much bigger play here."

Tech
Alibaba, Foxconn Invest in Chinese Electric-Vehicle Maker; E-commerce giant Alibaba is making its first big investment in a car maker

SHANGHAI Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Foxconn Technology Group have co-led a 2.2 billion yuan ($348 million) funding round into Chinese electric-vehicle manufacturer Xiaopeng Motors, marking Alibaba's first big investment in a car maker

Venture capital firm IDG Capital was the third lead investor in the funding, and the funds are slated for both research and production costs, Xiaopeng, also known as Xpeng, said in a release Monday.

Two other Chinese internet giants, Baidu Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., have led fundings of at least $2.5 billion into Chinese electric-car companies including NiO and WM Motor Technology. Beyond China, Tencent also invested $1.8 billion for a 5% stake in Tesla Inc. last March.

Alibaba, Tencent and Baidu want to see their technology incorporated into cars as autonomous vehicles edge into the market, giving them captive audiences for online gaming, streaming video, internet shopping and social media, said Bill Russo, founder of Shanghai consultancy Automobility Ltd.

Alibaba and Foxconn executives said in the release that Xpeng gives the company the ability to tap into the intersection of the internet, artificial intelligence and traditional manufacturing, an area with a lot of promise. Foxconn, formally Hon Hai Precision Co., is based in Taiwan and is best known for manufacturing Apple Inc.'s iPhones.

Guangzhou-based Xpeng, which showcased its latest electric sport-utility vehicle at the Consumer Electronic Show in Las Vegas this month, plans to start sales of its SUV in the first half of the year. The vehicle will have a camera mounted on the roof with that allows passengers to record their journeys and post them on social media.

"In the short term, the traditional auto makers are still going to dominate and have seats at the table," said Xiaopeng He, the auto maker's chairman and an ex-Alibaba employee who co-funded Xpeng when the car maker was founded in 2014.

The company is targeting younger Chinese buyers who less brand conscious and looking for cars with internet connectivity, he said.

RELX PLC said Monday that it plans to buy venture-backed authentication company ThreatMetrix Inc. for 580 million ($818.8 million) in cash.

The Anglo-Dutch provider of information and analytics said ThreatMetrix will become part of its risk and business analytics unit.

ThreatMetrix's technology analyzes connections among devices, locations, anonymized identity information and threat intelligence. It then combines this data with behavioral analytics to identify high-risk digital behavior and transactions in real time.

Based in San Jose, Calif., ThreatMetrix had raised at least "https://www.wsj.com/articles/threatmetrix-raises-30m-in-debt-financing-1476790206?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=2" from investors including Adams Street Partners, August Capital, CM Capital, Tenaya Capital and U.S. Venture Partners.

The acquisition is subject to regulatory approval and is expected to close during the first half of 2018, RELX said. It said the deal isn't expected to have a material impact on 2018 earnings.

Cylance Growing While Hitting $100 Million Revenue; The company's financials offer a rare glimpse into the performance of cybersecurity unicorns

Cylance Inc. is quickly scaling, driven by demand for AI-based cybersecurity products, two years after it raised funding at a billion-dollar valuation.

The company generated more than $100 million in 2017 revenue, Cylance told WSJ Pro. This was an 177% increase year-over-year, pegging its 2016 revenue at about $36 million.

There are at least ten private cybersecurity companies that raised venture financing at a valuation of $1 billion or more.

Last year, three cybersecurity companies -- Okta, SailPoint and ForeScout -- went public, according to a report from industry tracker Momentum Cyber. Dell spin-off SecureWorks was the only cybersecurity initial public offering of 2016.

In 2018, industry watchers are expecting an increase in cybersecurity IPOs. But some cybersecurity companies that have confidentially filed have yet to test the public markets. Carbon Black confidentially filed more than a year ago, and it has not yet taken any public steps toward an IPO.

Cylance Chief Executive Stuart McClure said Cylance now can begin to think about its options for an exit. The company is focused on becoming cash-flow positive, and Mr. McClure said its current operating plan puts it on track to reach that milestone within a year.

"My goal as a leader of the company is to set us up to have the option to do anything we want to do," Mr. McClure said.

The company applies artificial intelligence to cybersecurity in order to identify computer viruses.

Cylance's financials come almost a year after the company laid off 4% of its workforce. Mr. McClure attributed the layoffs to the company's fast growth from 200 to 800 employees in seven months. The company now has 868 employees.

The Irvine, Calif., company last raised venture funding in June 2016, when it raised $100 million.

The company offers a line of products for the enterprise, and plans to launch a direct-to-consumer product later this year.

The company has more than 3,800 customers, including Dell, The Gap Inc., Panasonic, United Service Organizations and the National Hockey League Players Association.

Stephen Frank, the NHLPA director of technology and security, said the company chose Cylance over competitors after a proof of concept trial. He said Cylance has replaced two products the company previously used, Kaspersky and MalwareBytes. The organization has also reduced the number of people working on endpoint protection.

"[Cylance] made a very big splash on the scene," Mr. Frank said.

Banking & Finance: Bankers at Davos Talk Of Eerily Good Times --- Strength of corporate earnings helps fuel optimism; some worry about frothy markets

DAVOS, Switzerland -- Bankers and executives at the World Economic Forum are celebrating a growing economy and rising markets. They see a continuing string of deals flowing their way, cost-saving new technology and a boost from U.S. tax cuts.

But underlying worries persist despite an upbeat economy in practically all corners of the world, said delegates on the sidelines of the event. Among them: The market's ascent has been eerily, steadily calm.

"It does feel to me a little bit like 2006," said Jes Staley, chief executive officer of British lender Barclays PLC. "'Maybe we've solved the riddle of economic cycles' -- that's what we were all saying. We really got that wrong."

One concern, Mr. Staley said, is that investors have become complacent with low market volatility. "The system is geared. When there's a reversal, it could be fast."

Investors' portfolios have chugged steadily higher in value.

"The whole world is going up in a straight line," said Michael Lavelle, who runs Citigroup Inc.'s investment bank in the U.K. "But for how long?"

Mark Hantho, Deutsche Bank AG's chairman of global capital markets, said he sees the ratio of optimism versus caution this year at 70-30. "Markets have run very quickly. People are asking, how can it be this good? What am I missing?"

But banking clients don't want to miss out on deals or securities issuance and regret that later, he said. "There's a little bit of fear of being left behind."

Some are roundly bullish. "I've been coming since 2010. I've never seen a Davos more positive," said Manuel Falco, Citigroup's head of corporate and investment banking for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Behind the optimism is fundamental strength in corporate earnings, commodity prices and accommodative central bank policies, said James Amine, head of investment banking and capital markets at Credit Suisse Group AG.

"The market will dip. It won't be a straight line up through Dec. 31. I still feel good," said Mr. Amine. He added that days packed with Davos meetings bolstered his view that CEOs are more confident than they have been since 2006-2007.

"There's always things to worry about but not a lot until the middle of 2019," said Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO of asset and wealth management at JPMorgan Chase & Co.

She said Europe is one of the most attractive areas for investment, and "there is an insatiable appetite for private equity right now."

Artificial intelligence, blockchain and other developing technologies permeated Davos presentations, and also meetings among bankers and company executives. Technology is driving deals but also presents risks, they said.

European companies recognize they have lost the battle for the online consumer to big U.S. technology companies. "Their attention is now turned to the business consumer," said Wolfgang Fink, co-head of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s German and Austrian business.

"There's an acute anxiety among European companies to protect their edge," Mr. Fink said. European companies are pausing in some cases when considering deals involving manufacturing technology and internet solutions.

Zurich Insurance Group Ltd. CEO Mario Greco said he doesn't see big financial risks in the system -- not in inflation nor rising rates. More likely threats are political, social or ecological, he said.

That is a change from last year, when concerns such as China's economy were pronounced. Cybersecurity ranks high among bankers as a potential cause for a market downturn.

Some big investors feel the froth has gone too far, even with still-low interest rates. Canada's PSP Investments, which manages 140 billion Canadian dollars (US$113 billion) in retirement assets, has shifted some money from stocks to fixed-income assets. They are "the lesser of two evils," said CEO Andre Bourbonnais.

For banks, the mood is partially dulled by investment-banking businesses grappling with new competition, pressure on fees and other long-term declines.

The lack of volatility is hurting banks' trading operations, which make money by seizing on price swings in stocks, bonds and other assets. Trading revenues fell sharply in 2017 at big banks.

"From an economic standpoint, it is blue sky," said Andrea Orcel, who runs investment banking at UBS Group AG. "From an asset-price standpoint, blue sky. But investors are not trading. There is no in-and-out."

Merger and acquisition volume is running at a level well above the historical average. Cheap debt and sky-high stock prices give companies plenty of currency for deals.

With the U.S. tax changes, "CEOs have high confidence in the economy to be more acquisitive," said Daniel Pinto, who runs JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank.

Blockchain and bitcoin have been topics in just about every Davos venue, including a prominent street-front meeting spot in town. Payments executives expressed optimism about the technology's prospects to reduce costs and transaction times.

But to some economists it looks a lot like a bubble. Robert Shiller, Yale University professor and economics Nobel Prize winner, said buyers who missed out on the housing and stock-market boom are flocking to bitcoin. They are drawn in by "the existential meaninglessness of life when you're not invested in anything," he said.

Dell: the revenant

Public shareholders are irritating but they bring cash

We knew he would be back. Just four years after claiming that Dell s reinvention required a $25bn go-private deal, Michael Dell is eyeing up a listing for his eponymous tech company.

A Dell reflotation is one of several options that Mr Dell and his backers at private equity firm Silver Lake are currently considering.

Dell became a more complex business after buying software rival EMC for $67bn in 2016. The conceit of the management buyout was to build a scale vendor for corporate IT departments. Profiting from that means that Dell must once again engage with public investors.

In the first nine months of 2017, Dell s operating profit of $2bn was almost evenly divided among its three segments: PC hardware, corporate storage, server and networking and VMware.

When Dell bought EMC, much of its value came from owning 80 per cent of the listed VMware cloud and virtualisation business. The size of the two meant that Dell could not buy all of EMC for cash; it had to issue a new class of Dell stock tied to VMware.

This elaborate arrangement highlights the problem in the  Dell complex  as it is known. VMware, whose big data unit Pivotal is much hyped, trades at a far higher valuation than Dell and EMC. Capturing that value is going to require financial engineering.

Undoubtedly, Mr Dell and Silver Lake have made a small paper fortune on their dealings.

This may have less to do with a business turnround than sizeable leverage and the rally in equity markets. That leverage, however, is not looking so favourable now.

Dell has $52bn in debt and its most recent earnings are at the threshold where interest expense would no longer be tax deductible. Dell also faces billions in taxes on repatriating foreign cash.

Public investors and their short-term demands are starting to look more appealing. Patience is a privilege Mr Dell can no longer afford. That has implications for the price he can expect.

SoftBank Makes Construction Bet

SoftBank Group Corp. is putting its massive $93 billion tech-investment fund to work in construction.

The Japanese conglomerate's Vision Fund is leading a group of investors with an $865 million bet on Katerra Inc., a three-year-old Silicon Valley startup that aims to change how housing and commercial buildings are constructed by using an assembly-line-like system to control every aspect of design and production.

Founded by the former chief executive of electronics manufacturer Flextronics, Katerra handles everything from design to construction, while building prefabricated walls and fixtures in factories.

The Menlo Park, Calif., startup calls itself a "technology company," emphasizing software aimed at making the process more efficient. A main innovation appears to be a business model that puts architects and construction workers on the same payroll.

The deal, which values Katerra above $3 billion, marks the latest investment by the Vision Fund in ground rarely tread upon by tech investors.

The fund, anchored by a $45 billion commitment from Saudi Arabia, was initially described by SoftBank as a vehicle to invest in technologies of the future such as robotics and artificial intelligence. But since its launch last year, the fund has also invested in companies trying to upend old-line industries, such as WeWork Cos., a co-working office manager, and Plenty Inc., an indoor-farming company.

SoftBank executives have said they want to be at the forefront of technology shifts in myriad industries, and they have shown a willingness to invest at lofty tech valuations for promising startups.

Katerra, with over $1 billion in funding raised since its founding in 2015, is among the fastest startups to command a multibillion-dollar valuation.

The company is growing rapidly. It has 1,300 employees and plans to have 3,000 by year-end, said Michael Marks, its chairman and co-founder, and the CEO of Flextronics. The company didn't discuss exact revenue but said it has had $1.3 billion in bookings since it started.

Katerra's initial projects almost all involved Wolff Co., a real-estate developer led by another Katerra co-founder. But it now has 15 new clients, Mr. Marks said. He said Katerra's biggest appeal is saving developers time, which can yield better financial returns on projects that typically involve high-interest loans.

By year-end, "we think we can build from foundation to the keys in 30 days," he said. "That's typically a year today."

Still, Katerra and others trying to shake up the construction industry face challenges. Construction codes vary not just between states, but between towns. Construction unions have been apprehensive about such startups. Buildings above five or six stories require more complex engineering that has stymied some modular developers.

Other investors in Katerra include Khosla Ventures, iPhone manufacturer Foxconn Technology Group and the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board.

Tech
Google Parent Launches Cybersecurity Firm; Chronicle, Alphabet's 13th unit, to help companies use data to improve security

Google has a new sibling.

Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc., said Wednesday it is launching its 13th unit: a cybersecurity business called Chronicle LLC.

The company plans to sell cybersecurity services to other companies. Chronicle Chief Executive Stephen Gillett, a former executive at antivirus-software firm Symantec Corp., said Chronicle would help companies better use their data to improve security.

"We want to 10x the speed and impact of security teams' work by making it much easier, faster and more cost-effective for them to capture and analyze security signals that have previously been too difficult and expensive to find," he "https://medium.com/chronicle-blog/give-good-the-advantage-75ab2c242e45".

Chronicle plans to leverage Alphabet's technology to help companies run analyses faster and store larger amounts of data to recognize patterns.

Chronicle illustrates Alphabet's mission to make a variety of smaller bets outside of Google that could become its next big business. Other units include DeepMind, an artificial-intelligence firm; Calico, a life-extension lab; and two investment firms. Its last new unit, the self-driving-car firm Waymo, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-parent-alphabet-forms-new-driverless-car-company-1481650433".

So far, none of the new units have become significant businesses. Alphabet executives have stressed many of the bets will need years to pay off and only a few need to succeed for the Alphabet strategy to work.

Like Waymo, Chronicle is coming from Alphabet's secretive research lab X, where it began two years ago. Chronicle said several large companies are testing its technology but declined to say when it would begin selling more widely.

AI start-up fundraising fans bubble fears over Chinese tech

Aibee is one of many tech groups attracting investors before it makes money

Lin Yuanqing, a former executive with the artificial intelligence division of Chinese search engine Baidu, last month began what can be an onerous task: raising money for a start-up. In his case, though, the only challenge was deciding whose money to turn away.

His company, Aibee Beijing Intelligent Technology, which focused on the application of AI to the business world, attracted more than $25m in a fundraising that valued the start-up at more than $800m, two investors familiar with the matter said. In their view, Aibee s business plan lacked  clear products , and the company has just a few staff.

That was no deterrent. The fundraising lured the most prominent companies, including Alibaba, Baidu and Tencent. Sequoia, the US venture capital firm, showed up, as did General Atlantic, a New York-based and highly respected tech investor, even if not everyone ending up investing.

Aibee is the latest case to fan concern that in many areas of Chinese tech   particularly in AI   a bubble is brewing. It reflects how much capital there is on the Chinese mainland, raising the danger that it is the sheer quantity of money available, rather than the quality of the investment opportunities, that will determine the outcomes.

Mr Lin could not be immediately reached for comment

While Aibee could prove a stellar investment, the clamour to invest in a company at such an early stage provides ammunition for those fearful of a bubble. There is so much money in the hands of investors in China that early stage financing opportunities are almost like a free option.

California-based Sequoia, for example, invested under $2m, which is small change for the highly profitable company. Sequoia is a financial investor, but many others who showed up are also strategic investors, so a company like Aibee can potentially be core to their own businesses.

Nor is the sea of money likely to evaporate soon. For a start, controls on capital leaving China have tightened in the past 30 months, keeping more money at home.

 Bubbles are appearing at ever earlier stages because capital is being forced to stay onshore,  says Richard Ji, a former tech analyst at Morgan Stanley and now head of Hong Kong-based All Stars, a tech investment group.

While Mr Ji is a venture investor, he does not show up for the first fundraising because he believes they are too risky and the sweet spot is usually in the third or fourth round of fundraising.

What is more, the ever growing number of professional venture capitalists is just one source of capital for tech start-ups. There are also thousands of local Chinese government funds that control as much as Rmb3.6tn ($562bn).

 They [the Chinese government funds] say we have no interest in returns, our purpose is to promote innovation,  says Chen Zhiwu, a professor at Hong Kong University and head of that institution s Fung Global Institute, who taught many of China s best investors when he was at Yale.  But private equity and venture capital firms do well precisely because they care about returns. This dumb money is driving valuation up too far and making life difficult for others. 

Lofty valuations at the start of a company s life bring dangers. There is the possibility of further rounds of fundraising, but at a lower overall valuation for a company. Businesses can shy away from going public to avoid such an outcome.

 They can be a challenge for those who don t think ahead when planning the fundraising and IPO process,  Nick Norris, a senior M&A partner at the law firm Kirkland & Ellis in Hong Kong, says generally of high valuations.

However, the biggest drawback is that a surplus of capital encourages what used to be known as the spaghetti theory of investing: spray money indiscriminately and see what sticks. Given that they have so much to invest, investors focus on spreading their bets.

The former Baidu executive Mr Lin has told investors he chose the name  Aibee  because  Ai  is the Chinese for bee and he plans to pollinate companies across many industries. It may yet prove a world-beating company. But, at the moment, Mr Lin is just one of many entrepreneurs in some of tech s hottest areas, such as artificial intelligence, who are in demand before their companies start making proverbial honey.

Large hidden fund charges revealed by Mifid II rules

Janus Henderson, BlackRock and Vanguard funds cost up to four times more than thought

The total cost of investing in popular funds, including those run by Janus Henderson, BlackRock and Vanguard, is up to four times higher than first thought, FTfm can reveal today.

The Mifid II trading rules, which came into force this month, have forced asset managers to disclose hidden charges. They can no longer provide just an ongoing costs figure (OCF), the industry s standard measure of running costs. Instead, asset managers and fund distributors must give the total cost, including transaction or trading costs and other charges.

Analysis by FTfm and Lang Cat, the asset management consultancy, shows many investors pay almost double the OCF in the UK s most popular funds once transaction costs are included. This can go up to four times OCF if platform charges and performance fees are included.

Mike Barrett, Lang Cat director, said the size of hidden costs that investors were being saddled with was a  real eye opener .

 It is undoubtedly good that this clarity is here now. But it is grimy that it has taken some EU regulation for asset managers to tell investors what the true cost of investing is. It is a long time coming for all of us,  he said.

 You have always been paying these fees, but now the fund groups have the good grace to tell you these costs upfront. 

The Janus Henderson UK Absolute Return fund has an OCF of 1.06 per cent, as well as transaction costs of 79 basis points (or 79p for every 100 invested). If platform fees and a performance fee is charged, the total cost of investing jumps to an average of 3.82 per cent annually if purchased via Hargreaves Lansdown, the popular fund distributor.

A BlackRock iShares FTSE UK All Stocks Gilt tracker fund has on OCF of 20bp, but when platform fees and transaction costs are included this jumps to 75bp.

The cost of investing in renowned portfolio manager Neil Woodford s equity income fund stood at an average of 1.33 per cent annually on Hargreaves, when platform and transaction costs were included. The fund s OCF is 60bp via Hargreaves.

Similarly, the addition of transaction costs almost doubled the fees investors pay for JPMorgan s Global Macro Opportunities fund. It has an OCF of 78bp and transaction costs of 66bps, according to Lang Cat analysis.

An easy-to-read document on Vanguard s website reveals that some of its funds double in price when transaction costs are levied, and quadruple after including Vanguard s platform fee. But many other asset managers have not been as transparent, publishing either difficult-to-read spreadsheets or only providing the detail of costs to distributors.

Some asset managers, including BlackRock and Legal & General Investment Management, reported negative or zero trading costs, sparking concerns that fund houses were providing inaccurate figures.

BlackRock said it welcomed efforts to improve cost transparency.  We encourage investors to consider both net performance and costs/charges together to evaluate the value for money across different products. 

FTfm also approached companies that distribute funds, including Aegon, Fidelity, Aviva and Axa, to request data on total cost of investing for investors. Most did not respond or said the information was only available to customers that have signed up to use their services. Hargreaves was a notable exception, offering a clear outline of costs for any individual who visits its website.

Nick Blake, principal at Vanguard, said he believed investors will be  surprised  when they see the final cost figure for the first time.  If this disclosure can help clients get more accurate numbers and make it easier for them to make investment decisions, that can only be a good thing,  he said.

In 2016, the Investment Association, the UK trade body for asset managers, released a study that said there was   zero evidence  of hidden fees and charges in the fund industry.

But Peter Sleep, fund manager at Seven Investment Management, the UK asset manager, said the disclosure of the total cost of investing figures will  put the cat among the pigeons  over the next few months.

 I am pretty confident that there will be some shocking disclosures to come,  he said.Main unit for each fund has been used. Other units/share classes might have different costs.

Cloud AI Startups Steel Themselves as Tech Giants Arrive; Founders in the sector are forced to differentiate in the face of a new level of competition

Google has launched a service to provide companies with automated machine learning, joining rivals like Microsoft, IBM and Amazon while potentially raising competitive stakes for slew of startups selling artificial-intelligence development platforms.

Although industry watchers have long expected the arrival of Google's Cloud AutoML initiative, which will start off focused on image recognition, some entrepreneurs in the sector will be forced to differentiate themselves in the face a new level of competition.

"The announcements are awesome for customers, but will definitely put pressure on some overlapping pure-play [machine learning] companies," said Byron Deeter, partner at Bessemer Venture Partners.

Startups that provide broad machine-learning forms of AI across all vertical industry groups are the ones most likely to be threatened by Google, said Chuck Ganapathi, chief executive of Tact, a startup that provides an AI-based service for sales teams.

Google, Microsoft and Amazon are all using AI to help sell their own cloud offerings in what is a sharply competitive market where prices are dropping. Tact's cloud platform bill dropped 25% in the past 12 months, Mr. Ganapathi said.

Many startups that seek to incorporate some AI technology could benefit by not having to hire in-house talent to create new products.

"The reality is only a small percent of startups can afford to build their own AI teams", said Jason Lemkin, founder of SaaStr Fund. "Tapping into AI and ML as a service will be disruptive for many startups who now will be able to offer this type of functionality in Year 1, instead of Year 5."

Clarifai, a startup that provides machine learning-based image recognition technology, says it can cater to certain industry groups by providing what it calls pre-trained models. Its travel model, for instance, can recognize photos for hotel listings, while others recognize food or celebrities.

"It's all ready to go and trained on millions of images," said Matt Zeiler, chief executive of Clarifai.

The service can then be customized for specific needs. Clarifai makes its mark by focusing solely on AI not on selling cloud storage as many of the tech giants are operating.

"They're a cloud business," he said. "We're an AI business."

EQT Seeks Buyer for Stake in Data Firm Sportradar

EQT is seeking a buyer for its minority stake in Sportradar AG, a Swiss provider of sports data whose other investors include basketball legend Michael Jordan, a person familiar with the matter said.

The firm, which is based in Stockholm and backed by Sweden's billionaire Wallenberg family, has sounded out potential buyers in advance of a likely sale process, the person said. The firm's website says it owns a 37% stake in Sportradar.

Sportradar uses a network of data journalists to gather statistics from more than 20,000 sporting events every month, its website says. Its clients include gambling companies, sports federations and the media. Based in St. Gallen, the company was founded in 2000 and employs more than 1,900 people around the world.

The company posted  61 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2016, more than double the level of 2014, according to EQT's website. Revenue has risen from  91 million to  203 million over the same period.

EQT invested  44 million in Sportradar July 2012. Before EQT's cash injection, Sportradar had an enterprise valuation of  127.5 million, EQT said at the time. EQT originally used cash from its Expansion Capital II fund, which targeted minority investments in midmarket European businesses. Two years later, that fund sold the entire Sportradar stake at an undisclosed valuation to EQT's sixth flagship buyout fund, a  4.82 billion vehicle raised in 2011.

The company received more high-profile backing in 2015, when U.S. investment firm Revolution Growth, Michael Jordan and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban invested  40 million.

Sportradar has made a number of bolt-on deals in Asia and in the U.S. Most recently, its U.S. arm bought data company

Mocap Analytics Inc. In 2016 the firm bought 2016 Sportsman Media Holding GmbH, which owns media rights to Bundesliga football matches, among others.

Other data companies EQT has backed include firm include Bureau Van Dijk Electronic Publishing, a business information provider that EQT sold to Moody's Corp. last May. The  3 billion price-tag was nearly twice the  1.6 billion EQT paid in 2014 to buy the company from Charterhouse Capital in 2014, Private Equity News reported.

In 2014 EQT's midmarket fund bought StormGeo Holding AS, a provider of weather-related data used by shipping companies and the offshore oil-and-gas industry.

EQT has invested  22 billion around the world, its website says. It recently capped its oversubscribed flagship fund at  10.75 billion, Private Equity News reported in November.

Founded in 1994, EQT has diversified into other asset classes in recent years. Last year, in February, it raised  4 billion for infrastructure deals after less than six months in market.

It gathered  1.6 billion from investors in May to invest in midmarket European countries, and  420 million for its first real-estate fund a month later.

SoFi approaches Twitter executive about CEO job

Online lender s former chief stood down under fire for workplace culture

SoFi, the online lender, is talking to Anthony Noto, chief operating officer at Twitter, about becoming the permanent replacement for Mike Cagney, the founder and former chief executive who left last year amid accusations he had fostered a boorish workplace culture.

Mr Noto, a former Goldman Sachs banker who joined Twitter in 2014 after helping take the company public, could be confirmed as chief executive of the online lender in coming days, according to two people familiar with discussions. They cautioned that there were a couple of other contenders for the job, and that talks with Mr Noto, 49, could fall apart.

His signing would be a coup for San Francisco-based SoFi, the biggest and the brashest of a new breed of online lender.

The company has grown rapidly since it was founded by Mr Cagney in 2011 with a trio of classmates from Stanford Graduate School of Business. Starting out with student loans, SoFi pushed into consumer loans, mortgages and wealth management, attracting huge slugs of equity funding from the likes of Japanese conglomerate SoftBank and private equity group Silver Lake.

Mr Noto is  financially sophisticated, IPO-ready and has legitimacy in the tech community,  said Matt Harris, managing director of Bain Capital Ventures in New York.  There aren't many people who bridge Wall Street and Silicon Valley as well as he does. 

Mr Noto started out as a brand manager at Kraft Foods before joining Goldman in 1999, where he rose to head the global media group. During a two-year break from 2008 to 2010, the former star linebacker worked as finance chief for the National Football League.

If confirmed, Mr Noto s departure would be a blow to Twitter, the social media platform that has seen a succession of senior defections in recent years. He is currently the top executive in a permanent role; chief executive Jack Dorsey doubles as the chief executive of Square, the payments company.

After joining Twitter as its chief financial officer in 2014, Mr Noto s duties and importance to the company expanded during several years of instability in Twitter s top ranks. This included the exits of former chief executive Dick Costolo and the leaders of its product, engineering, media and communications teams between 2014 and 2016.

Twitter and SoFi both declined to comment. SoFi s interest in Mr Noto was first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

Tom Hutton, a SoFi board director since 2012, was named interim chief executive of SoFi in September. An initial investor in the financial-technology start-up, he was seen as a steady pair of hands. But insiders said he lacked the personality required to galvanise a company that has positioned itself as a new kind of financial services firm, winning hardcore fans among a select demographic   mostly wealthy, urban professionals   that the big banks would love to keep close.

Mr Cagney resigned in the wake of pair of lawsuits alleging sexual harassment and unfair work practices, much of it allegedly stemming from the chief executive and a cadre of senior executives. In a farewell note to staff, Mr Cagney, 46, said he had become a  distraction .

Last year SoFi completed a dozen securitisations worth a total of $6.8bn, according to PeerIQ, a data and analytics company. That was more than double the total of the next three most active issuers   Prosper, Lending Club and Avant   put together.

State Street s flagship SPY loses ground to BlackRock and Vanguard and

State Street celebrates the 25th anniversary of the launch of the first US-listed exchange traded fund on Monday, a date that will be marked by a bellringing event at the New York Stock Exchange on January 29.

The moment could also evoke alarm bells for the Boston-based manager, which has lost ground to BlackRock and Vanguard, its larger and more aggressive competitors.

State Street s flagship exchange traded fund, known as SPY, was launched in January 1993 and has grown into the world s largest and most widely traded fund with assets of $283bn. It has delivered an annualised net return of 9.56 per cent since launch, compared with the 9.71 per cent return registered by the US benchmark S&P 500 index. A $100 stake invested at the time of SPY s launch would be worth $980 now.

SPY gathered $6.2bn in new inflows in 2017, helped by a 19 per cent rally for the S&P 500, which hit a record high at the end of December.

The directly competing ETFs run by BlackRock and Vanguard, which also track the S&P 500 index, attracted much higher inflows of $30.3bn and $15bn respectively, according to ETFGI, a London consultancy.

These ETFs, known as IVV and VOO respectively, both carry total expense ratios of 4 basis points which compares with the 9bp annual charge for SPY.

Vanguard and BlackRock reduced fees more aggressively to win new business and senior executives at State Street admit in private that they have been slow to respond in the cut-throat price war.

 The difficulty with cutting fees is that it reduces the resources available for marketing, sales support and client education initiatives.  says Deborah Fuhr, co-founder of ETFGI.  It can be challenging for any manager to strike the right balance between fee cuts to win new client business and protecting revenues to support ongoing operations,  she said.

As a custody bank, State Street is also one of the world s largest providers of asset services to hundreds of investment managers. Some observers believe that this role as a service provider has constrained the ETF unit s ability to compete aggressively on pricing out of a fear of upsetting long-established and profitable relationships with other fund managers.

Last October State Street did respond to rivals with the creation of an ultra-lost cost range of 15 core ETFs, following similar initiatives that were implemented several years ago at BlackRock, Charles Schwab and Deutsche Bank.

Ben Johnson, director of passive funds research at Morningstar, the data provider says:  State Street historically suffered from a lack of focus on the ETFs that make the core building blocks of investors  portfolios. BlackRock created its US core range to respond to losing market share to Vanguard. This is a tactic that BlackRock replicated in other regions and which has also been mimicked successfully by other players. 

Rory Tobin, co-head of the State Street Global Advisors ETF business, says:  It is early days but the reception from clients to the repricing has been very positive. We have seen about $7bn in new inflows since the launch of the ultra-low-cost ETF suite and we will look to add to the range with complementary funds to appeal to wealth managers and model portfolio providers. 

SPY still has a significant advantage over competitors as one of the world s most widely used trading instruments. Turnover for SPY averaged more than 20.7m units a day in 2017, compared with just over 1m units daily for IVV and only 492,000 for VOO.

SPY is also much more widely used as a hedging tool by US market makers, with short interest averaging $43bn a day last year, compared with $753m for IVV and $329m for VOO, according to information from S3 Partners, a US financial analytics provider.

 The liquidity advantages of SPY over its rivals, such as its high trading volumes and the ready availability of inventory for short sellers, have eroded over time and are likely to diminish further,  Mr Johnson says.

The growing competitive pressures on SPY were mirrored across the entirety of State Street s ETF business, which saw global net inflows shrink to $40.6bn last year from $62.5bn in 2016, a decline of more than a third. In contrast, BlackRock and Vanguard attracted record new ETF business growth. Vanguard s ETF inflows jumped 54 per cent to $149bn in 2017 while BlackRock s iShares ETF arm surged to $248bn, up nearly 80 per cent.

The lacklustre performance of State Street s ETF business has been accompanied by a significant number of senior staff changes.

The veteran Jim Ross, who played a central role in the development of SPY, moved to the position of chairman of the ETF business in May 2016 to make way for two new co-heads: Nick Good and Mr Tobin.

One of their first moves was to hire Claire Perryman from BlackRock in October 2016 to lead State Street s ETF business in the UK.

Noel Archard, another BlackRock veteran, was recruited in May last year as head of global product along with Seth Morrison who came from Vanguard to lead marketing for the ETF business.

State Street also appointed Kathryn Sweeney as head of institutional sales for its ETF business in the Americas in June. She previously worked for Goldman Sachs.

The most significant personnel change occurred in November when Ron O Hanley, then head of the asset management division, moved up to the role of group chief executive. Mr O Hanley named Cyrus Taraporevala, one of his most trusted lieutenants, as chief executive of State Street Global Advisors.

A State Street alumnus who did not wish to be named said:  A lot of money has been pumped into the ETF business. There will be expectations for an improvement, particularly with Mr O Hanley s move from asset management to the role of group CEO. The heat is now on.

Health-Tech Backers Discover the Lure of Medicare Patients; Some say investing in low-income or underserved populations could have bigger market impact

More patients receive care under the nation's publicly funded health insurance programs than any other insurer in the world. Yet the startups making tools to improve the quality of care have long overlooked this giant population of low-income and elderly people.

Until now.

Most venture-backed health startups sell products to self-insured employers or directly to commercial insurance companies. But a growing group of entrepreneurs and investors are warming to the notion that Medicaid, which covers 1 out of 5 Americans, could sustain a business.

"The sheer number of people eligible for Medicaid is mind-blowing, from a market perspective," said Maverick Ventures Managing Director Ambar Bhattacharyya. "When you take a step back and look at all the health-care services that serve these people and how they could be improved by a tech component, there is an incredible opportunity."

Maverick recently led the $20 million Series A for Sidewalk Labs spinout Cityblock Health Inc., which is developing a personalized care coordination platform for urban-dwelling Medicaid and Medicare populations.

Cityblock Chief Executive Iyah Romm said the value proposition is less about adding new streams of revenue and more about managing reimbursement dollars more efficiently. For example, if digital tools were in place to connect Medicaid-covered people with services that could help avoid a hospitalization, states could rein in spending without cutting their budgets.

Many states are losing more money managing their Medicaid populations than commercial insurers are, so technology that can improve efficiency even incrementally could translate to huge savings.

"Part of the reason why, as a venture capitalist, this is such fertile territory is because it not only helps improve health, but its freeing up dollars to go toward education or infrastructure, or reduce taxes," said 7Wire Ventures Managing Partner Lee Shapiro. "That is efficient motivation."

7Wire has invested in a number of startups targeting these populations, including Cityblock and Spanish-language health services navigation platform ConsejoSano.

Andy Slavitt, previously administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, recently announced plans to launch an investment firm to back more startups in this domain. He said the true business opportunity doesn't need to be in things like artificial intelligence or big data.

"It takes 60% more to take care of someone with housing or transportation needs," said Mr. Slavitt, who also invested in Cityblock Health and sits on the company's board. "Those are the kinds of things investors can understand and quantify."

What's Bitcoin Worth? A New Plan to Bring Discipline to Crypto Prices; Intercontinental Exchange is jointly launching data feed pulling information from more than 15 cryptocurrency exchanges

The owner of the New York Stock Exchange is launching a service to bring bitcoin data to hedge funds and other professional trading firms, the latest sign that the once-fringe market for cryptocurrencies is being taken seriously by Wall Street.

Intercontinental Exchange Inc., or ICE, said Thursday that it was joining with startup Blockstream to launch a data feed that would pull information from more than 15 cryptocurrency exchanges around the world and deliver it to financial firms.

Due to go live by March, the feed would transmit information over ICE's high-speed data network in the same digital format used in electronic stocks trading, helping it fit seamlessly into the systems favored by big banks, high-speed traders and asset managers.

The move could help draw more financial heavyweights into the risky, rapidly evolving world of bitcoin. Invented less than a decade ago, the digital currency was long a niche product favored by libertarians and software geeks. But an extraordinary price run-up last year helped put it on Wall Street's radar.

Bitcoin was trading at $11,387.28 late Wednesday afternoon, down more than 40% from its record of $19,783.21 in December, according to research site CoinDesk.

ICE's plan would also represent a big step forward from the way many bitcoin investors now monitor prices and trading activity. Reflecting its hacker roots, the cryptocurrency community relies heavily on various websites that often have a homegrown feel and don't necessarily identify their creators or announce when they make changes.

That can cause problems. Last week, a move by the popular website coinmarketcap.com to remove data from some South Korean exchanges briefly caused chaos in the crypto markets, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-crypto-website-changes-its-data-and-100-billion-in-market-value-vanishes-1515443100"from many of the biggest digital currencies over a 24-hour period. The website didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

ICE isn't the first big-data player to wade into the crypto markets. Financial-information giants Bloomberg LP and Thomson Reuters Corp. broadcast the prices of major digital currencies on their widely used terminals. Money.Net, a lower-cost data vendor used by more than 1,000 banks, brokers and investment firms, expanded its coverage of cryptocurrencies this week to include data on hundreds of digital coins.

But ICE's new service, called the Cryptocurrency Data Feed, aims to go beyond those offerings by providing more detailed data that could be used by high-frequency traders and quantitative hedge funds to power sophisticated trading strategies.

For instance, it will include information about the "order books" at cryptocurrency exchanges, revealing how much buying and selling interest there is in a digital currency at any time. Such data can reveal signals about potential market moves.

And by streaming real-time data from many exchanges, ICE's data could help fuel arbitrage strategies, in which savvy traders try to exploit price variations across different marketplaces for the same asset. While such profit opportunities are fleeting in more mature asset classes, they are relatively abundant in crypto. During episodes of market stress in recent weeks, the price of bitcoin has varied by 10% or more at different digital-currency exchanges, crypto-market observers say.

The cryptocurrency exchanges supplying data for ICE's feed have all agreed to work with Blockstream to support the initiative, said Adam Back, the startup's chief executive and co-founder.

Lynn Martin, president of ICE Data Services, said ICE launched the new feed in response to heavy demand from data-hungry clients seeking to better understand cryptocurrencies.

"We're receiving a lot of requests for information for anything that would provide transparency into this market," Ms. Martin said. She declined to discuss which firms were expected to be the heaviest users of the new service.

Based in Atlanta, ICE is best known for owning the NYSE, which it acquired in 2013, as well as other exchanges and clearinghouses around the world. But it is also a growing player in the financial-data space. In 2016, 44% of ICE's net revenues came from market-data sales and related fees, up from 9% five years earlier.

By focusing on crypto-market data, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nyses-owner-resists-rushing-into-bitcoin-1512510905" from rival exchange operators that have rushed to launch futures contracts based on bitcoin.

"We may be stupid for not being first on that," ICE Chairman and Chief Executive Jeffrey Sprecher said at a financial conference in December, while also expressing doubts about the wisdom of his competitors' hurry to introduce bitcoin futures.

Tech
For These Young Entrepreneurs, Silicon Valley Is, Like, Lame; China's startup founders used to see a pilgrimage to tech's mecca of innovation as a rite. Now, not so much.

Last week, a group of Chinese startup founders and investors made a pilgrimage to Silicon Valley. They toured a Tesla assembly line, complained to senior Apple executives about its slow app-reviewing process in China and brunched on baked eggs and avocado at Russian billionaire investor Yuri Milner's hilltop mansion.

Silicon Valley has loomed large in China's tech world in the past two decades. China's internet industry started by copying Silicon Valley technologies and business models. That's why there's the Google of China (Baidu Inc.), the Uber of China (Didi Chuxing Technology Co.) and the Groupon of China (Meituan-Dianping). Some of the biggest Chinese internet companies, such as e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., were funded by Silicon Valley money. Translations of best-selling books by Silicon Valley sages, such as "Zero to One" by Peter Thiel and "The Hard Thing About Hard Things" by Ben Horowitz, became instant best sellers in China too.

So the trip to Silicon Valley is something of a rite for ambitious Chinese startups and investors looking for inspiration in global tech's mecca of innovation.

But for most of the 18 entrepreneurs and investors, and especially for those in their 20s and 30s, last week's visit largely failed to impress. To many in the group, northern California's low-rise buildings looked shabbier than the glitzy skyscrapers in Beijing and Shenzhen. They can't believe Americans still use credit cards and cash while "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-mobile-payment-boom-changes-how-people-shop-borrow-even-panhandle-1515000570", including settling bets for their Texas Hold'em games one night in Palo Alto.

They didn't see the shared bikes that are ubiquitous in China's cities nor could they order meal-delivery service at any hour. Office buildings don't use facial recognition to gain entry.

As China's internet industry has grown larger and its companies have become more competitive and confident, Silicon Valley's allure is fading.

"The age that Silicon Valley serves as the teacher and China follows step by step is becoming the past, at an accelerating pace," Li Gen, founder of online media startup QbitAI in Beijing, wrote about the trip on his company's official WeChat social-media account.

That feeling was reinforced throughout their trip. Mr. Milner, an early Facebook investor who has also backed big Chinese startups, told his brunch guests that China leads the world in mobile payments, e-commerce and online services.

At several meetings, presentations included slides showing the volumes of China's online meal delivery and mobile payments are many times that of the volumes in the U.S. Their slides also said e-commerce makes up more than 20% of China's retail revenue while making up about 10% in the U.S.

"I've read about this before from the media and wasn't sure if it's for real," says Ding Jichang, founder and chief executive of Mobiuspace, a mobile app developer. "Now I know we're not self-delusional."

That Chinese entrepreneurs had to travel to the U.S. for a shot of confidence about their tech prowess isn't so strange. China blocks Facebook, Google's search engine and some other U.S. internet services while "https://www.wsj.com/articles/moneygram-and-ant-financial-halt-merger-deal-1514931496" too. As a result, the biggest companies in the two markets rarely compete head-to-head.

One startup founder didn't recognize the famous "like" button in the Facebook giftshop. On a giant digital world map showing where Facebook's two-billion-plus monthly active users are, China is a big black blotch. A company employee told them that the only other country strangling access to Facebook is Iran (North Korea is largely disconnected from the global internet).

Last week's tour was put together by Kai-Fu Lee, chief executive of Beijing-based venture firm Sinovation Ventures and former head of Google China. Mr. Lee believes that China has the talent and competitiveness to go head-to-head with the U.S. in the next important tech frontier "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-gears-up-in-artificial-intelligence-race-1472054254".

Still, Mr. Lee thinks Chinese tech entrepreneurs have much to learn and should be less focused on financial results and on going public. He tried to expose the group to the more creative side of Silicon Valley, arranging for them to spend an afternoon listening to futuristic ideas at Singularity University. The think tank's co-founder Peter Diamandis wowed the group with his "https://www.wsj.com/articles/space-miners-scale-back-their-mission-1399497240", Planetary Resources Inc., in which Sinovation Ventures is an investor.

They were wowed again when meeting with two startup founders funded by Coatue Management LLC, a hedge fund. One of the founders, a serial entrepreneur working on an artificial-intelligence chip startup, told the group that his firm has spent $30 million in two years on research and development and won't have a product until later this year.

While the few older 40-somethings in the group admired Silicon Valley's idealism, the younger ones were less impressed. They said that moonshot ideas and long development times don't work in China because investors are less patient and copycats are so rife that businesses have to get products to market superfast.

"China is like a startup. The U.S. is like a big corporation," says Mr. Ding, whose company is developing an app to improve video-watching even on cheaper smartphones popular in emerging markets. "China runs very fast, tweaking along the way. The U.S. runs at a steady pace, doing a lot of research and development. It's hard to tell who will win in the end."

Banking & Finance: ICE Joins the Rush Into Bitcoin

World
U.S. and Chinese Companies Race to Dominate AI; Chinese rivals are gaining fast because of rising investment, as well as freer access to enormous amounts of data about people

Last fall, a U.S. intelligence-community contest sought algorithms that could identify surveillance images of people out of a database of millions of photos. The dark-horse victor was Shanghai-based artificial-intelligence startup Yitu Tech.

The five-year-old company beat out 15 rivals for a $25,000 prize. But Yitu had an advantage: access to Chinese security databases comprising millions of people that it could use to train and refine its algorithms.

Competitors, who worked from smaller databases, had "one hand tied behind our back," says Paul Nicholas, chief executive of CyberExtruder.com Inc., a Newark, N.J., startup that entered the contest.

The contest represents a growing concern about the global race to develop and profit from artificial intelligence, which frequently uses large data sets to learn skills like facial recognition and cancer diagnosis. Big U.S. technology companies are leading the race. But their Chinese rivals are catching up quickly because of growing investments, as well as freer access to enormous amounts of data about people, often compiled with the help of government agencies.

In the West, access to such information is at times limited by growing concerns over privacy and the ethics of letting machines make important decisions fears that are leading to new policies and stricter proposals around collecting personal data and deploying AI.

"Ultimately, AI advances are inextricably founded on the broad use of data to train machines as they go about learning," says Brad Smith, president and chief legal officer for Microsoft, which has invested heavily in AI and also is a vocal supporter of strong privacy protections. "The question is whether privacy laws will constrict AI development or use in some parts of the world."

An accelerating effort

At stake is whether U.S. giants including Apple Inc., Google parent Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Facebook Inc. and Microsoft Corp. can retain their lead in the global tech race or whether they will be overtaken by Chinese behemoths Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Also in the hunt is Chinese search engine Baidu, which is smaller but has invested heavily in AI.

When it comes to academic and corporate AI research, the U.S. particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area is a powerhouse. The U.S. dominates the number of international patents filed for AI topics like neural networks and unsupervised learning, according to filings from the World Intellectual Property Organization. The country also has more than 1,000 AI companies, almost double the number in China, according to a December report from Tencent's in-house research institute.

In addition, spending by U.S. companies dwarfs that of China's tech titans. Alphabet spent $13.9 billion on R&D in 2016, and Microsoft spent $13.0 billion for the year ended June 30. By contrast, Alibaba pledged in October to nearly triple its R&D spending to about $5 billion annually over the next three years.

But China hopes to close the gap with the U.S. in funding and tech development, driven by a new government effort to lead the AI field by 2030. The strategy focuses on boosting areas including medicine and agriculture, as well as government and military applications.

The drive is showing up already in the funding for AI startups. Among these Chinese firms, disclosed funding rose 10-fold in 2017 over the prior year to $7.06 billion, surpassing comparable U.S. firms, where disclosed financing rose 24% to $5.62 billion, according to CB Insights.

PricewaterhouseCoopers predicts that the U.S. will profit most from AI initially, but that China will catch up, reaping about 46% of the $15.7 trillion it expects AI to contribute to global economic output by 2030, followed by North America with 24%.

"The Chinese government's thoughtful investment in AI is a huge accelerator," says Andrew Ng, a former executive at Google and Baidu, who recently founded AI startup Landing.ai.

Different values

Another issue that looms large in the rivalry between China and the U.S. is privacy. Chinese consumers have fewer concerns about data privacy compared with those in the West and that gives Chinese companies greater leeway to mine their personal information and use it to develop smarter and more effective AI systems, for jobs such as medical care and surveillance.

For instance, Yitu, the AI contest winner, works on behalf of multiple security agencies in China and has access to a database of 1.8 billion photos of faces. Using that trove of information, it has learned to scan photos and find matches in seconds, to do jobs like authenticating the identity of ATM users.

Western policy makers are more reluctant to give companies wide latitude to use consumers' personal information, which some experts think could end up hampering the development of AI and let Chinese companies pull ahead in the tech-development race.

And privacy restrictions will get a lot tougher in May, as a new European Union law that covers tech titans like Google takes effect. The law limits the use of identifiable information about people, such as name, address and ethnicity, and allows individuals to demand explanations for automated decisions on important topics, such as why a computer denied someone's loan application answers that are difficult for some types of AI to provide.

More than 120 countries have so far adopted privacy laws, the large majority with European-style elements, according to Graham Greenleaf, a professor of law and information systems at Australia's University of New South Wales. Tech executives say Europe's size could force U.S. tech companies that wish to do business in Europe to follow its lead in other areas, too.

Regulation could be "a big help or a big detriment" to U.S. AI efforts, depending on how it's implemented, says Mr. Ng. "Despite the U.S.'s current lead in basic AI research, it can be easily squandered in just a few years if the U.S. makes poor decisions."

Davis's Take: Drones Fly Over  Trough of Disillusionment'; After a period of hype and high burn rates, an enterprise-focused savvy is taking hold

Investors in drone startups say the ecosystem may finally be growing up and getting real.

That's a good thing for an industry that has ridden a roller-coaster the past few years. Boosters hyped supposed virtues of unmanned aerial vehicles along with a general mania around robotics in 2017. Silicon Valley watched hundreds of millions of dollars take flight. And white-hot burn rates were all too common.

Chasing the consumer market proved to be more difficult than some investors realized, as China's DJI tightened its grip on recreational products. Several startups with high-profile backers came back down to earth, like 3D Robotics and Airware, which both were forced to shed jobs and reset investor expectations.

Now a new phase with more promise may be dawning for drones. Instead of selling investors on grand visions like meal deliveries by drone or creating massive aerial fleets for big companies, a new sophistication about the possibilities is taking hold, says Bilal Zuberi, a Lux Capital partner and board member of drone startups Airmap and Hangar. Drone investors, he says, "are emerging from a trough of disillusionment."

He is especially hopeful about the industry's enterprise-focused software platforms such as real-time analytics specialists, data-collection systems and components that deliver AI-infused capabilities like autonomous avoidance and next-level mapping intelligence. Some examples are Lux-backed Airmap, Verizon-backed PrecisionHawk and Iris Automation, which on Thursday revealed an $8 million Series A with Bessemer Venture Partners for its computer-vision technology that helps drones react and dodge in-flight hazards. These are hopeful signs of maturity in the industry.

One thing to start: We re expecting the UK s Informa and UBM to put out a detailed release on the status of their talks and rationale for a potential 9bn combination, which they revealed on Tuesday.

General Electric has turned into a horror movie.

The conglomerate s Frankenstein creation   GE Capital  reared its ugly head again on Tuesday. GE announced a shock $6bn charge related to liability from a legacy long-term healthcare insurance unit.

Ironically, GE had shed its direct long-term care unit, Genworth,years ago, but as shareholders rudely found out on Tuesday, retained a book of long-termcare reinsurance in  run-off  (ie it was no longer writing new policies) under the bed. Long-term care insurance is a famously bad business as Genworth s shareholders have found out in recent years (it currently has a buyout offer from a Chinese buyer stuck in US regulatory review).

Seniors are drawing on policies far in excess of claims estimates. Instead of paying billions in dividends to its parent,GE Capital willnow put in billions to shore up its balance sheet.

GE s ostensible hero is new boss John Flannery, whose chief skill right now, as Lex noted, is expressing disgust and disappointment on investor calls. Former boss Jeff Immelt s chief accomplishment was to shrink GE Capital by $200bn (measured in assets) to concentrate on a series of industrial businesses (and revolutionise CEO private jetting).

The pressure now, however, has been ratcheted up with GE Capital and those industrial businesses underperforming. Should GE just give up and sell or spin off everything? Flannery cracked open the door on Tuesday. The question is whether the monster gets to him before he gets to it.

Should Hock Tan drop Broadcom s pursuit of Qualcomm?

Ahead of what is likely to be one of the most hotly contested proxy fights in years, Qualcomm on Tuesday presented a new growth plan to its investors in an effort to convince them to resist Broadcom s$103bn hostile takeover bid.

In a letter to its investors (you can read it here), the US company that makes chips for Apple s iPhone vowed to boost earnings per share to between $6.75 and $7.50, which is nearly double what most analysts expect.

How does it plan to do this?

More cost-cutting; resolving its licensing dispute with Apple; monetising the soon-to-come launch of 5G and finally creatingfresh value from its merger with NXPSemiconductors(that s if it happens, more below).

Broadcom, as you d expect, responded in kind (read its response here), arguing that their $70 per share offer   $60 in cash and the rest in stock   is the best Qualcomm could ever get.

This is still early days in the fight, which is likely to get hotter inthe weeks before Qualcomm s general assembly in March. That s when the investors in the US semiconductor group will vote for or against Broadcom s proposal to change Qualcomm s entire board, a move that would facilitate a deal.

But DD has learnt during a recent trip to San Francisco that Broadcom is planning to raise its bid   this isn t a shocker   but the Qualcomm camp is unlikely to fall for any sweeteners.

Does it make sense to try given Qualcomm s reluctance to engage with Broadcom?

Hock Tan, the serial dealmaker and chief executive of Broadcom, is not a quitter and pretty much anyone who has sat across from him in a deal says:  Don t bet against him. 

Qualcomm s M&A defence has been clear: they will resist Tan s current bid   or any small increasein price. If anything, they are likely to roll out an even stronger case on how any deal would be blocked by antitrust regulators (something Broadcom disputes).

Having said all that, the hostile battle hasn t turned overtly negative, which means that Qualcomm is leaving some space (however tiny) for a whopper offer from Broadcom. Tan is not known for overpaying to get what he wants but he might have to if he is determined to win this time round.

Short-term, Qualcomm needs to worry about closing its $47bn deal with NXP. Ramius, a shareholder in the European chipmaker, said it would reject Qualcomm s tender offer, joiningElliott Management, the US activist hedge fund, which has been demanding a higher bid for NXP.

In the meantime, read this from Lex s Tom Braithwaite:How high does a hostile takeover bid need to go?

PIK squared: meet Ireland s king of glass and junk bonds

Payment-in-kind bonds   or PIKs as they re known   are usually associated with private equity firms taking money off the table after a leveraged-buyout.

But one of Ireland s richest entrepreneurs has pushed the frontiers of the already racy product even further than the PE guys, as part of a group of packaging company Ardagh Group s shareholders that recently raised a so-calledsuper PIKto pay themselves a dividend, reports the FT s Robert Smith.

Ardagh is one of the biggest companies you ve probably never heard of: a one-time small Irish glass bottle maker that has grown in the past two decades into one of the world s largest metal and glass packaging companies.

And Ardagh s chairman and founder Paul Coulson is the mastermind behind it all, having built the company up through a series of shrewdly timed debt-funded acquisitions. His reputation for savvy debt deals led the Irish Times to dub him a junk-bond titan last week.

 He s levered his way to a billionaire s fortune,  says one manager at a US credit hedge fund.

Coulson is no stranger to PIK debt, with Ardagh having raised such bonds as far back as 2005.

But his new $350m deal is being dubbed a  super PIK  because it was issued at a new holding company that sits behind  1.5bn-equivalent of existing PIK debt. See the chart below:

Coulson s ascent has proved a massive boon to Citigroup, which has held the coveted  lead-left  role on all of Ardagh s junk bond sales for years. The super PIK was no different, generating yet more fees for the US bank s leveraged finance division.

Verizon Expands Deal for NBA Games; Besides streaming league play, Verizon and the NBA will develop original programming to complement coverage

Verizon Communications Inc. has struck a wide-ranging agreement with the National Basketball Association that extends the telecommunications giant's relationship with the league beyond streaming games and into content creation as well as virtual and augmented-reality fan experiences.

As part of the deal, Verizon will now be able to offer the NBA's "League Pass" subscription package of more than 1,100 regular season games on all its platforms through its Yahoo Sports. Verizon's price tag for the package is $99 a season, 50% less than what it costs to buy it through a traditional pay-TV distributor. Verizon also receives some ad inventory to sell.

Currently Verizon distributes "League Pass" only on its go90 platform. As part of the deal, Verizon will gain mobile carrier exclusivity, meaning that no other carrier will be able to offer League Pass subscriptions. Non-Verizon users who have League Pass subscriptions will be able to access through Yahoo Sports.

The deal includes tablet and computer rights as well as mobile rights to games.

Terms of the new agreement were not disclosed but a person familiar with the situation said it is in the $400 million range, which is similar to the previous deal between the two. Verizon and Yahoo are also investing $25 million in a technology fund to develop new fan experiences for watching games.

Besides streaming games, Verizon and the NBA will develop original programming to complement coverage. The first such effort, "NBA Daily Run," is expected to debut later this season.

Verizon and the league will look to take advantage of the carrier's advanced 5G wireless technology to deliver new high-bandwidth services such as enhanced augmented and virtual reality. For example, the NBA will use Verizon's artificial intelligence technology to create an assistant general manager to help fantasy-team owners select and manage their rosters.

"We are granting them greater rights to do more and we're working with them to create a greater variety of content said Bill Koenig, the NBA's president of global content and media distribution. "This is a very important deal for us from a content, innovation and financial perspective," he added.

For Verizon, the new NBA partnership is part of its broader push into acquiring digital rights to sports content to broaden the reach of its Yahoo portal. In December, Verizon reached a deal valued at more than $2 billion with the National Football League to show games on its mobile network, go90 and Yahoo.

"It's our mission to be the first screen that customers go to for sports. We believe that sports is the aggregator for audiences," said Brian Angiolet, Verizon's senior vice president and global chief media and content officer.

The NBA's League Pass is also available through the league itself. NBA rights holders ESPN and TNT also stream their coverage to customers who have pay-TV subscriptions, as do regional sports networks.

While other sports including the NFL have seen ratings sag, national viewership for the NBA is up 21% this season following last year's finals, which were the most-watched since 1998.

Eric Jing on the Promise of Financial Services for the Unbanked; Ant Financial's CEO sees techfin giving people in developing countries greater access to economic opportunity

How will ordinary working-class and working-poor people save money, get an education, start a business, and ensure that today's young generation will be better off than the one that came before it?

Some will say that this question has largely been answered in developed countries where the financial infrastructure is mature and access to credit is ubiquitous giving citizens the means to fundamentally improve their lot in life.

However, the story in developing nations is completely different.

Financial inclusion is a key enabler to reducing extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity, yet many individuals have been excluded from the traditional financial-services system. In fact, according to the World Bank, around two billion people world-wide do not have access to traditional financial services, and more than 50% of adults in the poorest households are unbanked. More than 200 million micro, small and midsize enterprises in emerging economies lack adequate financing to thrive and grow due to a lack of collateral and credit history.

Thankfully, these massive challenges are giving rise to a wave of innovation by private companies using financial technology, or "techfin," to give people upward mobility and access to credit. Techfin represents a historic and global opportunity to promote equality and inclusion, with developing countries, such as China, leading the way.

Close to a billion people in Asia use digital wallets to pay for goods and services, both online and offline. Increasingly, they don't need to carry cash.

In China, 70 million small and microsize businesses in both urban and rural areas now have better opportunities to access credit, enabling them to gain financial support to develop their businesses and in turn create more jobs.

In India, the speed at which one billion citizens have been enrolled in digital identity verification has been breathtaking, and this has given 99% of the population the newfound ability to gain equal access to financial services and sustainable development.

This is just the beginning. Blockchain, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, the Internet of Things, biometrics and other technologies are generating more ways to upgrade financial systems to make them more transparent, secure, inclusive and sustainable.

Moreover, these innovations in finance and technology can be applied to myriad sectors and real-life scenarios giving consumers less time wasted on administration, and more time to spend on activities they enjoy. For example, in China, utility payments, movie ticketing and food delivery have seen massive jumps in productivity as service providers integrate with techfinplatforms.

The benefits of such innovation are manifest. However, the future of finance is not a given, and there are many challenges that need to be overcome. Techfin innovators need to work hand in hand with local regulators to build the right framework for tech-driven sustainable development. Data security and privacy protection are needed as significant new components of financial consumer protection. International collaboration is needed to enable micro, small and midsize enterprises to trade on digital platforms that are compatible across borders.

These are pressing global challenges, and techfin provides a path to solve them.

Mr. Jing is chief executive officer of Ant Financial Services Group.

The Property Report
Outlook Darkens for Self-Storage --- Growth is slowing as new supply floods markets and concerns rise about demand

By Peter Grant

17 January 2018
The Wall Street Journal

The party is coming to an end in the self-storage business.

For most of the current economic expansion, the sector has been beating all other major commercial property types in earnings growth and stock performance. Real-estate investment trusts like Life Storage Inc., Extra Space Storage Inc. and Public Storage had been able to push through stratospheric rent increases thanks partly to the scant supply of new development.

But now growth is slowing as markets are getting flooded with new supply. Earnings are still increasing, but no longer at the double-digit-percentage rates many companies enjoyed between 2010 and 2015.

Stock valuations, meanwhile, are falling back to earth. Self-storage companies are trading at a 2% discount to the estimated market value of the properties they own, compared with an average 16% premium over the past five years, according to Green Street Advisors.

Self-storage company executives point out that the business remains prosperous and continues to hold its own against other property types. The only major REIT sector trading more favorably is industrial, which is trading at a 4% premium to asset value. Malls and office REITs are trading at discounts of 13% and 9%, respectively, Green Street says.

"When you have five or six blowout years and you get back to normal, it just looks slow," said David Rogers, chief executive of Buffalo-based Life Storage, which has 700 facilities in 28 states.

But the supply pipeline is expected to stay fat for some time."We are seeing few signs of a slowdown in new projects," said Baird Equity Research in a report published in late November.

Demographic trends, meanwhile, raise concerns about the strength of future demand. Aging baby boomers can be expected to absorb a lot of new supply as they leave large houses for smaller apartments.

But household formation has generally been slow in the U.S. economy. Also, urban-living millennials have tended to accumulate less stuff than their parents up until now.

"When you live in urban settings, you live small," Mr. Rogers said.

Mr. Rogers and others said they see signs millennials are beginning to form families, move to the suburbs and accumulate patio furniture, pool toys and the other items that ultimately seem destined for self-storage. "We missed a five-to-six-year period, but we're catching up," Mr. Rogers said.

The self-storage business generally has enjoyed strong growth over the years thanks to the love affair between Americans and their stuff. Once people rent out a unit they become a captive audience for rent increases.

"This is why it's such a great property type," said R.J. Milligan, a Baird analyst. "Say you're paying $100 a month and they increase your rent $5, which in commercial real estate is a significant increase. You're not going to move your stuff on a Saturday to a place that's charging $95."

The biggest self-storage companies have adopted a wide range of new technologies such as data analytics and search-engine optimization to find and keep customers. "Our ability to outperform the mom-and-pop [self-storage facilities] has gotten bigger and bigger," said Joseph Margolis, chief executive of Extra Space Storage, a Salt Lake City-based REIT that operates more than 1,500 properties.

Profits also have been plentiful for self-storage operators for most of the recovery from the 2008 crash because new supply has been limited. Roughly 2,000 self-storage facilities were developed annually between 2000 and 2009, Mr. Margolis estimated. That declined to a few hundred a year in the years after the downturn, he said.

But development has increased significantly. The Census Bureau reported that in November the annualized rate of new construction in the sector was about $4.6 billion on a seasonally adjusted basis. That's more than double the level of November 2016 and more than triple the level of November 2015.

Private-equity firms in the business include Brookfield Asset Management Inc. and Carlyle Group LP. TPG, another private-equity firm that had been active in self-storage, sold its business in 2016 for $1.3 billion to the REIT that later changed its name to Life Storage.

The new capital that has flowed into the sector has kept private market values of individual properties high, especially those that are well-leased. High-quality self-storage operations are more than 90% occupied in most markets at near-record rent levels.

But there is doubt that the market will be able to sustain such high levels with the new supply being added. Green Streetis projecting that net operating income growth for the self-storage sector will be below the broader REIT industry.

"That typically hasn't happened historically," said Ryan Burke, a Green Street analyst. "It speaks to the fact that self-storage as a business is in uncharted territory over the near term."

Growth Investor Oxx Nears First Close of Debut Fund; London firm targets roughly $150 million

Growth investor Oxx Ltd. is nearing a first close of its debut fund within the next month, and expects to collect around $100 million (roughly 72.5 million pounds) toward a $150 million goal, said a person familiar with the matter.

The London firm was launched at the start of 2017 after Richard Anton and Mikael Johnsson"https://www.penews.com/articles/amadeus-carve-out-oxx-launches-in-bloomsbury-20170127" to co-found the new software-focused shop. The two are 100% owners of Oxx, the person said.

The firm secured commitments from "https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-carlyle-fund-head-joins-oxx-1485885004" and a former co-head of a Carlyle Group LP group that made European growth-stage technology investments, the person said. Oxxalso scored money from continental European and Nordic families, the person said. In addition, the firm raised capital through OurCrowd, an Israeli crowdfunding platform that pools money from individuals.

Oxx's debut fund is denominated in sterling, the person said, but will back companies with ambitions to expand internationally.

The firm is targeting companies in the U.K., Israel and the Nordic region, seeking to participate in funding rounds of $5 million to $20 million in business-to-business technology companies. Oxx will aim to exit its holdings in markets where demand for technology investments support lofty valuations, such as the U.S., the person said.

Oxx announced its first deal last year when it "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oxx-leads-12-million-investment-in-swedish-software-company-1504515600?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1", which tests software applications. The funding was intended to help the company expand outside the Nordics into other parts of Europe and the U.S.

The firm, which has four full-time staff so far, expects to grow to about half a dozen people this year, the person said. Oxx's founders have continued to represent their previous firm through board seats on half a dozen portfolio companies, including business software firm Openbravo SLU and analytics company Clicktale, the person said.

Among the businesses the founders of Oxx had a hand in, Mr. Anton was involved previously in big data firm Autonomy, which ultimately was sold to Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., and social video company Unruly Holdings Ltd. before it was sold to News Corp, the parent company of WSJ Pro publisher Dow Jones & Co. Mr. Johnsson was involved in Tobii AB, an eye-tracking technology company.

Digital-health startup HealthTap Inc. has formed its most significant collaboration to date, striking a deal with international health-care organization Bupa.

HealthTap, formed in 2010 and backed with $85 million from investors such as Mayfield and Khosla Ventures, is known for providing consumers with access to doctors through video, voice and text chat. The company says it connects hundreds of millions of people in scores of countries with health advice from a network of more than 100,000 doctors.

But the company has also built an artificial intelligence-powered health-operating system it calls Hopes. The system brings key components of digital health care into one place, including telemedicine and a directory of virtual practices from doctors, nurses and medical groups. HealthTap now derives most of its revenue from Hopes, according to founder and Chief Executive Ron Gutman. The company hasn't disclosed revenue specifics.

HealthTap has been making Hopes available to insurance companies and health-care providers, but hasn't revealed a identified any until now. U.K-based Bupa is a health insurer and health-care provider, serving some 16.5 million health-insurance customers and providing medical care for more than 10 million people. Bupa will use Hopes to create an experience in health care akin to the end-to-end service retail customers can get with Amazon, according to Mr. Gutman.

The Hopes system will be connected to the patients' personal-health record so that it can offer personalized patient guidance and a payments platform, according to Mr. Gutman.

He said he had been waiting until HealthTap had a sizable group such as Bupa before revealing who was using the Hopes system. HealthTap, based San Francisco and Palo Alto, Calif., expects to reach similar partnerships with large health-care organizations.

Financial terms of the Bupa agreement weren't disclosed.

US stocks climb, with Macau casino stocks rallying on analyst upgrade

UnitedHealth Group shares advanced after the company boosted its full-year profit outlook by more than 16 per cent, citing a benefit from tax rules pushed through by Republicans late last year.

The shares climbed 2.4 per cent to $234.20, taking its year-to-date gains to more than 6 per cent, after UnitedHealth posted upbeat quarterly results.

The health insurer said it now expected adjusted net earnings of between $12.30 and $12.60 a share, up from its previous outlook of between $10.55 and $10.85 a share.

The New York-based company said it wanted to use a  significant portion  of the benefits to accelerate  investments in data analytics, technology and innovations to better serve consumers and care systems and to advancing new and existing business platforms .

In the three months ended in December, UnitedHealth s profits doubled to $3.6bn, or $3.65 a share, compared with $1.68bn, or $1.74 a share, in the year-ago period.

The earnings included a one-time tax benefit of $1.21 a share. Adjusting for one-time items, the company reported earnings of $2.59 a share, ahead of expectations for $2.51. Revenues jumped nearly 10 per cent to $52.06bn, exceeding analysts  estimates.

The advance in UnitedHealth shares came as US stocks pushed deeper into record territory with the Dow breaching 26,000 for the first time.

The S&P 500 rose 0.4 per cent to 2,796.14, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.6 per cent to 25,962.29, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.5 per cent to 7,295.67.

Macau casino stocks rallied as analysts at Morgan Stanley raised their outlook for 2018 gaming revenue, projecting a 16 per cent increase, compared with 11 per cent previously.

That helped push shares in Wynn Resorts up 2.5 per cent to $169.67, while those in Crown Castle rose 2.6 per cent to $106.22 and Las Vegas Sands shares increased 2.4 per cent to $72.70.

Meanwhile, MGM Resorts shares rose 2.7 per cent to $35.96 and US depositary receipts in Melco Resorts & Entertainment climbed 3.8 per cent to $28.04.

The analysts argue that the Macau market  is in the early stages of a multiyear growth path  driven by China s transition to a high-income country,  incoming infrastructure tailwinds for Macau specifically  and what they describe as a more sustainable mix of growth.

They see the mass market contributing a higher portion of profits than in the previous cycle.

 Following a stronger than expected fourth quarter, we have become increasingly confident in Macau s ability to capitalise on the increasing penetration from lower-tier Chinese cities, and see visitation from lower tier cities increasing at a 10 per cent [compound annual growth rate] over the next five years and total visitation growing at a 7 per cent CAGR,  said Thomas Allen, analyst at Morgan Stanley.

Meanwhile, Under Armour shares fell 6 per cent to $14.22 after analysts at Macquarie downgraded the athletic gear maker to  underperform  from  neutral  and lowered their price target on the stock to $8.

Institutions are changing to attract talent

When Ron Knapp joined Citigroup s fintech unit as head of technology, he sent a note to his new managers with a suggestion:  Given what we re trying to achieve I think I should come in wearing my boots and jeans. 

Mr Knapp joined Citi FinTech in 2016 to build a team of technology specialists, a few months after the bank had launched the division to  design and deliver the bank of tomorrow . Having spent 16 years at Amazon, latterly in software development, his move meant he joined a tribe he says will become increasingly valuable to big banks   established tech professionals.

Financial institutions started poaching professionals from the tech world about three years ago in response to disruption from fintech competitors, says Max Johnson, manager at the recruitment agency Robert Walters. But to convince tech tribes to work for them, they have had to change.

 Banks stereotypically have very rigid structures in a corporate lifestyle kind of way,  Mr Johnson says.  These [tech] people want to be creative, they want to be in an environment that is not constricted. 

Small alterations, such as relaxing the dress code, can help. But in the end, Mr Johnson says, it comes down to pay.  Banks have had to compete with very competitive salary structures for tech,  he says.

In the UK, starting salaries for technology roles are higher at banks than at tech firms, according to data from the pay comparison site Emolument. However, just under half of the tech companies have fewer than 250 employees, and Tom Chambers, data science and analytics consultant at Robert Walters, says a shift is under way.  Banks are taking over in terms of salaries,  he says. But salary is only one attraction, says Faye Woodhead, director of Deutsche Bank s global employer brand and graduate recruitment.  Opportunity and ability to make a difference, be challenged and learn is as important. Dress code may help but it is window dressing. 

Most importantly, banks are offering roles that did not exist in the industry a few years ago, according to Elly Hardwick, head of innovation at Deutsche Bank.  There are so many opportunities in artificial intelligence, machine learning and distributed ledger technology,  she says. And banks have something tech companies do not   financial data.

 Think of the reasons why tech companies want to partner with big banks,  Ms Hardwick says,  exactly the same things are attractive to employees at these companies. 

 Five years ago I never thought I would be at a bank,  says Carey Kolaja, Citi FinTech s global chief product officer. Up until late 2015, Silicon Valley had been the centre of her professional life after years at eBay and PayPal. She switched because she wanted a role serving people who lacked access to financial services.  It is about the magnitude and scale of the problems you can solve at a bank,  Ms Kolaja says.

She and Mr Knapp have made changes to recruitment at Citi FinTech, in order to make the bank more attractive to the tech specialists they want to hire.  You have to start with the language of job descriptions, they have to speak in a way that demonstrates we understand current technology,  Mr Knapp says.  It is easy to say you are going to be innovative, but you have to convince potential employees you actually have a plan. 

Ms Woodhead at Deutsche Bank says the traditional banking candidate knows what to expect.  We communicate to the tech talent pool in a different way   we want to surprise them. 

Some banks have introduced separate web pages and social media strategies targeting tech talent, but Deutsche has a presence in developer communities, advertising on sites such as Stack Overflow, where developers exchange ideas, and Built in NYC, a website for tech start-ups in the city.

The influx of tech professionals means banking staff are developing, too.  Exposing internal people to new ways of doing things is just as important,  Ms Hardwick says.  When tech and business sit together at the table, that is when you get the real culture transformation.

UnitedHealth Says Tax Overhaul To Boost 2018 Earnings; Health insurer's profit rises as both healthcare, Optum businesses grow

UnitedHealth Group Inc.'s said "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-signs-sweeping-tax-overhaul-into-law-1513959753" will increase its 2018 earnings by roughly 16%, as it invests part of the windfall in technology and data initiatives.

The health-care giant also beat analysts' expectations on its fourth-quarter earnings, but investors are likely to focus even more closely on the first concrete preview of the tax law's impact on the managed-care industry. UnitedHealth said the overhaul would likely boost its cash flow by about $1.7 billion this year. The company also said it thought "http://www.wsj.com/graphics/taxes-corporate-sectors/" would be sustainable over time, though it refrained from offering details of its 2019 outlook.

UnitedHealth raised its 2018 earnings outlook to between $11.65 and $11.95 per share, from $10 to $10.30 previously; the new net earnings projection amounts to a range of $11.48 billion to $11.78 billion. The company's adjusted earnings guidance became $12.30 to $12.60 a share, compared with $10.55 to $10.85 previously.

The new range roughly matched the expectations of those analysts who had already adjusted their outlooks to account for the tax overhaul, according to analyst Peter Costa of Wells Fargo, who calculated their average projection at around $12.50 a share. UnitedHealth's corporate-tax rate will drop to roughly 24% from approximately 37% previously.

UnitedHealth's earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 were fueled by growth in its UnitedHealthcare health-insurance and its Optum health-services businesses. Earnings during the quarter were $3.62 billion, or $3.65 a share, more than double the $1.68 billion, or $1.74 a share, the company earned during the same period a year prior. Adjusted earnings were $2.59 a share compared with $2.11 a share a year ago. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were expecting adjusted earnings per share of $2.51 and revenue of $51.51 billion.

UnitedHealth's earnings of $10.72 a share for 2017 were also helped by the new tax law. Because of a net deferred tax liability, the company had a noncash benefit of $1.22 per share.

Though the managed-care industry has been widely expected to benefit handsomely from the federal tax overhaul, some companies have cautioned about the size of the windfall, warning that some might be whittled away due in part to regulatory requirements and price competition, among other factors.

UnitedHealth's overall tax picture may also be different than that of its health-insurance competitors, since a significant portion of the company's business is now in its Optum health-services arm, which faces fewer regulatory requirements than the UnitedHealthcare health-insurance unit.

UnitedHealth said it would invest around $200 million to $300 million of its 2018 tax benefit in initiatives including artificial intelligence, data analytics, health-information records and improving its relationship with customers.

As it sketched out the impact of the tax overhaul, the company also flagged a premium revenue cutback between $400 million and $500 million this year, though it didn't adjust its 2018 revenue guidance range. That is partly tied to how the new tax change interacts with the way insurers handle an existing health-insurance tax that is part of the Affordable Care Act, as well as the ACA's requirements that a certain minimum share of premiums go toward health-care expenses.

UnitedHealth Group Chief Executive David S. Wichmann said the company is "not in a position to give elemental guidance" for next year. But he also said of the tax-overhaul benefit that "we believe it to be sustainable."

For the fourth quarter of 2017, revenue rose 9.5% to $52.06 billion. UnitedHealthcare revenue grew 9.6% overall while revenue from employers and individuals fell 1.5%. Profit for UnitedHealthcare rose 26% to $1.76 billion.

UnitedHealthcare has has pulled back from"https://www.wsj.com/articles/unitedhealth-profits-rise-as-it-exits-health-care-exchanges-1492514074", after running up losses, and has said it is unlikely to re-enter them soon. But the company potentially stands to benefit as the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-signs-order-paving-way-for-health-care-changes-1507824146" that would be sold outside the health-law marketplaces, potentially with skinnier benefits and lower price points. During Tuesday's call, Mr. Wichmann said the company was "supportive" of those efforts, but didn't preview the potential upside for UnitedHealthcare. He did flag that the insurer currently "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-administration-plans-aca-exemptions-for-self-employed-1515073801", one form of coverage that the Trump administration's moves are expected to encourage.

Last month, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/unitedhealth-looks-to-global-growth-with-2-7-billion-offer-for-banmedica-1513950761"Banmedica SA, a health-care company in South America for roughly $2.74 billion. It expects the deal to close in the first quarter.

Optum "https://www.wsj.com/articles/unitedhealth-to-buy-major-doctor-group-for-4-9-billion-from-davita-1512560700" to buy DaVita Medical Group, part of DaVita Inc. which will become part of Optum's rapidly growing health-care provider business.

Mr. Wichmann said that investors shouldn't see the recent torrid deal pace as a sign that UnitedHealth is changing or accelerating its approach. He said both acquisitions fit into the company's long-term goals, and it had been eyeing the South American markets for about five years, while the DaVita purchase was "more coincidental."

UnitedHealth executives also said that with the DaVita acquisition, its health-care provider footprint will extend to 35 local markets, advancing toward its target of 75.

Competition from budget upstarts and Chinese rivals is hitting flag carriers

On January 3,Singapore Airlines shocked its customers with a plan to charge them up to $50 just for using a credit card to book its cheapest seats. The reaction was swift and furious.  Disgraceful money grab,  wrote one of the many angry customers who took to the internet to vent.

Singapore Airlines retreated the next day.  Following a further review, Singapore Airlines will not be proceeding with the implementation  of the credit card service fee, it said in a three-line statement.

The unhappy New Year episode was a rare embarrassment for Singapore Airlines, known around the world for its best-in-class customer service and luxury image. But it also reflected the tough reality that national flag carriers all across Asia are facing.

Even as rising prosperity in the region has led to a huge increase in air travel, its most renowned airlines   including Singapore Airlines andCathay Pacific Airways   have faced turbulence.

They have been hammered by budget carriers such asAirAsia at the low end of the market, while Gulf airlines such as Emirates Airline and Qatar Airways have eaten into their business for premium long-haul flights. At the same time, Chinese airlines are becoming more competitive at both ends of the spectrum. While such intense competition is great for Asia s air travellers, it is leading to lower ticket revenues and massive over-investment that signals more pain in the future.

 Competition has become more and more intense and you have a lot of aggressive competitors these days,  said Brendan Sobie, chief analyst at Sydney-based aviation consultancy CAPA.

To fight back, the airlines are in the midst of serious restructuring efforts, searching for new ways to make money and frantically cutting costs.

Singapore Airlines  botched credit card fee was just one idea it has pulled from the well-worn playbooks of the budget carriers. After posting its first quarterly net loss in five years in March 2017, Singapore Airlines and its chief executive, Goh Choon Phong, embarked on a three-year  transformation programme . The ideas range from cutting bureaucracy and introducing a new revenue management system to charging some customers $5 to select a seat in advance, a policy it introduced in December.

Sixteen years after AirAsia brought the budget airline model to the region, flag carriers such as Singapore Airlines are finally beginning to adopt some of its practices, as their European and American counterparts have already done.  What Singapore Airlines is starting to do is not new to the industry,  Mr Sobie said.  They are following the trend. 

Cathay Pacific, which embarked on restructuring after an annual loss in 2016, is also planning to squeeze its economy class customers. Its new Boeing 777-300 cabin will jam 10 smaller seats into a row from the current nine. More vulnerable is Malaysia Airlines, which for a decade has been fighting a price war with pioneering budget airline AirAsia. The national flag carrier was taken private by the government after two devastating plane accidents in 2014, and has embarked on a five-year restructuring. But the plan appears to be in trouble after its chief executive abruptly announced his resignation in October just a year after taking the job. He was the second chief executive hired to implement the reform effort.

The common thread for Asian flag carriers is declining ticket prices. Passenger yield   the revenue an airline receives for flying one passenger one kilometre   fell for airlines in the Asia-Pacific region for three years in a row from 2014 to 2016, according to the International Air Transport Association, or Iata.

Remarkably, this has been happening in the region where passenger demand growth is the fastest in the world. Fuelled by rising tourism and business travel, passenger traffic for Asia-Pacific airlines is estimated to have increased 10 per cent in 2017, the third straight year of double-digit growth, Iata says.

While the pace of decline in passenger yields has slowed in recent months, they remain low. Singapore Airlines managed to swing back from its first-quarter loss, helped by rising passenger carriage at its low-cost operator Scoot, but ticket prices remained a major issue.  Going forward, we are still seeing the demand [increase], but we are also seeing more capacity being added,  Mr Goh said in November.

Sensing years of rising passenger growth ahead, Asia s airlines are investing heavily in new aircraft. Boeing estimates that the Asia-Pacific region will see delivery of 16,050 new aeroplanes in the next 20 years, close to 40 per cent of its total. Carriers in Southeast Asia have 1,600 aircraft on order to add to an active fleet of close to 2,000 in the region, according to CAPA. Low-cost airlines account for about 70 per cent of the orders, the consultancy said.

The airlines  expectations for growth are not unfounded, however. More than half of the world s new air passengers in the next 20 years will live in Asia, the Iata forecast last autumn. It expects China to displace the US as the world s largest aviation market by 2022. Still, some worry the heavy fleet investment is not sustainable.

 There may be too much capacity in Asia 	. 	. 	. 	[to] keep ticket prices steady,  said Mark Webb, an analyst at Hong Kong-based research company GMT Research.

Some governments are trying to curb overcapacity. In December, South Korea s transport ministry rejected licence applications by prospective budget carriers Aero K and Fly YangYang on the grounds that the market was saturated with low-cost airlines.

As difficult as this highly competitive environment has been for some of the airlines, they have at least enjoyed low fuel prices in recent years. But even this has had limited benefits.  What has happened in Asia is that most of the savings airlines gained from lower fuel prices have been passed through to consumers in lower ticket prices,  Mr Webb said.

But the pressure on airlines  bottom lines could intensify if fuel prices begin to rise. Iata has forecast that spending on fuel will increase 19.6 per cent in 2018.  Lower fuel prices have aided airlines  ability to reduce prices and be very aggressive,  Mr Sobie said.  It will be interesting to see if fuel prices increase. 

Uber of the skies?

The disruption is not limited to Asia s traditional flag carriers, however. Even AirAsia, which pioneered no-frills service in Asia when it launched in 2002, is feeling pressure from rising competition.

On a recent AirAsia X flight from Kuala Lumpur to Wuhan, China, Fabian Kong decided to pay extra for a premium flatbed. That premium gave the businessman business class perks at about half the price he would have paid on a full-service carrier.  It was very comfortable. I could rest well during the return flight at midnight,  Mr Kong said.

Mr Kong s pleasant journey was thanks in part to pressure on AirAsia, which operates the AirAsia X long-haul flight, to bring in more revenue to offset lower passenger yields. But Tony Fernandes, AirAsia Group chief executive, is looking beyond bringing in extra money from add-on fees.

He is planning a wider shake-up of the company that would push it further into digital payments, ecommerce and retail. He is beefing up AirAsia s digital infrastructure with an eye to pushing offerings to customers through technologies such as artificial intelligence and the internet of things.  With customer data, we can sell more to our customers like whatAlibaba and Amazon have done,  he said in December.

Mr Fernandes created a new deputy chief executive position to oversee non-airline units such as online payment BigPay, duty-free shopping RokkiShoppe.com and parcel courier Red Box. The plan is to eventually spin off these units through listings.

 I hope people will not see us as an airline but as a digital company that moves people around like Uber,  Mr Fernandes said.

The digitisation initiative is part of a group-wide reorganisation. The Malaysia-listed AirAsia, which owns affiliates in India, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines and Thailand through joint ventures, has proposed swapping its partners  stakes into shares in a holding company. The aim is to streamline its group structure, with a long-term goal of achieving full ownership of each unit.

The moves come as AirAsia, which controls nearly 50 per cent of the market in Malaysia, faces rising competition from Malindo Air, a Malaysian airline launched in 2013. Malindo is a premium carrier backed by Indonesia s Lion Air, which decided to push into Malaysia after AirAsia entered its home market. Now Malindo is focusing on regional destinations, escalating its competition with AirAsia. CIMB said in a July report that Malindo s seatswere expected to grow 18 per cent in 2017, greater than AirAsia s 6 per cent.

Malindo has been adding capacity to Indonesia and South and North Asia, too, competing head to head on certain AirAsia routes. With a fleet size one-third that of AirAsia, Malindo competes on 71 per cent of the former s short-haul routes and 20 per cent of its long-haul routes, according to CIMB. The airline may move further into AirAsia s mid- to long-haul territory based on a target of adding 10 aircraft yearly.

For passengers in AirAsia s home market, the fierce price war between the two airlines has had an upside: Malaysia is one of the cheapest countries in the region for flights.

Focus on ultra-long haul

Yumiko Tanaka travelled between Hong Kong and Toronto every year between 1995 and 2005 on Cathay Pacific, but lately she has been shopping around for cheaper fares. The emergence of China s low-cost airlines has given her plenty of choices.

On her most recent trip home for the holidays, she chose Hong Kong Airlines, a unit of China s HNA Group, which was almost 600 Canadian dollars ($483) cheaper than Cathay. And while she thought the food wasn t quite as good as Cathay s, she said it was as  satisfactory an experience as anyone flying coach would have .

The shift of travellers such as Ms Tanaka highlights the mounting challenges facing what has long been routinely voted the world s best airline. Cathay Pacific had a turbulent 2017, reporting a disastrous loss of HK$8.46bn ($1.08bn) due to a bad bet on the future price of fuel. It removed its longtime chief executive Ivan Chu Kwok-leung, and in August the airline posted its worst first-half loss in 20 years. In November, Qatar Airways bought a 9.6 per cent stake in Cathay for $662m. Its restructuring plan, which includes the loss of 600 jobs, has led to nasty labour disputes. On top of all that, Hong Kong s flagship airline continues to lose customers to low-cost carriers, both at home and abroad.

Chinese airlines have been pushing hard into long-haul flights, with Air China and Hainan Airlines adding new US routes. In particular, Cathay is losing ground to Hong Kong Airlines. Last year, it launched flights from Hong Kong to Auckland, Vancouver and Los Angeles at much cheaper prices than Cathay s. It is also planning new routes to San Francisco, London and New York this year.

The mainland-backed airline is able to operate the same routes at much lower costs thanks to its Airbus A330 and A350 aircraft, which are smaller and more fuel efficient than Cathay s super-wide Boeing 777 models. A single Cathay ticket from Hong Kong to Vancouver typically costs 50 per cent more than what Hong Kong Airlines offers. Cathay s plan to add an extra seat to each row of its Boeing 777 models this year could help ease that cost gap, but it also risks alienating some of its frequent customers, many of whom are business travellers looking for more room and a more luxurious experience.

In response, Cathay is expanding its global network by adding more ultra-long-haul flights. Last year the airline announced a new nonstop flight to Washington from Hong Kong. The 17-hour flight will shave two hours off the trip and become the longest commercial route running in Hong Kong.

Analysts say it makes better sense for Cathay to enhance its advantages on long-haul markets and business travel, rather than compete with budget carriers on short-haul routes.  Many travellers complain about Cathay, but they continue to consume Cathay,  said Geoffrey Cheng, head of transportation and industrial research at BOCOM International Holdings.

Despite losing some market share to rivals, Mr Cheng said, Cathay still had supremacy among business and affluent travellers willing to pay extra for punctuality and better services. He said Cathay should try to develop direct flights to more exotic destinations where the competition was smaller.

Another worry for Cathay, Mr Cheng says, is the internationalisation of nearby Shenzhen airport. While Hong Kong has long served as a transfer hub for mainland Chinese flying overseas, mainland carriers are increasingly able to bypass the city on international journeys. Shenzhen last year served about 3m passengers on international flights, and its operator hopes to increase its traffic to 15m passengers by 2025.

The proximity of the two airports not only forces Cathay to compete more fiercely with other domestic airlines, but also with one of its own shareholders. State-ownedAir China, which has a 30 per cent stake in Cathay, last month launched a direct flight from Shenzhen to Los Angeles. Cathay operates four direct flights to Los Angeles each day.

To make things more complicated, Air China is also a majority shareholder in Shenzhen Airlines, which operates 17 international flights from the southern Chinese city. While analysts had expected the competition between Cathay and Air China to lead to deeper integration between the two companies, Qatar s investment altered the dynamics. Cathay s shares fell as much as 5 per cent after the news was announced, as investors saw the deal as a way to block Air China s takeover of the Hong Kong-based airline. The two carriers  love-hate relationship is likely to continue.

In the meantime, Cathay must contend with the loss of longtime customers such as Ms Tanaka, who now has plenty of different airlines competing for her business. For her, low prices trump other considerations.  I have no allegiance to Cathay per se,  she said.

Unease at Fox, South Korea vs bitcoin, Ovie Smarterware

At the Consumer Electronics Show, there are few problems to which the technology industry s solution is not  more technology , my colleague Tim Bradshawreportsfrom Las Vegas, where the world's gadget makers have flockedfor their biggest annual gathering.

So thetiming could not have been worse for two Apple shareholders who together own about $2bn of the iPhone maker s stock to launch anactivist campaignover technology addiction and children s health.

Worse still, the investors turned a social issue that had been steadily gaining momentum over the past year into a threat to share prices, arguing that the  long-term health  of young people and society are  inextricably linked  to the  long-term viability  of companies such as Apple.

Having the topic thrust back into the headlines just as CES got under way blindsided the industry. Unlike artificial intelligence, robots or virtual reality, digital addiction was hardly a hot topic on the show floor this week.

Many tech executives have been privately grappling with the problem, with a growing number of Silicon Valley parents limiting smartphone usage by their children.

Yet the perceived impact on the bottom line of encouraging customers to use their products less makes it difficult for tech companies, software developers or telecoms operators to discuss the problem.

Asia is closing in on the US as the biggest home for venture capital, with funding of $70.8bn last year to America's $71.9bn, according to the latest PwC/CB Insights MoneyTree Report.

Global VC funding rose nearly 50 per cent year on year to more than $164bn invested across 11,042 deals, according to the survey.

In Asia, funding more than doubled. In the US, it rose 17 per cent year on year, but deal volume fell to 5,052, the lowest since 2012.

Europe remained the laggard, despite a 40 per cent rise in financing to $17.6bn across 2,483 deals.

China is proving a magnet, with money pouring into everything from ride-hailing apps and shared bikes to artificial intelligence and car-charging stations.

Didi Chuxing late last month announced a $4bn investment from a consortium that included Japan's Soft-Bank and Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala Capital as well as domestic investors. That valued the ride-hailing group at $56bn, making it the biggest unicorn behind US rival Uber.

Other China unicorns, including Meituan-Dianping, an app that enables users to book and buy meals, manicures and other services, raised $4bn late last year for a valuation of $30bn.

Abundant finance has helped fund cut-throat practices, including costly subsidies   which precipitated Uber's retreat from China, throwing its lot in with Didi. Meituan last week marked its own entry into ride-hailing.

Some one-time start-ups such as handset maker Xiaomi are eyeing the public markets, where tech groups including Tencent and Alibaba are seeing their prices rise. The pair are big investors in start-ups in China and Asia, with Tencent in particular out-spending traditional VC companies.

Jerusalem-based OurCrowd, an equity crowdfunding platform that works with a global community of some 20,000 accredited investors, is raising a $100 million venture capital fund called Cognitiv Ventures.

Cognitiv Ventures plans to raise the funds from OurCrowd's existing investor network as well as new investors. The fund will invest in early stage companies around the world developing technology using artificial intelligence, IoT and robotics across health care, ag tech and advanced manufacturing.

OurCrowd Chief Executive and founder Jon Medved said the fund will invest in about 15 to 20 startups over the next couple of years. So far, it has invested in online marketplace EquityX Ltd.,genetic testing service KolGene and kitchen utilities startup FreshKeep.

The fund is OurCrowd's third venture fund and 12th fund overall since it was founded in 2013. It follows OurCrowd First, a $12 million venture fund closed in May 2016. Other funds on OurCrowd's platform include digital health-focused OurCrowd Qure and Oxx, a growth stage fund spun out of Amadeus Capital in the UK.

Mr. Medved said the way Cognitiv operates as part of a platform enables a wider range of investors to contribute to the fund. Alongside institutional partners and family firms, individuals can also contribute with as little as $50,000.

"Traditional venture investing is for a really rarified group, but since we already have the platform that provides investors support in legal, accounting and business development areas, individuals can come in with a fraction of a regular LP commitment," said Mr. Medved.

General Partner Avi Reichental said Cognitiv will continue in the path of OurCrowd First, which invested alongside firms like Softbank, Khosla Ventures and Artis Ventures. Portfolio companies include 3D printing startup Nexa3D Inc., agtech company Centaur Analytics Inc. and Zebra Medical Vision Ltd., which uses artificial intelligence for medical imaging.

Mr. Reichentel will lead the fund alongside general partners Eduardo Shoval and Yori Nelken, who were both general partners at OurCrowd First. They expect the fund to close in three to 18 months.

Demand for tech groups drives $71bn of start-up money to region

Asia is closing in on the US as the biggest home for venture capital, with total funding of $70.8bn last year to America s $71.9bn, according to the latest PwC/CB Insights MoneyTree Report.

Global VC funding increased nearly 50 per cent year on year to more than $164bn invested across 11,042 deals, according to the survey. In Asia, funding more than doubled while in the US it rose 17 per cent year on year but deal volume fell to 5,052, the lowest level since 2012.

Other top-ranked Chinese unicorns, including Meituan-Dianping, an app that enables users to book and buy meals, manicures and many other services, raised $4bn late last year for a valuation of $30bn.

Abundant funding has helped fund cut-throat business practices, including costly subsidies   which precipitated Uber s retreat from China, throwing its lot in with Didi. Meituan last week marked its own entry into ride-hailing.

Some one-time start-ups such as handset maker Xiaomi are now eyeing the public markets, where liquidity is also abundant and tech companies in particular, including China s tech titans Tencent and Alibaba, are seeing their prices propelled higher.

The duo are also big investors in start-ups in China and Asia, with Tencent in particular out-spending traditional VC companies.

Corporations, including their VC arms, were involved in more than a third of last year s deals in Asia.

Artificial intelligence attracted increasing financing, up to $5bn in the US last year, while $2.5bn went into genomics in the US.

China cracks down on bitcoin mining in latest rejection of cryptocurrencies

China is moving to wipe out its bitcoin mining industry following concerns of excessive electricity consumption and financial risk, in the latest sign of Beijing's hostility to cryptocurrencies.

A multi-agency task force has told provincial governments to "actively guide" companies to leave the cryptocurrency mining industry, according to a document seen by the Financial Times. The move follows China's shutdown of local bitcoin exchanges and its ban on initial coin offerings.

Miners create bitcoins by solving complex maths problems used to validate new bitcoin transactions. The reliance on raw computing power is more akin to industrial manufacturing than traditional high-technology businesses.

Many bitcoin miners have established operations in remote areas without registering a company. Some have also skirted regulations that forbid end users from purchasing electricity from power producers rather than grid operators.

China mines about three-quarters of the world's bitcoins, according to Liao Xiang, chief executive of Lightningasic, a Shenzhen-based mining operation.

Miners have taken advantage of cheap electricity in regions rich in coal or hydroelectric power such as Sichuan.

China is using state investment and an array of industrial policies to seize global leadership in strategic tech sectors, from artificial intelligence to robotics. But the crackdown on bitcoin miners reflects a judgment that cryptocurrencies do not merit state support. Bitcoin mining "consumes a large amount of electricity and also encourages a spirit of speculation in 'virtual currencies'", the document said. Mining operations contradict efforts to prevent financial risk and discourage activities that "deviate from the needs of the real economy", it added.

The internet finance task force, which includes the People's Bank of China, has previously clamped down on peer-topeer lending. The PBoC did not respond to a request for comment.

The order does not call on regional authorities to shut mining operations directly, but to squeeze them out by enforcing policies on power consumption and environmental regulation.

Chinese miners are seeking ways to transfer their operations abroad, to destinations such as Iceland and Russia where the cooler climate helps prevent computers from overheating. Notebook page 10 Lex page 12

Banks risk being ousted by tech rivals if they fail to innovate

INSIGHT

Bitcoin and blockchain are likely to dominate discussions at Davos this month. But there will be a far deeper deliberation about the wider disruptive impact of technology on banks. Financiers used to think that the post-crisis regulatory burden would make financial services less appealing for entrants. But now they fear that non-banking rivals may target more profitable sectors and skim the cream in areas such as payments or lending. Central banks are concerned too. The Bank of England recently wargamed the impact of fintech on banks' business models for the first time in their stress tests, suggesting UK banks could lose 1bn of profits to new competitors.

The picture is changing fast, with US deregulation and the finalisation of the Basel rules. Banks have had to focus on new rules since the crisis, soaking up their change-thebusiness technology budgets. Now they can potentially free up resources to focus on maximising the potential of technology A more intense focus by banks on potential disruption has four big implications.

First, banks will step up their spending dramatically. According to IDC, only about a quarter of US bank technology budgets is spent on digital transformation, as opposed to business as usual. They expect this to grow to nearer 40 per cent in 2020. This implies a more than doubling of transformation expenditure over the next four years. There will be deep seams of opportunities to mine. For instance, cyber risk is currently viewed as the greatest risk to the financial system by the Basel Committee. Tech firms and consortiums that detect fraud, solve authentication and the protection of data from cyber risks will flourish.

Second, this spending could substantially boost banks' Harnessing blockchain ' productivity and profits. A straw poll of executives I took from a range of companies in the World Economic Forum's disruptive innovation in financial services group suggested they are looking to automate up to one-third of their activities in the coming four years   and 2018 is likely to be pivotal for blockchain as pilots, such as its rollout at the Australian Stock Exchange, get the green light.

Cryptocurrencies will capture the imagination of users and fears of policymakers. But harnessing blockchain will be just one chapter of a dense book. How banks use machine learning and rudimentary artificial intelligence to improve customer experience, nudge sales or improve efficiency will have a larger impact on the bottom line than blockchain in the next five years.

But with Big Data comes Big Noise: companies will also need help to structure, manage and analyse the new data to use it effectively. Those banks that embrace innovation could have a productivity dividend and mitigate the risk of disruption.

Third, the battle for customers will get far more intense, making it more challenging for start-ups looking to build consumer brands. The fight between every start-up and financial institution comes down to whether the start-up gets distribution before the incumbent gets innovation, as venture capitalist Alex Rampell likes to say. Banks will drive up the cost of customer acquisition for start-ups who will increasingly struggle unless they build network effects and scale quickly. Roboadvisers and peer-to-peer lenders will be on heightened alert. Some start-ups will need to rethink their plans to disrupt and look to form partnerships instead.

Finally, the biggest fear is whether banks, or other financials, may get "Amazon-ed". A recent WEF report suggested that finance is more likely to be upended by established big tech firms than nimble fintech start-ups. Changes in financial regulation, such as a lighter touch fintech charter being examined in the US or the second payment services directive in Europe, could make this more likely. The tech giants have the brands, customer reach, digital processes and flair to develop good products, and to take swift advantage of any regulatory changes.

A survey by Bain across 22 countries suggested customers are open to potentially buying financial products from tech firms, leaving banks vulnerable. In China, leading technology firms have already moved into banking and insurance at scale. Ant Financial, part of Alibaba, is already as big as the ninth-largest US bank.

While central bankers fret about bitcoin, this is what financiers will really be discussing this year.

Pitney Bowes shares rally on report of Blackstone, Carlyle interest

Shares in Pitney Bowes jumped on Thursday following a report that the US mail equipment and data analytics business had received interest from Blackstone and Carlyle.

Pitney Bowes shares were up more than 13 per cent to $13.17   having hit an intraday high of $13.68   and were poised for their biggest one-day gain since May 2017.

The rally came after a Bloomberg report that the company is attracting interest from buyout firms including Blackstone and Carlyle, and that it had held preliminary talks with suitors. The report also said the company s chief executive is open to a breakup of the company or an outright sale.

Connecticut-based Pitney Bowes had said in November that it was exploring strategic alternatives. It had hired Lazard as a financial adviser and Cravath, Swaine & Moore as its legal adviser to assist in the process.

Pitney Bowes  third-quarter revenues were in line with its expectations, but chief executive Marc Lautenbach has expressed his disappointment in the results, with profits down 12 per cent. Lower mail volume has proved a challenge to the company, which provides postage meters for e-commerce and logistics. Pitney Bowes now expects to drive sales growth from shipping, parcels and address verification.

Incubator and venture-capital firm Y Combinator is doubling down on biotech.

The firm already accepts early stage life sciences startups into its accelerator program. Past YC life sciences startups include: Atomwise, Bikanta, Ginkgo Bioworks, Transcriptic and uBiome.

Now the firm is starting a special track in its program for life sciences companies. The track will focus initially on longevity and age-related diseases.

Y Combinator, known for hatching companies like Airbnb and Dropbox, has already expanded significantly from its initial roots as an accelerator for tech startups. It offers a growth venture fund, a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/y-combinator-launches-growth-program-1513303337" for CEOs to learn how to scale a company, and an accelerator track focused on artificial intelligence.

YC Bio will have a specialized focus like the AI track, according to a blog post by Sam Altman, the firm's founder. But YC Bio will invest differently, betting between $500,000 and $1 million in startups for a 10% to 20% ownership stake, instead of the typical $120,000 for a 7% stake in typical startups.

The program will offer lab space, special deals and access to experts in the field.

China Swats Jack Ma's Ant Over Customer Privacy; Regulator rebukes major mobile-payments firm for automatically enrolling Alipay users in its credit-scoring system

By Josh Chin and Chuin-Wei Yap

The Wall Street Journal Online

BEIJING Chinese internet regulators scolded the country's leading mobile-payments company for compromising its customers' privacy, putting pressure on firms to better protect personal data in a society subject to heavy state surveillance.

The Cyberspace Administration of China said Wednesday that it had summoned representatives of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. affiliate Ant Financial Services Group to dress them down for automatically enrolling users in its credit-scoring system.

The action followed complaints that people using Ant's Alipay mobile-payment platform were not properly notified that enrolling in the credit-scoring system would give Ant sweeping rights to their personal financial data, allowing it to be shared with other companies and third parties. This included information on their income, savings and shopping expenditures.

The regulator said Ant's action violated new national standards on the protection of personal data, and broke a pledge the company signed late last year to protect such information.

At a meeting with regulators Saturday, Ant was ordered to fix the system and ensure similar incidents don't occur again, according to a statement on the agency's website. Alipay has about 520 million active users, but it is not known how many people were affected.

Ant last week publicly apologized for the action, and on Wednesday said it was reviewing its privacy-protection policy and would implement the regulator's demands.

The rebuke is another blow for Ant, which was founded by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma to provide secure-payment services for customers of his Alibaba online shopping sites. Last week, Ant "https://www.wsj.com/articles/moneygram-and-ant-financial-halt-merger-deal-1514931496" to acquire Dallas-based MoneyGram International Inc. after the $1.2 billion deal failed to win approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S. The Journal earlier reported that "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-puts-chinese-deals-on-ice-1500664800" about how MoneyGram's data might be used by Ant.

China's rising middle class is taking on more household debt, but the bulk of borrowers don't have conventional lending histories to evaluate credit risk.

Ant's Sesame Credit is one of the new rating systems to emerge in response, using online-shopping habits and social-media activity to evaluate risk. Such systems depend critically on a large user base to refine its big-data analysis.

Controversy over automatic enrollment in the service grew after Yue Shenshan, a lawyer and legal commentator for state media, criticized it in a Jan. 3 social media post.

"Sesame, you secretly help me select 'agree' in tiny characters. If I wasn't more careful I would have fallen for it. Who are you trying to deceive?" Mr. Yue wrote on the Twitter-like Weibo service. The post had attracted more than 22,000 likes and almost 9,000 comments by Wednesday.

Other recent episodes indicate that privacy concerns are starting to build in China.

In December, a wave of online outrage over privacy violations forced Chinese cybersecurity company Qihoo 360 Technology Co. to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/controversial-chinese-live-streaming-platform-shuts-down-after-fueling-debate-over-privacy-rights-1513769394" from the company's surveillance cameras in playgrounds, schools and restaurants.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-internet-giants-face-users-anxiety-over-privacy-1515411818" against Chinese search giant Baidu Inc., saying the company didn't inform users that its apps grant the company access to their phone data, including messages and contacts.

Qihoo said purchasers of its cameras had to opt in to the live-streaming system, while the platform's managers said providing surveillance and live-streaming services in the same product was "something we need to think twice about." Baidu said users have to provide an authorization to access the apps to operate, and the data collected is "within the scope of reasonable use."

Such incidents challenge Western notions that Chinese people are unconcerned about privacy, though researchers say the growing skepticism among Chinese consumers over the use of personal data is almost exclusively focused on companies, rather than the government.

A series of new laws and regulations reflect that split. The national personal information security standards, for example, offer privacy protections on par with the U.S., requiring companies to inform users when they are collecting personal data and to keep data collection to a minimum. Yet China's "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-implement-cybersecurity-law-amid-foreign-tech-firm-anxieties-1496237532" allows "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-tech-giants-have-a-second-job-helping-the-government-see-everything-1512056284" in the name of public security.

"Companies are going to have to answer to both of these drives, and privacy advocates should be prepared to take in both positive moves and disturbing trends at the same time," said Graham Webster, a senior fellow at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center.

Effort to Unwind Money-Fund Rule Hits Hurdle

Bipartisan House legislation aimed at undoing sweeping changes to certain money-market mutual funds suffered a major blow this week: The fund industry's top trade group came out in opposition to the bill, a move that could make it much tougher to advance through the chamber.

The Investment Company Institute now opposes the legislation in question after months of being neutral. The bill would overturn a 2014 Securities and Exchange Commission requirement that a subsection of the $2.7 trillion money-fund industry float in value like other mutual funds.

The decision by ICI is a victory for some of its biggest members, including BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments, which have privately argued the industry has already spent millions of dollars to comply with the SEC's requirement a view now adopted publicly by ICI.

"ICI's members spent thousands of hours and millions of dollars implementing these changes, and the cash management market has adjusted to the new regulatory regime," a spokesman for the trade group said in a written statement.

Money-market funds are investments designed to be a safe place to park cash temporarily with little risk of taking a loss. For years, they generally offered investors $1 back for each $1 they invested, an expectation that triggered a stampede out of some funds catering to large institutions during the 2008 financial crisis when it became clear investors might get less than a dollar back, called "breaking the buck."

Most of the industry has learned to live with the SEC rule. But Federated Investors Inc., with nearly 70% of its assets in money funds, and state and local treasurers teamed up to undo the rule, which they say has increased borrowing costs and limited investment options. Some 60 lawmakers signed on to the bill, introduced by Rep. Keith Rothfus (R., Pa.).

Supporters of the bill played down the significance of ICI's opposition

"State and local governments, universities, hospitals, and businesses continue to bear the unfair and highly disproportionate costs of the SEC's questionable rule," Mr. Rothfus said in a statement. "That is why this bill continues to have strong bipartisan support."

The bill was scheduled to be debated by the House Financial Services Committee last month, but didn't come to a vote amid behind-the-scenes pushback from firms opposed to the legislation.

Even with ICI now opposing the bill, it may come up again for a committee vote, though it's unlikely to advance in its current form, according to people familiar with the process.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

 Fiduciary Rule' Poised for Second Life Under Trump Administration

By Dave Michaels

WASHINGTON The Trump administration's threat to dismantle Obama-era rules that cracked down on conflicted advice from stock brokers won't mean no rules at all. Instead, they could emerge from a different regulator who Wall Street knows a little better.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is accelerating work on its own version of the "fiduciary rule," a regulation issued by the Labor Department that put restraints on brokers handling retirement accounts. The SEC's effort would affect all brokerage accounts not just those for retirement funds and could ban brokers from calling themselves financial advisers unless they accept a strict duty of loyalty to clients.

The SEC hopes to vote to propose its rules by the second quarter of 2018, according to people familiar with the matter. That would be a first step toward creating consistent federal standards for all brokerage accounts, since the Labor Department's rules only covered 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts, or IRAs.

Consumer groups that backed the fiduciary rule, introduced at the end of the Obama administration, are likely to oppose the SEC proposal if they believe it would give Wall Street an end run around Labor's stricter approach. Those groups will watch for how the SEC goes after conflicts of interest such as bonuses and perks that brokerage firms provide to their employees for selling particularly lucrative products, said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America.

"It's difficult to see how they can come up with a solution that does not land them in court," Ms. Roper said. "If they propose a rule we like, industry will sue them. If they give industry a disclosure-based best interest standard that they want, we'll sue them."

Brokers including Fidelity Investments say existing regulations enforced by the SEC sufficiently protect clients. Any changes, Fidelity wrote in a recent letter to SEC Chairman Jay Clayton, should focus on disclosures that explain a broker's conflicts of interest, such as how much they earn from recommending different products.

Groups such as Ms. Roper's say disclosures aren't enough because many retail investors don't understand a broker's financial incentives. Similarly, the trade group for investment advisers wants the SEC to impose a standard on brokers that is "as robust as" the fiduciary duty its members face.

The SEC has struggled for years to harmonize the rules brokers and investment advisers face when they serve retail clients. Use of the term "financial adviser" has muddied the waters further for less sophisticated investors, who may not understand the "buyer beware" culture that pervades the securities business.

SEC Commissioner Michael Piwowar has pushed for banning the "financial adviser" title unless a broker has accepted a fiduciary duty to act in the investor's best interest, according to a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Piwowar told a conference audience in March that the name "means absolutely nothing" today.

If the SEC proposes to ban the term, Ms. Roper said, the agency should also restrict how brokers market their services. Without that, she said, brokers and insurance agents will adopt a different moniker, like financial counselors or wealth managers. "Mr. Piwowar has a fundamentally sound idea, but I think it needs to be treated more broadly," she said.

The SEC staff has held meetings in recent weeks with brokerage firms including Charles Schwab Corp. and Wells Fargo Advisors, a unit of Wells Fargo & Co., as well as trade groups such as the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and the Financial Services Roundtable, according to regulatory filings and people familiar with the matter.

Groups such as Sifma and the Financial Services Roundtable lobbied against the Labor Department's measure several years ago and pushed instead for the SEC to write a broker-conduct rule that would govern all accounts. Sifma said the SEC understood the brokerage industry well enough to write regulations that wouldn't disrupt the interplay between investors and financial professionals.

The SEC proposal could emerge later than the spring of 2018 because the agency will add two new commissioners in the coming weeks. Both new members, Robert Jackson and Hester Peirce, could want time to study a proposal that will generate scrutiny on Capitol Hill.

The SEC's measure could affect future revisions to the Labor Department's rule affecting retirement accounts. Some brokers, including Fidelity Investments, want Labor to exempt firms that comply with a new SEC standard from the fiduciary rule. That would allow the SEC to again regulate all brokerage activity, including retirement investments, and wouldn't require the Labor Department to go through the cumbersome process of revising its regulation.

The Labor Department under the Trump administration has delayed important parts of its fiduciary rule until July 2019, saying the rule has reduced choices for investors and imposed huge compliance duties on industry. The Labor Department noted possible action by the SEC when it decided in November to delay enforcement of its rule.

Bitcoin Powers Big Returns for a Pair of ETFs

By Asjylyn Loder and Dave Michaels

Bitcoin boosted the returns of two of the top-performing exchange-traded funds last year, signaling that some fund companies aren't waiting for regulators to approve a U.S. fund devoted exclusively to the cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin is the largest holding of two ETFs from Ark Investment Management, a New York-based investment firm that owns shares in a trust that holds bitcoin. Both funds returned more than 97% since the end of 2016, according to FactSet. The funds each had about 6% of their assets in bitcoin, which soared 1,446% since the end of 2016.

At least nine companies have applied to the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to offer an ETF that tracks returns on bitcoin. Investors can already buy bitcoin directly through a private account, though it can be hard to buy or sell the digital currency during periods of heavy trading activity. Other cryptocurrency funds are available to qualified investors or in the lightly regulated over-the-counter market.

An ETF on a U.S. exchange would offer investors a way to bet on the cryptocurrency through their existing brokerage accounts, reassuring those who are uneasy about wading into bitcoin on their own.

While the SEC hasn't approved any applications, some fund companies hoped that might change after two Chicago exchanges late last year became the first in the U.S. to list futures contracts on bitcoin. The SEC has indicated that a liquid and regulated futures contract could strengthen the case to allow bitcoin ETFs, but regulators still haven't given the green light to any applicant.

The latest setback came this week, when the SEC asked several firms to withdraw applications to launch ETFs backed by bitcoin futures contracts, which made their debut last month. Last year, the SEC rejected two proposed ETFs that would directly own bitcoin, including one from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, arguing that the global market for the digital currency wasn't transparent enough to support sufficient oversight.

The SEC wants more time to monitor how bitcoin futures trade before it approves futures-backed ETFs, said Garrett Stevens, chief executive officer of Exchange Traded Concepts LLC, which proposed ETFs offering both short and long exposure to bitcoin futures.

With so much money flooding into cryptocurrencies, the SEC wants to make sure bitcoin ETFs are linked to markets that are efficient enough to avoid "something drastic happening," he said.

Mr. Stevens said his company already withdrew one application in the fall, when the SEC staff said it wouldn't consider approving an ETF until after bitcoin futures started trading. Cboe Global Markets Inc. launched trading in bitcoin futures in early December, and CME Group Inc. started trading similar contracts a week later.

"You had two contracts that had been approved on two separate exchanges. That gave us a high degree of confidence," Mr. Stevens said. "So this kind of a ground stop is surprising, to be honest."

The SEC declined to comment

Ark began investing in the cryptocurrency in 2015 by purchasing shares in the Grayscale Bitcoin Investment Trust, which bills itself as a way to own the digital currency "without the challenges of buying, storing, and safekeeping bitcoins." The trust returned 1,560.5% last year.

"We are not investing in bitcoin or bitcoin futures," said Tom Staudt, Ark's chief operating officer and director of product development.

Grayscale's trust is only open to accredited investors who must invest a minimum of $50,000 and hold the shares for at least one year before they can be resold in the over-the-counter market. The restrictions limit the supply of publicly available shares, and the trust trades at a premium to Bitcoin when demand exceeds supply.

Grayscale withdrew its own application to launch a Bitcoin ETF last year.

The Grayscale bitcoin trust is the largest holding of two ARK ETFs, accounting for 5.9% of the holdings of the $422 million ARK Innovation ETF and 6.4% of the $261 million ARK Web x.0 ETF, according to Ark's website.

Other large holdings include Amazon.com Inc., Twitter Inc. and Tesla Inc. A third Ark fund, the Ark Industrial Innovation ETF , has 3.15% of its portfolio invested in the bitcoin trust.

"It's clear that the investment community wants this," said Michael Sonnenshein, sales director for Grayscale Investments. "Cryptocurrencies as an asset class are here to stay."

Jamie Dimon: I  Regret' Calling Bitcoin a Fraud

By Paul Vigna

JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon is softening his stance on bitcoin.

In an interview with Fox Business on Tuesday morning, Mr. Dimon said "I regret making" an earlier comment in which he said the digital currency was a fraud.

Tuesday's comments were brief   the Q&A on bitcoin lasted less than two minutes   but he did manage to quickly sketch out his current take on the world of cryptocurrencies.

"The blockchain is real," he said, referring to the open-ledger technology that underpins the trading of bitcoin and other digital currencies.

Back in September, Mr. Dimon said during a conference that bitcoin is "a fraud," and he'd fire any trader in his company who was buying or selling it.

The fraud comment made him the face of bitcoin skeptics, whose ranks include famous investors like Warren Buffett and Howard Marks. When he made those comments, bitcoin was trading around $4,200. It has rallied sharply since then   it was trading this morning above $14,000   and Mr. Dimon has been hearing it from the cryptocurrency's supporters.

The fraud comment wasn't his first time or last time criticizing bitcoin though. He said in November 2015 that no government would support it, and in January 2016 said bitcoin would go "nowhere." After the fraud comment, he said during an earnings conference call that he wasn't going to talk about bitcoin, but one day later said, "if you're stupid enough to buy it, you'll pay the price for it one day."

While that day may yet come, for now Mr. Dimon is falling back on his core criticism. He said on Fox that his opinion on bitcoin was always more about how governments would respond to it, specifically whether they would take steps to outlaw or discourage it if it became too big and threatened fiat currencies.

In the interview, Mr. Dimon added that "you can have crypto-dollars and yen and stuff like that," a reference to the idea that central banks and governments would create their own bitcoin-like currencies that borrowed some of its technological advantages. Addressing initial coin offerings, or ICOs, which many virtual-currency related startups have used to raise millions of dollars with minimal disclosure, Mr. Dimon said: "You look at every one individually."

As for bitcoin itself, "I'm just not interested in that topic at all.".

What the Tax Law Will Do to Big Bank Earnings

By Michael Rapoport

It is going to be a noisy quarter for bank earnings. Because of the tax-overhaul law, big banks are going to record a host of special charges that cut into fourth-quarter profit.

How big is the bill? Five of the biggest U.S. banks are likely to report a total of about $31 billion in tax-related hits for the fourth quarter, according to the banks' recent disclosures and public comments.

Don't expect investors to be overly alarmed, though. The banks should benefit from the new tax law in the longer term. In fact, with the U.S. corporate tax rate falling to 21% from 35%, many banks could make back any losses within a few years, or even sooner.

The new law is "good for us," Bank of America Corp. CEO Brian Moynihan said at a conference last month.

Still, investors will have to be on their toes when the banks' fourth-quarter earnings announcements begin Friday with JPMorgan Chase JPM 0.51% & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. Tax-law changes could make banks' core earnings which exclude charges and other one-time or nonoperating items less clear. Plus, they will probably make earnings announcements and conference calls more complicated, as banks strive to explain the law's impact.

Because the new tax law was signed in the fourth quarter, accounting rules require companies to reflect the law's impact in that period. That means some banks will have to take big upfront charges to write down the value of their deferred tax assets and pay a one-time tax on their foreign earnings.

"It is going to muddy the waters a little bit," said Janet Pegg, an analyst at Zion Research Group, an accounting and tax research firm. "We're going to be depending on clear disclosure from the companies."

Another wrinkle: Because of the reduction in the tax rate, banks and other companies will have an incentive to "kitchen-sink things," said Christopher Marinac, director of research at FIG Partners in Atlanta. That is, to accelerate deductible expenses to record them in 2017 instead of 2018. That would have the effect of lowering taxable profits in the period when the higher tax rate still applies, thus maximizing the deductions' benefit.

Complicating things further: Any 2018 earnings guidance from banks will be harder to interpret since the new lower tax rate means forecasts will be incorporating a dramatically lower tax liability.

Most of the immediate charges banks are expected to take in the fourth quarter stem from two issues: a reduction in the value of the banks' deferred tax assets and a one-time tax imposed on their earnings generated and held outside the U.S.

Citigroup Inc. C 1.05% may be most affected. Finance chief John Gerspach said at a December conference that Citigroup expects a fourth-quarter charge of about $20 billion, mostly from writing down the bank's huge pile of deferred tax assets.

These are past tax credits and deductions that companies can hold on to and use to defray future tax bills, sort of like an IOU. Citigroup has $45.5 billion of them, generated by the losses the bank suffered during the financial crisis.

But when the tax rate declines, companies' tax bills shrink. So many of those credits and deductions become less valuable and must be written down, leading to charges against earnings. The reverse can happen also: Wells Fargo had net deferred tax liabilities, or taxes payable in the future, of about $7 billion as of the end of 2016. That could lead Wells Fargo to record a gain, though it hasn't announced any such move.

Part of Citigroup's charge also stems from a tax on companies' foreign earnings.

In the previous system, the U.S. taxed corporate profits no matter where in the world they were earned, leading many companies to keep foreign profits overseas instead of bringing them back to the U.S. where they would be taxed at a 35% rate. The new law changes the U.S. approach to a "territorial" system, with taxes levied only on U.S.-generated profits.

But the new law also imposes a one-time tax of 15.5% on foreign-held liquid assets like cash and 8% on illiquid assets. Zion Research estimates that will cost financial companies in the S&P 500 a total of $13.56 billion.

Among other big banks, Bank of America has said it expects a $3 billion charge from writing down deferred tax assets; J.P. Morgan sees a potential adjustment of up to $2 billion from the foreign-earnings issue; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. expects a $5 billion charge from a combination of both issues; and Morgan Stanley sees a $1.25 billion charge, mostly from deferred tax assets.

European banks will be affected, too. Deutsche Bank AG expects a charge of  1.5 billion ($1.79 billion), Barclays PLC sees a charge of 1 billion ($1.35 billion) and Credit Suisse AG expects a charge of 2.3 billion Swiss francs ($2.34 billion).

Apart from their earnings, some banks will see other financial effects from the new tax law. Write-downs of deferred tax assets will lead to reductions in some banks' regulatory capital, and will cut into their book value, a figure closely watched by investors.

But even as banks take their fourth-quarter charges, the tax-rate reduction to 21% is starting to work for them. Large national and regional banks should see an average 15% boost in their earnings per share by 2019 from the lower tax rate, Bernstein analyst John McDonald said in a research note last week.

Despite any hits to profit now, "I think investors will see past it," Mr. Marinac said.

Analysis: Earnings May Temper the Bank Rally

By Aaron Back

Bank shares have been riding high, seen by investors as among the biggest beneficiaries of tax reform and a strengthening economy. But this enthusiasm could soon collide with just mediocre fundamentals.

Two of the nation's largest lenders, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo , will report fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, followed by several more next week. The results will be noisy as banks take multibillion-dollar write-downs related to the tax package.

For the most part, investors should look past these one-time movements. For instance, banks' deferred tax assets, which are credits against future tax bills leftover from crisis-era losses, are now worth less. But this is more than outweighed by the fact that their future tax bills will be lower.

There are exceptions, however. For some banks, these write-downs could meaningfully hit capital levels, making it harder to keep up share buybacks. One bank that could be tripped up by this is Goldman Sachs . In recent notes, analysts at Nomura, Credit Suisse and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods all warned that Goldman could have to reduce planned buybacks after taking a tax-related write-down of around $5 billion.

Certain snags of the new tax structure also could be highlighted. The new "base erosion" tax on cross-border payments, for instance, could become a permanent drag on the derivatives businesses of big global banks.

But, by and large, investors will be focusing more on the fundamental drivers of the banking business. This means firstly loan growth, particularly business lending, which was anemic in 2017. The cause still isn't entirely clear, but for much of the year many bank executives blamed the policy uncertainty that prevailed in Washington, D.C.

This would suggest that loan demand is set to rebound now that tax reform has passed, but analysts remain cautious. UBS analyst Saul Martinez, for instance, says in a note that average loan growth could rise to roughly 3% to 4% over the next couple of years, from 1% to 2% in 2017.

A return to the rapid, high-single-digit loan growth that prevailed from 2014 to 2016 seems unlikely. Over the long run it is difficult for overall loan growth to exceed the rate of economic growth plus inflation, or roughly around 4%, notes Mr. Martinez. Banks also face rising competition from private lenders and other alternative sources of capital.

Similarly, while further rate increases by the Federal Reserve in 2018 still would be positive for banks, there will be diminishing returns each time to bank profits as deposit costs creep up. This is especially the case if long-term rates stay low.

Since the end of September, shares of the six largest banks in the U.S. have risen an average 11.6%, compared with a 9.4% climb for the S&P 500. They now trade at an average valuation of 1.37 times book value, compared with 1.17 a year ago. Heading into a messy earnings season with many long-term issues still uncertain, banks may be due for breather.

Realtors, Licking Their Wounds, Get Ready for Their Next Battle

By Laura Kusisto

The National Association of Realtors, one of the largest and wealthiest lobby groups in the U.S., emerged from the recent tax overhaul hobbled and humbled. Now, the coming debate over the government's role in backing mortgages for most Americans will test whether it can regain some of its clout in Washington politics.

The NAR has about 1.3 million members and spent more than $32 million on lobbying in 2017 through Dec. 8, second only to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group.

The NAR's sway was perceived in Washington to be even greater than its financial resources because it claimed to represent the American dream of homeownership. The group's top issue, the mortgage-interest deduction, has been considered a third rail in American politics.

Yet, the tax overhaul signed into law in late December significantly diminished the incentives for homeownership, leaving little distinction for most Americans between owning a home and renting.

NAR President Elizabeth Mendenhall said the group "achieved major improvements to the tax legislation passed in Congress, and from here, our work continues to improve that law and ensure, as Congress turns to housing finance reform, that there are no negative impacts on the country's homeowners."

The housing lobby scored some 11th-hour victories. The bill preserved the mortgage-interest deduction for second homes, which had been eliminated in the House version. It also left in place a break that lets homeowners shield some of the profits they make selling their homes from capital-gains taxes.

Now political leaders are turning their attention to remaking mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , a decade after the government-backed entities received federal bailouts.

Bipartisan Senate legislation expected to be introduced early this year is expected to preserve government backing of 30-year mortgages a critical goal for the NAR while eventually dialing back federal ownership of the two entities. But the NAR could find itself at odds with some members of Congress who want to see an end to the federal housing guarantees the Realtors consider essential to delivering affordable mortgages to millions of Americans.

The tax overhaul marked a significant legislative defeat for the NAR that raises questions about its lobbying strategy and whether it will have more success in the next round.

In the fight over the tax bill, the NAR argued that doubling the standard deduction, which eliminates the incentive for most Americans to itemize their tax returns and claim the mortgage-interest deduction, could turn the U.S. into a "nation of renters."

It was a tough sell. Since the housing crash, politicians on both sides of the aisle have been less eager to tout the government's role in encouraging homeownership. Rising home prices and tighter mortgage credit in recent years, meanwhile, have meant that new loans and purchases have skewed toward the affluent, making government subsidies less politically palatable.

"All these flies in the ointment started to add up and it made the [mortgage-interest deduction] quite vulnerable," said Nela Richardson, chief economist at Redfin, a Seattle-based real-estate brokerage.

The NAR's opposition from the outset, meanwhile, undermined its ability to win compromises, analysts said.

After the president released an outline of the tax overhaul in April, the Realtors called it a "nonstarter," saying homeowners could see their "home's value plummet and their equity evaporate." Online ads in the states of critical swing votes, such as Maine Sen. Susan Collins, described the plan as a "tax increase on middle-class homeowners."

"The Realtors made the decision to do a fairly resolute, if not scorched-earth, resistance to this. &[They] really got screwed in the House bill because they came out early in opposition," said Charles Gabriel, president of Capital Alpha Partners, a political forecasting company for investors.

A turning point came in the lead-up to the house bill when the National Association of Home Builders split from the Realtors for the first time in three decades, proposing a tax credit it said would be better targeted to less wealthy Americans.

The builders were convinced the proposal had momentum but received calls from House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady and Speaker Paul Ryan telling them the Republican leadership didn't want to complicate the bill with an untested concept like the tax credit, recalled Jerry Howard, chief executive of the NAHB.

Mr. Howard insists that even though the builders group was defeated, it was still the right decision to come to the table because the builders were able to win a number of important concessions for small-business owners and affordable-housing construction.

"The Realtors have a very, shall I call it, one-dimensional view of the tax code and that is the mortgage-interest deduction," Mr. Howard said. "We have to look at this thing holistically."

The industry split gave lawmakers an opening, but so did fissures in the NAR's own membership between agents in high-cost states that could see prices decline due to the bill and agents who hope to benefit from a potential exodus to lower-cost ones. A plea for members to call, email or write to members of Congress generated just over 200,000 sign-ups, which amounts to less than a quarter of NAR's membership. The NAR said that was the largest response in the group's history.

As the Fannie and Freddie debate begins, analysts said the NAR's power is likely diminished, but it remains a force.

"The mortgage industrial complex took it on the chin during the tax debate," said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Compass Point Research & Trading, a Washington, D.C.-based investment bank. But, he added, the housing industry "is part of the fabric of every single congressional district and its capacity to influence the policy-making process will remain substantial.".

WSJ Pro: Senators Support CFTC in Clearinghouse Standoff

Sens. Pat Roberts (R., Kansas) and Debbie Stabenow (D., Mich.) said they supported Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo's position that a hard-fought agreement with the European Union on clearinghouse supervision shouldn't be reopened. The European Commission has made moves over the past year to enhance its role in overseeing London-based clearinghouses in the wake of Brexit, which U.S. regulators deem an unacceptable intrusion on their jurisdiction. The two senators, who are the chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said in their letter that "failure to abide by the terms of the 2016 CFTC-EC agreement would call into question the credibility of the process that has been undertaken cooperatively by the CFTC and the EC in recent years."

Franc Profits

Switzerland got a lot wealthier in 2017, thanks to its central bank's emergence as "https://www.wsj.com/articles/55-billion-profit-for-giant-asset-managerthe-swiss-central-bank-1515485509" of foreign stocks and bonds.

The Swiss National Bank said Tuesday it expects to report a record annual profit of 54 billion Swiss francs ($55 billion) for last year a staggering sum equal to 8% of the country's gross domestic product. By comparison, if the Federal Reserve were to run a profit of similar scale relative to the U.S. economy, it would be about $1.5 trillion. The Federal Reserve has earned an annual profit of around $100 billion in recent years.

The SNB's profit was lifted by a trio of positive forces: low bond yields preserved the value of its foreign bonds that account for 80% of its foreign reserves, higher stock prices raised the value of its equity holdings, and the weaker Swiss currency made those foreign assets worth more in franc terms.

The profit is more than Apple Inc. earns in a year, and more than JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. combined. Those are all giant, world-spanning corporations, while the SNB employs about 800 people. Its chairman among the best-paid central bankers earns about $1 million a year.

Pro Private Markets
Biotech: The Bright Spot in the Exits Scene; IPO market gets a lift from biomedical companies in 2017

In an otherwise lukewarm exits market, biotechnology has proven itself a hot spot for venture capitalists.

Growing confidence that startups can shepherd new medicines to market is feeding demand for biotech initial public offerings as well as acquisitions. Last year, 26 venture-backed biotech companies went public, the highest number of any sector, according to market tracker Dow Jones VentureSource. That lifted the number of IPOs across all industries to 57, up from the 38 completed in 2016.

Biotech mergers and acquisitions also jumped, with 31 companies sold, compared with 27 in 2016. This year got off to a roaring start with Impact Biomedicines Inc. agreeing to be acquired by Celgene Corp. in"https://www.wsj.com/articles/celgene-nears-deal-to-buy-impact-biomedicines-for-as-much-as-7-billion-1515353759"

Activity should remain high because large drug companies need to strike business-development deals to shore up future growth prospects, industry observers said.

"We expect it to be a busy year from [a] BD perspective," said Yatin Suneja, a biotech analyst with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.

Yet across all markets, M&A activity was essentially flat, declining to 600 deals in 2017 from 613 the previous year.

A soaring stock market and a flood of capital into the private markets have given startups greater control over how and when they deliver liquidity to investors and employees. Large technology companies certainly have the option to go public. Last year, for example, featured IPOs from notable companies such as Snap Inc., and Spotify AB has recently filed to go public.

But with capital from sovereign-wealth funds and crossover investors flowing into private companies, startups can raise hefty sums at high valuations. Secondary investors' willingness to pay high prices for shares of hot companies also eases some of the pressure to go public.

"Companies feel like they need to be at a real scale to get institutional coverage [and] to be able to withstand shocks in the market," said Jeff Fagnan, founding partner of Accomplice.

Some venture firms also want to keep tech companies private longer to score a larger payday. Companies such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Airbnb Inc. and WeWork Cos. have held back and are expected to continue doing so this year, The Wall Street Journal has reported.

"If you can raise money at high valuations in the private market, why go public?" said Deepak Kamra, general partner of Canaan Partners.

But that can only hold for so long, Mr. Kamra said. Limited partners will demand distributions. And acquirers that have been waiting for the stock market to fall back will recognize that they can't sit it out forever. Large tech companies with a dearth of bold internal programs eventually turn to acquisitions to fuel growth, he said.

Over the past 18 months private-equity firms have stepped up as significant buyers, which has provided another option for startups in addition to strategic acquirers, said Alex Niehenke, a partner with Scale Venture Partners.

Last year, for example, Scale's portfolio company Applause was acquired by Vista Equity Partners.

One tech sector seeing growing M&A activity is business-support services, which had 125 acquisitions, the highest total on record. In November for example supply-chain technology company Logility Inc. purchased venture-backed Halo Business Intelligence Inc. to secure that startup's analytics capabilities.

Meantime, drug manufacturers have been hunting for biotech acquisitions, a chase encouraged by a favorable regulatory climate. Last year the Food and Drug Administration approved 46 new drugs, up from 22 in 2016. In October, Lupin Inc. snapped up venture-backed Symbiomix Therapeutics LLC, which had won FDA approval in September for bacterial vaginosis treatment.

Like their tech counterparts, biotech companies are also fielding interest from crossover investors, which has helped several go public. A run of 11 biotech offerings in the fourth quarter pushed the annual IPO total to 26, up from 19 in 2016. These offerings included an IPO from Spero Therapeutics Inc., a drug developer whose private investors included crossover investors such as Rock Springs Capital.

Biotech companies going public lately tend to be later-stage companies with drugs in mid- to late-stage clinical trials, according to an analysis by Silicon Valley Bank. As a result, companies are commanding strong pre-money valuations and investors are typically finding they can take companies public in an up round, according to SVB Managing Director Jon Norris.

With a good supply of biotech companies with clinical-stage products and strong venture and crossover backing, "I think pre-money valuations will continue to stay on the high side," he said.

Investors predict another good year for biotech IPOs in 2018. Still, the market has tightened since the boom of IPOs occurring midway through this decade, when a total of 130 biotechs went public from 2013 through 2015. Poor performance from several companies that went public during that wave has made public investors more selective.

As the biotech IPO window has narrowed, overall activity has also slowed. Last year's 57 IPOs was well below the totals of 70, 108, and 76 seen from in the years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

Other health-care markets didn't perform as well as biotech in 2017. Medical-device companies had three IPOs last year, down from four in 2016, and medical software and information services companies had just one, compared with three the prior year. No venture-backed health-care services companies have gone public since 2015, a year when two listed on public exchanges, according to VentureSource.

M&A activity also slipped in these sectors compared with 2016, in part because of uncertainty about health-care legislation. Medical-device acquisitions dropped to 21 from 29 in 2016. Medical software buyouts fell to 22 from 26, and health-care services purchases declined to eight from 15.

"Nobody likes uncertainty," said Michael Balmuth, managing partner of SV Health Investors. "Unfortunately, what's going on in Washington creates a certain amount of uncertainty [with] health-care services."

Effort to Unwind Money-Fund Rule Hits Hurdle

Bipartisan House legislation aimed at "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bringing-back-the-money-fund-buck-1513247400" suffered a major blow this week: The fund industry's top trade group came out in opposition to the bill, a move that could make it much tougher to advance through the chamber.

The Investment Company Institute now opposes the legislation in question after months of being neutral. The bill would overturn a 2014 Securities and Exchange Commission requirement that a subsection of the $2.7 trillion money-fund industry "https://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-ready-money-fund-rules-1404945583".

The decision by ICI is a victory for some of its biggest members, including BlackRock Inc. and Fidelity Investments, which have privately argued the industry has already spent millions of dollars to comply with the SEC's requirement a view now adopted publicly by ICI.

"ICI's members spent thousands of hours and millions of dollars implementing these changes, and the cash management market has adjusted to the new regulatory regime," a spokesman for the trade group said in a written statement.

Money-market funds are investments designed to be a safe place to park cash temporarily with little risk of taking a loss. For years, they generally offered investors $1 back for each $1 they invested, an expectation that "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122186683086958875" catering to large institutions during the 2008 financial crisis when it became clear investors might get less than a dollar back, called "breaking the buck."

Most of the industry has learned to live with the SEC rule. But Federated Investors Inc., with nearly 70% of its assets in money funds, and state and local treasurers teamed up to undo the rule, which they say has "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-rules-and-fresh-headaches-for-short-term-borrowers-1470695795". Some 60 lawmakers signed on to the bill, introduced by Rep. Keith Rothfus (R., Pa.).

Supporters of the bill played down the significance of ICI's opposition

"State and local governments, universities, hospitals, and businesses continue to bear the unfair and highly disproportionate costs of the SEC's questionable rule," Mr. Rothfus said in a statement. "That is why this bill continues to have strong bipartisan support."

The bill was scheduled to be debated by the House Financial Services Committee last month, but didn't come to a vote amid behind-the-scenes pushback from firms opposed to the legislation.

Even with ICI now opposing the bill, it may come up again for a committee vote, though it's unlikely to advance in its current form, according to people familiar with the process.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

 Fiduciary Rule' Poised for Second Life Under Trump Administration

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fiduciary-rule-poised-for-second-life-under-trump-administration-1515580200" Obama-era rules that cracked down on conflicted advice from stockbrokers won't mean no rules at all. Instead, they could emerge from a different regulator who Wall Street knows a little better.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is accelerating work on its own version of the "fiduciary rule," a regulation issued by the Labor Department that put restraints on brokers handling retirement accounts. The SEC's effort would affect all brokerage accounts not just those for retirement funds and could ban brokers from calling themselves financial advisers unless they accept a strict duty of loyalty to clients.

The SEC hopes to vote to propose its rules by the second quarter of 2018, according to people familiar with the matter. That would be a first step toward creating consistent federal standards for all brokerage accounts, since the Labor Department's rules only covered 401(k)s and individual retirement accounts, or IRAs.

Bitcoin Powers Big Returns for a Pair of ETFs

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-powers-big-returns-for-a-pair-of-etfs-1515585600" of two of the top-performing exchange-traded funds last year, signaling that some fund companies aren't waiting for regulators to approve a U.S. fund devoted exclusively to the cryptocurrency.

Bitcoin is the largest holding of two ETFs from Ark Investment Management, a New York-based investment firm that owns shares in a trust that holds bitcoin. Both funds returned more than 97% since the end of 2016, according to FactSet. The funds each had about 6% of their assets in bitcoin, which soared 1,446% since the end of 2016.

Jamie Dimon: I  Regret' Calling Bitcoin a Fraud

"https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/01/09/jamie-dimon-i-regret-calling-bitcoin-a-fraud/" and CEO Jamie Dimon is softening his stance on bitcoin.

In an interview with Fox Business on Tuesday morning, Mr. Dimon said "I regret making" an earlier comment in which he said the digital currency was a fraud.

Tuesday's comments were brief the Q&A on bitcoin lasted less than two minutes but he did manage to quickly sketch out his current take on the world of cryptocurrencies. "The blockchain is real," he said, referring to the open-ledger technology that underpins the trading of bitcoin and other digital currencies.

What the Tax Law Will Do to Big Bank Earnings

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-the-tax-law-will-do-to-bank-earnings-1515580201". Because of the tax-overhaul law, big banks are going to record a host of special charges that cut into fourth-quarter profit.

How big is the bill? Five of the biggest U.S. banks are likely to report a total of about $31 billion in tax-related hits for the fourth quarter, according to the banks' recent disclosures and public comments.

Don't expect investors to be overly alarmed, though. The banks should benefit from the new tax law in the longer term. In fact, with the U.S. corporate tax rate falling to 21% from 35%, many banks could make back any losses within a few years, or even sooner.

Analysis: Earnings May Temper the Bank Rally

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/earnings-may-temper-the-bank-rally-1515580380", seen by investors as among the biggest beneficiaries of tax reform and a strengthening economy. But this enthusiasm could soon collide with just mediocre fundamentals.

Two of the nation's largest lenders, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo, will report fourth-quarter earnings on Friday, followed by several more next week. The results will be noisy as banks take multibillion-dollar write-downs related to the tax package.

Realtors, Licking Their Wounds, Get Ready for Their Next Battle

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/realtors-licking-their-wounds-get-ready-for-their-next-battle-1515538892", one of the largest and wealthiest lobby groups in the U.S., emerged from the recent tax overhaul hobbled and humbled. Now, the coming debate over the government's role in backing mortgages for most Americans will test whether it can regain some of its clout in Washington politics.

Political leaders are turning their attention to remaking mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a decade after the government-backed entities received federal bailouts.

Bipartisan Senate legislation expected to be introduced early this year is expected to preserve government backing of 30-year mortgages a critical goal for the NAR while eventually dialing back federal ownership of the two entities. But the NAR could find itself at odds with some members of Congress who want to see an end to the federal housing guarantees the Realtors consider essential to delivering affordable mortgages to millions of Americans.

WSJ Pro: Senators Support CFTC in Clearinghouse Standoff

Sens. Pat Roberts (R., Kansas) and Debbie Stabenow (D., Mich.) said they supported Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo's position that a hard-fought agreement with the European Union on clearinghouse supervision shouldn't be reopened. The European Commission has made moves over the past year to enhance its role in overseeing London-based clearinghouses in the wake of Brexit, which U.S. regulators deem an unacceptable intrusion on their jurisdiction. The two senators, who are the chairman and ranking member, respectively, of the Senate Agriculture Committee, said in their letter that "failure to abide by the terms of the 2016 CFTC-EC agreement would call into question the credibility of the process that has been undertaken cooperatively by the CFTC and the EC in recent years."

Franc Profits

Switzerland got a lot wealthier in 2017, thanks to its central bank's emergence as "https://www.wsj.com/articles/55-billion-profit-for-giant-asset-managerthe-swiss-central-bank-1515485509" of foreign stocks and bonds.

The Swiss National Bank said Tuesday it expects to report a record annual profit of 54 billion Swiss francs ($55 billion) for last year a staggering sum equal to 8% of the country's gross domestic product. By comparison, if the Federal Reserve were to run a profit of similar scale relative to the U.S. economy, it would be about $1.5 trillion. The Federal Reserve has earned an annual profit of around $100 billion in recent years.

The SNB's profit was lifted by a trio of positive forces: low bond yields preserved the value of its foreign bonds that account for 80% of its foreign reserves, higher stock prices raised the value of its equity holdings, and the weaker Swiss currency made those foreign assets worth more in franc terms.

The profit is more than Apple Inc. earns in a year, and more than JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. combined. Those are all giant, world-spanning corporations, while the SNB employs about 800 people. Its chairman among the best-paid central bankers earns about $1 million a year.

Increased "competition in local banking markets increases credit to young, highly productive firms and can impact aggregate industry productivity &We find that the reallocation of labor plays an important role in explaining these gains," they write.

Data Sharing Can Help Stop Financial Abuses

Tales From the Cryptocurrency; New ideas for how companies can cash in on blockchain mania.

Some Hooters customers just got a fresh reason to return to the chain. Chanticleer Holdings, which owns and operates nine Hooters locations, has introduced a loyalty program pegged to cryptocurrency. "Eating a burger is now a way to mine for cryptocoins!" gushed the chief executive officer of the company helping Chanticleer develop the rewards initiative.

Companies everywhere are pivoting to blockchain, the digital ledger for recording secure transactions by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Among recent pivoters is Vapetek, a California e-cigarette supplier that "http://www.nasdaq.com/press-release/nodechain-inc-focuses-on-bitcoin-and-ethereum-cryptocurrency-mining-20171220-00198"as Nodechain to mine digital currencies. Croefit, a sports bra maker, transformed itself into a digital-asset trader called the Crypto Co. Long Island Iced Tea's shares surged on news it was becoming a blockchain investor. The company rechristened Long Blockchain Corp. still sells flavored teas.

Although lately bitcoin's price has swung wildly, the frenzy to go crypto will continue, at least until the bubble bursts. Here are a few more you may hear about in weeks or hours to come:

 " Blockchain Video. Blockbuster went bankrupt in 2010 but will return as a site for streaming videos of blockchain evangelists. I'd invest, but I'd have to pay the $30 late fee I owe for not returning "Pulp Fiction" on time.

 " Alt-Right Coin. Hardcore Breitbart and Steve Bannon fans will get their own unique cryptocurrency, though it will only be available in trace amounts and require an apocalypse to gain value. Alt-Left Coin has already been fully mined to fund Elizabeth Warren's 2020 presidential bid.

 " H&R Blockchain. Conceding America's tax system is beyond human comprehension, H&R will advise clients to throw out their shoe boxes of receipts and let its accounting bots assign refunds and payments using data analytics and peer-to-peer filing algorithms.

 " The Bitstein Co. Still searching for a buyer in the wake of a seismic sex scandal, the Weinstein Co. will reverse its fortunes by launching an initial coin offering for buying up every script in development on bitcoin. Even Meryl Streep might like that action.

 " EthereYum Brands. The company behind KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell will convert to an exchange for ether, the No. 2 digital token. Yum will transform Col. Sanders into Col. Crypto, offering buckets of chicken to open-source coders for keeping its Ethereum network trans-fat-free.

 " Heath's Ledger. The moody actor from Perth left this earth in 2008, but fans can soon secure a portion of his aura via HeathCoins. These tokens memorializing Ledger's short list of films will trade on the Australian Futures Exchange.

 " Saudi Aramcoin. Instead of raising a measly $50 billion through a traditional initial public offering, Aramco plans to go superlong on crypto for a new golden kingdom; if the bet fails, the Saudi crown prince will round up the sheikhs at the Riyadh Ritz for another shakedown.

As for me, I'm hereby changing my name to Allan Ripple to align with the San Francisco firm whose digital currency, XRP, soared 1,100% in the past month. As a hedge, I'm sending everyone I know a chain letter.

Mr. Ripp runs a press relations firm in New York.

China moves to shutter bitcoin mines

Beijing views cryptocurrencies as not strategically important technology

China is moving to wipe out its bitcoin mining industry following concerns of excessive electricity consumption and financial risk, in the latest sign of Beijing s hostility to cryptocurrencies.

A multi-agency task force has instructed provincial governments to  actively guide  companies in their respective regions to exit the cryptocurrency mining industry, according to a document seen by the Financial Times. The move to pressure miners follows China s shutdown of local bitcoin exchanges and its ban on initial coin offerings.

Miners create new bitcoins by solving complex maths problems used to validate new bitcoin transactions. The reliance on raw computing power makes the process more akin to industrial manufacturing than traditional high-technology businesses.

Many bitcoin miners have established operations in remote areas without even registering a company. Some have also skirted Chinese regulations that forbid end users from purchasing electricity directly from power producers rather than grid operators.

China mines about three-quarters of the world s bitcoins, according to Liao Xiang, chief executive of Lightningasic, a Shenzhen-based mining operation. Chinese miners have taken advantage of cheap electricity in regions rich in coal or hydroelectric power, including Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Sichuan and Yunnan.

The global industry accounts for 0.17 per cent of global electricity consumption, more than 161 individual countries, according to Digiconomist, a website that tracks the industry.

China s government is using state investment and an array of industrial policies in an effort to seize global leadership in strategic technology sectors such as artificial intelligence and robotics. But the crackdown on bitcoin miners reflects a judgment that cryptocurrencies do not merit state support.

Bitcoin mining  consumes a large amount of electricity and also encourages a spirit of speculation in  virtual currencies  , according to the document. Mining operations contradict efforts to prevent financial risk and to discourage activities that  deviate from the needs of the real economy , it added.

The internet finance task force, which includes the People s Bank of China, has previously led regulatory tightening efforts on peer-to-peer lending and online consumer loans.

The order does not call on regional authorities to shut mining operations directly, but rather to squeeze them out by strictly enforcing policies on electricity consumption, land use, tax collection and environmental regulation.

The PBoC did not respond to a request for comment.

Chinese miners are now seeking ways to transfer their operations abroad, either by physically moving factories or selling their expertise. Cheap electricity and a cool climate, which helps prevent computers from overheating, are the main requirements. Canada, Iceland, eastern Europe and Russia are seen as the most promising destinations.

Industry participants say China was in any case never an especially suitable location for mining, even after accounting for electricity costs in selected regions that are lower than the national average. China s current dominance is mainly due to its well-developed supply chains for computer components used in the mining process.

 The difficulty is that setting up in other countries takes time and capital to build large-scale data centres,  said Mr Liao.  It needs so much electricity. A typical industrial park doesn t meet the requirements.

Investors plough money into agriculture tech

Start-ups and big groups do battle for business as US farmers seek disruptive solutions to combat falling revenues

More money went into funding agricultural technology start-ups last year than the previous two combined, as battle lines were drawn between traditional "big ag" companies and some of the Silicon Valley venture capitalists looking to upend the multi-billion-dollar industry.

Investors ploughed more than $700m into agricultural tech in 2017, according to the research company CB Insights, a big step up from the $332m and $233m in 2016 and 2015 respectively.

The spending on start-ups using robotics or data science to make farming more efficient contrasts with the straitened financial situation in rural America. Farm incomes have eroded since a commodity boom peaked in the early 2010s, leaving oversupply and low prices. According to the US department of agriculture's economic research service, the country has now had three consecutive years of falling farm incomes. In Broken Bow, Nebraska, Clay Govier's relatively small arable farm of about 3,000 acres has seen revenues fall about 50 per cent since corn prices began to crash in 2012. "With land prices and property taxes going up ... it puts the squeeze on the little guy," he said. At the same time, input costs such as seeds and fertiliser have stayed high, eating into Mr Govier's profits.

This is a situation that encourages investment that can improve the lot of farmers and increase the efficiency of the industry, analysts say.

The significant late-stage capital raises suggest that the ag tech sector is maturing, says Rob LeClerc, co-founder and chief executive of AgFunder, a specialist research company. He points to a $203m series D fundraising round closed this month by Indigo Ag, a Boston company that wants to use microbes to improve plant health and crop yields.

But some start-ups are aiming more directly at making pricing for essentials such as seeds and fertilisers more transparent from the "big ag" industry. Nearly a quarter of 2017's ag tech investments were made by corporations or their venture capital arms, including those of giants Monsanto and Syngenta, up 7 percentage points from 2016   raising questions about whether "big ag" will be friend or foe to the disrupters.

One tech start-up, Farmers Business Network (FBN), which raised $110m from investors including Google's venture capital arm last year, says it wants to help farmers avoid being exploited by manufacturers of chemical agricultural necessities, following a spate of consolidation that prompted concerns of an emerging oligopoly.

The so-called "big six" agricultural chemical companies could soon be down to four, after the $142bn merger of Dow Chemical and DuPont last September, Syngenta's $44bn acquisition by ChemChina, and a proposed merger of Bayer and Monsanto which is subject to an EU antitrust investigation.

Testifying before the US Senate judici-ary committee in 2016, Tim Hassinger, Dow AgroScience's chief executive, said his company's merger would "bring more competition to the market, not less". DowDuPont plans to break itself into three companies.

An FBN study found wide pricing differences across the US for seeds and chemicals, particularly in remote locations where farmers had few choices. Some were paying three times more than others for the same product. Californiabased FBN, founded in 2015 by Charles Baron, a former Google project manager, and Amol Deshpande, an ex-tech venture capitalist, pools data from its nearly 5,000 US and Canadian members and, for an annual fee of $600, analyses the information to produce insights, from accurate pricing for chemicals, to pointers about seeds and soil.

According to Mr Baron, farmers have not had the benefit of internet pricing wars. Although some agricultural products can be bought online, agricultural "retailers have fought tooth and nail to prevent online competition", he said. "It was already a small market and [it is] getting a lot smaller. There's naturally less choice and competition."

Big ag is not waiting to be disrupted.

Bayer has invested $600m-$700m in the past 18 months in more speculative "moon shot" life-science companies, including an ag tech project with Ginkgo Bioworks, a biotech company recently valued at more than $1bn, to create seeds pre-coated with a microbial fertiliser.

Monsanto Growth Ventures led a $30m series C funding round for NewLeaf Symbiotics, a Missouri start-up trying to use bacteria to help crops grow better. And this month, Syngenta Ventures led a $12m series B funding round in Asilomar Bio, which uses chemistry to improve crop yields.

The big ag companies are also acquiring outright. Last year, Deere & Co, the Fortune 500 tractor maker, bought Blue River Technology, a Silicon Valley start-up that uses machine learning to make agricultural spraying equipment more precise, for $305m. DuPont also spent $300m to acquire Granular, a San Francisco-based company making computer software for farmers.

Ben Belldegrun, managing partner at Pontifax Agriculture Technology Fund, predicts that big companies looking to keep up with changing technology will continue to spend   and are likely to make 2018 another strong year for ag tech fundraising. "The interest in the sector is not going away," he said. "The fundamentals demand innovation."

Quant hedge funds poised to pass $1tn mark as sceptics turn into 'AI groupies'

The quantitative hedge fund industry is on the brink of surpassing $1tn of assets under management after breakneck growth in systematic, computerpowered investment strategies.

The sum of money managed by quant hedge funds tracked by data provider HFR rose to more than $940bn by the end of October 2017, nearly double the level of 2010. Flows continued to be strong in the fourth quarter, according to hedge fund executives.

Exploding interest in automated, algorithmic investment approaches, ranging from the simple to high-octane strategies powered by artificial intelligence, has driven the surge. Even many traditional hedge funds are now hiring data scientists and programmers to reshape themselves into quants.

"Over the past decade the results of systematic quantitative investing have been undeniable," said Philippe Jordan, president of CFM, a French quant hedge fund. "People have gone from being sceptical and uninterested to being artificial intelligence groupies."

The growth of Two Sigma, one of the leaders of the quant hedge fund industry, is emblematic of the shift away from traditional hedge fund strategies. The New York-based firm's assets have swelled from about $6bn in 2011 to more than $50bn in 2017, putting it roughly on par with the best-established quant powerhouses such as Renaissance Technologies and DE Shaw.

CFM's assets under management nearly doubled last year to about $11bn, and the hedge fund has expanded its staff from about 160 at the start of last year to more than 200 today, according to Mr Jordan. He expects staffing to double over the next five years as more money pours into quantitative investing. Executives say the war for computer scientist talent has become intense. Estimates for the size of the industry vary greatly because what constitutes a quant fund is debatable, especially now that many traditional hedge funds and even mutual fund groups are reinventing themselves as more computerdriven firms.

However, Morgan Stanley's analysts recently estimated that quant strategies, ranging from the newer breed of exchange traded funds to sophisticated hedge funds, have grown at 15 per cent annually over the past six years and control about $1.5tn.

But of that pile, they estimate, hedge funds account for only $438bn, while quant mutual funds manage $712bn.

TD Bank Acquires Toronto-Based AI Startup Layer 6; Acquisition to help Canadian bank accelerate plans to offer new services using artificial intelligence  software

Toronto-Dominion Bank said Tuesday it has acquired Toronto-based startup Layer 6 Inc., a move aimed at bolstering the Canadian bank's artificial intelligence expertise amid a broader push by financial services firms in adopting the technology.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed. TD said in a statement that the acquisition is not expected to have a meaningful impact on the bank's common equity Tier 1 capital ratio.

The acquisition will help TD "jump start" its ability to launch services such as product recommendations for retail banking customers rather than build an AI team themselves, said Michael Rhodes, the bank's group head of innovation, technology and shared services. The startup will retain its name and its office in midtown Toronto but will focus its work solely for TD, he added.

"We've made enormous investments in data and data infrastructure over the past several years, " Mr. Rhodes said. "We didn't have substantive intellectual capital around AI, so this actually filled in a gap for us."

The Layer 6 deal is the first major acquisition by a Canadian bank of an AI company as financial service institutions develop technology aimed at taking their massive stockpiles of data and use complex algorithms that could, for example, improve customer satisfaction or automate various services to help manage costs.

Royal Bank of Canada opened an AI research lab based in Montreal in November aimed at taking advantage of the city's well-established AI presence. RBC hired Richard Sutton, a professor of computing science at the University of Alberta and top AI researcher, as an adviser last year.

Layer 6's software uses artificial intelligence to handle large amounts of data and provide real-time prediction tools that would help provide customers with recommendations for products and services, said the company's co-Chief Executive Jordan Jacobs. Layer 6's co-founders Mr. Jacobs and Tomi Poutanen also helped launch Canada's Vector Institute in March to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canada-looks-to-develop-a-new-resource-artificial-intelligence-1490982372" that would support research collaborations with local companies and academics in AI technology.

The company put itself on the map after winning last year's ACM RecSys Challenge, an annual research competition that was previously awarded to teams from Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Russian software giant Yandex. Layer 6 hasn't secured any venture financing and was built on a relative shoestring budget by the company's founders as well as some angel investment from friends, Mr. Jacobs said.

"Banks have enormous amounts of data and AI needs a lot of data to be effective and accurate," Mr. Jacobs said. "Banks can show a return on investment in what they're doing, whether that's measured in terms of customer satisfaction or revenue improvements. Even small improvements can be worth a lot of money."

Canada has seen U.S. tech giants such as Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Uber Technologies Inc. and Microsoft Corp. establish "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-to-open-new-artificial-intelligence-lab-in-montreal-1505497926" across the country in recent years.

Canada's AI boom also comes amid a surge in Canadian startup venture capital financing from U.S. investors with nearly 400 million Canadian dollars ($321 million) invested in the country's AI and machine learning startups over the past three years, according to recent Thomson Reuters data.

Renault-Nissan Starts Up Billion-Dollar Venture Fund for Car Technology; Auto makers are rushing to access startups' advances, including driverless-vehicle tech

LAS VEGAS The Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi Alliance is creating one of the largest venture-capital funds dedicated to automotive technologies, escalating an already feverish pursuit by global auto makers to reinvent personal transportation.

The company said it will commit $200 million annually over five years for a total of $1 billion to invest in a variety of startup technologies, including battery and self-driving vehicle advances. The new corporate venture fund is part of a push by Renault-Nissan Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn to speed development of technologies that the alliance's three auto makers don't have in-house.

The message to tech startups, Mr. Ghosn said at an event tied to the CES show happening here: "Please come see us."

The spending comes on top of the 8.5 billion euros ($10.1 billion) annually that Renault SA, Nissan Motor Co. and Mitsubishi Motors Corp. invest together in research and development.

"We will be a success if we really bring into the company the new technology for the car of the future that will [take] too long and also [be] too expensive to develop within our R&D," said Francois Dossa, who is leading the new fund called Alliance Ventures. "The main driver is to be fast."

He plans to have teams in Silicon Valley, Paris, Japan and China looking for early- to late-stage startups. Mr. Dossa's deputy is Christian Noske, who came from the corporate venture arm of BMW AG.

Mr. Dossa said the Alliance Ventures fund has already invested in Ionic Materials Inc., a Woburn, Mass., startup working to develop solid-state batteries, a technology that holds the promise of packing more range into smaller-size batteries.

Alliance Ventures joins a growing stable of auto makers looking to invest in the next hot startup.

In July, the Toyota Research Institute announced the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/toyota-plans-100-million-investment-arm-for-ai-development-1499867441" called Toyota AI Ventures to help finance early-stage startups in the area of artificial intelligence. The Silicon Valley subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corp. is part of the Japanese auto maker's efforts to develop autonomous vehicles.

Corporations generally have had mixed success wading into the risky business of venture capital, which typically involves taking minority stakes in fledgling companies with unproven technology.

Venture funds can give companies insight into the latest technological developments and flag possible acquisition targets. But these funds tend to struggle financially, since most startups fail and corporations usually invest strategically, not for pure financial gain. And founders of startups are sometimes reluctant to take money from a strategic investor out of concern the business becomes perceived as too much aligned with the corporation.

Mr. Dossa said his fund aims to address concerns about working with corporate funds by moving quickly on investment decisions, keeping investment agreements, known as term sheets, simple, and by not requiring exclusivity. "We intend to create real partners," he said.

Investors around the world have poured money into automotive technology as programs by Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo self-driving unit and Tesla Inc. have gained attention and stoked new enthusiasm for autonomous vehicles and electric cars.

General Motors Co. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gm-closes-acquisition-of-cruise-automation-1463154595" called Cruise Automation in a deal potentially valued at more than $1 billion to jump-start its autonomous effort. Aptiv PLC, an automotive-technology company that was spun out of parts marker Delphi last year, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/delphi-to-buy-self-driving-car-tech-startup-for-450-million-1508860946"NuTonomy for $450 million in October.

 Big ag  companies increased their investments in 2017 alongside venture capitalists

More money went into funding agricultural technology start-ups last year than the previous two combined, as battle lines were drawn between traditional  big ag  companies and some of the Silicon Valley venture capitalists looking to upend the multibillion-dollar industry.

Investors ploughed more than $700m into agricultural tech companies in 2017, according to research firm CB Insights, a big step up compared with the $332m and $233m invested in 2016 and 2015 respectively.

The spending splurge on start-ups using robotics or data science to make farming more efficient contrasts with the straitened financial situation in rural America.

Farm incomes have eroded since a commodity boom peaked in the early 2010s, leaving oversupply and low prices.According to the US Department of Agriculture s economic research service, the US has now had three consecutive years of falling farm incomes.

In Broken Bow, Nebraska, Clay Govier s relatively small arable farm of about 3,000 acres has seen revenues fall about 50 per cent since corn prices began to crash in 2012.  With land prices and property taxes going up 	. 	. 	. 	it puts the squeeze on the little guy,  he explained. At the same time, input costs like seeds and fertiliser have stayed high, eating into Mr Govier s profits.

This is a situation that encourages investment that can improve farmers  lot and increase the efficiency of the industry, analysts say.

The significant late-stage capital increases suggest the ag tech sector is maturing, says Rob Leclerc, co-founder and chief executive of AgFunder, a specialist research company and investor. He points to a $203m series D fundraising round closed last month by Indigo Ag, a Boston company that wants to use microbes to improve plant health and crop yields.

But some start-ups are aiming more directly at making pricing for essential commodities such as seeds and fertilisers more transparent from the  big ag  industry.

Nearly one quarter of 2017 s ag tech investments were made by corporations or their venture capital arms, including those of giants Monsanto and Syngenta, up 7 percentage points from 2016   raising a question about whether  big ag  will be friend or foe to the industry s disrupters.

One tech start-up, Farmers Business Network, which raised $110m from investors including Google s venture capital arm last year, says it wants to help farmers avoid being ripped off by manufacturers of chemical agricultural necessities, following a spate of consolidation that has prompted concerns of an emerging oligopoly.

The so-called  big six  agricultural chemical companies could soon be down to four, after the $142bn merger of Dow Chemical and DuPont in September, Syngenta s $44bn acquisition by ChemChina, and a proposed merger of Bayer and Monsanto which is subject to an EU antitrust probe.

Testifying before the US Senate Judiciary in 2016, Tim Hassinger, Dow AgroScience s chief executive, sought to reassure Washington that his company s merger would  bring more competition to the market, not less . DowDuPont plans to break into three companies.

An FBN study found wide pricing differences across the US for seeds and chemicals like fertiliser, particularly in remote locations where farmers had few choices. Some farmers were paying three times more than other growers for the same product.

California-based FBN, founded in 2015 by Charles Baron, a former Google project manager, and Amol Deshpande, a former tech venture capitalist, pools data from its nearly 5,000 American and Canadian member farms and, for an annual fee of $600, analyses the information to produce insights for farmers, from accurate pricing for chemicals, to pointers about seeds and soil.

According to Mr Baron, farmers have not had the benefit of internet pricing wars when it comes to buying seeds and chemicals. Although you can buy some agricultural products online, agricultural  retailers have fought tooth and nail to prevent online competition,  he said.  It was already a small market and [it is] getting a lot smaller. There s naturally less choice and competition. 

FBN s series D round was led by T Rowe Price and Temasek, the Singapore wealth fund. Existing investors including Google s venture capital arm GV, Kleiner Perkins and Acre Venture also invested in the latest round.

Big ag is not waiting around to be disrupted. Bayer alone has invested $600m-$700m in the past 18 months in more speculative  moon shot  life science companies, including an ag tech project with Ginkgo Bioworks, a biotech companyrecently valued at over $1bn, to create seeds pre-coated with a microbial fertiliser.

Monsanto Growth Ventures led a $30m series C funding round for NewLeaf Symbiotics, a Missouri start-up trying to use bacteria to help crops grow better. And last month, Syngenta Ventures led a $12m series B funding round in Asilomar Bio, which uses chemistry to improve crop yields.

The big ag companies are also acquiring outright, as well as investing. In one of 2017 s biggest deals,Deere & Co, the Fortune 500 tractor maker, bought Blue River Technology, a Silicon Valley start-up that uses machine learning to make agricultural spraying equipment more precise, for $305m. DuPont spent $300m to acquire Granular, a San Francisco-based company making computer software for farmers.

Ben Belldegrun, founder and managing partner at Pontifax Agriculture Technology Fund, forecasts that big companies looking to keep up with changing technology will continue to spend   likely making 2018 another strong year for ag tech fundraising.

 The interest in the sector is not going away,  he said.  The fundamentals demand innovation.

Growth propelled by interest in more systematic, computer-powered investment plans

The quantitative hedge fund industry is on the brink of surpassing $1tn of assets under management this year after breakneck growth from rising interest in more systematic, computer-powered investment strategies.

The amount of money managed by quant hedge funds tracked by HFR, a data provider, rose to more than $940bn by the end of October 2017   nearly double the level of 2010   and flows have continued to be strong in the fourth quarter, according to hedge fund executives.

An explosion of interest in automated, algorithmic investment approaches, ranging from the simple to high-octane strategies powered by artificial intelligence, has driven the surge. Even many traditional hedge funds are now hiring data scientists and programmers to reshape themselves into quants.

 Over the past decade the results of systematic quantitative investing have been undeniable,  said Philippe Jordan, president of CFM, a French quant hedge fund.  People have gone from being sceptical and uninterested to being artificial intelligence groupies. 

The growth of Two Sigma, one of the leaders of the quant hedge fund industry, is emblematic of the shift away from traditional hedge fund strategies. The New York-based firm s assets have swelled from about $6bn in 2011 to more than $50bn in 2017, putting it roughly on par with the best-established quant powerhouses such as Renaissance Technologies and DE Shaw.

He expects staffing to double over the next five years as more money pours into quantitative investing. Hedge fund executives say that the war for computer scientist talent has become intense.

Estimates for the size of the industry vary greatly because what constitutes a quant fund is debatable, especially now that many traditional hedge funds and even mutual fund groups are reinventing themselves as more computer-driven firms. However, Morgan Stanley s analysts recently estimated that quant strategies   ranging from the newer breed of exchange traded funds to sophisticated hedge funds   have grown at 15 per cent annually over the past six years and control about $1.5tn.

But of this pile, they estimate that hedge funds only account for about $438bn, while quant mutual funds manage $712bn. Barclays analysts last summer estimated that quant hedge funds, or quant strategies within bigger hedge fund groups, managed about $500bn. Yet regardless of the overall size, analysts agree that it is the fastest-growing corner of the hedge fund industry.

That is worrying some fund managers, who fear that the money gushing into both simple and complex algorithmic trading strategies is making markets both more complex and fragile. The packaging of increasingly complex strategies into ETFs that are sold to retail investors is particularly alarming, according to analysts at 13D Research.

 When algorithms coexist in complex systems with the subjectivity and unpredictability of human behaviour, unforeseen and destabilising downsides result,  they wrote in a recent report.  They re ignored, they intensify, until they become undeniable. We have little doubt the same will prove true for the algorithmic revolution in asset management.

Investing in Funds & ETFs: A Quarterly Analysis --- Exchange-Traded Funds: What to Look for in ETFs in 2018 --- Investors should expect an increase in the types of products

Corrections & Amplifications

The first name of Jay Batcha, Optimal Capital's chief investment officer, was incorrectly given as Ray in an article on exchange-traded funds in Monday's Investing in Funds & ETFs report.

(WSJ Jan. 12, 2018)

(END)

Exchange-traded funds are taking over. Many industry observers say that the party will continue, even if a downturn hits the stock market, and especially if a pullback hits the bond market.

U.S. ETF investing had another record year in 2017, with net flows at $463 billion, of which $330 billion went into stock funds and $119 billion into debt and fixed-income funds. Total U.S. assets under management now top $3.4 trillion, though that is still one-fifth of the total assets in long-term mutual funds (excluding money markets).

During the year, 275 new products were launched and 136 products were delisted, according to research firm XTF. The announced acquisition by Invesco Ltd.'s Invesco PowerShares of Guggenheim Investments' ETF business has brought the slow but steady consolidation toward the top of the ETF pyramid. The fourth-largest issuer at $177 billion in assets, when combined, will still trail State Street Corp.'s State Street Global Advisors ($567 billion), Vanguard Group ($851 billion) and BlackRock Inc. ($1.35 trillion). Additionally, three issuers -- Global X, Goldman Sachs and Exchange-Traded Concepts -- experienced more than 100% asset growth in 2017, according to Toroso Asset Management.

Here are five trends to watch in 2018.

1. The time for fixed-income ETFs has come. This argument is made every year, but rising short-term interest rates and a flattening yield curve in the U.S. will shine a spotlight on fixed-income fund performance and drive more investors to consider ETFs, both active and passive, according to Todd Rosenbluth, senior director of ETF and mutual-fund research at CFRA. For investments where outperformance is measured more in basis points than percentage points, the fact that 2017 flows equaled 21.5% of total fixed income ETF assets (compared with 12.3% for equity ETF assets) is an indicator of the growth that should continue this year.

2. More products and issuers. Even with 123 fund sponsors already in the U.S. market, Toroso's Michael Venuto sees room for even more entrants. Last year, the asset-management units of several insurance companies (USAA, Transamerica, Principal) launched a number of funds, while established asset managers without significant ETF businesses were emboldened to cut fees and ramp up marketing on new products or previous acquisitions. Mr. Venuto says new issuers and products will fall into three categories: hot ideas, catch-up by existing asset managers and insurers, and registered investment advisers converting separate accounts to ETF-based strategies.

3. ETF "innovators" will continue to push the envelope of investible assets. Empowered by fringe investment trends in the legal-marijuana industry and bitcoin/blockchain ecosystems, new and established ETF issuers alike have applied to list at least six marijuana-investment products and 16 bitcoin/blockchain-related strategies, according to Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas. And, following the launch of bitcoin futures in December, two exchanges -- NYSE Arca and Cboe Global Markets -- have applied to list bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. While these products are still waiting for approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission (approval which for some of them may never come, especially if the federal government succeeds in a new push against state legalization of marijuana), Optimal Capital's Chief Investment Officer Ray Batcha says there are many esoteric strategies that could get more attention should the U.S. stock market and debt markets move sideways. These include ETFs offering downside protection with options and swaps.

4. The robots come home to roost. Robo advisers are dead; long live robo advisers. Like "ETF strategists" before them, stand-alone automated investment platforms have ceased to threaten established financial advisers or brokerage firms, despite shining a light on costs and minimums for professional advice. "Distribution is a major choke point for ETF issuers. Even BlackRock has pivoted to model portfolios on the strength of its Aladdin analytics platform," says Matt Hougan, CEO of Informa PLC's Inside ETFs. JPMorgan Chase & Co. revealed its own plans for a digital-wealth offering in December, following Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch, while Vanguard's low-cost Personal Advisor Services had $93 billion in discretionary assets and Charles Schwab's Intelligent Portfolios $21 billion through Sept. 30. A November deal between PayPal and microinvesting services Acorns (and its 1.3 million customers) could open up a new front for banks and investment managers.

5. Active management is redefined. Even supporters of actively managed stock funds argue that active vs. passive/indexing can be boiled down to high cost vs. low cost. (And, yes, there is high-cost passive in some areas of the market.) Now, Vanguard is gearing up to blow a hole in the active/passive distinction by introducing low-cost, actively managed ETFs in the first quarter -- index funds with that will home in on areas of the market recently ruled by the smart-beta crowd -- namely momentum, value and minimum volatility, among others.

But perhaps the index giant's entry into active equity ETFs -- stock funds that mesh the low cost and tax benefits of ETFs with an active manager -- will jostle the sleepiest region of the ETF market. The niche has just $8.3 billion in assets, according to XTF, across 74 funds.

For Advisers of UHNW Clients, Takeaways From a Billionaire Survey; Arts and sports ownership are important. The wealth transfer is coming. Digital tools will be key for engaging with clients.

Tom Holly leads PwC's Asset & Wealth Management practice in Washington, D.C. Voices is an occasional feature of edited excerpts in which wealth managers address issues of interest to the advisory community. As told to Alex Coppola.

This past fall, Swiss banking giant UBS Group AG and global consulting and accounting firm PwC released their "https://www.wsj.com/articles/asias-billionaire-ranks-outstrip-u-s-for-first-time-1509003434". There are a number of interesting findings from the report that advisers working with ultra-high-net-worth clients can incorporate into their work in order to provide these clients with greater value.

First, billionaires are becoming increasingly involved as patrons of the arts and maybe more surprisingly sports. There are more private art galleries than ever before, and billionaires now own two-thirds of professional basketball and football teams in the U.S. These clients see arts and entertainment as more than investments or hobbies and rather as means of making a social and cultural impact in their community. Building a new stadium and developing the area around it, for example, can potentially revitalize a neighborhood while creating jobs and opportunities for local businesses.

For advisers, one of the greatest benefits you can bring to these clients is helping connect them with like-minded peers who can help them pursue their interests and achieve their goals. If a client has a passion for fine art, for example, help put them in touch with individuals who have similar collections and experience as a patron. Those contacts can provide your clients with guidance and support and share their own experiences, whether it's showing them how to lend their pieces to institutions or how to create their own endowment.

Networking is most effective and useful when it's focused on a specific cause. It's not about simply introducing affluent clients to other wealthy people, but identifying the issues close to them whether it's entertainment, education, global health and connecting them with resources that will help steer and amplify their philanthropic efforts.

Second, and possibly the most significant trend for advisers of UHNW clients to note, a massive intergenerational exchange of wealth is on the horizon. Just under half of all U.S. billionaires are age 70 or older, and over the next two decades an estimated $1.3 trillion in assets are set to change hands, whether to their heirs or charitable causes. Advisers should be proactive in driving discussions around that wealth transfer, reviewing legacy and contingency plans with clients and closely monitoring any regulatory or tax law changes to ensure those plans account for them.

Finally, billionaires, like most investors, are increasingly turning their attention to technology. Advisers should prepare accordingly for changing expectations around digital experience. The next generation of investors is far more digitally inclined than their parents when it comes to wealth management demanding more access to data and tools like predictive analytics. As a wealth manager, it's important to ask yourself if digital strategy is an area you can contribute to and if not, then who at your practice or which third-party is responsible for driving that work.

What to Look for in ETFs in 2018; As inflows continues apace, look for more products, including fixed income and marijuana-linked investments

The first name of Jay Batcha, Optimal Capital's chief investment officer, was misspelled as Ray in an earlier version of this article. (Jan. 10, 2018)

Exchange-traded funds are taking over. Many industry observers say that the party will continue, even if a downturn hits the stock market, and especially if a pullback hits the bond market.

U.S. ETF investing had another record year in 2017, with net flows at $463 billion, of which $330 billion went into stock funds and $119 billion into debt and fixed-income funds. Total U.S. assets under management now top $3.4 trillion, though that is still one-fifth of the total assets in long-term mutual funds (excluding money markets).

During the year, 275 new products were launched and 136 products were delisted, according to research firm XTF. The announced acquisition by Invesco Ltd.'s Invesco PowerShares of Guggenheim Investments' ETF business has brought the slow but steady consolidation toward the top of the ETF pyramid. The fourth-largest issuer at $177 billion in assets, when combined, will still trail State Street Corp.'s State Street Global Advisors ($567 billion), Vanguard Group ($851 billion) and BlackRock Inc. ($1.35 trillion). Additionally, three issuers Global X, Goldman Sachs and Exchange-Traded Concepts experienced more than 100% asset growth in 2017, according to Toroso Asset Management.

Here are five trends to watch in 2018.

1. The time for fixed-income ETFs has come. This argument is made every year, but rising short-term interest rates and a flattening yield curve in the U.S. will shine a spotlight on fixed-income fund performance and drive more investors to consider ETFs, both active and passive, according to Todd Rosenbluth, senior director of ETF and mutual-fund research at CFRA.

S&P 500 Extends Record Run; Dow industrials edge down, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq close at new highs

The S&P 500 inched higher Monday, extending this year's run of records.

Stocks have "https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-stock-gains-show-some-signs-of-slowing-1515118525", buoyed by investors' optimism over the global economy and bets that central banks are unlikely to pressure markets by raising interest rates faster than expected.

Many investors and analysts believe the rally will continue, especially if the economy continues to grow at what they describe as an ideal pace: fast enough to support corporate earnings growth but slow enough to keep the Federal Reserve from withdrawing stimulus too quickly.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 12.87 points, or less than 0.1%, to 25283.00. The S&P 500 rose 4.56 points, or 0.2%, to 2747.71 and the Nasdaq Composite added 20.83 points, or 0.3%, to 7157.39, with both indexes posting their fifth consecutive closing record.

Corporate news drove swings in individual stocks Monday.

Kohl's shares jumped $2.54, or 4.7%, to $56.90 after the retailer boosted its annual profit outlook and said its comparable sales jumped over the holidays, thanks to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/retailers-get-bump-from-holiday-season-1515422466".

Shares of Crocs, which raised its guidance for fourth-quarter revenue, added 1.03, or 8.4%, to 13.23.

Meanwhile, GoPro shares fell 96 cents, or 13%, to 6.56 after the company said its fourth-quarter revenue would come in "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/01/08/gopro-shares-crash-back-to-earth/" and that it would cut about 20% of its workforce.

Shares of Nvidia climbed 6.60, or 3.1%, to 222.00 after it said Uber and Volkswagen would use its artificial-intelligence technology in upcoming projects.

Analysts say they will be closely watching companies' forecasts for the year as the earnings season begins in earnest later this month.

"This is when the accounting department really needs to put pen to paper in terms of what tax reform means for them," said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley FBR.

Goldman Sachs analysts estimate the recently passed U.S. tax overhaul bill, which will reduce the corporate tax rate to its "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-signs-sweeping-tax-overhaul-into-law-1513959753", could give a 5% boost to per-share earnings for the S&P 500 in 2018.

That could lend additional fuel to a stock rally that has repeatedly wrong-footed skeptics. The S&P 500, Dow industrials and Nasdaq closed out 2017 with their "https://www.wsj.com/articles/asian-equities-take-stock-as-2017-concludes-1514512785".

At the same time, valuations have crept higher, leading many analysts to say U.S. stocks look pricey relative to their international counterparts.

"The critical signpoint for the earnings season will be where companies plan to use their cash and where their guidance ends up," Mr. Hogan said.

Signs that companies are investing in their businesses rather than "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/01/08/how-will-apple-use-its-250-billion-held-overseas-analysts-say-buybacks/""https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/01/08/how-will-apple-use-its-250-billion-held-overseas-analysts-say-buybacks/", which some see as less helpful in driving long-term profitability could help give stocks a boost, he added.

Elsewhere, the Stoxx Europe 600 rose 0.3% on Monday, lifted by gains in shares of basic-resources companies.

Solid economic data also helped pull European stocks higher, analysts said.

The European Commission's economic sentiment indicator for the European Union last month reached its highest level since August 2000.

In Asia, stocks mostly rose, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbing 0.3% and notching its 10th consecutive session of gains the longest such streak since October 2012.

The Shanghai Composite added 0.5%, its seventh consecutive advance, while Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.

Tech
China's Internet Giants Face Users' Anxiety Over Privacy; Search engine Baidu joins Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial and Tencent Holdings under the spotlight

BEIJING China's powerful internet titans are suddenly on the defensive amid concerns that the data they gather is compromising consumer privacy.

Search engine Baidu Inc. is the most-recent company to come under the spotlight, joining Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. affiliate Ant Financial and Tencent Holdings Ltd., following claims by a provincial consumer group that Baidu illegally obtained users' personal information.

Baidu's search app and mobile browser fail to give consumers advance warning that the apps enable Baidu to monitor the user's phone and have access to messages, contacts and system settings, the Jiangsu Provincial Consumers Association alleged in a civil suit filed last week.

The association, which is supported by the provincial government in the coastal region near Shanghai, said such notice is required by law. It asked the Nanjing Intermediate People's Court to compel Baidu to comply.

Baidu denied the allegations, saying its mobile apps can't monitor phone calls and that "access to geographic location, text messages and address books are within the scope of reasonable use." It added that users must give the app authorization to operate.

"Baidu has always attached great importance to the protection of personal information," the Beijing company said.

Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent all play a significant role in helping China's authoritarian "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-tech-giants-have-a-second-job-helping-the-government-see-everything-1512056284", and to a much greater degree than their tech counterparts in the U.S., The Wall Street Journal reported.

Among Chinese citizens, there is increasing awareness that what they do and say online is readily accessible to authorities, said Shaun Rein, managing director at China Market Research Group.

"In the past few months, the concern over user data held by these internet companies has started to worry people," Mr. Rein said.

Liu Yanchun, a 22-year-old student from Hunan province, said she wouldn't download new Baidu apps after learning about the lawsuit. But she expressed frustration at doing anything beyond that because of her dependence on apps such as Tencent's WeChat for communication and mobile payments.

"I feel a bit helpless," Ms. Liu said. "If WeChat wants to gather my information, I don't really think I have much chance to resist it."

Last week, the normally press-shy Tencent took the rare step of publicly denying that it collects user chat history for big-data analysis, after a prominent Chinese businessman expressed concern that WeChat messages were read "every single day."

Also last week, Ant Financial apologized to users of its Alipay mobile-payment service for automatically enrolling them in its social-credit scoring service as the default method when people clicked on a 2017 user-spending annual report. Ant said in a statement that users who had been enrolled by default would be removed from it.

Still, concerns persist.

"There is no privacy at all," one user wrote on Weibo social media in response to a posting about the Baidu case. "We are basically 'naked!'"

Economy
Economists Stick With Long View for Slower U.S. Growth Despite Recent Uptick; Tax cuts may spur investment and spending, but not enough to upend projections for output growth to ease from past decades

U.S. economic growth picked up last year and that could continue into 2018 if tax cuts enacted into law last month spur business investment and consumer spending, as many forecasters expect.

But economists who study the long-run outlook many of whom were gathered this weekend for the annual meeting of the American Economic Association aren't budging much from their projections that output growth will remain far slower than its historical average in the years ahead.

The economy grew at a 3.1% annual pace in the second quarter and a 3.2% annual rate in the third quarter, according to the Commerce Department. That was well above the postrecession pace of near 2%.

The government will release official numbers for the fourth quarter on Jan. 26. Most see the economy again outperforming the expansion average, but perhaps not as much as in earlier months. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates a 2.7% growth rate in the final three months of 2017, while forecasters at Macroeconomic Advisers project a 2.3% pace.

"This is not enough to establish a new trend, by any means," Harvard University economist Dale Jorgenson said.

It wouldn't be the first time in recent years that growth accelerated for a time before easing again; output grew at impressive annual rates of 4.6% and 5.2% in back-to-back quarters during 2014 before settling back into a subdued pace.

The tax-code changes enacted by Congress in December could boost growth for the next couple of years, Mr. Jorgenson said. That leaves the longer-term outlook "maybe a bit more optimistic than you were before we got two good quarters and the tax cut, but not in the range of 3%," Mr. Jorgenson said.

Taxes and the outlook were hot topics in icy Philadelphia this weekend during the AEA annual conference.

Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, noted during a Saturday presentation that professional forecasters have been revising up estimates for near-term U.S. growth, consistent with an improving outlook tied to lower taxes.

Other economists in Philadelphia were skeptical the tax cuts will produce a meaningful boost.

Historically, "tax cuts aimed at the top of the income distribution have had very little stimulus effect," said University of Chicago economist Austan Goolsbee, who had Mr. Hassett's job during the Obama administration.

Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Columbia Business School and former top White House economist under President George W. Bush, said the legislation isn't as worrisome as critics suggest, nor as positive as advocates claim. "It's not going to raise us off to 4% GDP growth," Mr. Hubbard said. "But it's not going to kill 10,000 people a year."

In the long run, economists believe "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-gdp-growth-revised-up-to-3-3-rate-in-third-quarter-1511962566" is determined by two forces: how many people are working, and how productive they are.

Annual growth in inflation-adjusted potential output averaged 3.2% between 1950 and 2016, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. But many forecasters think those days are gone.

Demographics are set to hold down workforce participation as baby boomers retire. Meantime productivity growth in the U.S. has sagged since an information technology-fueled surge in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Tax cuts could spur productivity by incentivizing business investment in new equipment, but the effects are uncertain.

The CBO last summer estimated potential gross domestic product growth would average 1.8% over the ensuing decade. Estimates by Federal Reserve officials in December for longer-run GDP growth ranged from 1.7% to 2.2%, with a median projection of 1.8%. Private-sector economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal last month had an average longer-run GDP forecast of 2.2% a year.

To be sure, economists have been wrong about the shifting long-run outlook before. They largely failed to predict the productivity pickup in the 1990s and the subsequent slowdown last decade.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Erik Brynjolfsson said the current consensus about growth is too pessimistic, but not because of anything happening in Washington. Instead, he said the adoption of "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-tech-driven-boom-is-coming-please-be-patient-1514390400" will boost productivity and transform the economy, much as the adoption of electricity did in the past.

He thinks the U.S. is now seeing the early stages of a sustained pickup in economic growth.

"No doubt there'll be ups and downs, and I'm not someone who tries to predict quarterly growth," Mr. Brynjolfsson said. "But when I look at the longer trend, I'm optimistic."

Northwestern University economist Robert Gordon said the U.S. is due for a pickup of long-depressed productivity growth that will help the economy maintain growth around 3% a year but only for a year and a half, perhaps two years. He said that wouldn't change his thinking about the subdued underlying trend.

With the jobless rate at 4.1% in December, his thinking goes, the economy can't sustain above-trend growth indefinitely.

"That potential growth ceiling on growth will eventually start to bite as we run out of workers," Mr. Gordon said.

Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco economist John Fernald said at a panel in Philadelphia that the slower-than-usual recovery from the 2007-09 recession reflected broad trends that were under way before the downturn and may not dissipate.

"The headwinds to a substantial pickup in growth are fierce," he said.

Electronic health records company Practice Fusion Inc., which raised more than $157 million in venture capital, has agreed to be acquired by Allscripts for $100 million cash.

Practice Fusion formed in 2005 and offers an affordable cloud-based electronic health record system to independent physician practices.

Allscripts, a large health care IT company, said combining Practice Fusion's operation with its payer and life sciences business would enable the company to expand its big data insights and analytics, while also improving data-sharing technologies and clinical-trial offerings.

San Francisco-based Practice Fusion had raised funding from investors including Felicis Ventures, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Longitude Capital.

MediaMath and Undertone Ad Tech Veterans Launch Venture Capital Fund; MediaMath CEO Joe Zawadzki and Undertone co-founder Eric Franchi to lead ad tech-focused fund called MathCapital

Corrections & Amplifications

MediaMath's headquarters is located at 4 World Trade Center in New York. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the location as One World Trade Center.

As funding and exits in the ad-tech sector has become harder to secure, two high-profile figures have joined forces to launch a venture capital fund with an aim to accelerate the next generation of digital advertising businesses.

Joe Zawadzki, chief executive of digital ad-buying technology firm MediaMath, and Eric Franchi, a co-founder and former executive at Undertone, will lead the ad-tech focused fund they have named MathCapital, alongside three other MediaMath executives.

MathCapital is hoping it can act as a shot in the arm for a once-buoyant sector where funding has dried up as many firms struggle to convince investors of their long-term potential within a digital advertising market dominated by Google and Facebook.

The fund's initial fundraising target is $5 million, with a goal of eventually expanding to $25 million.

MathCapital plans to initially make investments in the $150,000 to $250,000 range, mostly focused on the seed stage, with some funds held in reserve to extend that to as much as $500,000 over the lifetime of certain investments.

While MathCapital will operate as a separate entity from MediaMath, startups receiving investment from the fund will also have access to support from the ad tech company, including office space at its headquarters in New York City's 4 World Trade Center and integration with its technology and clients.

Ad tech companies secured about $3 billion in equity funding in 2017, compared with the industry's peak of $4.4 billion in 2015, according to data from research firm CBInsights. There was a slight uptick in the number of deals and dollars last year compared with 2016, which CBInsights analyst William Altman says was due in part "to the increased efficacy of artificial intelligence technologies in advertising" and rising investor interest in backing those specialized companies.

While there has been a wave of consolidation in the industry, ad tech investors haven't all seen the exits they once envisioned. Some deals have been in more distressed situations, like "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sizmek-to-acquire-fellow-ad-tech-company-rocket-fuel-for-125-5-million-1500379406", a fraction of its once $2 billion market valuation.

The public markets may also be somewhat responsible for investors' reluctance to pour money into the space. Ad tech stocks fell 4% in 2017, according to investment bank LUMA Partners.

Mr. Zawadzki believes the venture community is under-investing in ad tech and sees data points like these as an opportunity, recalling the often-quoted Warren Buffett line, "Be greedy when others are fearful."

Mr. Zawadzki said there is an "explosion" of new digital advertising capabilities that still need to be built to help marketers achieve their business goals, from core infrastructure to using artificial intelligence and working on new formats such as virtual reality.

"The list of things un-done is longer than the list of things done in terms of finishing this journey," Mr. Zawadzki said.

MathCapital formalizes a lot of the work the two ad tech veterans and MediaMath's corporate development team had been doing in the background for some time.

Mr. Zawadzki has been a prolific ad tech investor for a number of years, having invested in firms including AppNexus, Accordant, Integral Ad Science and Moat. Messrs. Zawadzki and Franchi are both investors in marketing data startup mParticle. Meanwhile, MediaMath had also been involved in incubating some small ad tech startups.

Undertone, where Mr. Franchi previously worked, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/israeli-firm-perion-acquires-undertone-for-180-million-1448978581" in 2015.

In addition to investing in companies itself, MathCapital is also willing to provide expertise to help more generalist venture investors who can potentially offer more significant capital navigate the ad tech space, according to Mr. Zawadzki.

MediaMath's general counsel, Peter Piazza, and chief investment officer, Dan Bisgeier, are also partners in MathCapital, while executive assistant to the CEO, Larisa Bravette, will be an associate in the firm.

Fed's Harker: Two Rate Increases in 2018 Likely Appropriate

Fed's Mester Would Be Happy With 3 or 4 Rate Increases This Year--CNBC

Possible Fed Leaks Prompted Warning From Bernanke in 2012

When The Data Changes Your Mind

Transcripts of the Federal Reserve's 2012 meetings came out Friday and the main story out of thousands of pages of discussion was Jerome Powell's queasiness about launching a third round of asset purchases.

Mr. Powell, who joined the Fed as a governor in May of that year and who has since become President Donald Trump's pick for chairman, worried that continued bond buying might not boost the economy as much as expected but could send inflation surging and could be perilous to unwind.

Even though he voted in favor of a third bond-buying program, he wanted his new colleagues to know that "I am somewhat uncomfortable with the road that we are on."

None of this should come as much of a surprise to close Fed-watchers. In his early years on the Fed, Mr. Powell made no secret of his worries about the program, also known as quantitative easing.

What's interesting about Mr. Powell's views is how they shifted when the data suggested he was wrong. In a February 2015 speech, he acknowledged that officials such as former Chairman Ben Bernanke and current Chairwoman Janet Yellen were right about QE.

"Let's let the data speak: The evidence so far is clear that the benefits of these policies have been substantial and that the risks have not materialized," he said in February 2015.

For a Fed official to misread the economy's response to monetary policy is hardly a cardinal sin, especially for a newcomer to the central bank. Even the most brilliant economist struggles to predict the future just like the rest of us.

What's notable is that Mr. Powell wasn't afraid to change his mind.

We don't yet know what kind of chairman he'll be but a willingness to put empirical evidence ahead of preconceived ideas is a promising sign in any leader.

Key Developments Around the World

Powell Backed Fed's Bond-Buying Plan With Reservations in 2012

By Nick Timiraos

Federal Reserve governor Jerome Powell guardedly supported an aggressive expansion of the Fed's controversial bond-buying program in 2012 and expressed reservations behind closed doors about longer-term risks, according to transcripts of central bank policy meetings released by the bank on Friday.

Mr. Powell joined the board in May of that year and has been tapped by President Donald Trump to succeed Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen next month. Because he voted consistently to support the policies of former Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and later Ms. Yellen, markets expect he wouldn't deviate significantly from the Fed's current policy path to gradually raise rates.

The materials released Friday reveal for the first time his greater caution in 2012 about aggressively deploying unconventional policy tools compared with Mr. Bernanke and Ms. Yellen, who forcefully warned about the risks if they failed to do everything in their power to boost hiring.

The release of 2,167 pages of transcripts and other materials from eight meetings of the Fed's rate-setting committee, published with the customary five-year lag, provide the first verbatim public record of what individual officials and staffers said during the policy discussions. Until now, their comments have only been summarized in the minutes released three weeks after each meeting, without identifying any speakers by name.

The transcripts include Mr. Powell's first five meetings, during which officials debated plans to unleash a third round of bond purchases aimed at boosting the then-fitful U.S. economic recovery.

Mr. Powell, a former private-equity executive, is set to become the first non-economist in four decades to lead the Fed. His concerns about expanding the bond-buying program imply greater caution about making big or sudden moves and suggest he may be more attuned to how financial markets respond to policy decisions than his predecessors.

In his discussions on the economy, Mr. Powell often related anecdotes about how industrial companies and the finance industry viewed growth prospects, and he frequently complimented the quality of Fed staff memos that grounded the policy discussions.

The Fed in 2008 launched the first of three rounds of bond purchases aimed at stabilizing markets and lowering long-term interest rates. The untested move drew criticism from some economists and lawmakers that the central bank was risking a surge in inflation. In the end, the economy and the labor market continued to strengthen, while inflation remained under control.

Despite his early misgivings, Mr. Powell by 2015 had fully embraced the view that the central bank should be prepared to take aggressive and sustained action to boost growth and fight recessions.

"Let's let the data speak: The evidence so far is clear that the benefits of these policies have been substantial and that the risks have not materialized," he said in a speech in February 2015. Last year, he said the Fed should be prepared to employ bond purchases again to support the economy if it is in dire shape and doesn't respond to interest-rate cuts.

The 2012 transcripts show Mr. Powell indicated greater skepticism about the benefits of resuming bond purchases, but he also backed efforts to target those purchases toward boosting a nascent housing rebound by buying more mortgage-backed securities.

Some conservative economists and GOP lawmakers have objected most strongly to the Fed's mortgage-bond purchases because they said targeting one particular sector of the economy in this case, housing amounted to credit decisions better left to fiscal policy makers in Congress and the executive branch.

In August 2012, as more Fed officials including Ms. Yellen pushed for renewed stimulus to boost flagging growth, Mr. Powell said the bar for another round of bond-buying hadn't been met.

He said he was "coming around to the view" that risks cited frequently by Wall Street investors, including inflation and the difficulty of exiting from the bond buying program, could be managed. But he raised other concerns, such as that the purchases might one day lead to accounting losses on the Fed's holdings.

In September, the Fed announced the beginning of its third bond-purchase campaign, which was its most controversial because it made open-ended purchases of mortgage bonds, and later, Treasurys. The program was designed to drive down long-term interest rates and push investors into other assets, like stocks.

At the meeting, Mr. Powell believed the proposal would boost sluggish economic growth but voted to proceed "with a certain lack of enthusiasm." He added, "I am somewhat uncomfortable with the road that we are on."

The decision to purchase assets in 2012 differed from the crisis-fighting stance of 2008 and 2009, he said, because the Fed was now resorting to such stimulus as "a straightforward jobs program."

He added, "There is no credible threat of deflation, recession or financial crisis, any of which could present a compelling case for action and the use of all of our tools."

Mr. Powell said his reservations focused on the mid-to-long term and not the next six months. "My concern is that for very modest benefits, we are piling up risks for the future and that it could become habit forming," he said.

By contrast, Ms. Yellen, then the Fed's vice chairwoman, said the benefits of stronger hiring easily outweighed potential costs. "These concerns pale in comparison to what I view as the potential economic and human costs of failing to reduce the unemployment rate as aggressively as we can," Ms. Yellen said.

At the Fed's October meeting, Mr. Powell said he was concerned Wall Street broker-dealers were now projecting the Fed's balance sheet would swell from $2.8 trillion to $4 trillion by early 2014.

"Why stop at $4 trillion? The market in most cases will cheer us for doing more," he said. "Our models will always tell us that we are helping the economy, and I will probably always feel that those benefits are overestimated." He also said officials were "way too confident" they could smoothly slow or unwind those purchases once they were ready to do so.

By December, officials voted to increase the purchases to $85 billion a month, with $40 billion in mortgages and $45 billion in Treasurys. Mr. Powell again supported the move, but he said he would have preferred focusing more heavily on buying mortgages and worried again about the drawbacks of a larger balance sheet.

His concerns again stood in contrast to Ms. Yellen, who cautioned against thinking there were any "riskless policy options" and against repeating the mistakes of the Bank of Japan in its long-running battle against price declines, or deflation. She said officials there, over the past 15 years, had been too hasty to withdraw stimulus at every "whiff of recovery," prolonging their problems.

While Ms. Yellen acknowledged accounting losses from the balance sheet could one day damage the Fed's reputation and political independence, she added, "prolonged failure to meet the central bank's mandate" of stable inflation and low unemployment "can be just as damaging."

Some concerns about the potential for market instability and difficulty communicating the Fed's plans to exit from the purchase programs materialized in May 2013. When the Fed discussed plans to pare its bond purchases that spring, a tumble in bond prices sent yields soaring, in what was called the taper tantrum.

The Fed stopped adding to its balance sheet in 2014 but continued until last October to reinvest the principal of maturing bonds to keep its holdings steady, at around $4.5 trillion. Ms. Yellen successfully launched the Fed's strategy to slowly shrink the portfolio last fall so far, without causing a rerun of the taper tantrum by allowing some assets to mature. The Fed doesn't plan to sell holdings outright.

Possible Fed Leaks Prompted Warning From Bernanke in 2012

By Kate Davidson

WASHINGTON Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke told colleagues at an October 2012 policy meeting that the recent disclosure of sensitive Fed policy deliberations was "probably unintentional," but warned that such lapses could damage the central bank's credibility, according to meeting transcripts released Friday.

The Fed leader's concerns followed the publication of two separate reports that appeared to reveal confidential information from the Fed's September policy meeting, a potential breach of its communications policies.

One of the reports, published by Medley Global Advisors, a policy information service, later sparked a criminal investigation and led to the resignation in 2017 of Richmond Fed President Jeffrey Lacker, who admitted to speaking with a Medley analyst the day before report was sent to clients.

Mr. Bernanke asked the Fed's inspector general and the secretary of its policy committee to investigate the Medley report, as well as a separate report in The Wall Street Journal. "Based on their findings, we will take further steps as indicated," he said, according to the transcript.

The Journal story, published in late September 2012, detailed how Mr. Bernanke formed a consensus among policy makers that summer to launch a third round of its bond-buying program, known as quantitative easing. The Medley report, published several days later, offered details about policy discussions likely to appear in the minutes of the September meeting, potentially market-moving information.

"My own sense is that the leaks were probably unintentional," Mr. Bernanke said at the start of the Oct. 23-24, 2012, meeting. "We have very good reporters talking to lots and lots of people. But that said, they are obviously damaging to the reputation and credibility of the committee, so I urge everybody, please, to be more careful in the future."

Fed guidelines prohibit officials from discussing confidential information. Any breach must be reported to the central bank's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee and could be referred to law enforcement by the Fed's inspector general.

The internal probe concluded that the Journal story was deeply reported and didn't constitute a leak, and that Fed officials who spoke with the Journal didn't provide details of Fed "policy proposals or actions." It also found that much of the information in the Medley report previously appeared in the Journal story.

After the internal probe became public in December 2014, however, federal prosecutors in the Southern District of New York, as well as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, launched an investigation into the Medley report. Republicans in Congress also admonished the Fed for its handling of the possible leak of market-sensitive information, and subpoenaed the Fed for more details about the Medley probe.

In April 2017, Jeffrey Lacker, then president of the Richmond Fed, stepped down unexpectedly after revealing he had spoken with the Medley analyst the day before the report was published.

"I have always strived to maintain the appropriate balance between transparency and confidentiality, but I regret that in this instance I crossed the line to confirming information that should have remained confidential," he said in a statement at the time.

Mr. Lacker didn't face any criminal charges related to the investigation, and no charges were ever filed against anyone else. The inspector general closed its investigation of the matter last year.

19 Central Bankers Walk Into a Bar...

By Sarah Chaney

America's central bankers met in 2012 to debate changes in monetary policy, including a third round of bond purchases aimed at boosting the still-fitful economic recovery. Still, the officials found a few opportunities at the Federal Open Market Committee meetings to poke fun at one another and find humor in such comedy-rich topics as financial markets, monetary policy and economic modeling.

The 2012 transcripts, released Friday, noted 247 moments of laughter across eight meetings. (They're marked by a "[Laughter]" tag in the transcripts; we're not kidding.)

We've collected some of the best and worst cracks. Our background information and analysis is in italics. The rest are direct quotes from the transcripts.

(Note: all job titles refer to positions held at the time of the transcript)

January 24 25

Before the FOMC makes important decisions on the adoption of a formal inflation target, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke announces the retirement of economist Lawrence Slifman, senior adviser in the division of research and statistics, remarking on his relative youth in Fed years.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Good morning, everybody. I'd like to start by recognizing our colleague, Larry Slifman, who is at his last meeting before his planned retirement. Larry is still fairly junior, having been on the Board staff almost 42 years. [Laughter]

Mr. Bernanke adds a dash of mathematical humor.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE: He has attended 183 FOMC meetings over 30 years. At one day per meeting, that's almost exactly six months of FOMC meetings. [Laughter]

Later, Mr. Bernanke turns to Janet Yellen, vice chairwoman, for the nomination of someone to chair the FOMC meeting.

MS. YELLEN: I would like to move the nomination of Ben Bernanke as Chairman.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Second. Other nominations? Any objections? [No response] Thank you, once again. Avoiding primaries, I'm glad to say. [Laughter]

March 13

After a coffee break, the meeting recommences with comments from Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I'm especially grateful that you allowed my colleagues around the table a chance to get some coffee before listening to me. [Laughter] Useful input for them.

Later in the meeting, Fed governor Elizabeth Duke launches into a discussion on the psychology of the housing market.

MS. DUKE: ...Once prices seem to be rising, and buyers have lost out on homes that they had already imagined as theirs, they stop looking for bargains and focus on the house they really want. And to illustrate this, in case you think I'm overestimating that, I'm going to offer a final data point. Friday, I had lunch with Governor Yellen, who expressed that she might be interested in buying rather than renting. Over the weekend, while I was studying my Tealbook, Governor Yellen found a house she was interested in buying. On Monday at lunch, she told me all about how beneficial it would be for her to buy rather than to rent. And as we sat down for this round, she told me that she was considering making a higher offer because someone had come in and bid higher on her house.

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA: She must be worried that interest rates are going up. [Laughter]

MS. DUKE: Now, this is someone with a very informed forecast of economics.

MR. FISHER (Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas): It's like the Case-Shiller index we now have the "Yellen index." [Laughter]

April 24-25

John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, speaks about his staff's research on the declining labor-force participation rate and what it means for the economy. Economists, he recognizes, aren't the youngest folks.

MR. WILLIAMS: ... They found that about half of the recent participation drop came from aging workers, some of whom may be retiring early in the face of a bad job market. The remaining half came from abnormally high labor force withdrawals among two groups: youth; and adults between the ages of 25 and 54 I call them "the young." [Laughter]

June 19-20

The FOMC meets and announces plans to extend through the end of the year the Operation Twist program, which aims to drive down long-term interest rates by selling short-term securities and using the proceeds to buy longer-term securities. Mr. Bernanke also introduces two new Fed governors.

CHAIRMAN BERNANKE: Good morning. I would like to start by welcoming two new members to the table, Governor Jeremy Stein and Governor Jay Powell, sitting over here in the delinquents' corner. [Laughter]

Bernanke, who served as chairman of Princeton's economics department, continues the introduction.

 &.We welcome our two new distinguished colleagues and look forward to collaborating with them and learning from them. I am optimistic because I note that they both got their B.A.'s from Princeton University. [Laughter]

July 31-Aug. 1

At this meeting, the FOMC signals it is getting closer to launching a new round of stimulus. Some of the central bankers got creative with their economics metaphors. Take, for instance, this remark from Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard:

MR. BULLARD: Monetary and fiscal policies are like having a gorilla in your living room with your family hanging around. It's much better if the gorilla is not jumping up and down. [Laughter]

Or this remark from governor Elizabeth Duke:

MS. DUKE: I think yes. I feel like an Excel spreadsheet caught in a circular reference. [Laughter]

Sept. 12-13

The FOMC meets and announces the third round of quantitative easing. Despite the serious subject matter, there was still humor to be had, this time from Ms. Duke.

MS. DUKE: At some point, demographics win. Those kids now living at home with their parents will not stay there until they're 40. [Laughter] And when they do form households, they're going to require housing units, whether rental or owner occupied.

Oct. 23-24

At this meeting it is clear that Mr. Kocherlakota, a scholarly Ph.D. economist, knows his audience:

MR. KOCHERLAKOTA: Financial markets continue to exhibit levels of risk aversion that I would have to say are extraordinarily high. The 20-year real (Treasury inflation-protected securities) yield is essentially zero. This means that on the margin, investors do not see any investments better than giving up a unit of purchasing power today for a unit of purchasing power 20 years in the future. Now, as somebody who has spent much of my life teaching about the time value of money, I find this quite disheartening. [Laughter]

Of course, sometimes economists opt for sports humor in lieu of nerd humor. Take Mr. Williams:

MR. WILLIAMS: In my remaining comments, I am going to focus on the risks to the outlook. Of course, the number one risk to the U.S. economy is determined by the outcome of the World Series. [Laughter]

For whatever the macroeconomic impact was, the The San Francisco Giants won the 2012 World Series, sweeping the Detroit Tigers in four games.

Dec. 11-12

The FOMC meets and announces it will continue purchases of long-term Treasury securities it began under Operation Twist. The central bankers continue with their analogies.

MS. DUKE: There is an analogy I was going to use to a holiday movie, and I was a little embarrassed by it, but if (Dallas Fed) President (Richard) Fisher is willing to make his barnyard analogy [laughter], I'll move ahead with mine. In the movie It's a Wonderful Life, they keep saying that every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings. So to make a somewhat cheesy comparison, I think that every time home prices tick up a notch, a household pops above water on its mortgage and so regains its financial wings.

Fed's Harker: Two Rate Increases in 2018 Likely Appropriate

By Michael S. Derby

PHILADELPHIA Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said Friday he is expecting the U.S. central bank to raise rates fewer times in 2018 than it did the year before, adding that officials have time to take stock of the economy before moving again.

"My own view is that two rate increases are likely to be appropriate for 2018," Mr. Harker told a gathering of the American Economic Association in Philadelphia. After his speech, he told reporters, "for right now, given that we've just moved in December and are continuing to watch the balance sheet normalization, I think we can take some time" before boosting rates again. He noted whatever happens "all depends on how the data comes in."

Mr. Harker was a voting member of the interest rate setting Federal Open Market Committee in 2017, and he supported all of the three rate rises that year that left the central bank's overnight target rate range at 1.25% and 1.50%. He won't be a voter this year. Collectively, officials are considering around three increases for 2018.

Mr. Harker explained in his speech that he believes what lies ahead of the economy looks like a continuation of positive trends. He said he sees growth of just under 2.5%, and noted that when it comes to the job market, there is "very little slack left," with the jobless rate staying low throughout 2018 before increasing "a few tenths of a percentage point" in 2019.

Mr. Harker added that he believes job creation will slow to around 100,000 a month by the end of 2019. But he doesn't see that as problematic: "That's to be expected, and it's more than enough to keep pace with population growth."

On Friday, the government reported job gains of 148,000 in December, with a jobless rate of 4.1%. While slower than past months, "that is still a relatively good number," the official said.

On the price-pressure front, Mr. Harker said inflation that is below the Fed's 2% target will give way, saying "inflation will run a bit above target in 2019 and come down to target the following year." But he added, "if soft inflation persists, it may pose a significant problem."

Mr. Harker also said he is keeping an eye on the bond market. There, a narrowing in the normally positive difference between short- and long-dated securities is flashing a yellow sign about the outlook. So-called flat yield curves are often viewed as predicting a slower economy in the future, and inversions of the curve, where short-dated securities move above long-dated bonds, are associated with recessions.

Several Fed officials are anxious that Fed rate rises are themselves the primary driver of the yield-curve shift and have warned that if more increases come it could be the central bank itself that causes the next recession.

"Worries so far have been a little inflated," and it appears this so-called flattening of the yield curve is benign, the official said. "I think the removal of accommodation will help somewhat, and I don't think it warrants shouting 'fire' in a crowded theater," he said.

When it comes to recessions and inverted curves, "there is a correlation, but it's not clear the causality is there," he said. He told reporters after the speech that with slow and steady rate rises, "I don't think we should do anything that would precipitate any inversion of the yield curve

Mr. Harker said in his speech that changes in the economy that suggest a generally lower level of interest rates may give the Fed less space to conduct policy. Because of that, he, like some others on the Fed, believe it may be time to look at other ways to conduct monetary policy.

"I should be clear that I'm not pushing for any changes, nor do I have any particular change I would prefer," Mr. Harker said. But, "we need to be seriously considering the various alternatives whether it's inflation targeting, price-level targeting, or asymmetric loss functions and not fixating on one without serious academic debate about the others."

Fed's Mester Would Be Happy With 3 or 4 Rate Increases This Year--CNBC

By Nick Timiraos

For the last several years, markets have watched monthly employment reports for signs that job gains would be strong enough for the Federal Reserve to gently raise interest rates.

Now, after several rate increases and with unemployment at a 17-year low, Fed officials face the question of whether joblessness might fall so much that they should pick up the pace of tightening to prevent the economy from overheating.

The latest employment report released Friday by the Labor Department doesn't suggest they need to move more aggressively or slow down. Employers added 148,000 jobs in December, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.1%. Average hourly earnings of private-sector workers rose 2.5% from a year ago, in line with recent monthly readings.

While the pace of job growth was slightly below the monthly average of 171,000 jobs last year, a slower pace probably comforts Fed officials because unemployment has dropped below the level they believe is sustainable over the long run, around 4.6%.

So far, they haven't had to worry that unemployment is too low because inflation is running below their 2% target. Consumer prices, excluding food and energy items, rose 1.5% for the year ended November, according to the central bank's preferred gauge.

Fed officials want a tight labor market to push inflation up to 2%, which they see as a healthy level for an expanding economy, but don't want price pressures to surge out of control. Some worry if the economy gains too much momentum, they would have to raise rates more aggressively, which could derail the recovery.

Fed governor Jerome Powell, who is in line to succeed Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen next month, said in a speech last June that the continued strength of the labor market "might warrant a faster pace of tightening."

After holding their benchmark federal-funds rate near zero for seven years, Fed officials have raised it five times since late 2015, most recently in December, to a range between 1.25% and 1.5%. They also penciled in three quarter-percentage point rate increases in 2018 and two more moves in 2019.

The Fed is expected to leave rates unchanged at its next meeting, Jan. 30-31. Before the release of the employment report, the market for federal-funds futures contracts implied traders saw a 73% probability of a rate increase at the central bank's second meeting of the year, in March, according to CME Group.

Fed officials surely cheer signs the tight labor market is drawing people back to work. The share of adults aged 25 to 54 who are working rose to 79.1% in December, the highest level since July 2008, when the economy was contracting sharply. That is up from a recent low of 74.8% in November 2010, but still below the 80.1% high point reached during the mid-2000s expansion.

So far, strong hiring and stable growth hasn't translated into big gains in wages or prices, a function of weak productivity growth and possibly a greater level of slack in the labor market than many economists initially believed. Still, in several U.S. metro areas with very low unemployment rates, wages appear to be rising at a stronger clip as labor markets grow tighter.

While the Fed is likely to welcome a pickup in wage growth, such an upturn also would signal that the central bank is entering a delicate policy stage. If officials raise rates too slowly, the economy could overheat. If they move too aggressively, they could trigger a recession.

All of this is playing out in a moment when Washington has approved new tax cuts, which economists expect to boost U.S. growth over the coming two years. Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. last month lowered their forecast for the unemployment rate over the next two years due to the new stimulus. They now see it falling to 3.5% by year's end, and to 3.3% next year, which would be a level not seen since the early 1950s.

Analysis: Jobs Report Should Ease Fed Fears of Unemployment Falling Too Low

For the last several years, markets "https://www.wsj.com/articles/analysis-jobs-report-should-ease-fed-fears-about-unemployment-falling-too-low-1515164359" for signs that job gains would be strong enough for the Federal Reserve to gently raise interest rates. Now, after several rate increases and with unemployment at a 17-year low, Fed officials face the question of whether joblessness might fall so much that they should pick up the pace of tightening to prevent the economy from overheating. The latest employment report released Friday by the Labor Department doesn't suggest they need to move more aggressively or slow down. Employers added 148,000 jobs in December, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.1%. Average hourly earnings of private-sector workers rose 2.5% from a year ago, in line with recent monthly readings.

NY Fed Official Sees Space for Central Bank to Provide Money-Like Assets

By Michael S. Derby

A top Federal Reserve Bank of New York staffer said Saturday the U.S. central bank has a role providing "money-like assets" even outside of times of financial stress.

In a speech in Philadelphia before the American Economic Association, New York Fed executive vice president Simon Potter sought to take stock of the central bank's role in providing assets that aren't cash but are effectively seen as a substitute by financial market participants.

Mr. Potter said provision of these money-like assets is a Fed job when it is doing emergency lending during times of financial sector crisis. But that may not be the only time for the Fed to be active on that front.

"Central banks are uniquely able to produce money-like assets that are viewed as safe during non-normal times," Mr. Potter said in the text of a speech. "In more normal times, regulation and supervision are the best tools to mitigate risks from the private creation of money-like assets, but there is a role for the central bank to use its balance sheet to smooth fluctuations in the supply and demand for money-like assets."

Mr. Potter noted in the wake of the financial crisis and a strengthened regulatory regime, the financial sector may not be able to produce enough assets that function like money in rapidly changing market conditions. That opens a door for the Fed to help smooth over private market shortfalls.

Mr. Potter said this front is one where the Fed needs to tread carefully.

"Since investors are aware of the central bank's unique ability to quickly supply safe and money-like assets in non-normal times, their incentives to monitor risks in normal times may be reduced," he said. He added "the central bank needs to take care that its provision of money-like assets in normal times does not crowd out the private financial system or exacerbate run behavior in stressful times."

Economists Stick With Long View for Slower U.S. Growth Despite Recent Uptick

By Ben Leubsdorf

Updated Jan. 8, 2018 12:29 a.m. ET

U.S. economic growth picked up last year and that could continue into 2018 if tax cuts enacted into law last month spur business investment and consumer spending, as many forecasters expect.

But economists who study the long-run outlook many of whom were gathered this weekend for the annual meeting of the American Economic Association aren't budging much from their projections that output growth will remain far slower than its historical average in the years ahead.

The economy grew at a 3.1% annual pace in the second quarter and a 3.2% annual rate in the third quarter, according to the Commerce Department. That was well above the postrecession pace of near 2%.

The government will release official numbers for the fourth quarter on Jan. 26. Most see the economy again outperforming the expansion average, but perhaps not as much as in earlier months. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta estimates a 2.7% growth rate in the final three months of 2017, while forecasters at Macroeconomic Advisers project a 2.3% pace.

"This is not enough to establish a new trend, by any means," Harvard University economist Dale Jorgenson said.

It wouldn't be the first time in recent years that growth accelerated for a time before easing again; output grew at impressive annual rates of 4.6% and 5.2% in back-to-back quarters during 2014 before settling back into a subdued pace.

The tax-code changes enacted by Congress in December could boost growth for the next couple of years, Mr. Jorgenson said. That leaves the longer-term outlook "maybe a bit more optimistic than you were before we got two good quarters and the tax cut, but not in the range of 3%," Mr. Jorgenson said.

Taxes and the outlook were hot topics in icy Philadelphia this weekend during the AEA annual conference.

Kevin Hassett, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, noted during a Saturday presentation that professional forecasters have been revising up estimates for near-term U.S. growth, consistent with an improving outlook tied to lower taxes.

Other economists in Philadelphia were skeptical the tax cuts will produce a meaningful boost.

Historically, "tax cuts aimed at the top of the income distribution have had very little stimulus effect," said University of Chicago economist Austan Goolsbee, who had Mr. Hassett's job during the Obama administration.

Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Columbia Business School and former top White House economist under President George W. Bush, said the legislation isn't as worrisome as critics suggest, nor as positive as advocates claim. "It's not going to raise us off to 4% GDP growth," Mr. Hubbard said. "But it's not going to kill 10,000 people a year."

In the long run, economists believe the economy's maximum sustainable growth rate is determined by two forces: how many people are working, and how productive they are.

Annual growth in inflation-adjusted potential output averaged 3.2% between 1950 and 2016, according to estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. But many forecasters think those days are gone.

Demographics are set to hold down workforce participation as baby boomers retire. Meantime productivity growth in the U.S. has sagged since an information technology-fueled surge in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Tax cuts could spur productivity by incentivizing business investment in new equipment, but the effects are uncertain.

The CBO last summer estimated potential gross domestic product growth would average 1.8% over the ensuing decade. Estimates by Federal Reserve officials in December for longer-run GDP growth ranged from 1.7% to 2.2%, with a median projection of 1.8%. Private-sector economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal last month had an average longer-run GDP forecast of 2.2% a year.

To be sure, economists have been wrong about the shifting long-run outlook before. They largely failed to predict the productivity pickup in the 1990s and the subsequent slowdown last decade.

Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Erik Brynjolfsson said the current consensus about growth is too pessimistic, but not because of anything happening in Washington. Instead, he said the adoption of machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies will boost productivity and transform the economy, much as the adoption of electricity did in the past.

He thinks the U.S. is now seeing the early stages of a sustained pickup in economic growth.

"No doubt there'll be ups and downs, and I'm not someone who tries to predict quarterly growth," Mr. Brynjolfsson said. "But when I look at the longer trend, I'm optimistic."

Northwestern University economist Robert Gordon said the U.S. is due for a pickup of long-depressed productivity growth that will help the economy maintain growth around 3% a year but only for a year and a half, perhaps two years. He said that wouldn't change his thinking about the subdued underlying trend.

With the jobless rate at 4.1% in December, his thinking goes, the economy can't sustain above-trend growth indefinitely.

"That potential growth ceiling on growth will eventually start to bite as we run out of workers," Mr. Gordon said.

Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco economist John Fernald said at a panel in Philadelphia that the slower-than-usual recovery from the 2007-09 recession reflected broad trends that were under way before the downturn and may not dissipate.

"The headwinds to a substantial pickup in growth are fierce," he said.

Dallas Fed Paper Explores Relationship Between Demographics and Global Trade

Michael Sposi of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas analyzes how the "https://www.dallasfed.org/~/media/documents/institute/wpapers/2017/0332.pdf" has evolved across countries, quantifying how these differences affect the pattern of trade imbalances across countries. Mr. Sposi's paper notes that removing demographic-induced changes to saving shows a strong negative relationship between net exports and productivity growth. Demographics alleviate the allocation puzzle to a greater degree than investment distortions, Mr. Sposi's research suggests.

What Is Driving U.K. Borrowing?

The strong rise in U.K. consumer debt "https://bankunderground.co.uk/2018/01/08/whos-driving-consumer-credit-growth/", or people sidestepping tightened mortgage rules, according to an analysis by Ben Guttman-Kenney, Liam Kirwin and Sagar Shah at the Bank of England. However, borrowers do remain in debt for longer than previously realized, their research shows. "Credit growth not being disproportionately driven by subprime borrowers is reassuring," they conclude. "As is the lack of evidence that mortgage lending restrictions are pushing mortgagors towards taking on consumer credit. But vulnerabilities remain. Consumers remain indebted for longer than previously thought. And renters with squeezed finances may be an increasingly important (and vulnerable) driver of growth in consumer credit."

Finally, a Brighter Outlook for Wages

Wage growth has lagged in the economic expansion but an uptick in December and a tax-cut boost in January could change the trend, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/finally-a-brighter-outlook-for-wages-1515174344" The Wall Street Journal's Justin Lahart. "Average hourly earnings were up 2.5% in December versus a year earlier, hewing to a trend that has been in place for over two years. But December 2016 was a strong month, meaning last month needed to be strong to match that pace. On a monthly basis, hourly earnings gained 0.3% in December from a month earlier, on the high end of recent monthly gains. Wages increased just 0.1% in November."

Canada's unemployment rate "https://www.wsj.com/articles/canadas-jobless-rate-falls-in-december-to-four-decade-low-1515160812" in December and job creation exceeded expectations by a wide margin for a second straight month, likely increasing pressure on the Bank of Canada to raise interest rates in early 2018.

The U.S. trade gap "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-trade-gap-grew-3-2-in-november-1515159241" in November, driven by a surge in imports as upbeat American households stepped up purchases of cellphones, household items and other products.

The U.S. service sector "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-service-sector-activity-grew-more-slowly-in-december-1515165875" during the last two months of 2017, but still expanded at a healthy pace. The Institute for Supply Management on Friday said its nonmanufacturing index fell 1.5 percentage points to 55.9 in December 2017.

Many Investors Bailed Out Early

One of the biggest surprises of the U.S. stock market's relentless rally is how many individual investors have run away from it.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 25000 for the first time on Thursday, punctuating a record-setting period nearly unmatched in U.S. history. Yet throughout the nearly nine-year surge in share prices, small investors have continued to yank money out of funds that own U.S. stocks.

Nearly $1 trillion has been pulled from retail-investor mutual funds that target U.S. stocks since the start of 2012, according to EPFR Global, a fund-tracking firm.

Over that same period, the S&P 500 soared 116% and, along with the Dow Industrials and Nasdaq Composite Index, rose to 191 all-time highs.

Much of those outflows likely made their way back into the stock market through lower-cost exchange-traded funds. The EPFR Global figure excludes flows to ETFs and institutional mutual fund shares, and the firm estimates that perhaps as much as 40% of the mutual fund stock outflows were recycled into stocks through ETFs.

Even so, U.S. stock funds in aggregate have suffered outflows in each of the past three years, according to trade group Investment Company Institute, a sign of growing skepticism about the stock market's steep climb.

Nancy Langwiser-Kear, 60, of Wellesley, Mass., said the booming rally has made the stock market less attractive. She has been selling U.S. shares.

"This market over the past year has been a mix of hope and fantasy," she said. "There's no reason to be hanging out in stocks at the end of the bull market."

The S&P 500's 0.4% rise Thursday put the broader index over the top for its own milestone, making it the greatest bull market run by the index in the post-World War II era. The S&P has notched a more than 300% gain since the market surge began in March 2009, surpassing the tech-fueled-rally of the 1990s, according to the research firm Leuthold Group, which excluded dividends from its calculations.

Rather than celebrating this wealth-generating machine, some individual investors have made clear in multiple surveys just how little enthusiasm they have for this market.

For years, analysts have described an "unloved" or even "hated" stock rally, where prices defiantly rise despite one of the weakest U.S. economic recoveries on record, Washington's policy sclerosis and geopolitical flashpoints, from the Greek debt crisis and Brexit to North Korea's nuclear threat.

"It is the most disliked bull market of my career," said John Fox, chief investment officer at Fenimore Asset Management. "No one is excited. This is not like 1999 and 2000, where you went to a bar and CNBC was on TV."

Survey data indicate that American stock ownership is retreating.

Sixty-two percent of Americans reported owning equities, on average, between the fall of the dot-com bubble and the onset of the global financial crisis, between 2001 and 2008, according to a Gallup survey from early 2017. That number shrunk to 54% during the current bull market, from 2009 to 2017.

Declining stock ownership was consistent across education level, employment status, gender, ethnicity and U.S. region, the Gallup poll found.

This mistrust of stocks has led many individual investors to seek safety in the bond market, despite rock-bottom interest rates and an even longer rally that in many ways looks more stretched than stock valuations.

More than $950 billion has moved into all bond mutual and exchange-traded funds since 2012, ICI said.

The Wall Street Journal polled more than 150 individual investors, of various ages and income levels across the U.S., about why they have avoided stocks.

Together, their responses paint a picture of how America's vaunted stockholding culture has waned -- not during a punishing selloff but amid one of the best periods ever to own shares.

Shawn Goodspeed, 33, said he dipped his toes into investing shortly after college. After taking advice from CNBC, he said he invested small sums in bank stocks in 2007 and 2008 -- and watched his small investment shrink during the ensuing crisis.

"It was a good learning experience," he said. "Now I'll invest only in things I understand."

Surveys show that stock ownership is down among middle-aged investors who still feel the aftershocks of stock-market collapses following the dot-com boom and during the financial crisis.

"So when the markets rebounded . . . there was a segment of the population that was very hesitant to get back in," said Steven Wagner, chief executive of advisory firm Omnia Family Wealth in Aventura, Fla.

"People are always shaped by their recent experiences, and much more so by the negative ones," he said.

As baby boomers near retirement age, many are paring back positions in riskier equity funds for more stable holdings such as bonds.

"I'm 10 years from retirement, so I'm being more cautious," said Jeffrey Lee Schantz, a 58-year-old architect in Boston, who has put what he considers to be his nest egg into "very conservative investments," including fixed-income funds.

Many younger Americans, who started accumulating income only after the housing bust and financial crisis, never developed an affinity for stocks.

"I've always been wary of losing my money on a badly timed purchase or sale of a stock, but now I'd rather not risk losing what little money I have on a misreading of the market," said Michelle Morley, a 26-year-old model.

Stocks are less part of the social fabric than during the 1990s bull run.

Discount online brokers such as E-Trade Financial Corp. and what is now TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. sprung up to meet booming demand of day traders who hoped to strike it rich on the next hot stock.

In one of the most extreme expressions of stock mania, doctors and other health professionals quit their jobs to day-trade full-time.

Today, discount brokers are thriving again after a long slump. But this time their business caters to registered investment advisers who trade primarily on behalf the affluent elite.

College students and other millennials, meanwhile, have found other ways to speculate than buying the latest tech stock.

Nate Reutiman, a 20-year-old Boston College student studying marketing and analytics, said he is more interested in cryptocurrencies. Last year, Mr. Reutiman and his roommates discussed contributing $1,000 each to install a mining rig, a system of computers built to find bitcoins, in their dormitory room.

For some Americans, their lack of interest in the stock market reflects a lack of disposable income, following a period of stagnant wages and mounting student debt that has more than doubled over the past decade.

"My money is spent servicing student loans," said Marcus Wallace, a 25-year-old waiter in Washington, D.C. Until that debt is reduced, he explained, the great stock market bull run will have to go on without him.

Funds and Other

Big Buyers Step Up

U.S. stocks have kept climbing even as many individual investors have stayed away, thanks to robust demand from other types of big buyers.

Institutional investors have been steady participants throughout the rally, ensuring that many individuals could at least partake in the market's big gains through retirement accounts. Many state-owned government funds have tilted toward U.S. stocks, and more recently foreign investors turned from sellers to buyers of the U.S. market.

The most dedicated buyer of U.S. shares has been the companies themselves. Stock buybacks started ramping up in 2009, hitting a record of $572 billion in 2015, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. With the new tax law cutting the corporate rate to 21% from 35%, analysts expect companies will use at least some of that cash to buy back more of their own shares.

Some individuals lost their nerve as share prices galloped higher. Nancy Langwiser-Kear, 60, in Wellesley, Mass., says the booming rally has made the stock market less attractive than a few years ago.

That may bode well for the stock market in 2018, but there is scant evidence it is doing anything to revive what once was a thriving U.S. equity culture.

Stocks are less part of the social fabric than in the 1990s and, to a lesser degree, during the years leading up to the financial crisis. Discount online brokers such as E-Trade Financial Corp. and what is now TD Ameritrade Holding Corp. sprung up to meet the booming demand of an army of 20- and 30-something day traders who hoped to strike it rich on the next hot stock.

Near the peak of the tech craze, customers at barber shops swapped tips on tech stocks as they received their trims, and mom-and-pop investors purchased pricey courses from companies like TeachMeToTrade.com in the hopes of turning a hobby into a career.

Buyouts

Blue Point Capital Partners, Cleveland

Lower midmarket investor Blue Point Capital Partners is aiming to raise $600 million for Blue Point Capital Partners IV LP and a related vehicle, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm also filed to raise $25 million for Blue Point Capital Partners IV Executive Fund LP, according to a separate SEC document. Blue Point didn't record any capital commitments to the vehicles in the filings. The firm's third buyout fund closed at $425 million in 2014. Blue Point typically invests in the manufacturing, business-services, consumer and distribution sectors, aiming to back companies with $20 million to $200 million in annual revenue and more than $5 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Brookfield Asset Management Inc., Toronto

Real asset manager Brookfield Asset Management Inc. plans to return to market to raise a new global private-equity fund at the start of 2018. Brookfield aims to collect $8 billion to $10 billion for the fund, more than twice the amount it gathered for Brookfield Capital Partners IV LP, said a person familiar with the matter. That vehicle closed on $4 billion in 2016. Brookfield's private-equity business contains a fraction of its overall assets, which largely comprise real assets such as real estate and energy holdings. The firm's private-equity strategy focuses on companies that complement its real assets businesses, though it also invests in financial services and recently has put capital toward nonperforming loans.

Capital Partners, Norwalk, Conn.

Capital Partners closed its third fund at the vehicle's hard cap with $600 million in commitments. The firm will make control investments from Capital Partners Private Equity Income Fund III LP in small and midsize businesses in the manufacturing, distribution and services industries. Capital Partners aims to finance acquisitions from the fund primarily with equity and "only low-to-moderate levels of outside debt," according to a news release.

Clarion Capital Partners, New York

Clarion Capital Partners closed its third fund with commitments of $427 million, slightly above an initial $425 million hard cap. Clarion Investors III LP was targeting $350 million. Investors in the fund include the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association, according to a pension document. Clarion was seeking $300 million for Clarion Investors II LP, according to a 2013 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The filing indicates the firm had raised at least $142.6 million for the vehicle, although it isn't clear on what amount the fund ultimately closed. Clarion aims to invest in lower midmarket companies in the business-services; health-care services; consumer and retail; media, entertainment and technology; and financial-services sectors. The firm typically deploys $15 million to $50 million of equity in businesses generating $7.5 million to $25 million of annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization.

Denham Capital Management, Boston

Denham Capital Management aims to raise its first fund dedicated solely to the mining sector, according to a document from the Pennsylvania Public School Employees' Retirement System. The fund, Denham Mining Fund LP, is targeting $750 million to invest in mining assets, according to the PSERS document. The fund had a $200 million first closing in April and expects to have a final closing in March 2018, according to a document from Hamilton Lane, the pension's consultant. Hamilton Lane recommended PSERS make a $150 million commitment to the fund, which will look to invest in early-stage mining assets, improve them, bring them into production and then exit, according to the PSERS document. The vehicle will invest mostly in base metals, along with metallurgical coal and specialty industrial metals, and will probably make seven to eight investments of $25 million to $150 million each, Hamilton Lane said in a letter to PSERS. Denham focuses on the oil-and-gas and power markets in addition to the mining sector. The firm in 2016 closed its first stand-alone oil-and-gas fund at $900 million, according to the pension document.

EnCap Investments, Houston

EnCap Investments raised $7 billion for one of the biggest energy-focused private-equity funds amassed in 2017. The fund, EnCap Energy Capital Fund XI LP, follows a $6.5 billion predecessor closed in 2015. The new fund enables EnCap to finance capital-intensive investments in the oil-and-gas exploration and production industry. Among the regions the firm will continue to favor are the Permian Basin and the Scoop and Stack plays of Oklahoma. The firm's EnCap Flatrock Midstream affiliate also has collected more than half of the $3.25 billion it is targeting for its latest fund. EnCap Flatrock collected at least $2.22 billion so far for EnCap Flatrock Midstream Fund IV LP and associated pools, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. EnCap Flatrock held a first closing for the pool of capital in mid-November on $2.22 billion and expects to hold a final closing on the fund in January, said a person familiar with the matter. EnCap Flatrock hadn't announced a final closing for the vehicle as of press time. The EnCap affiliate typically backs management teams that have experience in the North American midstream oil-and-gas sector acquiring and developing assets, including pipelines and systems to gather, store and process the fluids produced from wells. For its latest fund, EnCap Flatrock secured commitments from institutional investors including the Orange County Employees Retirement System, Teachers' Retirement System of Louisiana and San Antonio Fire and Police Pension Fund, according to board meeting minutes. Its previous fund close in 2014 at $3 billion.

Francisco Partners, San Francisco

Francisco Partners closed on nearly $3.98 billion for its newest fund, giving the private-equity firm its largest pool of capital yet for technology deals. The sum raised for Francisco Partners V LP is more than $1 billion larger than Francisco Partners' previous fund, which closed at almost $2.88 billion in 2015. The firm typically invests in midmarket and lower midmarket companies. In 2016, Francisco Partners closed a $600 million fund, Francisco Partners Agility LP, to target technology deals too small for its main funds. Investors in the new multibillion-dollar fund include the Oregon Investment Council and Nebraska Investment Council, according to pension documents.

Frontier Capital, Charlotte, N.C.

Frontier Capital amassed $700 million for its newest fund. The firm exceeded an initial $500 million target for Frontier Fund V. Richard Maclean, a managing partner and co-founder of the firm, said the larger pool of capital isn't likely to change the firm's investment strategy of targeting lower midmarket software and technology-enabled business-services companies. He said Frontier expects to make a few more investments from the fifth fund than from its previous vehicle. That fund closed with $390 million in 2015. Fund IV made 10 investments, and the latest vehicle likely will back 11 to 12 companies, Mr. Maclean added. With the new capital, Frontier will deploy $15 million to $75 million in businesses with enterprise values of less than $100 million, he said.

GI Partners, San Francisco

Midmarket investor GI Partners held a final closing for GI Partners Fund V LP, exceeding the fund's $2.3 billion target and reaching its $2.7 billion hard cap. The new pool of capital is larger than its predecessor, which closed in 2014 at $2 billion. GI's latest fund primarily will target businesses with enterprise values of $250 million to $1 billion in sectors such as information-technology infrastructure, health care, software and services.

HCI Equity Partners, Washington

HCI Equity Partners closed its latest fund, HCI Equity Partners V LP, above a $400 million target. With the new pool of capital, the firm is aiming to make controlling investments in lower midmarket North American companies focused on industrial products and services.

Kimmeridge Energy, New York

Kimmeridge Energy, a firm that focuses on the upstream oil-and-gas sector, gathered $650 million to acquire and develop assets in shale fields throughout the U.S. The private-equity manager closed its fourth fund, Kimmeridge Energy Fund IV, at its $400 million hard cap. Kimmeridge has rounded up an additional $250 million in the form of co-investment pledges. In addition to its latest pool of capital, the firm in 2017 raised $350 million for a mineral fund focused on the Permian Basin of West Texas and southern New Mexico. In total, Kimmeridge has collected about $1.7 billion since its founding. The firm has fully exited its third fund which gathered $200 million alongside co-investment commitments of $135 million in 2016 and most of its second and first vehicles, said a person familiar with the matter.

KKR & Co., New York

KKR & Co. raised $1.45 billion for its first fund focused exclusively on small health-care companies. The firm itself is contributing $265 million to the KKR Health Care Strategic Growth Fund through a combination of its own balance sheet and employee commitments. Ali Satvat, KKR member and head of KKR Health Care Strategic Growth, said the new fund plans to address a "gap in the marketplace" for growth-stage companies that are too large for early-stage investors but not mature enough to be acquired or taken public.

Leavitt Equity Partners, Salt Lake City

Health care-focused investor Leavitt Equity Partners is aiming to collect $125 million for Leavitt Equity Partners II LP, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm is an affiliate of Leavitt Partners, a health care-focused information provider and consulting business founded by Mike Leavitt, a cabinet member for former President George W. Bush who was administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. Leavitt Equity was founded in 2014 to take minority stakes in growth-stage and lower midmarket companies, sometimes alongside other private-equity funds, according to a person with knowledge of the firm. Leavitt Equity's first fund gathered $100 million, the person added.

Lightyear Capital, New York

A filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission states Lightyear made a $28.5 million general-partner commitment to the new fund and that the firm has a total of $1.03 billion to invest between Fund IV and a related co-investment vehicle. Investors in the new fund include the New Mexico State Investment Council, New Mexico Educational Retirement Board and Los Angeles Fire & Police Pensions, according to pension documents. Lightyear invests in midmarket financial-services companies such as banks, brokerages, insurance companies, asset managers and financial-technology businesses.

Its credit arm invests in securities such as leveraged loans and collateralized loan obligations.

Peak Rock Capital, Austin, Texas

Midmarket firm Peak Rock Capital is nearing the fundraising goals for a set of new investment vehicles, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The firm so far has collected at least $1.18 billion for funds including Peak Rock Capital Fund II LP and Peak Rock Capital Credit Fund II LP, according to the filings. Fund II and a parallel vehicle have gathered at least $900.3 million so far toward a $960 million goal; the credit fund and a parallel vehicle have gathered at least $225.1 million toward a $240 million goal.

Finnish firm CapMan raised  86 million ($101.2 million) for its maiden growth fund, which initially will manage six businesses owned by Norvestia Oyj, an asset manager the firm acquired in 2016. The new strategy was born out of CapMan's acquisition of the Nordic asset manager in late 2016. CapMan is transferring six of Norvestia's existing investments into the new vehicle, Juha Mikkola, managing partner of CapMan Growth Equity, wrote in an email. The new fund aims to make minority investments worth  2 million to  10 million in entrepreneur-led companies that have strong growth potential but have passed "the startup phase," according to a news release.

U.S. Private Sector Adds 250,000 Jobs in December; Businesses hired to keep up with holiday demand

Hiring at private U.S. employers grew more than expected in December, according to a report, as the busy holiday shopping season prompted businesses to hire in order to keep up with demand.

Firms across the country added 250,000 workers to their ranks in December, according to payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody's Analytics.

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected the addition of 195,000 jobs.

The November total was revised down to 185,000 from 190,000.

The ADP report is based on private-payroll data in addition to government data.

"Robust Christmas sales prompted retailers and delivery services to add to their payrolls," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's Analytics.

"We've seen yet another month where the labor market has shown no signs of slowing," vice president and co-head of ADP Research Institute Ahu Yildirmaz.

Growth was driven by small businesses which added more than double their monthly average for the past six months.

The ADP report comes ahead of the monthly jobs report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday. The BLS report is expected to show slower growth in employment in December compared to the strong gains seen in November. Economists expect nonfarm jobs to rise by 180,000 for December, compared with 228,000 the prior month.

Management: CEOs Gird for a Year of Disruption --- Cybersecurity risks, emerging technologies and talent battles add to pressure on leaders

Corporate leaders see cybersecurity threats, disruptive technologies and stiffer competition for talent as some of their most pressing issues in the new year, according to interviews with nearly a dozen chief executives.

"I don't think there's any such thing as an easy year for CEOs anymore," said Jim Loree, who just completed his first full year in the top job at Stanley Black & Decker Inc.

The growing pressures coincide with a changing of the guard in the corner office, creating one of the largest legions of new leaders in years to tackle those tough tasks.

Last year, 919 CEOs resigned, retired or were fired at publicly traded North American companies, the most in at least a decade, according to Liberum Research.

The feverish pace of turnover claimed some of the biggest names at U.S. corporations, including the leaders of Equifax Inc., General Electric Co., Ford Motor Co., Caterpillar Inc., Arconic Inc., Macy's Inc. and Mondelez International Inc. And on Dec. 31, Papa John's International Inc. founder John Schnatter stepped down as CEO.

Departures of company chiefs continue in the new year. On Tuesday, Rent-A-Center Inc. said founder Mark Speese had stepped down from its top spot.

Under increased investor pressure, directors are making broad demands of their chiefs, some leadership specialists say. "The expectations that boards have of CEOs is that they can do everything," said Hugh Shields, co-founder and principal at Shields Meneley Partners LLC, a career-transition and leadership-coaching firm for senior executives. "In some cases, they are looking for a unicorn."

The threat of data breaches poses a critical risk, said Mr. Loree and several other chief executives. "These bad actors keep getting smarter and more aggressive," Mr. Loree said. "It's an ongoing war."

Stanley Black & Decker, which makes power and hand tools, recruited Mark Maybury as its first chief technology officer in November. He is a cybersecurity specialist with a doctoral degree in artificial intelligence. Dr. Maybury's duties include overseeing cybersecurity, Mr. Loree said.

About 64% of 1,031 human-resources professionals believe data security and the threat of a cyberbreach will become a very challenging or extremely challenging issue in 2018, according to a survey by XpertHR, an online provider of compliance guidance.

Another challenge in the new year will be anticipating how emerging technologies open new markets or upend their industries, company leaders say. Julio Portalatin, president and CEO of Mercer Consulting, a unit of professional-services firm Marsh & McLennan Cos., said that high on his priority list is guarding against unforeseen, nimble rivals that could harness automation and artificial intelligence to poach customers in niche markets. "It's the [rivals] I don't know about that I'm concerned about," he said.

To gird Mercer's business against such attacks, Mr. Portalatin said Mercer formed a business this summer focused on helping employers use data analytics and other new technologies to recruit and manage employees and assist their workforces in adapting to a more digital economy.

New technologies are disrupting the war for top talent, said Mike Cannon-Brookes, co-founder and co-CEO of Atlassian Corp., which has headquarters in Sydney and San Francisco. The maker of workplace software tools no longer solely competes with other tech firms for staffers. In their quest to build highly sophisticated technology platforms, some financial-services companies now have more software engineers than bankers and traders on their payrolls, Mr. Cannon-Brookes said.

To fill more than 200 positions currently open at the 2,300-employee company, Atlassian is looking to hire people across four continents.

The imminent drop in U.S. corporate tax rates might intensify political pressure on chief executives to expand their U.S. workforces, some business leaders say.

Polaris Industries Inc., a producer of snowmobiles, motorcycles and all-terrain vehicles, expects to hire nearly 100 engineers world-wide in 2018 and most will work in the U.S., said CEO Scott Wine. The company already employs nearly 900 U.S. engineers.

"With the additional money from tax reform, we can invest a bit more in our best [research] programs," Mr. Wine said. Those engineering projects typically generate a new technology, engine or vehicle.

The Polaris chief expects to spend about $260 million on research and development this year, compared with just under $240 million for 2017.

Despite widespread revelations of workplace misconduct that toppled numerous powerful executives in 2017, most CEOs don't rank sexual harassment among their top concerns for 2018.

One exception is Anil Chakravarthy, head of software maker Informatica LLC. The recent scandals have prompted "an extensive look at our code of conduct [and] what protections we have for whistleblowers," Mr. Chakravarthy said.

Sexual harassment "is not an issue for us today," he said. "But I don't want it to be."

Quartet Health Raises $40 Million to Improve Mental Health Care Access; F-Prime Capital executive partner joins the board

New York-based Quartet Health Inc., which makes software to coordinate care between primary physicians and mental health care providers, has raised a $40 million Series C round.

F-Prime Capital led the round with Polaris Partners. Existing investors GV and Oak HC/FT also contributed, along with first-time investor Deerfield Management. The latest financing brings the company's total raised to date to $87 million.

Founded in 2014, Quartet Health develops cloud-based software that uses insurance claim data and patient data from electronic medical records to identify individuals whose chronic physical condition may be exacerbated by a mental health condition. The Quartet platform provides a means of connecting patients with behavioral health specialists, who then keep in close collaboration with the patient's primary care physician to improve treatment decision-making for both parties.

Quartet works with insurance companies Humana Inc. and Blue Cross Blue Shield as well as Northern California's provider network Sutter Health. Along with the funding, the company also announced its launch in New Jersey, marking the company's sixth major market and first statewide expansion.

F-Prime Capital executive partner Carl Byers, who has invested in each of the company's previous rounds and will take a board seat with this round, said Quartet enables a new model of holistic care. Where a primary care doctor may have previously been limited to just giving a patient a reference, they can instead work with Quartet to be more informed about all aspects of a patient's health and learn how their mental health condition and care is affecting their physical treatment.

"The workflow in health care has been historically very messy, and most providers have thought of behavioral health as this black box where you either try to do it yourself or you just avoid it," said Mr. Byers. "The result is patients who aren't treated effectively and insurance paying way too much."

The company plans to use the funding to expand the capabilities of its software, particularly by scaling its machine learning team, and it will also continue to build out its behavioral health provider network.

Quartet also brought on former Anthem Inc. Executive Vice President Ken Goulet and former Rackspace US Inc. Chief Executive Lanham Napier as new board members.
