Mike Lynch, the founder of UK software group Autonomy, has unveiled the latest investment from his $1 billion technology fund, forging ahead with new deals despite investigations into the sale of his former business, writes Murad Ahmed.

Invoke Capital is leading a $13.75 million investment in Sophia Genetics, a Swiss healthcare company that uses big data to predict and diagnose genetic diseases. Other investors in the round include Swisscom, the media group and Endeavour Vision, a Swiss venture capital firm.

Sophia Genetics will now work with Genalys, a British big data start-up within Invoke's portfolio, to develop a mathematical approach to healthcare that can provide an early diagnosis for patients and optimised treatment of cancer and genetic diseases.

Mike Lynch, the founder of UK software group Autonomy, has revealed the latest investment from his $1bn technology fund as he forges ahead with deals despite investigations into the sale of his former business.

Invoke Capital is leading a $13.75m investment in Sophia Genetics, a Swiss genetics company. Other investors in the round include Swisscom, the media group, and Endeavour Vision, a Swiss venture capital firm.

The investment is Invoke's first entry into healthcare, which Mr Lynch believes is ripe for disruption by technology groups that can utilise big data.

Sophia Genetics will work with Genalys, a British big data start-up within Invoke's portfolio, to develop a mathematical approach to medicine that can predict problems with a person's health. It works with hospitals and researchers, helping to provide an early diagnosis for patients and optimised treatment of cancer and genetic diseases.

"It's a bit like playing poker when you can see the other guy's hand," said Mr Lynch. "There is no doubt this is the beginning of personalised medicine which will be a revolution in healthcare."

He said the fund is likely to pursue other similar investments. Mr Lynch said he considered 40 genetics companies before settling on Sophia Genetics, believing the group had the greatest chance of making an impact on "an industrial scale".

Invoke seeks to fund young companies involved in "deep technologies" that give them a clear advantage over rivals in their industry. Previous investments include two Cambridge-based start-ups, Darktrace, a Cambridge-based cyber security company and Neurence, an augmented reality platform.

Mr Lynch remains in the crosshairs of Hewlett-Packard's legal team over Autonomy, which HP acquired for $11bn in 2011. The Silicon Valley company last week said it would continue to press claims against him and Sushovan Hussain, Autonomy's former chief financial officer, over alleged fraud related to acquisition.

HP last week settled shareholder lawsuits over the $8.8bn writedown it subsequently took on the value of Autonomy. It claims that some $5bn of the writedown was due to misrepresentations by former Autonomy executives about the state of the business. Autonomy's management team have always denied any wrongdoing.

Mr Lynch said the issues with HP had not affected his work with Invoke, and had not put start-ups off making deals with Invoke.

"We raised a billion dollars in four weeks, which is much faster than some of the more established funds," said Mr Lynch. "Other than hurling bricks at each other in the press, there is no litigation [with HP]. There's not actually that much of a distraction."

WSJ 125 (A Special Report): Finance --- In Banking, the Big Will Get Bigger: James P. Gorman expects most bank branches to disappear, and cash to become a museum piece

By James P. Gorman

The threshold question: Will banks continue to exist? The answer is yes, because society will still need the two essential functions they provide: mobilization of capital from providers to users, and facilitation of payments for goods and services.

But technology, globalization and demographics will change the shape of banking as dramatically in the next 100 years as they have in the last.

In particular, technology will continue to breed competition and disintermediation. Traditional consumer banking will come under extreme pressure as its central deposit-taking and lending functions are challenged by online savings vehicles, crowdfunding and loan syndicating by such nontraditional competitors as insurance companies, pension and hedge funds.

Universal adoption of mobile devices puts a bank branch in everyone's pocket and renders bricks and mortar obsolete. Of the 97,000 bank branches that exist across the U.S. today, all but about 10,000 will disappear. Those remaining will become social gathering places where people go to be educated about finance, engage in discussion groups about savings and investment and, at the high end, get exclusive exposure to luxury goods and services.

At the same time, ample opportunities will continue to exist for big global banks in providing large-scale finance for corporations, institutions and governments. Inexorable consolidation will make the big banks even bigger. Economies of scale and the boundary-less nature of electronic technology will doom most small institutions, though some may survive under protectionist regulation or niche strategies.

Regulation will become ever more globally harmonized. A century ago, the Federal Reserve had just been created, and U.S. banking regulation was largely state-level. Increases in global trade flows have fueled a harmonization process that began in 1944 at Bretton Woods and continued through the Basel Accords of today. Nationalism in financial regulation will not go away entirely, but the reality of economic interconnectedness will tip the scales in favor of a global regulatory architecture.

In the capital markets, state ownership will decrease as developing nations become developed and privatize productive enterprises, and as industrial sectors continue their cycles of creative destruction. This bodes well for continuing vital, if volatile, global equity markets.

Asset management will become the single-largest segment of financial services, as users of capital become providers of capital in newly developed economies and an aging global demographic creates an inevitable shift from consumers to savers. A burgeoning global middle class will create an enormous pool of savings in search of investment, for which they will seek professional advice and execution.

While this new investor class will expect adequate financial returns, they increasingly will demand, too, that their capital generates a positive social return. Many also will value human relationships with financial advisers, even if they conduct their meetings across continents or oceans via digital video-conferencing.

Underfunded defined-benefit and government pension plans will finally have to be dealt with, and reforms will push more people into private investment programs, further propelling asset management. Too much money chases too few returns, potentially setting the stage for the next "100-year" global financial crisis.

Technology, of course, holds both promise and threats. Big-data applications dramatically enhance institutions' ability to reduce loan losses and identify financial fraud through margin calls and detection of suspicious fund flows in real time. As powerful as these tools are, determined cybercriminals will find ways to steal so much they will force nations to establish deposit-insurance-like entities extending beyond traditional banks to cover theft.

Cash as a physical entity will virtually cease to exist, with coins and checkbooks consigned to museums. As people conduct their financial transactions on hand-held devices made secure by advanced biometrics, even tipping will be done electronically.

Paper currency does not disappear entirely, however. You'll still need it to buy a beer at a certain dusty bar in the Australian outback, where the proprietor sticks stubbornly to a cash-only policy, "because you never know, mate!"

Investing in Funds & ETFs: A Quarterly Analysis --- The Experts: Insights From Our Online Panel

It's so tempting: investing in the mutual fund currently atop the performance charts. That ranking is the best evidence there is that this is a money-winning choice. Except, of course, it isn't. There are any number of reasons why it isn't that simple. Here are just a few from The Experts, an exclusive online panel of industry and thought leaders who comment on topics raised in the Investing in Funds & ETFs report. Edited excerpts of their comments follow. To read more, go to WSJ.com/WealthReport.

How Should Potential Investors Evaluate a Top-Performing Fund?

Why Top Performers Rarely Stay So

S&PDow Jones Indices performs a study twice each year that looks at the extent to which top-performing funds continue to be top-performing funds. The study consistently shows that very few funds are able to stay on top. For example, among domestic stock funds that were in the top quartile of performance as of September 2011, 7.23% were in the top quartile of performance for the following two years. In the previous edition of the study, it was only 4.69%. If results were purely random, we would expect 6.25% of the funds to be top-quartile performers over the next two years.

-- Mike Piper, personal-finance blogger, author

Find Out the Back Story

Dig deeper to understand what is behind short-term high performance. Did the fund change strategy or manager? Did it take a contrarian approach or a big bet that paid off? Did a handful of holdings contribute to the majority of the performance? Is the approach the fund took sustainable? Has the fund had similar above-average performance in previous periods? How did it perform relative to its peers in the sector? Did a rising tide raise all boats in the sector?

-- Frank Holmes, chief executive and chief investment officer, U.S. Global Investors Inc.

Don't Chase Transitory Performance

Ask whether the past year is representative of the fund's performance over a longer period against the appropriate benchmark. Being a top performer for one year may be a matter of luck.

Another question you should ask is whether the style box or sector the fund represents is the "flavor of the year." Certainly, biotechnology was hot in 2013. But so far in 2014, not as much.

To avoid chasing performance, you need to ask yourself if you have an analytic framework that you apply to the funds you choose in order to remove emotion (such as feelings of regret or missing out) as much as possible from the decision-making process. Note: Read the fund's prospectus before any fund purchase.

-- Michelle Perry Higgins, financial planner and principal, California Financial Advisors

Why You Should Avoid Today's Hot Funds

Perhaps you should not ask any questions and just pass on it. Short-term performance records are meaningless. All hot funds eventually turn cold. Investing in the top performer over the past year is dangerous as there is an excellent chance the fund will not repeat and may end up in the bottom 10 instead. I personally only look at Top Performer lists to entertain myself.

-- George Papadopoulos is a fee-only wealth manager in Novi, Mich.

What Is Your Advice About Socially Responsible Investing?

Be Careful of the 'Robo' Funds

While there are some very reputable and high-quality providers of socially responsible funds (Calvert Investments, Acumen), there are also a wide range of high-price robo funds that slap on an "SRI" label to appeal to people with good intentions (and often limited financial knowledge). Such funds charge higher-than-average fees (justified by the excess research required) yet simply use computer databases to measure percentages of revenues or profits derived by certain offending lines of business rather than look at the company as a whole from a fundamental, qualitative standpoint.

-- Manisha Thakor, founder and chief executive, MoneyZen Wealth Management LLC

An Alternative to SRI Mutual Funds

For some socially responsible investors, mutual funds will not allow them to invest all of their money in accordance with their personal values. To provide the most flexibility one would need to develop a portfolio of individual stocks and bonds. Motif Investing provides a very interesting and low-cost way to invest and manage your personal portfolio of stocks and ETFs. Motif also provides access to some SRI portfolios. If you select one of these portfolios but want to make changes to the underlying holdings before you make a purchase, you can do so.

-- Sheryl Garrett, founder, Garrett Planning Network Inc.

Key Points to Consider About SRI

Decide if you want some or all of your portfolio to be invested in socially responsible funds. If you decide to use only socially responsible funds, it may be difficult to diversify to the same extent as you could with traditional funds.

Review the fund manager's screening criteria and restrictions. Specifically, what kinds of companies does the fund exclude? Do the criteria align with the specific values that caused you to be interested in socially responsible investing?

Be prepared for periods when the fund you choose may underperform traditional funds in the same sector or style box.

-- Michelle Perry Higgins

Beware of the Fees

I love socially responsible funds, but far too many are saddled with absurd fees, charging 1% or even more for S&P 500-like exposure. You'll probably have more positive impact by investing in low-cost funds and donating the money you save to good causes.

There's no reason in today's era of big data that SRI funds should be so costly. You can find cheap ones if you look.

-- Matt Hougan, president, ETF.com

Should Investors Watch Stock-Fund And Bond-Fund Money Flows?

What Flows Tell You About the Market

When more dollars start to flow into a market than flow out, or vice versa, it can be a leading indicator worth watching because it signals a change in confidence. The majority of money in the market is controlled by institutional investors. When the "smart money" starts to move, it is typically based on in-depth economic study and front-line observations. When fund flows reach extreme heights or depths, this could be a sign of irrational exuberance or pessimism, and a signal to turn contrarian.

-- Frank Holmes

Why Fund Flows Matter

Mutual funds that tend to perform well will draw greater net inflow of assets and those that perform less well will draw greater outflow of assets. Depending on the size of the mutual fund, it may become more difficult for the existing manager to sustain performance if fund flows are abnormal on either side of the equation. It will be difficult for a fund manager to stay fully invested if investors are constantly requesting redemptions.

-- Ted Jenkin, blogger, co-CEO and founder, oXYGen Financial, blogger, co-CEO and founder,

Factors to Ignore When Picking a Fund

There are some things about investing that should not be a focus of your attention. Two of them are 1) past performance and 2) flows of money into funds. There is little if any persistence in mutual-fund returns. Often the "winners" in one year are the losers in the next. Also, the flows of money into equity mutual funds are a notoriously poor signal for you to follow suit. Indeed, investors are more likely to put money into equities at or near market tops and to take money out at or near the bottoms.

-- Burton G. Malkiel, professor of economics emeritus, senior economist, Princeton University, author of "A Random Walk Down Wall Street"

How Fund Flows Trip Up Investors

Each Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute publishes information showing how much cash is flowing into and out of equity, bond and hybrid funds. The long-term data clearly shows a pattern of buying high and selling low. This is a costly mistake and one that every individual investor should be careful to not replicate. Beyond the insight into investor sentiment and mistakes, fund flow information is not useful to individual investors. If it tempts a person to alter his allocation, it could be dangerous. The average individual investor would do well to either ignore it or simply treat it as market trivia.

-- Charles Rotblut, vice president, American Association of Individual Investors, vice president,

FT REPORT - GREECE
Crisis forces rethink as entrepreneurs win funds for their ventures; Technology start-ups

IT experts are using the home market as a springboard for global success, writes Kerin Hope

With the jobless rate among young graduates approaching 40 per cent, the incentive for skilled Greeks to travel abroad to find work is strong.

Yet several hundred young entrepreneurs are testing their abilities by founding technology start-ups at home.

Until the crisis struck, Greece had few aspirations to become an internet hub, even though several university IT departments staffed by US-trained professors who keep up their Silicon Valley connections turn out highly qualified software engineers.

Now there is a drive to catch up.

"The crisis has changed things in a positive way," says Marco Veremis, co-founder and chief executive of Up-stream, an Athens-based mobile marketing company.

"There's a start-up culture that's buoyant. It's still early days, but people are working to produce something with value-added."

The bulk of financing for technology start-ups comes from four venture capital funds backed by an EU regional development package covering 70 per cent of a seed capital investment.

Aristos Doxiadis, a private equity professional, says: "There have never been many angel investors in Greece and it was hard to raise funding at the height of the crisis, but there's a community of people here who trust each other, so we managed."

He adds: "Now that several start-ups have taken off, there's growing interest."

Mr Doxiadis is a partner in Openfund II, a  ¬11m operation that provides Greek technology start-ups with business tools and advice for competing in a global market, from guidance on pitching for funding to access to 50 international mentors. It is backed by the EU's European Investment Fund and a dozen private investors.

One early success was Taxibeat, a smartphone application for hailing cabs that was launched in 2011. It made headlines in Athens at a time when taxi services were being disrupted by cabbies resisting reforms of the transport sector.

Taxibeat differs from other taxi-hailing apps by enabling customers to choose the driver they prefer, based on ratings by other passengers plus extras such as speaking fluent English.

Considered a good fit for European cities with heavy tourist traffic and for emerging markets where taxi services are less regulated, Taxibeat has expanded in markets across Europe from Bucharest to Paris and also in Latin America.

"Taxibeat has played a catalytic role for Greek start-ups because it was such a good story," Mr Doxiadis says.

Openfund II has backed 12 start-ups since its launch last year and plans to reach 25 by the end of 2015.

So far, only one company has reached Silicon Valley. Bugsense, which collects and analyses crash reports from mobile apps, was launched in 2010 with a seed investment of $100,000 from a group of Greek diaspora IT experts working in California.

It was sold last year to Splunk, a US-based data analytics company, for an undisclosed amount.

Workable, founded by two former Upstream employees, is tipped as Greece's next success story after raising $1.5m in a new funding round led by Greylock Partners, a Silicon Valley venture capital fund.

Workable is developing cloud-based recruitment software for small and medium enterprises.

"When a Greek start-up raises funding from an international fund, it sends a clear message to investors here," says Mr Veremis, an angel investor and board adviser to Workable.

Several start-ups aimed at the tourist industry, the most important sector of the economy, have since expanded into global markets.

Incrediblue's website connects yacht-owners and crew with customers who book sailing holidays based on price, location and reviews by users, reducing costs in a fragmented market where local brokers charge high fees.

Locish, a smartphone question-and-answer app that has attracted $820,000 of funding from two Greek venture capital funds, provides travellers with tips from local residents on where to eat and drink in Athens, New York and San Francisco.

Incubators that provide business space along with "open coffee" sessions and weekend meetings give young entrepreneurs an opportunity to exchange ideas and receive feedback, says George Kasselakis, Openfund II's executive director.

Thanos Kosmidis and his partner Alex Giamas work at Microsoft's innovation centre in Athens, which supports several start-ups with technology advice and mentoring.

CareAcross, their English-language website supporting cancer patients and care- givers, which is financed with  ¬100,000 of private funding, is at an early stage of development.

"It's useful to have a physical base with a diverse set of people supporting you," says Mr Kosmidis, who worked for IT companies abroad for 12 years before returning to Greece to start as an entrepreneur.

In Depth: At Bruised Banks, Naysayers Gain More Clout After Crisis

By James Sterngold

At Wells Fargo & Co., some executives pushed last year to relaunch a program letting homeowners get a line of credit secured by the equity in their house -- and pay only the interest due on the loan. Such credit lines have been scarce since the financial crisis, but the executives saw them as a way to boost revenue as housing prices climb.

The bank's chief risk officer, Michael Loughlin, said no. He proposed requiring regular payments that shrink the borrower's debt over time and didn't budge when told Wells Fargo might lose business to other lenders. The other bankers agreed to go along with his decision.

"Five years ago, if the risk group recommended against a strategy or product, it might just be one part of a debate," he says. Now, "when we say no, it's usually no."

Mr. Loughlin is an example of the naysayers who are gaining power and multiplying in number across the U.S. banking industry as financial institutions bend to pressure from regulators to make their operations safer and simpler following the financial crisis that began in 2008.

The ultimate goal is to reduce the likelihood of another round of catastrophic losses that could shake the financial system. In a report released Wednesday, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency warned that "credit risk is now building after a period of improving credit quality and problem loan cleanup."

Wells Fargo now has 2,300 employees in its core risk-management department, up from 1,700 two years ago, and the department's annual budget has doubled to $500 million in that period. The company's overall workforce has remained flat.

In February, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. put its chief risk officer on the company's management committee for the first time in Goldman's 145-year history. The 34-person group oversees the entire firm and is traditionally dominated by executives who made their name as traders or investment bankers.

Regulators say they don't track the total number of risk-management or risk-control employees at the nation's roughly 6,700 banks, though officials believe that big and small institutions everywhere are turning jobs long seen as ho-hum into front-line commanders.

Senior risk officers earn as much as 40% more than they did a few years ago, says the OCC, a federal agency that regulates units of Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and about 1,700 smaller institutions.

The number of people who passed a risk-management exam often required for jobs in the field nearly tripled in the four years that ended last year compared with 2004 to 2007, according to the Global Association of Risk Professionals.

"These are the basic regulations and the norms now," says Thomas Curry, head of the OCC.

The changes are hugely expensive amid sluggish loan growth and a steep decline in trading revenue. But banks have no choice. The OCC and Federal Reserve are using leverage they got through the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law and other postcrisis changes to restrain risk-taking.

Under rules issued in February, the biggest U.S. bank holding companies are required to have a chief risk officer and a risk committee on the company's board of directors. The chief risk officer must get direct access to the board committee and chief executive to make sure the risk officer's opinions aren't watered down or whitewashed. The companies have until 2016 to comply, but most have already made the changes.

In addition, large banks are being prodded to produce detailed statements specifying how much risk -- and what kinds -- the banks are willing to take to meet financial goals. Risk officers are being urged to investigate large losses and question bankers who make unusually big profits. Either one could be a sign of risk-taking run amok, regulators say.

"We look for patterns of behavior that reinforce a strong or weak risk-management culture both within and across lines of business," says Martin Pfinsgraff, who is in charge of large-bank examinations at the OCC.

To keep a closer eye on banks, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York says it has about 45 examiners, about twice the precrisis level, who just assess risk management at each bank holding company overseen by the regulator. Those companies include Goldman and Morgan Stanley.

Regional bank KeyCorp, based in Cleveland, has rewritten its compensation guidelines so that loan officers can lose a chunk of their bonus if they fall short of new risk-management standards. Before the financial crisis, bonuses were determined largely by profit goals.

"Before, you threw something over the wall, and the risk managers said yes or no," says William Hartmann, KeyCorp's chief risk officer. "Now we're more involved in the development of the strategy or the plan."

Partly as a result, KeyCorp has sharply reduced its loan commitments for construction and real-estate development. Bankers there also work harder to judge the overall riskiness of a borrower, instead of one project at a time.

It is too soon to tell if any of the changes will make a difference in the long run. Regulators say banks still have a long way to go before complying fully with the toughened standards, known as "heightened expectations."

Last year, none of the 21 largest banks subject to the requirements were deemed "strong" overall by the OCC in all categories. The number climbed to two earlier this year.

Another big challenge is the slippery nature of risk itself. Before the financial crisis, for example, many lenders believed they had properly weighed the dangers of subprime mortgages -- and had set aside a financial cushion of reserves that was big enough to absorb losses on the loans. Those predictions were disastrously wrong.

"Our abilities to measure market risk are akin to where medicine was in the 1700s," says Damian Handzy, chairman and chief executive of Investor Analytics, a New York firm that operates risk-control systems. "Everyone is honestly trying to get better at this, but we're still in the laboratory. The old systems do not address systemic risk at all. Traditional banking tools are just not designed for that."

Jeffrey Wallis, president of SunGard Consulting Services, a unit of SunGard Data Systems Inc. that sells risk-management software and systems to banks, says financial firms are "still developing the right technology, the processes and the right people to do this."

"At the individual bank level, I think we're safer," Mr. Wallis adds. "I don't know that on the macro level we really have a better handle on things. A lot of the risks that could hurt us are still not fully understood, or we don't know how to detect them."

Other bank-industry veterans are more optimistic. Donald Lamson, a partner at law firm Shearman & Sterling LLP who worked for 30 years at the OCC, predicts that the rise of risk managers "will change the world for banks because now they have to speak this language, they have to go through this process." Under the new rules, "the point is you cannot have a system where an intermediary manager can block a recommendation by the risk manager."

By some measurements, the banking industry has become less vulnerable. At the end of 2013, five of the largest bank holding companies by assets had $792.83 billion in combined equity capital, a buffer against possible losses. The total is up 19% from $666.91 billion in 2009, according to the OCC.

The same companies' combined value at risk, an estimate of a securities firm's exposure to losses in any given trading day, fell 64% to $381 million from $1.05 billion during the period.

Part of the shift reflects regulatory cudgels like the Volcker rule, part of Dodd-Frank that curbs banks' ability to bet with their own capital and led to an exodus of swing-for-the-fences traders. The 30 largest institutions also must pass annual "stress tests" by the Federal Reserve to raise dividends and buy back shares. Inside those companies, chief risk officers help lead the grueling, anxious process.

For decades, risk managers spent most of their time worrying about types of trouble seen as relatively easy to measure, such as vulnerability to interest-rate changes, stock-market swings or loan losses. Ambitious young executives often saw the risk-management department as a dead end.

At many banks, the number of employees responsible for steering clear of bad surprises is now climbing by more than 15% a year, recruiters say. "This is a real career path now, something people want to get into, not something they fall into," says Jeanne Branthover, a financial-industry recruiter at Boyden Global Executive Search in New York.

Near the top of the corporate ladder, chief risk officers can earn roughly as much as a chief financial officer or general counsel. Before the financial crisis, chief risk officers got about one-third less, according to Ms. Branthover.

Federal regulators are tracking the pay figures as a gauge of how serious banks are about improving risk oversight. "Pay is how we can ensure these are people of stature and they're competent," says Mr. Curry, the OCC chief.

At Goldman, Chief Risk Officer Craig Broderick's ascent to the management committee in February signaled the growing importance of the New York securities firm's risk police since it became a bank holding company during the crisis.

Officials won't say how many employees work in risk management or compliance, but managers in that unit are known throughout Goldman as the "Federation," a nod to the benevolent forces in "Star Trek" responsible for protecting members from intergalactic marauders.

The nickname was around before the crisis but seldom used outside the group. "If anyone ever wondered how important the Federation is to the firm, they don't have to wonder anymore," Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman's chairman and chief executive, wrote in an email to The Wall Street Journal.

Mr. Broderick, a 55-year-old former assistant scoutmaster of his son's troop, says his duties have grown far beyond quantitative risk management. They also include areas such as assessing and controlling exposure from Goldman's digital infrastructure, derivatives-clearing operation, litigation and malfeasance by traders and other employees.

"People sometimes talk about building an airplane while it's flying," Mr. Broderick says. "To me, it feels like we're turning a two-engine plane into a four-engine plane in flight."

Wells Fargo's Mr. Loughlin, 58, has had his office near John Stumpf, the fourth-largest U.S. bank's chairman, president and CEO, since before the financial crisis. But Mr. Loughlin has gained even more authority.

After being promoted to chief risk officer in 2010, his duties expanded to include oversight of market-related risks and potential dangers that could hurt the entire company. "I'm afraid I brought the mood of the party down somewhat," Mr. Loughlin told investors at a meeting in May. "That is my job."

He also knows how to say yes. In February, Mr. Loughlin agreed to lower the minimum credit score for certain mortgages eligible for backing by the Federal Housing Administration, which helps first-time and low-income families buy homes. Wells Fargo said it would make loans to borrowers with credit scores as low as 600, down from its previous limit of 640. Borrowers with scores below 620 have traditionally been considered subprime.

Mr. Loughlin says the move doesn't expose Wells Fargo to greater risk because the bank requires ample documentation of an applicant's income and carefully scrutinizes the ability to make loan payments.

Markets
Analysts Expect More Penalties, Charges for Big Banks; Muted Reaction to BNP, Credit Suisse Guilty Pleas Likely Set the Stage

Law-enforcement officials have secured guilty pleas from two large, complex banks in two months, and the financial system survived.

The muted reaction from investors to guilty pleas by BNP Paribas SA and Credit Suisse Group AG is likely to set the stage for more stiff penalties, including criminal charges, for big banks from the U.S. Department of Justice, analysts say.

"What this signals is that if a conviction will not shut down the company, than there's no reason not to convict," said Brandon Garrett, a University of Virginia law professor who tracks corporate prosecutions.

On Monday, BNP Paribas agreed to pay nearly $9 billion and plead guilty to conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions. That followed a May settlement in which Credit Suisse agreed to plead guilty to a criminal charge that it helped wealthy Americans evade taxes. The bank also agreed to pay $2.6 billion to U.S. authorities. The two are the only bank parent companies to plead guilty to a crime in recent years.

Attorney General Eric Holder sparked a political controversy when he suggested at a Senate hearing last year that some banks are so large and complex that the Justice Department was running into trouble prosecuting them because it might trigger broader economic problems. Mr. Holder later said those comments were misconstrued, and began pushing prosecutors to work with regulators to find ways to win guilty pleas from big banks.

Against that backdrop, banks, their lawyers, the French government and even the Federal Reserve warned that criminal charges against a big bank could trigger a firm's collapse by sending clients and investors fleeing for the exit.

In the days leading up to the Credit Suisse plea, Federal Reserve officials repeatedly warned the Justice Department the settlement could cause a run on the bank and implied there could be unpredictable economic consequences, according to people familiar with the matter. Such concerns have been amplified by the 2008 financial crisis, when the failure of Lehman Bros. rippled across the financial system in unexpected and damaging ways.

Prosecutors tried to lessen the chance of economic mayhem by getting regulators, including the New York Department of Financial Services, to agree not to take punitive action such as revoking a bank's charter or license to operate which would amount to the death penalty for a financial institution.

Still, in both the BNP and Credit Suisse settlements, Fed officials gamed out the potential negative scenarios the plea deal could trigger, including mapping out each bank's linkages to other financial firms and their ability to withstand any losses that the announcement might spark. Fed officials didn't attempt to dissuade prosecutors from pursuing any particular course of action, said a person familiar with the matter.

Those worst-case scenarios didn't come to pass, arming prosecutors with two arguments in favor of continuing to seek stiff punishment from large financial firms.

Both banks suffered some loss in share price after news of the pending criminal pleas surfaced, but nothing disastrous. Both in fact saw share prices rise modestly after the formal settlement announcements were made.

Analysts say the full impact of the punishment's toll on BNP Paribas will take some time, particularly given the yearlong ban on the French bank's ability to conduct certain U.S. dollar transactions.

Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of the policy-analysis firm Federal Financial Analytics Inc., said the BNP and Credit Suisse cases show that prosecutors and regulators have figured out how to structure the guilty pleas and accompanying punishments without triggering unintended consequences for the financial system. "That's one of the reasons I think there's going to be more of them," she said.

Jaret Seiberg, a policy analyst with Guggenheim Partners, predicted in a client note Monday that "a lack of reaction by investors and customers" to the BNP announcement would encourage DOJ to pursue criminal charges against a U.S. bank so prosecutors "can say definitely that no bank is too big to jail." Mr. Seiberg raised concerns, however, that a guilty plea could trigger far more serious market repercussions for a U.S. bank than the foreign cases to date.

Indonesia and Turkey drag Mobius down; Fund focus

Bradley Gerrard finds exposure to banking sector hits Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust

Franklin Templeton's Mark Mobius has cited Indonesian and Turkish holdings as the biggest drag on the performance of his flagship 1.9bn investment trust.

Mr Mobius said in the annual results statement of the Templeton Emerging Markets Investment Trust (Temit) that positions in Turkish and Indonesian banks dented returns the most, alongside Buenaventura, the Peruvian mining company.

Turkey and Indonesia's stock markets have been hit in the past year after they were included in the "Fragile Five" - a term used to identify countries whose large current-account deficits made them vulnerable to a tightening of US monetary policy.

The MSCI Turkey index has started to recover in 2014 and in the past year has risen 2.2 per cent in dollar terms, although this is far below the 18.4 per cent rise in the MSCI Emerging Markets index, according to FE Analytics, the data provider.

Indonesia's stock market has also risen in 2014, but is still down 5.1 per cent over the past 12 months.

"Tapering of the US quantitative easing programme and its impact on the country's substantial current-account deficit, along with a corruption investigation implicating figures close to the government, prompted a sell-off in the Turkish market," Mr Mobius said.

" Banks , including Akbank, one of Turkey's largest privately owned banks, came under particular pressure, especially after the chief executive of a leading competitor was arrested.

"We are of the opinion, however, that Akbank is well positioned to benefit from growing demand for financial and banking services in Turkey."

According to the trust's annual report, the stock fell nearly 44 per cent in the year to March 31.

Mr Mobius said Bank Danamon Indonesia, another stock undermined by fears over US tightening, would benefit from economic growth and rising demand for financial products from the expanding Indonesian middle class.

The trust's sterling share class fell nearly 17 per cent in the year to March 31, more than the loss of 9.9 per cent in sterling terms of the MSCI Emerging Markets index.

Mr Mobius said "political difficulties" in Russia , Thailand and Turkey "may dominate news media" as would continuing analysis of Chinese economic data, but that there were promising trends in emerging markets too .

"The major economic restructuring under way in China, South Korea and Mexico , and the rising focus on reducing corruption in many countries and the emergence of market-friendly economic policies and investment across much of south and southeast Asia, could all create opportunities over time," he said.

Mr Mobius has started to look for ways - albeit small ones - to tap into emerging markets from afar.

But investors should not expect a significant shift in Mr Mobius's strategy of delving deep into emerging market-based stocks. His other off-benchmark position was Oil & Gas Development in Pakistan .

FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - MONEY
Merciless lessons from the Ming era; Investing

Anew exhibition - Ming: The Golden Empire - has just opened at the National Museum of Scotland. I wandered around it this week with JPMorgan's Stephanie Flanders, who had kindly come north to speak with me at a lunch held by the Prince's Trust.

Given that both of us are more than averagely preoccupied with economics you'd expect us to be looking for the lessons from the Ming era that we might translate to today. There were plenty. There is a piece of paper money once worth one ounce of silver, a nice reminder that fiat money isn't really something to hold if you are after long-term value. During the hyperinflation of the 1450s anyone with paper notes probably rather wished they had ounces of silver instead.

There are amazing luxury items (if you go, look for the carved jade belt pieces) from which you can note the wealth of the court relative to the masses and draw conclusions about wealth inequality and the interplay between state spending and taxation 600 years ago.

The Ming dynasty period was one of high spending but low taxation, so by the 17th century it was running massive deficits, something that contributed to its eventual collapse. There are some original exam papers for mandarins - almost impossibly difficult, apparently, but also fairly meritocratic and something that might make you think our own bureaucrats look a little underqualified.

But the bit of the exhibition that reminded me most of today was the bit about art. By the late Ming period (the dynasty ran from 1368 to 1644), say the curators, "an increasingly commercialised art market grew in response to demand at all levels of society". Forgeries abounded; books gave advice to novices; and craftsmen suddenly found that they had become brands. By the end it became so bad that contemporary commentator Li Rihua said: "Crafty dealers and market hustlers will do almost anything to make a sale, spouting absurd claims to the point of talking absolute nonsense."

This translates nicely to the property market. Demand at all levels of society, endless instruction books on how to make it big in buy-to-let ; branded developers; and of course plenty of hustlers spouting absurd claims to the point of talking absolute nonsense about everything from investing in student property to the (debatable) shortage of housing in the UK.

This brings us to some of our own mandarins, the members of the Financial Policy Committee (FPC). This is chaired by Bank of England governor Mark Carney and has recently been given new powers that allow it to interfere in credit markets. This week it announced it is to introduce controls on mortgage lending in the UK. Lenders will not be able to offer more than 15 per cent of their mortgages at more than 4.5 times the borrower's income and they will also have to be sure that borrowers will still be able to afford their payments if interest rates rise by three percentage points in the five years after they take out their mortgage.

Mr Carney noted that he didn't expect this to have any effect at all - it allows high loan-to-value lending to rise from its current level, which is already above its 2008 peak. Nothing in there for the hustlers to worry about. As the analysts at Fathom Consulting put it, you can now expect "house prices and household debt to continue to rise from levels that are already too high". Something will eventually slow the property market in London and the southeast. But this particular bit of nonsense talk isn't going to be it.

That said, all this is more important than it looks. We haven't had credit controls or mortgage restrictions such as these in the UK for 30 years. Now we do. It is a new world of bureaucratic power. Given the tendency for the work of bureaucrats to expand to fill whatever space is available, I suspect they will soon be making more use of it.

Finally, a note on contrarianism. A few months ago I suggested buying stocks in Russia - the cheapest and most obviously unpopular market I could see. You didn't like this much. Indeed, most of you thought buying Russia was downright stupid and many said so in the comments section below the article. Since then, the Micex is up about 25 per cent. I mention this not to demonstrate my brilliance - regular readers will know that market timing isn't my thing - but as a reminder about what contrarianism really is.

Ask any fund manager how he perceives himself and he will almost always tell you that he "isn't interested in what other people are buying"; he "looks for value", he looks past the chatter to the "long term potential" of investments; he is in fact a contrarian investor. Then ask him if he holds any Gazprom, or whether he has been in the market recently buying a little Tesco for its big data wealth, amazing branding and the potential in its banking business. I can be fairly sure the answer will be no.

When I suggested Russia, I said I liked (and hold) the JPMorgan Russian investment trust. Alan Brierley of Canaccord Genuity agrees. He notes that the market is still on price-to-book ratio of a mere 0.7 times and a forward price/ earnings ratio of 5.3 times (the US is on 19 times). The market trades at a 68 per cent discount to the rest of the world in valuation terms and this trust trades at an 11 per cent discount to the net asset value of its investments. That's got to be a better long-term deal than a buy-to-let flat in London. Something for your Nisa money, perhaps?

The Property Report
Sinking Yields in Asia Spur Investor Shift --- Less Willing to Accept Low Returns, Buyers Are Taking on More Risk and Considering Properties Outside Their Regions

Commercial real-estate yields in Asia are the lowest in the world, forcing investors to pay top prices for the highest-quality buildings, take on more risk or consider property investments outside of their regions for the first time.

Yields for centrally located office buildings are just 2.2% in Taipei, 2.8% in Hong Kong and 3.5% in Tokyo and Singapore. By comparison, they are 4.7% in New York and 3.8% in London's West End, according to CBRE Group Inc.

Pension funds, sovereign-wealth funds and other institutional investors have been willing to accept such low returns because they look attractive in a low interest-rate environment. But it also means that buyers are exposed to a loss in value if interest rates rise and demand for such low yields cools.

Yields have fallen so far in Taiwan that financial regulators last year instituted a new rule that limits domestic insurance companies' investments to properties that offer a rental yield of 2.875% or above. Authorities also have allowed insurance companies to buy real estate outside the country's borders for the first time.

Investors are modifying their strategies. Terence Loh, executive director at China-focused investment fund CDH Investments, said he has been investing in development projects in cities such as Beijing, Hangzhou and Xi'an rather than buying existing buildings. "The risk-reward is more compelling," he said.

Yields are an important measure of commercial-property values because lower yields typically mean higher prices. They are calculated by dividing the annual income by the price.

Traditionally, yields in Asia are lower than they are in Europe and the U.S. because often there are more buyers chasing fewer properties. Pension funds, sovereign-wealth funds and other institutional investors favor fully leased, well-located buildings and there are fewer of these in Asia. Also, many of these investors, until recently, have been reluctant to venture outside the regional markets they know best.

But lately yields in Asia have fallen to unusually low levels, along with the rest of the world. Buyers can tolerate smaller yields partly because they can borrow at lower costs and the lower returns still look attractive compared with the debt market.

Yields also have been falling in many countries because the annual incomes of properties aren't keeping up with rising prices. Prime office rents in Beijing and Shanghai, for example, have stayed flat over the past two years, according to CBRE, while those in Hong Kong and Taipei rose 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, in the past year.

In some Asian cities, including Taipei and Beijing, yields are at or near historical lows, according to CBRE. In Hong Kong, they are at similar levels to the last major property boom in 1997. In Tokyo, the yields are at their lowest levels since 2005, CBRE says.

In Taipei, Mercuries Life Insurance Co. Ltd. in April bought almost 8,000 square meters of retail space in the podium at Taipei TiT Tower Square for 3.95 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$131.5 million), with a rental yield of 3%, according to Real Capital Analytics, a real-estate data firm. The seller, Homax Group, acquired the same property in June 2011 at a price of NT$2.8 billion for a yield of 4.5% at the time.

In Singapore, a group of local companies in May bought a 93% stake from Keppel REIT in the Prudential Tower in the city's central financial district for 512 million Singaporean dollars (US$409.3 million). The deal boasted a 3.5% yield, according to Real Capital. By comparison, Keppel REIT in 2011 bought the Ocean Financial Centre, also in the heart of Singapore, for S$2.0 billion in a deal that offered a 5.3% yield, Real Capital says.

Investors have started to leave their comfort zones to find higher yields. Some have targeted Australia. Yields are at 6% in Sydney's and Melbourne's main office districts. Singapore-based real-estate company Hiap Hoe Group bought an office building in Perth for 90 million Australian dollars (US$84.8 million), at a yield of 8.3%, according to research by property firm JLL.

Other investors are seeking distressed properties, hoping to boost yields by increasing revenue. Gaw Capital Partners, a Hong Kong-based private-equity real-estate firm, earlier this year paid US$30 million for the Hyatt Regency Osaka in hopes of turning around a hotel that lost US$10 million in the year ending March. "We saw a lot of quick fixes that we could do and cost-cutting that would make the hotel cash-flow positive right away," said Christina Gaw, managing principal and head of capital markets at the firm.

Some real-estate experts say investors are willing to accept low yields because they feel that property incomes are poised to rise after years of stagnation. They point out that commercial property often benefits from rising inflation because it allows landlords to raise rents. "Investors are going into Tokyo with the expectation of rising rents," said Alistair Meadows, international capital group head at JLL.

But others say investors accepting low yields are walking a thin line. Many of them have been trying to boost returns by adding leverage, a risky formula that exposes investors to default if rents or values decline.

Also, if interest rates rise faster than inflation, owners could get squeezed, experts say. "These tight [yield] rates will have a very small margin of error," said Nicholas Wilson, research manager for capital markets in Asia Pacific, at JLL.

Markets
After Crisis, Risk Officers Gain More Clout at Banks; U.S. Banking Industry Bends to Pressure to Make Operations Safer and Simpler

At Wells Fargo & Co., some executives pushed last year to relaunch a program letting homeowners get a line of credit secured by the equity in their house and pay only the interest due on the loan. Such credit lines have been scarce since the financial crisis, but the executives saw them as a way to boost revenue as housing prices climb.

The bank's chief risk officer, Michael Loughlin, said no. He proposed requiring regular payments that shrink the borrower's debt over time and didn't budge when told Wells Fargo might lose business to other lenders. The other bankers agreed to go along with his decision.

"Five years ago, if the risk group recommended against a strategy or product, it might just be one part of a debate," he says. Now, "when we say no, it's usually no."

Mr. Loughlin is an example of the naysayers who are gaining power and multiplying in number across the U.S. banking industry as financial institutions bend to pressure from regulators to make their operations safer and simpler following the financial crisis that began in 2008.

The ultimate goal is to reduce the likelihood of another round of catastrophic losses that could shake the financial system. In a report released Wednesday, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency warned that "credit risk is now building after a period of improving credit quality and problem loan cleanup."

Wells Fargo now has 2,300 employees in its core risk-management department, up from 1,700 two years ago, and the department's annual budget has doubled to $500 million in the same period. The company's overall workforce has remained flat.

In February, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. put its chief risk officer on the company's management committee for the first time in Goldman's 145-year history. The 34-person group oversees the entire firm and is traditionally dominated by executives who made their name as traders or investment bankers.

Regulators say they don't track the total number of risk-management or risk-control employees at the nation's roughly 6,700 banks, though officials believe that big and small institutions everywhere are turning jobs long seen as ho-hum into front-line commanders.

Senior risk officers earn as much as 40% more than they did a few years ago, says the OCC, a federal agency that regulates units of Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and about 1,700 smaller institutions.

The number of people who passed a risk-management exam often required for jobs in the field nearly tripled in the four years that ended last year compared with 2004 to 2007, according to the Global Association of Risk Professionals.

"These are the basic regulations and the norms now," says Thomas Curry, head of the OCC.

The changes are hugely expensive amid sluggish loan growth and a steep decline in trading revenue. But banks have no choice. The OCC and Federal Reserve are using leverage they got through the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law and other postcrisis changes to restrain risk-taking.

Under rules issued in February, the biggest U.S. bank-holding companies are required to have a chief risk officer and a risk committee on the company's board of directors. The chief risk officer must get direct access to the board committee and chief executive to make sure the risk officer's opinions aren't watered down or whitewashed. The companies have until 2016 to comply, but most have already made the changes.

In addition, large banks are being prodded to produce detailed statements specifying how much risk and what kinds the banks are willing to take to meet financial goals. Risk officers are being urged to investigate large losses and question bankers who make unusually big profits. Either one could be a sign of risk-taking run amok, regulators say.

"We look for patterns of behavior that reinforce a strong or weak risk-management culture both within and across lines of business," says Martin Pfinsgraff, who is in charge of large-bank examinations at the OCC.

To keep a closer eye on banks, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York says it has about 45 examiners, about twice the precrisis level, who just assess risk management at each bank-holding company overseen by the regulator. Those companies include Goldman and Morgan Stanley.

Regional bank KeyCorp, based in Cleveland, has rewritten its compensation guidelines so that loan officers can lose a chunk of their bonus if they fall short of new risk-management standards. Before the financial crisis, bonuses were determined largely by profit goals.

"Before, you threw something over the wall, and the risk managers said yes or no," says William Hartmann, KeyCorp's chief risk officer. "Now we're more involved in the development of the strategy or the plan."

Partly as a result, KeyCorp has sharply reduced its loan commitments for construction and real-estate development. Bankers there also work harder to judge the overall riskiness of a borrower, instead of one project at a time.

It is too soon to tell if any of the changes will make a difference in the long run. Regulators say banks still have a long way to go before complying fully with the toughened standards, known as "heightened expectations."

Last year, none of the 21 largest banks subject to the requirements were deemed "strong" overall by the OCC in all categories. The number climbed to two earlier this year.

Another big challenge is the slippery nature of risk itself. Before the financial crisis, for example, many lenders believed they had properly weighed the dangers of subprime mortgages and had set aside a financial cushion of reserves that was big enough to absorb losses on the loans. Those predictions were disastrously wrong.

"Our abilities to measure market risk are akin to where medicine was in the 1700s," says Damian Handzy, chairman and chief executive of Investor Analytics, a New York firm that operates risk-control systems. "Everyone is honestly trying to get better at this, but we're still in the laboratory. The old systems do not address systemic risk at all. Traditional banking tools are just not designed for that."

Jeffrey Wallis, president of SunGard Consulting Services, a unit of SunGard Data Systems Inc. that sells risk-management software and systems to banks, says financial firms are "still developing the right technology, the processes and the right people to do this."

"At the individual bank level, I think we're safer," Mr. Wallis adds. "I don't know that on the macro level we really have a better handle on things. A lot of the risks that could hurt us are still not fully understood, or we don't know how to detect them."

Other bank-industry veterans are more optimistic. Donald Lamson, a partner at law firm Shearman & Sterling LLP who worked for 30 years at the OCC, predicts that the rise of risk managers "will change the world for banks because now they have to speak this language, they have to go through this process." Under the new rules, "the point is you cannot have a system where an intermediary manager can block a recommendation by the risk manager."

By some measurements, the banking industry has become less vulnerable. At the end of 2013, five of the largest bank-holding companies by assets had $792.83 billion in combined equity capital, a buffer against possible losses. The total is up 19% from $666.91 billion in 2009, according to the OCC.

The same companies' combined value at risk, an estimate of a securities firm's exposure to losses in any given trading day, fell 64% to $381 million from $1.05 billion during the same period.

Part of the shift reflects regulatory cudgels like the Volcker rule, part of Dodd-Frank that curbs banks' ability to bet with their own capital and led to an exodus of swing-for-the-fences traders. The 30 largest institutions also must pass annual "stress tests" by the Federal Reserve to raise dividends and buy back shares. Inside those companies, chief risk officers help lead the grueling, anxious process.

For decades, risk managers spent most of their time worrying about types of trouble seen as relatively easy to measure, such as vulnerability to interest-rate changes, stock-market swings or loan losses. Ambitious young executives often saw the risk-management department as a dead end.

At many banks, the number of employees responsible for steering clear of bad surprises is now climbing by more than 15% a year, recruiters say. "This is a real career path now, something people want to get into, not something they fall into," says Jeanne Branthover, a financial-industry recruiter at Boyden Global Executive Search in New York.

Near the top of the corporate ladder, chief risk officers can earn roughly as much as a chief financial officer or general counsel. Before the financial crisis, chief risk officers got about one-third less, according to Ms. Branthover.

Federal regulators are tracking the pay figures as a gauge of how serious banks are about improving risk oversight. "Pay is how we can ensure these are people of stature and they're competent," says Mr. Curry, the OCC chief.

At Goldman, Chief Risk Officer Craig Broderick's ascent to the management committee in February signaled the growing importance of the New York securities firm's risk police since it became a bank-holding company during the crisis.

Officials won't say how many employees work in risk management or compliance, but managers in that unit are known throughout Goldman as the "Federation," a nod to the benevolent forces in "Star Trek" responsible for protecting members from intergalactic marauders.

The nickname was around before the crisis but seldom used outside the group. "If anyone ever wondered how important the Federation is to the firm, they don't have to wonder anymore," Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman's chairman and chief executive, wrote in an email to The Wall Street Journal.

Mr. Broderick, a 55-year-old former assistant scoutmaster of his son's troop, says his duties have grown far beyond quantitative risk management. They also include areas such as assessing and controlling exposure from Goldman's digital infrastructure, derivatives-clearing operation, litigation and malfeasance by traders and other employees.

"People sometimes talk about building an airplane while it's flying," Mr. Broderick says. "To me, it feels like we're turning a two-engine plane into a four-engine plane in flight."

Wells Fargo's Mr. Loughlin, 58, has had his office near John Stumpf, the fourth-largest U.S. bank's chairman, president and CEO, since before the financial crisis. But Mr. Loughlin has gained even more authority.

After being promoted to chief risk officer in 2010, his duties expanded to include oversight of market-related risks and potential dangers that could hurt the entire company. "I'm afraid I brought the mood of the party down somewhat," Mr. Loughlin told investors at a meeting in May. "That is my job."

He also knows how to say yes. In February, Mr. Loughlin agreed to lower the minimum credit score for certain mortgages eligible for backing by the Federal Housing Administration, which helps first-time and low-income families buy homes. Wells Fargo said it would make loans to borrowers with credit scores as low as 600, down from its previous limit of 640. Borrowers with scores below 620 have traditionally been considered subprime.

Mr. Loughlin says the move doesn't expose Wells Fargo to greater risk because the bank requires ample documentation of an applicant's income and carefully scrutinizes the ability to make loan payments.

Apartment Market Rolls On

Investors in the past week have closed on two separate purchases of apartment complexes in the Denver region and Washington -- for a total of $324 million -- in the latest sign of the surprising endurance of the multifamily sector.

A venture including the Guardian Life Insurance Company of America and Allstate Life Insurance Co. bought a $229 million portfolio of 1,514 units in Denver, Aurora, Colo., and Renton, Wash. Radco Cos., an Atlanta-based real-estate investment firm, acquired a $95 million apartment complex with 512 units in the Lakewood suburb of Denver.

The buyers said projected yields were 6% and 5.9%, respectively. That is a decline from average yields in the Denver area of 6.3% in the 12 months ending on March 30. Falling yields typically represent rising prices.

The continued strength of the multifamily sales market has been a relief to many landlords who were worried the market would weaken. Rental apartment buildings were among the first types of commercial properties to rebound after the recession. But as early as 2011, some analysts were predicting the sector would cool off, fearing competition from improving home prices and the fledgling single-family rental market.

Those thunderclouds passed without a storm. The competition from the sales market has been weaker than expected largely because mortgage lending has continued to be restrictive.

Rental apartment values nationally are up 14% from the peak 2007 levels hit before the downturn, according to a Green Street Advisors index that tracks the performance of listed rental-apartment landlords. Sales volume in Denver increased 15% in the first quarter compared with a year ago, according to Real Capital Analytics Inc., a research firm.

Rents and occupancy rates also are up nationwide. In the first quarter of this year, rents rose another 0.6% -- up 13% since the upswing began in 2009 -- and vacancies fell to 4%, according to real-estate data firm Reis Inc.

Denver has been one of the strongest housing markets in the country, fueled by a high-tech and startup scene that has launched companies including Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. and Rally Software Development. Denver has seen 2.8% job growth in the year ending in April, compared with 1.7% nationally, according to Green Street Advisors analyst Dave Bragg.

Property prices in Denver are up 23% since 2007, the biggest rise of any U.S. city outside of San Francisco, according to Green Street. Denver's growing job market "bodes very, very well for" its rental market, Mr. Bragg said.

Mike Moran, who leads Allstate's real-estate investment group, says the Denver portfolio is appealing because it consists of "workforce housing" with monthly rents ranging from $1.20 to $1.35 a square foot. Few developers are building such housing right now, he said, leaving the market wide open for high returns.

Dan Fasulo, managing director of Real Capital, also said workforce housing has less risk than upscale apartments because there is less new supply in the pipeline. "If the overall economy does improve, you'll basically reap the benefits," he said.

TruAmerica Multifamily, an investment firm founded last year by industry veteran Bob Hart and Guardian Life Insurance, was part of the buying group and will manage the portfolio.

TruAmerica and its partners will spend between $25 million and $30 million renovating the apartment buildings, which were built in the 1970s and '80s. Mr. Hart said he hopes to see a 20% to 25% rise in rents over the next five years.

Radco plans to spend about $1.2 million on renovations including updating the clubhouse, swimming pool and dog spa. "Denver is a dog town," said Radco founder Norman Radow.

Still, some question whether Denver's housing market can maintain this trajectory. Denver's rents have been on the rise for the past five years, up 20% since peak '07 levels. "You can't do 10% rent increases every year," Mr. Fasulo said.

Others worry that an oversupply of upscale housing will flood the market. The supply of multifamily housing in Denver is expected to rise 8.1% in the next four years, according to Green Street.

But Mr. Radow thinks his firm is getting in on the front end of the trend. "We think the rent curve is continuing to go up," he said.

 Big data  lends new Zest to banks' credit judgments

When Douglas Merrill left Google, he made the kind of move into financial services that many people believe the tech group itself may one day make.

Mr Merrill, the internet group's former chief information officer, founded Zest Finance to develop a simple theory: that consumers' online behaviour can be a decent proxy for their reliability in managing money. "All data is credit data," he once told the New York Times. "We just don't know how to use it yet."

Zest is one of a fast-growing coterie of financial technology companies - "fintech", to use the jargon - that are aiming to revolutionise the way banks and other financial services companies operate.

Talk of fintech investment is all the rage , as banks try desperately to focus attention on a positive forward-looking agenda, and draw a line under the legacy woes. This is partly spin, of course. But investment in technology is also genuinely needed after seven years of crisis and post-crisis regulatory reform that distracted focus - and funding - away from the pipes and cables that make everything work. Who knows? Done right, it could even help prevent some of the scandals of the past. And, as with so much in the mass market internet world, it can claim to be an agent of democratisation.

Zest and companies like it claim that many people who have traditionally been denied credit - either because they lack a record of previous borrowing, or because that record is bad - will be validated by their broader approach to credit scoring. By using "big data" records sourced from individuals' social network and internet footprints, typical credit scores can end up 40 per cent higher, Zest says.

That could be good for the lenders, who can take on more business with less risk of default, and good for the borrowers, who want the money. This data analysis can be particularly powerful in emerging markets, where families may need more money than they have to hand to school their children or start small businesses - both vital investments for macroeconomic development.

Admittedly, some of the data mining that fintech companies carry out makes liberty campaigners jittery. On balance, though, it is refreshing to see new ideas being brought to the traditionally obscure process of granting consumer credit.

And if big data gives the industry a second leg to stand on, a third innovation is emerging from another oblique angle - and appears equally promising. A Shoreditch business called VisualDNA has been gaining rapid traction for its credit scoring of loan applicants through a form of psychometric testing.

"Not everyone has a credit score, but everyone has a personality type," argues Alex Willcock, the company's founder. VisualDNA's test, administered via a lender, is relatively quick, taking 10 or 15 minutes. The bulk of the questions ask applicants to choose pictures from a selection that can reveal their attitude to types of risk. For example, one offers pictures of a preferred leisure activity: a day out with the family, a night out partying or a good book?

The company's technology has been up and running for a couple of years in Russia, via Svyaznoy, a phone retailer-cum-bank that is controlled by VisualDNA investor Maxim Nogotkov. Among the dozen or so lenders that now use the tests across half-a-dozen countries, some report improvements of as much as 50 per cent in loan default rates. As a result, credit scoring agency Experian and credit card company MasterCard both signed up as clients, and banks in South Africa, Turkey and Mexico are about to trial the tests.

Mr Willcock is not lacking ambition. He talks about targeting 30m borrowers out of a 1.9bn "addressable unbanked" market over the next few years.

There are some practical shortcomings - some pictures are open to interpretation, and some applicants may dodge safeguards designed to spot dishonest answers. At a macro level, too, there will be concerns. Improperly used, this kind of fintech could further inflate the credit bubbles in many markets to unsustainable levels.

But, like it or not, technology is the future. The world is not going back to the old order of a bank manager knowing each of his customers and making credit judgments on that basis.

Big data and psychometric tests have the potential to replicate the personal touch, and ensure lenders know more about their customers than they ever used to.

Recently, amid money laundering scandals, the bank maxim of "know your customer" has become all about regulatory compliance. But it should also be about making decent business decisions.

Sinking Yields in Asia Spur a Property-Buying Shift; Investors Are Modifying Their Strategies and Taking on More Risk

Commercial real-estate yields in Asia are the lowest in the world, forcing investors to pay top prices for the highest-quality buildings, take on more risk or consider property investments outside of their regions for the first time.

Yields for centrally located office buildings are just 2.2% in Taipei, 2.8% in Hong Kong and 3.5% in Tokyo and Singapore. By comparison, they are 4.7% in New York and 3.8% in London's West End, according to CBRE Group Inc.

Pension funds, sovereign-wealth funds and other institutional investors have been willing to accept such low returns because they look attractive in a low interest-rate environment. But it also means that buyers are exposed to a loss in value if interest rates rise and demand for such low yields cools.

Yields have fallen so far in Taiwan that financial regulators last year instituted a new rule that limits domestic insurance companies' investments to properties that offer a rental yield of 2.875% or above. Authorities also have allowed insurance companies to buy real estate outside the country's borders for the first time.

Investors are modifying their strategies. Terence Loh, executive director at China-focused investment fund CDH Investments, said he has been investing in development projects in cities such as Beijing, Hangzhou and Xi'an rather than buying existing buildings. "The risk-reward is more compelling," he said.

Yields are an important measure of commercial-property values because lower yields typically mean higher prices. They are calculated by dividing the annual income by the price.

Traditionally, yields in Asia are lower than they are in Europe and the U.S. because often there are more buyers chasing fewer properties. Pension funds, sovereign-wealth funds and other institutional investors favor fully leased, well-located buildings and there are fewer of these in Asia. Also, many of these investors, until recently, have been reluctant to venture outside the regional markets they know best.

But lately yields in Asia have fallen to unusually low levels, along with the rest of the world. Buyers can tolerate smaller yields partly because they can borrow at lower costs and the lower returns still look attractive compared with the debt market.

Yields also have been falling in many countries because the annual incomes of properties aren't keeping up with rising prices. Prime office rents in Beijing and Shanghai, for example, have stayed flat over the past two years, according to CBRE, while those in Hong Kong and Taipei rose 2.3% and 1.1%, respectively, in the past year.

In some Asian cities, including Taipei and Beijing, yields are at or near historical lows, according to CBRE. In Hong Kong, they are at similar levels to the last major property boom in 1997. In Tokyo, the yields are at their lowest levels since 2005, CBRE says.

In Taipei, for example, Mercuries Life Insurance Co. Ltd. in April bought almost 8,000 square meters of retail space in the podium at Taipei TiT Tower Square for 3.95 billion New Taiwan dollars (US$131.5 million), with a rental yield of 3%, according to Real Capital Analytics, a real-estate data firm. The seller, Homax Group, acquired the same property in June 2011 at a price of NT$2.8 billion for a yield of 4.5% at the time.

In Singapore, a group of local companies in May bought a 93% stake from Keppel REIT in the Prudential Tower in the city's central financial district for 512 million Singaporean dollars (US$409.3 million). The deal boasted a 3.5% yield, according to Real Capital. By comparison, Keppel REIT in 2011 bought the Ocean Financial Centre, also in the heart of Singapore, for S$2.0 billion in a deal that offered a 5.3% yield, Real Capital says.

Investors have started to leave their comfort zones to find higher yields. Some have targeted Australia. Yields are at 6% in Sydney's and Melbourne's main office districts. Singapore-based real-estate company Hiap Hoe Group bought an office building in Perth for 90 million Australian dollars (US$84.8 million), at a yield of 8.3%, according to research by property firm JLL.

Other investors are seeking distressed properties, hoping to boost yields by increasing revenue. Gaw Capital Partners, a Hong Kong-based private-equity real-estate firm, earlier this year paid US$30 million for the Hyatt Regency Osaka in hopes of turning around a hotel that lost US$10 million in the year ending March. "We saw a lot of quick fixes that we could do and cost-cutting that would make the hotel cash-flow positive right away," said Christina Gaw, managing principal and head of capital markets at the firm.

Some real-estate experts say investors are willing to accept low yields because they feel that property incomes are poised to rise after years of stagnation, especially in Japan as it emerges from a long slump. They point out that commercial property often benefits from rising inflation because it allows landlords to raise rents. "Investors are going into Tokyo with the expectation of rising rents," said Alistair Meadows, international capital group head at JLL.

But others say investors accepting low yields are walking a thin line. Many of them have been trying to boost returns by adding leverage, a risky formula that exposes investors to default if rents or values decline.

Also, if interest rates rise faster than inflation, owners could get squeezed, especially if they have floating-rate debt, experts say. "These tight [yield] rates will have a very small margin of error," said Nicholas Wilson, research manager for capital markets in Asia Pacific, at JLL.

Esther Fung in Shanghai and Aries Poon in Taipei contributed to this article.

U.S. News: Drop in Short Sales Trims House Inventory

By Joe Light

Copyright 2014 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved 

Short sales of underwater homes have fallen sharply amid the expiration of a key tax break, a situation that could slow the housing recovery and further limits an already thin supply of houses for sale.

Such sales, where owners sell their homes for a price below the balance on the mortgage, reduce the number of houses that end up in foreclosure. In most cases for the sale to proceed, lenders must approve the purchase and agree to forgive the unpaid portion of the mortgage owed by the homeowner.

Short sales had been especially common in recent years in hard-hit states like Florida, Michigan and Nevada, where most homes remain valued at prices that are substantially lower than during the housing boom. In March, about 5% of home purchases nationwide -- some 18,258 -- were short sales, according to mortgage-technology-and-services firm Black Knight Financial Services. That was down from 6.4% in February and off sharply from the 19.7%, or 51,909, that were short sales in January 2012.

This year's drop can be traced in part to the December expiration of the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act, which Congress originally passed in 2007. Before the act, when a home was sold through a short sale and the lender forgave a portion of the mortgage debt, the seller would typically be required to pay income taxes on the amount forgiven. The act made the forgiven debt tax-free, which paved the way for short sales and helped speed the housing recovery.

"It's a big concern," said Veronica Malolos, a real-estate broker in Kissimmee, Fla. Ms. Malolos said some underwater sellers delisted their properties in January and February after learning that the tax provision wouldn't be extended.

Ms. Malolos's clients Javier and Mayra Gonzalez in Kissimmee said they tried to sell their home last summer after Mr. Gonzalez found a new job but took it off the market in the new year. The couple received offers of about $145,000 on the home, on which they owe about $206,000, including debt from a home-equity line of credit, but their bank wouldn't accept them.

Because the mortgage act wasn't extended, the couple estimate they would owe about $15,000 in additional income taxes based on the $61,000 difference, something they say they couldn't afford.

This year, the couple's bank began foreclosure proceedings on their home, but they said they are working things out with the bank and are staying put, even though Mr. Gonzalez now has a commute of about an hour and 40 minutes each way to his new job in Vero Beach.

Short sales also have tumbled because of rising home prices, which pushed many homes back above water or closer to it. The median existing-home price nationwide was $201,700 in April, 5.2% higher than in April 2013, according to the National Association of Realtors . In the first quarter, about 19% of homes were worth less than their mortgage, according to the real-estate-information website Zillow, down from 31% a year ago.

With would-be short sellers on the sidelines, the housing market may take longer to work through remaining underwater homes, restricting the already tight home inventory on the market. If some potential short sellers decide to go through a foreclosure instead, that could cause higher losses for mortgage-bond investors, or companies that guarantee payment of mortgages, which tend to recover less in a foreclosure because of the costs of carrying a home.

The Senate Finance Committee in April passed a bill to extend the forgiveness provision, along with many other tax breaks that had expired. But the bill stalled in May after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Republicans couldn't agree on how to amend the measure.

Now some analysts don't expect Congress to move on a bill until December, after the midterm elections. Any extension would likely come as part of a wider package of tax-break extensions. "This is trapped, and there's little hope of prying it loose," said Jaret Seiberg, financial-policy analyst for Guggenheim Securities LLC,

In the meantime, real-estate agents say sellers are loath to consider short sales on homes, even when facing foreclosure as the alternative. That is a problem not just for troubled homeowners, but also for banks and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which typically lose more money when homes are sold through a foreclosure than through a short sale.

"There are still millions of homes underwater, but short sales have fallen off considerably," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. "It's gumming up the system" and could be limiting home-buyer activity.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Henderson Value Trust must rally or close; Fund focus

Shareholders impatient for turnround, says Matthew Jeynes

The 116bn Henderson Value Trust has come under fire from a top City brokerage amid signs its new management is struggling to turn its fortunes round.

Analysts at Winterflood Securities - one of the top market makers in London - have warned that clients may step in and force change on the trust, which is also facing a looming shareholder vote over whether it should continue running.

The claims represent a blow for Henderson Global Investors , which took over management of the trust from SVM Asset Management's Colin McLean, who set the trust up in 1991, last April.

The Henderson team has yet to improve performance. The trust's net asset value is down 2 per cent compared with an 11.8 per cent rise for the FTSE World index, according to Winterflood.

This has failed to repair the trust's long-term record. It currently reports a three-year loss of 17.6 per cent versus an index gain of 35.6 per cent, according to FE Analytics, the data provider.

However, Ian Barrass, the Henderson investment veteran who was installed as lead manager, has stood by his efforts to revamp the portfolio.

The Winterflood remarks emerged in a research note. It says that while a reshuffle has started, there remains a lot of work to be done to the trust, which buys into other investment trusts and funds.

Simon Elliott, research analyst at Winterflood, said in the note: "Although Ian Barrass and the Henderson team argue that it is only one year into a three-year transition process, we suspect that shareholders would have expected more progress by now in terms of portfolio repositioning: nine of the top 10 holdings remain legacy positions."

The note cited concerns that the trust's main shareholders could intervene if the poor performance continued, forcing a change of structure or investment manager. The trust is scheduled to hold a continuation vote in December.

Mr Elliott says: "It is difficult to make the case for [the trust] at present, although we recognise that it does offer value."

Mr Barrass responded by saying he has always claimed the transition of the trust would take two to three years.

He says the overhaul is on track and he has already changed roughly one-third of the portfolio holdings since taking over.

However, he says many of the larger positions in the trust remain sound investments and he will not change them unnecessarily.

He also says he is not prepared to rush to sell out of some of the illiquid investments because such a move could adversely affect shareholder returns if not done carefully.

"We do think we are doing the right things here, sticking to a consistent strategy and improving this portfolio. Performance should come through over the next year or so," he says.

The managers have sold a number of holdings since taking on the trust, including the Baker Steel Resources Trust and the Northern Investors trust.

magine that you're about to accept a new job, and it's time to talk salary. You sit down with your boss, who begins as follows:

"Actually, our payroll system is impossibly complicated. You can pick from dozens of different ways to be paid and hundreds of different start dates, and each will produce a different salary. We offer some guidance, but we're short-handed. As such, deciding when and how to collect a paycheck is essentially up to you.

"So &what would you like to do?"

Welcome to Social Security.

Each day, thousands of Americans apply for the first time for Social Security benefits. And each day if questions from our readers and the stories we hear from financial advisers are any indication many applicants have no idea what they're getting into. They know little or nothing about the program's complexity, the myriad ways to collect benefits and the Social Security Administration's staffing and service problems.

As such, they're putting their retirement and, in many cases, their spouses' future at risk.

"People spend more time planning a vacation than they do planning for 20 or 30 years of Social Security benefits," says Barry Kaplan, chief investment officer for Cambridge Wealth Counsel in Atlanta. Those benefits, he notes, are insurance against market downturns, hyperinflation and living longer than you anticipate. But would-be beneficiaries, he says, typically "go into this without a clue."

If you and/or your spouse are weighing your options about Social Security, here's a look at some of the biggest issues involving both the agency and the benefits program that could shape your retirement for better or worse.

The Social Security Administration isn't your financial adviser.

A fair amount of the mail we receive from readers with questions or complaints about Social Security goes something like this: "My Social Security office never told me about &." About a particular strategy for claiming benefits. About a little-known rule. About the consequences of starting one's payouts at a particular point in time.

No, the Social Security Administration isn't perfect. (More about this in a moment.)

But its primary job is delivering a service, paying 59 million beneficiaries, and not financial planning. The agency provides loads of information about benefits on "http://www.ssa.gov/" and does its best to answer the public's questions in its field offices and by telephone. But a comprehensive talk about the nuances of Social Security and your financial future? That's not going to happen.

Indeed, the Social Security Administration doesn't know about and it isn't the agency's job to know about your household budget, your health, your savings, life insurance, plans you might have to work in retirement. In short, all the variables that should go into a decision about filing for benefits, says Mr. Kaplan in Atlanta.

So, the onus is on you to learn about, or find help in deciphering, the basics: how benefits work, claiming strategies, possible pitfalls. And if you're hellbent, for instance, on grabbing a payout at age 62 (the earliest possible date for most people) and locking yourself and perhaps your spouse into a permanent reduction in benefits, the agency isn't going to stop you.

The Social Security Administration is stretched increasingly thin at the worst possible time.

In March, Carolyn Colvin, the agency's acting commissioner, didn't mince words in a report tied to President Barack Obama's request for additional funding for the Social Security Administration.

"Our service and stewardship efforts [have] deteriorated," she said. "In fiscal year 2013, the public had to wait longer for a decision on their disability claim, to talk to a representative on our national 800 number, and to schedule an appointment in our field offices."

The agency, in short, is overextended. In the past three years, it has lost 11,000 employees, or about 12% of its workforce; by 2022, about 60% of its supervisors will be eligible to retire. Meanwhile, budget cuts have resulted in the consolidation of 44 field offices, the closing of 503 contact stations (mobile service facilities) and a delay in plans to open eight hearing offices (where appeals about agency decisions involving retirement and disability benefits are heard) and one call center.

And that 800 number? According to a report in December from the agency's inspector general, wait times in 2013 exceeded 10 minutes, an increase of more than five minutes from 2012.

The point: The Social Security Administration is grappling with its own problems just as the baby-boom generation, with about 75 million members, is moving full speed into retirement. (The oldest boomers are turning 68 this year.) The demands on the agency mean that you might not be able to find, or find in a timely fashion, the information or help you need. That said &

More services outside Social Security are offering more help.

The Social Security Administration is the first to acknowledge that benefits are complicated. The opening paragraphs of the agency's "Social Security Handbook," a guide to the benefits program, state plainly: "The Social Security programs are so complex it is impossible to include information [in the handbook] about every topic."

Fortunately, a growing number of tools and services some free, others for a cost are available to help people navigate these waters.

In recent years, AARP, the Washington-based advocacy group for older Americans, and "http://individual.troweprice.com/public/Retail/Retirement/Social-Security-Tool?van=socialsecurity" Inc., the Baltimore-based mutual-fund company, have introduced sophisticated online calculators that help users determine how and when to claim benefits. Both are free. (The Social Security Administration has several "http://www.ssa.gov/planners/benefitcalculators.htm", also free, that can help determine the size of your benefits, but not necessarily when to claim them for maximum effect.)

Among the services that charge a fee: "http://maximizemysocialsecurity.com/", from Economic Security Planning Inc.; "http://www.socialsecuritychoices.com/", from SocSec Analytics LLC; and SocialSecuritySolutions.com, all started by academics. Our review of several Social Security tools last fall singled out "http://socialsecuritysolutions.com/"for its ease of use and Maximize My Social Security for its flexibility.

Finally, check out "http://www.pbs.org/newshour/author/lkotlikoff/" at the Public Broadcasting Service website from Laurence Kotlikoff, an economics professor at Boston University and the developer of Maximize My Social Security. The articles, published each Monday, address a wide range of issues about Social Security (including numerous "secrets" and "gotchas") and answer questions about benefits. In short, invaluable reading.

The earnings test deters people from working in retirement and shouldn't.

Social Security's earnings test, in which benefits are reduced if a person is collecting benefits and income at the same time, generates numerous questions and much confusion. But the apparent penalties aren't what they seem.

If you are under your full retirement age when you first receive Social Security benefits and if you have earned income, $1 in benefits will be deducted for each $2 you earn above an annual limit. In 2014, that limit is $15,480. In the year you reach your full retirement age, the penalty shrinks; after you reach full retirement age, the deductions end completely.

The good news: Money lost to the earnings test isn't really lost. Once you reach full retirement age, Social Security recalculates and increases your future benefits to account for any dollars withheld.

Most beneficiaries, though, aren't aware of that; as such, they typically "work up to the [annual] limit and stop," says Andrew Biggs, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and former deputy commissioner at the Social Security Administration.

The earnings test, Mr. Biggs says, "should not be a disincentive to work." Rather, "think of the test as delaying benefits until later in retirement," he says. "Over your lifetime, your total benefits will come out the same."

Spouses, at a minimum, should be aware of three claiming strategies.

Couples have a tremendous amount of flexibility in how they can claim benefits.

But the options can quickly become overwhelming, which prompts many spouses to default to the easiest choice: grabbing a payout at age 62.

Before you do that, consider these three claiming strategies. Many couples aren't aware of these options or don't think they can benefit from them. Do yourself a favor: Run the numbers. (Fidelity Investments recently did a "https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/retirement/get-most-from-social-security" these and other claiming strategies.)

Maximize survivor benefits: If you claim benefits before your full retirement age, you could be locking your spouse into a low survivor benefit when you die. The longer you wait to claim, the larger the survivor benefits.

Claim and suspend: Once you reach full retirement age, you can claim your benefit and then suspend it. (In other words, you stop payments before they begin.) This allows for two things: Your spouse, if he or she is 62 or older, can begin collecting spousal benefits from Social Security. (This assumes that the spousal benefit is larger than the spouse's own retirement benefit. More on this in a moment.) Second, your own benefit, when you eventually claim it, will have increased in size. (Thanks to "delayed retirement credits.")

Claim a spousal benefit, then later claim your own benefit: At full retirement age if you are eligible for a spousal benefit and your own retirement benefit you have the option of claiming just the spousal benefit. At a future point in time, you can then jump to your own benefit, which will have increased in size.

And speaking of spousal benefits &

"Deemed filing" can box you in.

It's a frequent question: A husband who is already collecting Social Security (or weighing the claim-and-suspend strategy) asks if his wife can take just a spousal benefit at age 62 and then switch to a (presumably larger) benefit based on her earnings record in the future.

The answer: Nope.

If the wife, in this case, applies for benefits before her full retirement age, she is "deemed" in the eyes of the Social Security Administration to have filed for both benefits: the benefit based on her work record and a spousal benefit.

She will receive the higher of the two figures, but she will be locked into that reduced benefit going forward. (Reduced because she is claiming benefits before full retirement age.)

Again, as discussed above, if the wife waits until her full retirement age to file for benefits, she would have a choice: She could apply for just a spousal benefit. Then, a few years down the road, she could switch to a payout based on her earnings history.

William Meyer, founder of SocialSecuritySolutions.com, says the "deemed filing" rule trips up innumerable applicants. "We hear about it all the time," he says.

The lesson is clear and critical: Claim benefits before full retirement age, and your options are limited; claim benefits after full retirement age, and you have more flexibility and bigger payouts.

Divorced spouses and survivors don't know what they don't know.

Ask almost any financial adviser about Social Security slip-ups, and stories about ex-spouses, widows and widowers come tumbling out.

Mr. Kaplan in Atlanta recalls a woman age 67, divorced and still working who walked into his office and simply had no idea that she could have been collecting benefits for the previous five years based on her former husband's earnings.

Prof. Kotlikoff at Boston University tells the story of a friend who had lost his wife and was convinced that he couldn't claim Social Security checks as a survivor.

"He told me, 'I made more [money] than she did,' " Prof. Kotlikoff says. "And based on that, he thought, incorrectly, that he wasn't eligible for a survivor benefit. People just don't know about this stuff."

The point: Always err on the side of telling Social Security about your family circumstances and/or a change in those circumstances.

"Tell them about ex-spouses, tell them if you've lost a spouse, tell them if you have kids," Prof. Kotlikoff says. (A surviving spouse with children could be eligible for additional benefits.)

"If you don't tell them, they won't know. It's that simple."

Delaying Social Security doesn't just result in a bigger benefit; it also can make good tax sense.

You may have heard the advice countless times: Minimize (or avoid) withdrawals from your nest egg (401(k), individual retirement accounts, etc.) for as long as possible to take advantage of tax-deferred growth. Many investors who follow that advice grab Social Security benefits, typically at age 62, to help pay the bills.

But that advice ignores the possible tax benefits associated with following the opposite course: accelerating withdrawals from savings early in retirement so that you can hold off on claiming Social Security.

The thinking here is tied to the fact that Social Security benefits are taxable. As much as 85% of a married couple's benefits are subject to tax when their income exceeds $44,000 ($34,000 for individuals); as much as 50% of benefits are taxable at lower income levels.

If you delay claiming Social Security and, as a result, end up with larger benefits, future withdrawals from savings will likely be smaller a recipe for lower levels of taxable income. (For a detailed discussion of these tax issues, see ""http://research.prudential.com/documents/rp/InnovativeSocialSecurityNov2012.pdf"to Help Maximize Social Security Benefits," from James Mahaney, vice president at Prudential Financial Inc.)

"Many retirees don't consider the impact of their withdrawal strategy on how their Social Security is taxed," says Mr. Meyer, the SocialSecuritySolutions.com founder. "Missteps in tapping the wrong account and investments to generate income can significantly increase your taxes."

U.S. News: Drop in Short Sales Trims House Inventory

By Joe Light

Short sales of underwater homes have fallen sharply amid the expiration of a key tax break, a situation that could slow the housing recovery and further limits an already thin supply of houses for sale.

Such sales, where owners sell their homes for a price below the balance on the mortgage, reduce the number of houses that end up in foreclosure. In most cases for the sale to proceed, lenders must approve the purchase and agree to forgive the unpaid portion of the mortgage owed by the homeowner.

Short sales had been especially common in recent years in hard-hit states like Florida, Michigan and Nevada, where most homes remain valued at prices that are substantially lower than during the housing boom. In March, about 5% of home purchases nationwide -- some 18,258 -- were short sales, according to mortgage-technology-and-services firm Black Knight Financial Services. That was down from 6.4% in February and off sharply from the 19.7%, or 51,909, that were short sales in January 2012.

This year's drop can be traced in part to the December expiration of the Mortgage Forgiveness Debt Relief Act, which Congress originally passed in 2007. Before the act, when a home was sold through a short sale and the lender forgave a portion of the mortgage debt, the seller would typically be required to pay income taxes on the amount forgiven. The act made the forgiven debt tax-free, which paved the way for short sales and helped speed the housing recovery.

"It's a big concern," said Veronica Malolos, a real-estate broker in Kissimmee, Fla. Ms. Malolos said some underwater sellers delisted their properties in January and February after learning that the tax provision wouldn't be extended.

Ms. Malolos's clients Javier and Mayra Gonzalez in Kissimmee said they tried to sell their home last summer after Mr. Gonzalez found a new job but took it off the market in the new year. The couple received offers of about $145,000 on the home, on which they owe about $206,000, including debt from a home-equity line of credit, but their bank wouldn't accept them.

Because the mortgage act wasn't extended, the couple estimate they would owe about $15,000 in additional income taxes based on the $61,000 difference, something they say they couldn't afford.

This year, the couple's bank began foreclosure proceedings on their home, but they said they are working things out with the bank and are staying put, even though Mr. Gonzalez now has a commute of about an hour and 40 minutes each way to his new job in Vero Beach.

Short sales also have tumbled because of rising home prices, which pushed many homes back above water or closer to it. The median existing-home price nationwide was $201,700 in April, 5.2% higher than in April 2013, according to the National Association of Realtors . In the first quarter, about 19% of homes were worth less than their mortgage, according to the real-estate-information website Zillow, down from 31% a year ago.

With would-be short sellers on the sidelines, the housing market may take longer to work through remaining underwater homes, restricting the already tight home inventory on the market. If some potential short sellers decide to go through a foreclosure instead, that could cause higher losses for mortgage-bond investors, or companies that guarantee payment of mortgages, which tend to recover less in a foreclosure because of the costs of carrying a home.

The Senate Finance Committee in April passed a bill to extend the forgiveness provision, along with many other tax breaks that had expired. But the bill stalled in May after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Republicans couldn't agree on how to amend the measure.

Now some analysts don't expect Congress to move on a bill until December, after the midterm elections. Any extension would likely come as part of a wider package of tax-break extensions. "This is trapped, and there's little hope of prying it loose," said Jaret Seiberg, financial-policy analyst for Guggenheim Securities LLC,

In the meantime, real-estate agents say sellers are loath to consider short sales on homes, even when facing foreclosure as the alternative. That is a problem not just for troubled homeowners, but also for banks and mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which typically lose more money when homes are sold through a foreclosure than through a short sale. In the first quarter, for example, Freddie Mac said that in short sales, it recovered 68.4 cents for every dollar of unpaid principal. In foreclosures, Freddie recovered 64.4 cents for every dollar.

"There are still millions of homes underwater, but short sales have fallen off considerably," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. "It's gumming up the system" and could be limiting home-buyer activity.

'Medicare Unmasked': Doctors Bill Big for Tarnished Drug

By Christopher Weaver, Anna Wilde Mathews and Tom McGinty 
2,179 words
20 June 2014
The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

Many cancer doctors now use a drug called Procrit sparingly.

It was approved in 1989 for anemia and became a popular treatment for that side effect of chemotherapy. But regulators later learned Procrit can speed tumor growth and hasten death in cancer patients. Today, use of this class of drug -- best known as EPO, a substance Lance Armstrong took illicitly to pedal faster and longer -- is sharply restricted.

One Florida oncology group stands out for how much it bills Medicare for the pricey drug.

Medicare paid U.S. oncologists $128 million in 2012 to administer Procrit, federal data show. One-sixth of that money went to oncologists in the group, Florida Cancer Specialists. Of the 20 oncologists whom Medicare paid most for Procrit, 11 belonged to the Florida group.

Florida Cancer Specialists, based in Fort Myers, Fla., also used Procrit at higher rates than is typical, a Wall Street Journal analysis of 2012 Medicare billing data shows. Its 104 cancer doctors in the analysis on average treated 11% of patients with Procrit at least once, versus an average of 6.2% among other oncologists who used Procrit or a similar drug called Aranesp.

Some other oncologists have stopped using the drugs since 2007, when the Food and Drug Administration began warning about their risks. The FDA eventually said they shouldn't be used on some chemotherapy patients and required doctors to warn many others of their risks. Medicare that year also announced restrictions on reimbursements for the drugs when used on some cancer patients.

The Medicare data, released in April after a legal effort by the Journal to make them public, have shown how a minority of doctors account for an outsize portion of Medicare's costs. A look at oncologists' billing data reveals how, despite regulators' moves to limit the two anemia drugs' use in cancer patients, some oncologists still bill Medicare heavily for what can be highly profitable treatments.

The wide variation shown in the Journal's analysis "makes me think there is some excessive use," says Otis Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer. "We have clear evidence that this drug stimulates tumor growth," he says, and is appropriate for only a "very narrow slice" of cancer patients.

William Harwin, president of Florida Cancer Specialists, whose oncologists received $20 million in 2012 Medicare payments for Procrit, says his groups' use of the drug is "correct medically and we follow the guidelines" for administering and billing for the treatment. "There's no conspiracy to give [Procrit] in any extra dose or any extra amounts."

The Medicare data may be flawed, he says, and the usage rates the Journal identified seem too high. The group's rates are partly due to regional differences in patients' health and in what Medicare covers, he says, adding that its electronic records system helps avoid missed treatments that might cause under-billing among other oncologists.

The group's Procrit use "has dropped significantly" since 2007, Dr. Harwin says. Its doctors primarily use Procrit for patients with kidney disease or a rare blood disorder, he says, some of whom also have cancer.

Cancer doctors say it is typical for their patients, particularly the elderly, to have multiple diseases. Oncologists also sometimes treat patients who don't have cancer for kidney disease or blood disorders that are considered precancerous. Medicare doesn't have national payment restrictions for the drugs' use for diseases other than cancer.

Other doctors may underuse the drugs, Dr. Harwin says. He spoke out against Procrit restrictions in 2007 and now says "these were remarkably effective drugs and remain remarkably effective."

The 2012 data have limitations. They include only payments to doctors for services to at least 11 patients. They include 3,026 office-based oncologists who used the drugs but not hospitals that billed through another system.

Despite the data's limitations, "it does appear that some of the highest billing for EPO has occurred in Florida," says a Medicare statement responding to questions about Florida Cancer Specialists' Procrit use, "and that the vast majority of those billing physicians belong to a single, albeit large, practice."

Florida's rates of cancer and kidney disease are well above the national average. Still, Florida Cancer Specialists used Procrit more than other Florida oncologists in the data, who used the two drugs on 7% of patients on average. Doctors and researchers who reviewed the Journal's findings say differences in patients' health aren't likely to explain wide variations in doctors' drug-use rates.

While Medicare paid Florida Cancer Specialists the most as a group for the drugs, doctors elsewhere were the biggest individual recipients of payments in 2012.

Louis Avvento, a Riverhead, N.Y., oncologist, was No. 1 in Medicare payments for Procrit, receiving $618,049 and using it on 17% of patients. He didn't respond to inquiries.

The oncologist receiving Procrit payments for the largest percentage of patients was Chadia Morcos, a part-time Syosset, N.Y., doctor who treated 36% of her 47 patients with it. She says she follows guidelines for the drugs and that her rate appears high because she treats so few.

Some doctors were above-average users of both Procrit, from Johnson & Johnson, and Aranesp, from Amgen Inc. The top biller for both combined was David Dresdner of St. Petersburg, Fla., whom Medicare paid $740,949. He used Procrit on 16% of patients and Aranesp on 13%. He declines to comment.

Ralph Boccia of Bethesda, Md., says he is among "real believers in the benefits" of the drugs for cancer patients. The oncologist, who co-wrote Amgen-sponsored research supporting Aranesp's use in cancer patients, used Procrit on 24% of patients and Aranesp on 19%. He says his usage reflects his practice's growth and that he follows the guidelines but considers the safety concerns overblown.

A J&J spokeswoman says Procrit is "an important treatment option for patients with certain types of anemia" and that usage rates may vary because of differences in doctor experience and patient health. "Physicians and patients must consider the risks and benefits of treatment on an individual basis."

An Amgen spokeswoman says the anemia drugs, used according to their labels, "have a positive risk-benefit profile."

Regulators first approved the drugs, called erythropoiesis-stimulating agents, for anemia from kidney disease and then for anemia from cancer therapy. Oncologists once used them widely.

The drugs also gained illicit users among athletes seeking to boost red-blood-cell counts. Mr. Armstrong revealed his use of EPO, nicknamed after the generic name epoetin alfa, in a 2013 Oprah Winfrey interview.

In 2007, Medicare paid doctors $1.15 billion for Procrit and Aranesp combined for applications other than dialysis, the most for any physician-administered drug.

But medical-journal articles around that time linked the drugs to increased stroke risk, tumor growth and earlier death for cancer patients. In 2007, the FDA issued a warning calling attention to the findings. It ultimately changed the drugs' labels to say that they shouldn't be used on patients undergoing so-called curative chemotherapy for cancer -- treatment where the hope is to eliminate cancerous cells -- and that they hadn't been proved to relieve many anemia symptoms.

Medicare in 2007 issued a rule that it would pay for Procrit or Aranesp for a cancer patient only if blood tests showed anemia beyond a certain threshold. A small proportion of patients qualify, oncologists say.

Since then, many cancer doctors have cut back on the drugs, as have many kidney doctors. In 2012, Medicare paid $363 million for the drugs, down 70% from 2007.

The drugs can be lucrative. In 2012, 56% of oncologists' Medicare payments were from drugs, compared with 5% for other doctors. Medicare pays doctors only for drugs they inject or infuse in-office. They usually buy drugs upfront, and Medicare then pays them up to 6% more than an "average sales price" based on what drug makers officially report.

Pricey drugs thus yield more income than cheaper ones. Medicare paid $849 for Aranesp and $624 for Procrit for the average monthly treatment on a cancer patient, a separate Journal analysis of 2010 Medicare data shows.

The 2010 data, acquired from Medicare for a fee, are the most recent the Journal could obtain showing individual patient billings. They include payments for 5% of U.S. Medicare patients.

Big practices can extract discounts from suppliers that potentially yield more than the 6% margin. One oncology practice with more than 20 doctors recently could buy Procrit at low enough prices for an average margin of 21%, according to data from Oncology Analytics, a firm that helps manage insurers' cancer costs. It declined to identify the practice.

Dr. Harwin of Florida Cancer Specialists, which has roughly 170 doctors now, won't comment on the group's Procrit margin. It uses Procrit exclusively, in part for volume discounts, he says, but its doctors have "no financial incentive to choose a drug based on its margin."

The group's big bills go beyond Procrit. Of its doctors, 28 were among the top 100 U.S. oncologists by 2012 Medicare payments for all services, 22 of whom received over $3 million each.

Payments over $3 million a year were deemed "high cumulative payments" in a 2013 report by the Medicare parent agency's inspector general, which recommended Medicare scrutinize top-paid doctors' billings.

"We have an incredibly high expense structure," Dr. Harwin says, largely because of drug costs.

The group's biggest payee, Vikas Malhotra, received $8.4 million -- including $562,907 for Procrit -- the 12th-highest 2012 Medicare payment to any doctor. He says the payment level reflects a patient-volume increase, Florida's high cancer rates and work by nurse practitioners. The Procrit payments might trace to high blood-disease rates and referrals from kidney specialists, he says.

Kidney disease is common among the elderly, many of whom meet criteria for at least minor forms of it, oncology-practice administrators say.

Procrit and Aranesp billings listing kidney disease but not cancer don't face national Medicare restrictions. And while the FDA requires doctors to have cancer patients receiving the drugs for anemia caused by chemotherapy sign a consent form that says Procrit or Aranesp "may make my tumor grow faster and I may die sooner," there is no such requirement of kidney patients who are given the drugs for reasons other than chemotherapy.

Dr. Harwin says Florida Cancer Specialists requires doctors to follow all FDA rules when giving Procrit to patients, and doesn't use it on patients undergoing curative chemotherapy.

Medicare doesn't prohibit a doctor from billing for Procrit for kidney disease, even if the patient is in cancer treatment and doesn't meet Medicare's anemia threshold for billing for cancer. Some Medicare-billing experts say that if a patient has both diseases, some oncologists will list kidney disease on a Procrit bill to avoid the cancer rules.

Some former employees of the Florida group who were at one office in 2012 say that if patients met the criteria for either a chemotherapy or kidney-disease claim when billing for Procrit, doctors would typically list kidney disease. Such a practice is acceptable under Medicare and FDA requirements.

The 2012 Medicare data don't provide detail for how the Florida group billed for individual patients. But the slice of patient information in the 2010 data obtained by the Journal includes individual records for 314 people the group treated with Procrit. The group's doctors listed a cancer diagnosis for 147 of them on overall Medicare billings.

When the Florida group's doctors gave Procrit to the 147 patients, they listed kidney disease 54% of the time on Medicare bills -- without mentioning cancer -- and listed cancer 25% of the time. When its doctors billed for anything other than Procrit for those 147, they included a cancer diagnosis 89% of the time.

One of the group's oncologists gave chemotherapy drugs to a man in his late 70s for prostate cancer in 2010, telling Medicare the treatment had caused anemia, the data show. In a separate claim that day, the doctor billed Medicare for Procrit to treat his anemia, listing the cause as kidney disease.

"There is no central directive to do such a thing," Dr. Harwin says. "There's never been any thought that anyone should alter their diagnoses to justify giving Procrit."

Sarah Cevallos, the group's revenue vice president, says it sometimes bills separately for Procrit when treating cancer patients because Medicare's processor in Florida sometimes rejects Procrit claims with multiple diagnoses. She says the group has passed Medicare audits without problems.

A Medicare spokesman says "there are no administrative requirements that require these type of claims to be billed separately." Medicare hasn't identified issues at the Florida group other than small overpayments the group repaid, he says.

Worldwide

Banking industry headhunters may be chasing more German speakers than Arabic or Mandarin experts this year, as lenders turn their attention back to the developed world.

Ratings agency Fitch reckons credit growth in the developed world will be 1.3 per cent this year, from a slight contraction in 2013.

In contrast, Fitch forecasts that credit growth is going to slow this year in Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.

In a report, Fitch estimates: Asian credit growth to moderate slightly to about 9 per cent in 2014 from 9.7 per cent in 2013; Latin American credit growth to slow to 7.5 per cent this year from 8 per cent last year; Credit growth in the Middle East and Africa to fall back from 8.3 per cent to 5.8 per cent.

Emerging Europe is an outlier, however. Fitch predicts credit growth of 3.7 per cent in 2014 from 2.3 per cent last year.

It could be about time for banks to rein in their lending in certain emerging and Asian markets, Fitch says.

From the report: "Since 2010 there have been credit-to-GDP increases of 30-40 percentage points in three countries: China, Hong Kong and Mongolia, with strong house price inflation continuing in Hong Kong, and to a lesser extent China. There was a similar rise in Singapore, but not coupled with any sign of asset bubbles. Credit-to-GDP has risen by over 20 percentage points in Thailand and Turkey.

Real credit growth remains subdued in most developed countries outside Asia, even though there are signs of a recovery."

Americas

US The Federal Reserve may have cut its forecast for growth this year, but there was further evidence on Thursday that the economy is rebounding from a weak first quarter.

An index of manufacturing in the Philadelphia area climbed to its highest level since September

The index from the Philadelphia branch of the Federal Reserve climbed to 17.8 from 15.4 in May. Economists had forecast the index would come in at 14.

June's increase is the fourth in a row, cementing confidence that the sector has recovered from the winter disruption.

The index also revealed pressure on both prices and the jobs market. Its employment index climbed 4 points, while a measure of prices paid jumped 12 points.

Despite tepid wage growth the US labour market is, on balance, a bright spot for policymakers at the Federal Reserve.

And the latest initial jobless claim figures would have done little to shake that view.

The number of new claims from Americans for benefits fell 6,000 to 312,000 last week, the Labor department said on Thursday. Economists had forecast a figure of 313,000.

Gennadiy Goldberg, a strategist at TD Securities, said: "The march lower in jobless claims over the past several months has remained a particularly positive trend for employment, hinting at ongoing slack absorption as the layoff side of the labor equation shows gradual improvement to pre-recession levels."

While the Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its forecast for US economic growth this year, it also predicted that unemployment would decline more quickly than it has forecast.

A combination of an improvement in the economy as well as the retirement of the baby boomer generation has helped drive down unemployment from its recession high of 10 per cent.

Asia Pacific

New Zealand The economy grew at its fastest annual pace in six and a half years in the first quarter, as construction soared.

GDP expanded by 3.8 per cent from a year ago, the fastest pace seen since the third quarter of 2007.

The figure was just ahead of consensus forecasts, mainly because the prior quarter's growth pace was revised up from 3.1 to 3.3 per cent. On a quarterly basis, GDP expanded 1 per cent.

"Solid Chinese demand for New Zealand dairy is supporting surging export volumes, while food-based manufacturing is expanding robustly," said analysts at Moody'sAnalytics in a preview.

The upbeat figures support the Reserve Bank of New Zealand's decision to alter its focus and hike interest rates three times this year, as inflation concerns outweigh growth concerns.

Details of the report show the construction sector expanded by 12.5 per cent, while the mining sector grew 6.3 per cent. Wholesale trade fell 1.5 per cent, partly offsetting the growth.

"The reconstruction of Christchurch and the steady pickup in residential construction in Auckland remain the key drivers of construction and ancillary industries," Moody'sAnalytics added.

The Kiwi dollar fell 0.2 per cent just after the report came out, to 87.2 US cents. It had gained 0.9 per cent overnight and is up 3.5 per cent in the last two weeks, as investors throw cash into higher-yielding currencies.

RBNZ Governor Graeme Wheeler said last week that the Kiwi economy "has considerable momentum" and indicated the central bank would continue tightening monetary policy.

Europe

UK Sales on Britain's high streets slackened by 0.5 per cent in May compared to April, the first monthly decline since January and reflecting lower fuel prices.

That came after a bounce in April, when consumers spent more on food due to clement weather and due to price promotions around Easter.

Thanks in part to fierce supermarket competition, price cuts took their toll across the sector, with average prices of goods falling 0.7 per cent in May.

Year on year, retail sales were still up 3.9 per cent, however, confirming that the UK economy is in better shape than in 2013.

Markit Shares Trade Higher in Debut; Wall Street Data Provider's Shares Rise 11% in First Day of Trading

Shares of Wall Street financial-data provider Markit Ltd. rose 11% Thursday, a day after the London company completed a $1.3 billion initial public offering.

Canada's largest pension fund, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, said Thursday it would acquire 10.4 million shares at the IPO price of $24 each, giving the fund a 6% stake. On Thursday, the shares rose $2.70 on the Nasdaq to close at $26.70.

Lance Uggla, the company's chief executive, said in an interview he was "delighted" with the investor response. He said he thought investors had valued the company fairly and that having the Canadian pension plan as a large shareholder "definitely gives a lot of credibility to our offering."

Markit's shares were sold in the offering at a discount to the valuations of some peers, based on measures of earnings and stock-market value. Markit's $4.8 billion market value at the end of first-day trading is about 11 times its trailing 12-month earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That compares with roughly 12 times for MSCI Inc., 13 times for Verisk Analytics Inc. and 20 times for IHS Inc., according to FactSet.

The Canadian pension fund's purchase fell short of the $450 million of shares the fund said it had considered buying. A CPPIB spokeswoman cited heavy investor demand for the shares.

Twelve of the world's largest banks, which also underwrote the offering, were expected to sell shares in the IPO, along with hedge fund Eton Park Capital Management LP and current and former Markit employees.

Markit has become one of Wall Street's most important data providers for the derivatives, bonds, loans and foreign-exchange markets, generating $947.9 million in revenue and $147 million in profit last year.

The company chose to list in the U.S. because of the country's large investor base. Having less than $1 billion in annual revenue qualified it as a so-called emerging-growth company under the JOBS Act, meaning less paperwork filed publicly ahead of the IPO.

Markit incorporated in Bermuda just before its U.S. listing.

Mr. Uggla said investors were betting on the company's ability to sell tools that would help customers comply with a raft of new regulations in the wake of the financial crisis, such as reporting transactions, connecting to derivatives clearinghouses and reducing risk. "Markit is at the center of that," he said.

He didn't think the reduction in ownership by large banks would affect the company's ability to provide core data products. "We take data from far more financial market participants than we have shareholders," he said.

Corrections & Amplifications Markit incorporated in Bermuda just before its U.S. listing. A previous version of this story misstated that it incorporated in Bermuda following its U.S. listing.

Investors Back U.K. Manager Neil Woodford's New Fund; Asset Managers, Institutional Investors Commit to CF Woodford Equity Income Fund

A new fund from Neil Woodford, one of the U.K.'s highest-profile money managers, started trading Thursday backed by investors who are betting he can maintain strong returns after quitting long-term employer Invesco Perpetual to set up his own firm.

U.K. asset managers Hargreaves Lansdown and St James's Place both took money out of Invesco and bought into Mr. Woodford's fund. Several other large institutional investors also said they have committed to the CF Woodford Equity Income Fund from Woodford Investment Management LLP.

"Neil has a 25 year track record and we had to follow the manager," said Mark Dampier, head of research at Hargreaves Lansdown, which had 43.4 billion of assets under administration or management at the end of 2013. Hargreaves Lansdown has invested about 450 million in the Woodford fund.

Mr. Woodford, 54, joined Invesco, based in Henley-on-Thames in London's commuter belt in 1988 after studying at the University of Exeter and London Business School. He oversaw around 27 billion across six different funds, scoring returns of about 12% annually over the last five years.

He is known for contrarian views and in 2008, he sold out of bank stocks before the worst of the financial crisis.

His departure from Invesco was announced in October 2013, though he stayed with the firm until April 2014.

"My decision to leave is a personal one based on my views about where I see long-term opportunities in the fund-management industry," Mr. Woodford said in a statement at the time.

The new Woodford fund mostly will invest in U.K.-listed equities, although up to 20% could be placed in overseas names. The estimated yield at launch is 4.0%. WIM declined to comment on the total amount raised so far or the fund's performance on the first day of trading.

Mr. Woodford's exit from Invesco dealt a blow to the U.K.'s largest retail fund manager, with some funds and employees following the near-celebrity fund manager out the door.

St James's Place said in April it was withdrawing an 8 billion mandate from Invesco and investing half the money in Mr. Woodford's new fund.

"Our decision to leave Invesco Perpetual was based on the fact that we thought out clients' interests would be best served elsewhere," said Chris Ralph, chief investment officer at St. James's Place. "An exit like Neil's would have an impact on any business and Invesco Perpetual is no different."

According to data provider FE Analytics, the Invesco Perpetual Income fund experienced outflows of 1.6 billion in the past six months to the end of January this year, while the Invesco Perpetual High Income fund lost 937 million over the same period. Both were managed by Mr. Woodford ahead of his departure.

"I would be very surprised if we don't see more assets going to Woodford from Invesco," said Simon Evans-Cook, multi-asset manager at Premier Investment Management. Mr. Evans-Cook declined to comment on whether he had invested with Mr. Woodford's new fund.

Several key staff, including a number of portfolio managers, also have left Invesco for Mr. Woodford's new venture.

Mark Barnett, Invesco's head of U.K. equities who has taken over Mr. Woodford funds, said on a conference call Thursday that new hires are in the pipeline. He also said recent redemptions, were running at a "natural rate" and were "very manageable."

'Quiet Majority' Gets Time in the Spotlight

As activist investors continue to drive change at the companies they target, efforts are under way to head them off at the pass.

Citing a communication gap between companies and their shareholders, new firms are cropping up to bring boards and investors closer together. The latest launches this week, pairing a Wall Street veteran and financial backer BlackRock Inc., the world's largest asset manager.

Called iiWisdom and founded by David Weil, a former mergers-and-acquisitions banker at Credit Suisse Group AG and Merrill Lynch, the firm plans to use data analytics to spot shareholder unrest before it boils over.

The goal is to reach past outspoken activists to what Mr. Weil called "the quiet majority" -- money managers who rarely weigh in publicly on corporate matters but whose simmering displeasure can propel activists to victory.

Chief executives and boards, meanwhile, have expressed growing concern about distracting battles with activists. Investors such as Nelson Peltz and Carl Icahn have shown no company is immune by taking on giants like PepsiCo Inc. and Apple Inc.

"Right now, boards, they tend to hear mostly from the guys who shout the loudest," Mr. Weil said. "We're trying to give all investors the chance to be heard, and give directors the collective wisdom of their shareholders."

The efforts come as some executives are lamenting the challenge of managing companies under increasing pressure from shareholders. In comments Monday at The Wall Street Journal's CFO Network conference in Washington, PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Indra Nooyi said U.S. investors are too fixated on short-term results.

In the U.S. "it's always about: How is the quarter looking?" she said. "I think we need to bring that balance back into the dialogue today."

A bevy of advisers are lining up to help bridge the gap between companies and their shareholders -- a gap some say has contributed to the rising success of activist investors.

CamberView Partners LLC -- founded in 2012 by Frank Yeary, a former M&A banker at Citigroup Inc., and Abe Friedman, a former corporate-governance chief at BlackRock -- provides tailored advice to companies in the throes of, or seeking to head off, a proxy fight.

Last fall, an alliance of lawyers, board members and money managers calling itself the Shareholder-Director Exchange published a set of guidelines to facilitate meetings between investors and companies. And earlier this year, a task force assembled by the Conference Board, a research and advisory firm, published its own set of recommendations for strengthening those relationships.

The driving force behind the new ventures is the idea investors and companies often talk past each other, when they are talking at all. Smaller shareholders can struggle to get the attention of directors and management, while larger ones sometimes pull their punches, fearful of losing access, experts say.

And even the best intentions can be hampered by logistics. Companies have hundreds of institutional shareholders but only a handful of directors to meet with them. Similarly, big asset managers are invested in thousands of companies but may lack the ability to talk to all of them.

"There has been this disconnect in the way these groups are communicating," said Brian Rogers, chairman of T. Rowe Price Group Inc. and a member of the Conference Board task force. "That breeds frustration."

That frustration is playing out at the ballot box, where institutional investors are more willing than in the past to support dissidents or vote against management proposals.

T. Rowe Price, for example, backed 52% of activist board nominees between July 2009 and July 2013, according to proxy-solicitation firm D.F. King & Co. Fidelity Management & Research did so 44% of the time. Historical data is hard to come by, but experts say the trend has accelerated over the past few years, turning once-reliable management allies into potential supporters of dissidents.

Earlier this year, an activist succeeded in ousting the entire board of commercial landlord CommonWealth REIT, backed by several large institutional investors, according to people familiar with the vote. Last year, steel-parts maker Timken Co. agreed to split in two after activist Ralph Whitworth, supported by a major California pension fund, rallied widespread shareholder support for the move.

Board shake-ups may be inevitable at underperforming companies. But often, activists seize on dissatisfaction bred by more mundane gripes, which could be eased by more-regular feedback, advisers say.

Mr. Weil's iiWisdom will poll institutional investors about governance practices at individual companies and analyze the data for a fee. By quantifying investor sentiment on board diversity, management oversight and other issues, the firm hopes to give directors a push toward needed fixes.

The firm will initially poll shareholders of 50 large companies, including Coca-Cola Co., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Apple.

These companies will get the insights for free, though iiWisdom plans to eventually expand and charge for its reports.

"For many years, there's been a gaping hole in terms of how investors communicate with directors," said Robert C.S. Monks, a former chairman of proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. who is an investor in iiWisdom. "We're trying to fill it."

Markit Raises $1.3 Billion in Expanded IPO; Financial-Data Provider's IPO Size Increased to 53.5 Million Shares, Priced at $24 Each

Owners of Markit Ltd., the Wall Street financial-data provider, raised $1.3 billion in a larger-than-expected initial public offering of shares, according to people familiar with the deal.

The offering priced at $24 per share, in the middle of the expected $23- to $25-a-share range, the people said. But the size of the deal was increased to 53.5 million shares from an expected 45.7 million shares, and a larger amount was raised as a result, they added.

At the IPO price, the company's market value is around $4.3 billion, based on the number of shares outstanding after the deal.

Wall Street's biggest banks are the major beneficiaries of the deal, with 12 of them expected to sell portions of their stakes in Markit. The London company has become one of Wall Street's most important data providers for the credit, derivatives, bonds, loans and foreign-exchange markets, generating $947.9 million in revenue and $147 million in profit last year.

The banks raised a total of $1.2 billion, increasing the number of shares they sold to 49 million from 41 million, people familiar with the deal said. Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. were among the banks expected to sell shares, along with smaller sellers such as hedge fund Eton Park Capital Management LP and several current and former employees.

Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, the massive pension fund with more than $219 billion in assets under management, was expected to be the largest buyer in the IPO. It said in the IPO prospectus that it intended to buy $450 million worth of shares at the IPO price.

The company's largest shareholders including an employee benefit trust, private-equity firm General Atlantic LLC and Singapore state-owned investment company Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd. weren't set to sell any stock.

The shares were sold at a discount to the valuations of some peers, based on its market value and past-year earnings. Markit's $4.3 billion market value at the IPO price is about 10 times its 2013 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. That is a lower multiple than for other financial-data providers, such as roughly 12 times for MSCI Inc., 13 times for Verisk Analytics Inc., and 20 times for IHS Inc., according to FactSet.

That could set the stage for the shares to rally when they open for trading Thursday morning on the Nasdaq Stock Market, under the symbol "MRKT."

Stakes for the deal were especially high for the Wall Street banks selling shares because they were also the deal's underwriters. Given equal leading roles in the deal, they stand to earn fees of about 4% of the proceeds raised, or about $51 million. How that will be distributed among them remains to be seen.

Rothschild, the financial advisory group, played a role advising the company and managing the banks, according to the prospectus. It stands to earn a large fee, as well.

Markit's management has spent the past several days crisscrossing the U.S. on an IPO marketing tour. After starting in London, they met with investors in New York, Boston, Chicago, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, San Francisco, Denver and Los Angeles, according to marketing materials reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Their focus was explaining to prospective investors how the company makes money from its more than 3,000 institutional clients by charging fees for its services and occasionally for licensing. A recent marketing document used the tag line "the science of finance" to describe Markit's now-sprawling business.

But the company also acknowledged in its prospectus risks including litigation, and the possibility of paying fines, related to government investigations of abuses in the derivatives market.

Corrections & Amplifications

The size of Markit's IPO was increased to 53.5 million shares from an expected 45.7 million shares. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said it was increased to 49.3 million shares.

Banks Open Vault For Hotel Deals

By Craig Karmin and Eliot Brown

Banks are checking back into the hotel business.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG and other firms are ramping up lending for lodging acquisitions and debt refinancing to levels not seen since before the financial crisis. Lenders made $31 billion in hotel loans last year, nearly double the 2012 level, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, while all commercial-property lending rose 47%.

Credit is flowing against a backdrop of rising room rates, limited new construction and a spike in leisure and business travel in big cities such as New York and Los Angeles. Net operating income increased by 10% for the average U.S. hotel in 2013, according to PKF Consulting USA, which predicts "double digit annual gains" through 2015.

The easy money means hotel companies and investors can use less of their own cash to make deals, potentially amplifying returns. Debt now accounts for more than 67% of a hotel purchase price, up from about 56% in 2010, says PKF. That level is just below the high of around 70% in 2005.

Some of the largest hotel transactions have relied even more heavily on debt. NorthStar Realty Finance and a partner this month borrowed about $840 million from J.P. Morgan to acquire a 47-hotel portfolio for about $1 billion.

"There's been a sea-change during the past two months," says Monty Bennett, chief executive officer of Ashford Hospitality Trust, a Dallas-based hotel investor. "It's pretty close to the 2007 lending environment again."

The market isn't as frothy as it was at the peak in 2007, when a record $73 billion in loans tied to hotels were made, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Then, loan-to-value ratios could be as high as 90%.

Still, some analysts are warning that debtholders could be in trouble if the rosy outlook for hotels or the economy fades. Many hotel loans have floating interest rates, which means any rise in rates from rock-bottom levels will make it harder for borrowers to pay back their debt.

"Any hiccup in the economy could cause the value of the property to fall below the value of the debt, or cash flow might not cover interest payments," says Ryan Meliker, a hotel analyst at MLV & Co.

That scenario played out on a large scale in 2009, when hotel values plummeted by half from their 2006 peak, according to STR Analytics. That loss in value led numerous hotel owners to hand over their properties to lenders.

Concerns are rising at Moody's Investors Service because the ratings company prefers hotel loans to be made based on a measure of revenue per room that is relatively close to historic norms. "A number of hotels are getting outside our comfort zone on that basis," says Tad Philipp, head of commercial real-estate research at Moody's.

Banks seek to reduce their risk by packaging many loans into commercial mortgage-backed securities and selling them to investors. They can also sell the junior portions of the debt, which are riskier because they absorb the initial losses if an owner defaults.

Private-equity and real-estate investment firms like PCCP LLC and Starwood Mortgage Capital are getting into the game, too, sometimes providing a junior loan on top of a bank's senior mortgage. Some life insurers also are making more senior loans to hotel owners, but they usually require a larger percentage of equity from the borrower than banks demand.

Compared with other sectors of real estate, owners of hotels have been taking on slightly less debt. Owners of apartment buildings routinely secure loans for more than 70% of the value of their properties.

But hotels are considered far riskier investments compared with apartments, office buildings and malls. Given that rates change daily, income is highly volatile depending on the state of the economy, while office buildings and malls have more stable cash flows given long-term leases.

For instance, a 126-property hotel portfolio that is being sold to American Realty Capital Hospitality Trust Inc. generated $102 million of cash flow before debt service in 2013, and its owners and lenders are expecting it will stay near that level in coming years, according to loan documents. But three years earlier, the properties generated just $78 million.

Even so, American Realty last month agreed to pay $1.9 billion for the portfolio of mostly limited-service hotels with only $270 million of equity.

For top-performing properties or iconic hotels, analysts say, owners have had an easy time refinancing. Woodridge Capital Partners and Oaktree Capital Management acquired San Francisco's famed Fairmont Hotel atop Nob Hill for $197 million two years ago. With plans to invest $21 million for hotel renovations, the partners this month took out a loan on the property from J.P. Morgan for $221 million.

"If you can finance at these levels," says Mr. Meliker of MLV & Co., "it's like selling the hotel in advance."

But the competition among lenders also is making it tough for some. For example, Wells Fargo & Co. has made a few recent hotel loans, which the bank keeps on its balance sheet. But Christopher Jordan, an executive in Wells Fargo's hotel-lending group, says that he often finds himself competing against global banks and private-equity firms.

"Right now it's a trading business, not a lending business," Mr. Jordan says.

Real Estate
Lenders Open Vault for Hotel Deals; Banks Made $31 Billion in Hotel Loans Last Year

Banks are checking back into the hotel business.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Deutsche Bank AG and other firms are ramping up lending for lodging acquisitions and debt refinancing to levels not seen since before the financial crisis. Lenders made $31 billion in hotel loans last year, nearly double the 2012 level, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, while all commercial-property lending rose 47%.

Credit is flowing against a backdrop of rising room rates, limited new construction and a spike in leisure and business travel in big cities such as New York and Los Angeles. Net operating income increased by 10% for the average U.S. hotel in 2013, according to PKF Consulting USA, which predicts "double digit annual gains" through 2015.

The easy money means hotel companies and investors can use less of their own cash to make deals, potentially amplifying returns. Debt now accounts for more than 67% of a hotel purchase price, up from about 56% in 2010, says PKF. That level is just below the high of around 70% in 2005.

Some of the largest hotel transactions have relied even more heavily on debt. NorthStar Realty Finance and a partner this month borrowed about $840 million from J.P. Morgan to acquire a 47-hotel portfolio for about $1 billion.

"There's been a sea-change during the past two months," says Monty Bennett, chief executive officer of Ashford Hospitality Trust, a Dallas-based hotel investor. "It's pretty close to the 2007 lending environment again."

The market isn't as frothy as it was at the peak in 2007, when a record $73 billion in loans tied to hotels were made, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Then, loan-to-value ratios could be as high as 90%.

Still, some analysts are warning that debtholders could be in trouble if the rosy outlook for hotels or the economy fades. Many hotel loans have floating interest rates, which means any rise in rates from rock-bottom levels will make it harder for borrowers to pay back their debt.

"Any hiccup in the economy could cause the value of the property to fall below the value of the debt, or cash flow might not cover interest payments," says Ryan Meliker, a hotel analyst at MLV & Co.

That scenario played out on a large scale in 2009, when hotel values plummeted by half from their 2006 peak, according to STR Analytics. That loss in value led numerous hotel owners to hand over their properties to lenders.

Concerns are rising at Moody's Investors Service because the ratings company prefers hotel loans to be made based on a measure of revenue per room that is relatively close to historic norms. "A number of hotels are getting outside our comfort zone on that basis," says Tad Philipp, head of commercial real-estate research at Moody's.

Banks seek to reduce their risk by packaging many loans into commercial mortgage-backed securities and selling them to investors. They can also sell the junior portions of the debt, which are riskier because they absorb the initial losses if an owner defaults.

Private-equity and real-estate investment firms like PCCP LLC and Starwood Mortgage Capital are getting into the game, too, sometimes providing a junior loan on top of a bank's senior mortgage. Some life insurers also are making more senior loans to hotel owners, but they usually require a larger percentage of equity from the borrower than banks demand.

Compared with other sectors of real estate, owners of hotels have been taking on slightly less debt. Owners of apartment buildings routinely secure loans for more than 70% of the value of their properties.

But hotels are considered far riskier investments compared with apartments, office buildings and malls. Given that rates change daily, income is highly volatile depending on the state of the economy, while office buildings and malls have more stable cash flows given long-term leases.

For instance, a 126-property hotel portfolio that is being sold to American Realty Capital Hospitality Trust Inc. generated $102 million of cash flow before debt service in 2013, and its owners and lenders are expecting it will stay near that level in coming years, according to loan documents. But three years earlier, the properties generated just $78 million.

Even so, American Realty last month agreed to pay $1.9 billion for the portfolio of mostly limited-service hotels with only $270 million of equity.

For top-performing properties or iconic hotels, analysts say, owners have had an easy time refinancing. Woodridge Capital Partners and Oaktree Capital Management acquired San Francisco's famed Fairmont Hotel atop Nob Hill for $197 million two years ago. With plans to invest $21 million for hotel renovations, the partners this month took out a loan on the property from J.P. Morgan for $221 million.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Zurich's eco-warrior leads quiet green revolution; Interview

Chief investment officer Cecilia Reyes tells Chris Flood 'doing well and doing good are not mutually exclusive'

Cecilia Reyes would not strike many people as a typical "eco-warrior".

But the immaculately dressed chief investment officer of Zurich Insurance Group is a quiet revolutionary.

Petite and softly spoken, Ms Reyes was a driving force behind Zurich's decision last year to invest $1bn in "green" bonds that finance projects aimed at mitigating climate change.

"Doing well financially and doing good are not mutually exclusive. We can do both at the same time," says the 55-year old, a point she emphasises several times during the interview.

But sceptics question whether institutional investors such as Zurich will commit sufficient capital to make a significant difference in the fight against global warming. The $1bn investment is less than 0.5 per cent of the insurer's $214bn portfolio.

Ms Reyes counters that the $1bn commitment is "just a starting point" designed to attract other issuers and new investors to the small but rapidly growing green bond market .

"Why would you not invest in green bonds if they provide returns commensurate with their investment risks and at same time support environmentally friendly projects?" asks Ms Reyes, who was born in Manila and now has dual Swiss and Philippine nationality.

She argues that there is "huge potential" for green bonds, even if these instruments grow to just 1 per cent of the $57tn asset pool held by institutional investors globally.

Green bonds, says Ms Reyes, are one of the pillars of Zurich's responsible investing strategy.

"Responsible investing is part of our ambition to be the best global insurer. But we cannot achieve this without embedding responsible investing standards throughout both our core business activities, insurance and investment."

Her aim is to make responsible investing "part of Zurich's DNA".

While integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations into an investment process might sound straightforward, evaluating how these factors affect risk and returns of individual securities and different asset classes is not easy, she says.

Zurich uses external managers to run about two-thirds of its investment assets. Ms Reyes acknowledges that Zurich's internal and external managers need to do more work to properly assess the importance of non-financial factors such as environmental risks inherent in companies' business models.

"If non-financial risks are integrated in the assessment of investment opportunities, we truly believe that we will deliver better risk-adjusted returns over the long term," she says.

But sceptics doubt if ESG policies really work. A recent analysis by Hermes Fund Managers found environmental and social policies were a complete waste of time in terms of investment returns.

Ms Reyes, however, is convinced that ESG policies can drive change.

"As it becomes clear that investors ascribe value to non-financial ESG factors, companies will act accordingly," she says.

As part of its responsible investing agenda, Zurich is reshaping its private equity portfolio. It is raising allocations to PE managers that have declared an interest in making "impact" investments to address pressing social or environmental issues as well as generating financial returns.

Property and cleantech funds that invest in technologies such as solar and hydro power are other areas of interest for Zurich's strategy of bringing impact investing into the mainstream.

It is also working with a non-governmental organisation to deliver health services in the developing world, an area where Miss Reyes sees potential for further expansion.

"We believe that return-seeking private capital has an important role to play in helping NGOs deliver a positive impact in the communities [where] they are working," says Ms Reyes.

She points out that many observers confuse being a responsible investor with ethical investing. But assets such as tobacco and fossil fuels eschewed by those with an ethical mandate are not excluded from Zurich's portfolio.

Ms Reyes believes excluding large parts of the investable universe would not be consistent with Zurich's fiduciary duties or its aim of generating superior risk-adjusted returns.

However, some analysts argue that Zurich's investment performance has weakened, requiring holdings of high coupon bonds to be sold last year to support dividends.

It is a charge Ms Reyes rejects. She says Zurich has outperformed its internal liability benchmark by 800 basis points over the past decade and that investment returns have improved in the five years since the end of 2008 compared with the previous five-year period.

She acknowledges that Zurich has "benefited hugely" from the long bull market in fixed income and insists that the company has little to fear from rising interest rates, which will increase the discount applied to future liabilities.

She also explains that while conventional fund managers seek to maximise risk-adjusted returns, the investment strategy of an insurer is designed to ensure it can meet all its liabilities (future claims).

With operations in more than 30 countries, investment management for Zurich is a "highly complex" business. Zurich's assets are not run as a single pool but managed in each country where it operates.

As Zurich believes markets are "fairly efficient over time", Ms Reyes says it aims to be "very conscious of the risks we take, those which are rewarded and those which are not".

A key principle is to avoid "unrewarded risks" such as betting on the future path of interest rates. It also avoids concentrated portfolios, frequent trading and investing in complex or opaque instruments, such as highly leveraged structured credit products.

She admits that there is still more to do for Zurich as a thought leader, championing the importance of being a responsible investor with industry peers, fund managers and asset owners.

Achieving this ambitious agenda should win favour with investors and eco-warriors alike.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Half of fund groups to disappear

Half of fund companies will disappear by 2030 as the asset management industry struggles to keep up with technological change, KPMG has warned.

Mid-sized fund groups with 100bn-300bn in assets are most at risk of dying out, says Tom Brown, global head of investment management at the consultancy.

Mr Brown believes many fund companies in this bracket have not recognised the importance of data analytics to drive investment performance or understand their client base.

He said: "If you don't get either of those trends, in 15 years' time you won't exist in your current form.

"This is a bit of a wake-up call to the industry. Unless the current players really [accept] the fact that it is a different world they are facing, over time they will be marginalised and taken over, or just shrink."

Fund companies that are slow to adapt could find themselves replaced or bought out by big technology groups such as Apple or Google, or large retailers that could become "the next big powerhouses in investment management", added Ian Smith, financial services strategy partner at KPMG.

He said: "Trusted brands that resonate and appeal to a more diverse client base as well as the younger generation, may be able to build scale quickly."

Joerg Ambrosius, head of asset manager solutions in Europe at State Street, the financial services company, said it was "definitely right" that many names will disappear from the fund industry as midsized asset managers shrink or merge.

Recent research carried out for State Street showed that 72 per cent of senior asset management executives believe there will be an increased opportunity for acquisitions in the next 12 months alone.

The Family Strategy for Building an Empire

By Keiko Morris

Anthony Malkin's family has been a player in New York City real estate for four generations.

So it may come as no surprise that Mr. Malkin, chief executive of Empire State Realty Trust Inc., regards his familiarity with the city's building-owning families as an asset for one growth strategy he has in mind.

In an increasingly pricey Manhattan market, he believes Empire can trade company stakes for properties owned by families, allowing the sellers to defer the tax consequences.

Other publicly traded real-estate investment trusts have used the strategy, but he said it made particular sense in New York City, where a significant amount of the commercial property remains in family hands.

"I believe these are better opportunities than going out into the market and just competing against the flood of capital," he said.

It has been eight months since Empire State Realty went public, and its stock has steadily risen in value after an initial stumble. The company made news in May when it announced it would exercise its options on ground and operating leases on a pair of Garment District buildings.

Mr. Malkin's immediate priority is the continuing overhaul of the company's Manhattan properties, especially the Empire State Building, and the effort to lease its commercial space at higher market-rate rents. But analysts see the logic in his inclination to offer equity stakes in the company to acquire assets.

"Tony Malkin likely has an impressive Rolodex to call from, although the jury is still out on how receptive an audience he'll find," said Jed Reagan, an analyst at Green Street Advisors Inc. "His chances will likely improve if Manhattan property values continue to rise and Empire can further its track record in the public market."

Sales prices of Manhattan office buildings rose 55% from the first quarter of 2012 through the same period this year, according to real estate data firm Real Capital Analytics Inc.

Empire State Realty's stock began trading in October at about $13 a share. Since then, the stock's value has risen 27%. Major institutional investors such as Invesco Ltd. and Vanguard Group have bought shares, Mr. Malkin noted.

The company has made headway renovating and modernizing its buildings, filling the available space with larger tenants and raising rents, analysts said. Many of the leases that have been in place for a while are below market rates, they noted. It has been replacing smaller tenants with tenants such as LinkedIn Corp. and Shutterstock Inc. Both signed leases for space in the Empire State Building.

So far, the company has spent about $450 million on redeveloping its Manhattan office portfolio. It expects to spend another $100 million to $140 million though 2016, almost all of it at the Empire State Building.

At the end of the first quarter, the company's buildings, many of which sit near the coveted Midtown South area, were about 87% occupied, up 7.2 percentage points from a year earlier, company executives said during a conference call. That 13% vacancy rate compares with 7.9% for Midtown South and 11.1% for Midtown, according to Cushman & Wakefield Inc.

Empire State Realty announced in May that it would exercise its options to acquire the ground and operating leases at 112 W. 34th St. and 1400 Broadway for $734 million cash, common stock and operating partnership units. The company has been managing the properties for nearly a decade.

The building on West 34th Street, which is across from Macy's Herald Square store, has about 90,000 square feet of retail that will become available in 2016 and could bring much higher rents, analysts said.

"We have been intimately familiar with these assets," said Mr. Malkin, who, with his father, Peter Malkin, recused himself from a board vote on the deal. "We weren't taking a risk."

The two buildings will help the company diversify its sources of income and the value of its portfolio. That value continues to rest heavily on the broad shoulders of the Empire State Building and its income-generating observatory, said Jordan Sadler, a senior analyst at Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.

Last year, the observatory generated $101.8 million in revenue and drew a record 4.3 million visitors, the company said.

"While it's a great business and a great opportunity, it just represents a concentration that could be more exposed to [factors such as] annual tourism as opposed to the overall economic conditions of New York City," Mr. Sadler said.

Down the road, Mr. Malkin said, he aimed to maintain the company's balance sheet with its modest debt ratio.

At the end of the first quarter, the company said its debt-to-market capitalization ratio was about 24%.

Green Street Advisors, which uses its own estimation of the company's market value, puts Empire's debt ratio at 28%, including expected debt that will be assumed with the two new properties.

This compares to an average debt ratio of 41% for the U.S. real-estate investment trust office sector. More important, Mr. Malkin said, a strong balance sheet with low debt would allow the company to "deploy capital when others cannot."

"We are always going to be omnivorous opportunivores," Mr. Malkin said.

The Family Strategy for Building an Empire; Anthony Malkin Regards Familiarity With Real Estate Families as Asset for Growth Strategy

Global Finance: Fed Wants Consequences If Banks' Plans Go Awry

By Alan Zibel

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve wants to keep banks from buying back shares and raising dividends if they don't fulfill their stated goals to shore up financing.

The Fed, in a proposal released Thursday, said it would limit banks' ability to distribute dividends or buy back shares if firms don't raise the levels of capital proposed as part of their official capital plan submitted to the central bank.

The Fed said some banks, as part of its annual stress tests, "included issuances of capital instruments in their capital plans, but didn't execute these planned issuances." The Fed said such behavior has the "potential to undermine" its ability to evaluate the financial health of banks, a goal of its annual test of lenders' financial strength.

The Fed didn't indicate which banks have failed to follow through on their planned capital raises.

Under the central bank's proposal, if a bank pledged to raise $50 million in common stock but only raised $25 million, the bank would be required to reduce its dividends and share repurchases by $25 million.

The Fed's stress-test results, released annually, have become a yearly ritual with major implications for the banking system. This year, the Fed rejected Citigroup Inc.'s capital plan, and Bank of America Corp. was forced to scale back a plan to buy back shares and boost its dividend after finding an error in its capital level.

The central bank also proposed more-technical changes, including telling banks that they aren't required to submit revised versions of their capital plans if their initial proposals are rejected by the Fed. Banks can choose to resubmit if they want to seek board approval in the wake of a rejection.

Anna Krayn, a director in the stress-testing practice at Moody'sAnalytics, said the Fed proposal "could tie managements' hands in ways that might not be very beneficial" to the bank. In the past, she said, a bank might have planned to raise new capital but have delayed doing so because of market conditions. That might be harder to do under the Fed proposal, because it could prompt the regulator to restrict dividends in response, she said.

The Fed also proposed to change the date at which banks are required to submit their stress-test plans to April 5 from Jan. 5.

Bankers have complained privately that the current schedule requires them to work heavy hours through the holidays in late December to meet the January deadline.

Wells Fargo & Co. Chief Executive John Stumpf hinted at some of those frustrations at a conference last December, saying the process "means holidays for us" that include "an hour or two off for Thanksgiving."

The One Change That Could Make HR Departments More Effective

Most employees have at least one complaint about HR departments. With this in mind, we asked The Experts: What one change could make HR departments more effective?

This discussion relates to a recent Leadership Report and formed the basis of a discussion on The Experts blog in April 2014.

What HR Departments Can Learn From Hollywood

ROSABETH MOSS KANTER: HR should get into show business. If talent is key to company success, then HR professionals should take cues from Broadway, Hollywood and Bollywood. After all, HR people are casting managers, looking for the best people and best fit, in order to give audiences the best experience a core Disney premise. HR departments can be set and costume designers, creating a great work environment that's disciplined but also fun. They are production directors, making sure that everyone works together well. They reward star performers. They should redefine career paths to be more like the Hollywood model, with fewer fixed jobs and more temporary teams. They increasingly live in flexible project-based organizations, in which teams are brought together to create a "show" and then disband and re-form for another one.

HR departments have always been a little schizophrenic. There's the side that is part of finance and administration counting heads, managing the payroll, processing entries and exits. And there's another part that should be allied with marketing and sales selling the company to prospective and actual employees, and through culture-building or organization development, ensuring that employees help sell its virtues to customers. I think computers can handle the routine tasks on the administration side. I'd like to see the marketing side of HR get more emphasis. HR should be at the center of developing community-service projects that motivate employees while they improve the world. And they should give line managers the tools and training to put on the best possible shows for customers.

How HR Departments Can Create an Innovation Culture

MICHAEL WOLF: The mission and focus of HR departments needs to reflect that innovation happens in teams, not departments or divisions. HR must shift from carrying out personnel tasks such as benefits and policies to playing an active role in forming, nurturing and rewarding great teams bringing together the human resources to innovate through new products, new features and new ways of delighting customers.

Practically every CEO talks about building an "innovation culture." HR should be central to cultivating that culture. The reality is that companies need to create examples of innovation successes to give the rest of their organization a proof of concept that they can emulate.

HR's role can be critical in casting the right set of talents to form those teams. It isn't enough for HR to recruit people through the outside hiring process. They must look inside of their organizations and recognize individuals who strike the right balance between a diverse perspective and the ability to collaborate. HR can also advise senior executives to select effective group leaders. The weight of bringing together the right mix of people is even greater since small groups are usually the most effective. In fact, the best teams should be sized by the "two pizza rule" (a term alternatively attributed to either Jeff Bezos of Amazon or Brad Smith of Intuit) no larger than could be fed by two pizzas. Finally, HR can act as the strategic business partner to set out the team's objectives and ensure that the team is on track to achieve them.

Ultimately, great teams depend on great people, and teams can change a corporate culture. By moving from a centralized service function into an active role of facilitating small groups of the best people, HR can become the valued enabler and advocate of innovation.

What Most HR Executives Are Lacking

RITA GUNTHER MCGRATH: Companies should insist that nobody gets to have an important job in HR unless they have actually run a P&L, developed a strategy or executed against a major organizational change. The big problem with many HR departments is that they are staffed by career HR people who may be very capable but whose knowledge of actual leadership activities is purely theoretical. The best HR people I've worked with don't just echo the eternal HR whine "We want to be business partners and have a seat at the table." The best HR people know how to see opportunities for improving the organization, know how to tailor incentive and development plans to foster the engagement and retention of critical people, and don't wait to be invited to the table, they earn their spot there.

To give two examples: One European client came to Columbia to design an executive leadership program for people who had achieved positions of importance primarily because of technical expertise. The main driver of the program housed, temporarily, in the HR department had found resources for the needs assessment, benchmarked best practices, persuaded senior leadership that this was really important, and played a pivotal role in what became a highly regarded three-year intervention whose effects have been lasting.

In a second example, for a major conglomerate making an acquisition, it was the HR team that went through the talent of the target company, identified the "must keeps" and put together a pitch for the CEO to make a personal phone call outlining the post-acquisition role for the desirable person, vastly increasing the chance that they would remain with the merged company. Now that's driving effectiveness and truly strategic outcomes.

Oh, and one more thing. Having respected line managers serve a stint in HR would do a lot for its reputation as a career backwater.

How 'Hackathons' Can Help Companies Find the Best Employees

KARL ULRICH: The "hackathon" has emerged as an effective way to find exceptional engineering talent. Aspiring software developers gather for a two-day event in which individuals and teams compete to develop the best application in response to some compelling challenge. Judges (and increasingly sponsors) observe the results and designate the most successful efforts. For instance, the PennApps hackathon at my own university attracts more than 2,000 applicants from all over the country and is sponsored by Facebook, Amazon and Google, among others.

For software engineering, a domain in which a great coder can be worth 10 times more than an average coder, the hackathon is a powerful tool to accurately reveal who is great and who is only average. Plus, the mere fact that you travel to a hackathon, and commit 48 hours without sleep to the quest, reveals quite a bit about your abilities. No wonder the most powerful technology companies line up to sponsor the events and observe the outcomes.

But, in management more generally, say in operations or marketing, isn't a great employee worth 10 times more than an average employee? Might there be an event analogous to the hackathon for identifying and recruiting managerial talent? True, it's hard to imagine the appeal of a competition for who can run the best meeting or make the best PowerPoint deck. But, imagine a series of events over two days for revealing who is great at, say, generating ideas, giving a sales pitch, organizing a team to accomplish a goal, or improving the productivity of a process. We know that conventional interviews are terrible at predicting job performance.

Let's take inspiration from the hackathon and devise some fun, compelling, and challenging events that reveal those who are great at what they do, not just those who went to the right schools and can ace an interview.

HR Needs to Get on the Front Lines

WAYNE MEKJIAN: HR departments work hard to help us recruit top talent in our respective industries. As we look at what lies ahead of us in the technology world, I encourage our HR colleagues to get closer to our business and immerse themselves into what we do every day. What obstacles do we face? What new or unique skill sets have we developed?

From there, we can have better discussions about training and recruitment needs to ensure we stay competitive in the marketplace. We may discover that in some locations, like New York, we need to have a completely different recruiting strategy than we do in Charlotte, N.C.

Why HR Departments Need More Authority

GIANPIERO PETRIGLIERI: For all the focus organizations put on change and innovation, human-resource departments are often among their most conservative quarters.

This is evident in the long-standing popularity of "best practices" that help replicate traditional power structures, and of "competency models" that play down the complex and context-dependent nature of managing and leading, and being recognized as doing so.

It is even more evident in HR's current romance with "big data" and its promise to predict performance, or more precisely, to select and reward people most like those who have been credited with the company's success in the past.

There is nothing wrong with processes, models and data, of course. The problem is turning them into a fetish with the pretense that they remove human subjectivity and bias, when in reality they just endorse the subjectivity and consolidate the biases of those people and practices cast as models for everyone else.

Human resources' conservatism, in short, resides in cloaking leaders' choices under a veil of pseudoscientific inevitability that inhibits the company from questioning whether reliance on those leaders, those choices and on the past is desirable or wise.

The inability to question leaders, choices and the past, in turn, makes it difficult to imagine a different future let alone build one. No wonder innovation is such an elusive aspiration.

HR's conservatism is hardly due to the timidity or ideology of individuals who occupy the function. Quite the contrary, HR executives I meet are often frustrated by the constraints it poses on their desire and ability to initiate or support strategic change.

It is most often a product of the ambiguous status the HR function still holds in many organizations.

While corporate rhetoric celebrates it as a strategic instrument, HR is often treated as a maintenance tool. The aim to stay aligned to the business so as to create value often translates into the demand to keep the organization running smoothly to earn legitimacy.

Take leadership development, for example, arguably the most forward-looking among HR's duties. Most of the practices that go under that banner have less to do with helping employees make their mark on the company's future, and more to do with socializing them into the company's current culture and giving them knowledge and skills to perform in their current job.

Having to earn their legitimacy by keeping the business running leaves many HR departments with no real mandate and few resources to attempt or support experimentation the very work they would happily do more of and companies need.

What changes, then, would make that possible?

Structurally, human resources needs to have a seat on the executive committee, so as to question and help shape strategy rather than simply having to bolster it.

Culturally, the ubiquitous corporate rhetoric of alignment needs to give way to one that celebrates committed divergence.

Those changes would free HR departments up to do more than keeping things running smoothly. They would empower HR to help the company question and reimagine, not just hold on to and replicate, itself.

Ready or Not, Here Come the Asian Regulators

Global investigations of banking activity are becoming a fact of life given that banking is now a global activity. So far most of the headlines have come from Western regulatory inquiries into the activities of Western banks in Western markets. But more of this heat is destined to shift to Asia, and bankers, local regulators and Western authorities alike will face new challenges.

Banks have come under international scrutiny most recently for alleged activities in foreign-exchange markets, where regulators charge that some banks manipulated benchmark rates. In many ways, this is a typical example of such an investigation. It involves 12 regulators on four continents investigating 15 banks, but with U.S. authorities firmly taking the lead.

Already there are signs that greater regulatory scrutiny will arise in Asia, too. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, for example, made clear its intention to investigate potentially manipulative foreign-exchange trading when it ordered several Hong Kong banks to engage in an internal review and share the results with HKMA investigators.

In other instances, Asian regulators are starting to run ahead of Western authorities. For example, China's regulators aggressively investigated British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, showing that they are willing to develop their own leads and break new investigative ground where U.S. or British regulators may be stymied by various logistical hurdles.

Asian regulators increasingly have a stake in investigations given the volume of financial activity occurring in the region. They also have a political motive -- which is not unreasonable -- to show their citizens that they are cracking down on illegal activity in their jurisdictions. More worrying, money may play a role, too. The still-unfolding investigation into allegations of rigging the London Interbank Offer Rate, or LIBOR, has yielded $6 billion in fines for the U.S. and British governments. Regulators in emerging markets may follow the U.S. example of aggressively defining fraud as a path to reap massive windfalls for their treasuries.

One challenge this poses for banks is the difficulty of crafting effective compliance rules and conducting internal investigations across a large number of geographic areas. Already this is on display in cases such as the forex investigation, in which bank directors and senior managers are scrambling to quantify their exposure. Management will be under increasing pressure to improve internal processes, take disciplinary action where warranted and manage the torrent of subpoenas and other demands from regulators.

Western banks also will need to adjust to the realities of being investigated by new jurisdictions. Each regulator brings with it different tools, procedural considerations and timelines. Defense counsel representing banking institutions and their managers must take note. For instance, Asian regulators and prosecutors are often able to compel individuals to answer questions. Where those regulators take the lead, U.S.-based defense counsel, conditioned to Constitutional protections, may struggle to navigate this more nuanced terrain.

Similarly, data privacy and state secrecy restrictions abound in Asia and result in much tighter controls on information flow. Where U.S. bank lawyers are accustomed to open access to documents to formulate a defense to charges, when faced with a purely local investigation run by local regulators they may encounter difficulties in accessing information stored overseas. Lawyers and defense counsel may find that they have to head overseas simply to review documents and formulate a defense.

Asian regulators also will face changes as they seek to take the lead on cross-border investigations. Especially as Asia-originated financial flows increase and regional watchdogs grow ever more experienced, they will be less willing to wait to follow the lead of other regulators. Authorities are starting to engage in their own risk-based examinations of banks and flexing their enforcement muscles more. It is only a matter of time before we witness a high-profile investigation of an Asia-based bank, led by a local regulator.

In taking the lead on global investigations local Asian regulators will likely need to adopt hiring and investigative practices that mirror their Western counterparts. The capability to conduct large scale document review using artificial intelligence tools is essential. China recently announced use of high-tech algorithms to detect insider trading, showing that they are adopting Western style investigation tools. Similarly, local regulators will need to hire lawyers and investigative staff who can pursue creative approaches rather than cookie-cutter approaches which are doomed to fail in today's hyper-complex financial markets.

American regulators will need to adjust to this new world, too. In recent years, American and European authorities have developed an informal framework for their cooperation on such matters, including exchange of documents and assistance from local authorities on extradition of individuals. That model appears to be working increasingly well as the number of cross border requests for assistance climb each year. Cooperating with Asian counterparts who have taken the initiative in launching an investigation will be a new experience for U.S. officials who are used to setting the investigative agenda and dictating the terms of cooperation.

While the emergence of Asian regulators in the global investigation scene will take time to fully develop, the process is well underway. Managers and Western regulators can't afford to ignore this trend.

The Property Report: Deutsche Unit Pays Up for a Piece of Florida Mall

By Robbie Whelan

The real-estate asset-management arm of Deutsche Bank AG has purchased a 50% stake in a Florida mall at one of the highest prices paid for a mall since the downturn.

Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management paid $375 million for half of St. Johns Town Center, a large open-air shopping mall in Jacksonville whose tenants include Louis Vuitton, The Gap and an Apple Store. The deal values the 621,000 square-foot mall at $750 million, not including some $270 million in debt on the property, according to several people familiar with the transaction.

The deal comes as prices are rising overall for top-quality malls with strong sales numbers, big sales markets and low vacancy rates. Low interest rates on bonds and a scarcity of high-quality properties for sale has driven up prices of assets like St. Johns Town Center, which has 176 stores and serves a large market stretching from Southern Georgia to Central Florida.

"For institutional property, the buyers are stacked up 10 or 20 deep," says Dan Fasulo, managing director of Real Capital Analytics Inc., a research firm. "There's a lack of investment alternatives, and it just keeps driving capital into commercial real estate."

The high price of the deal is reflected in how much Deutsche initially will get in yield -- or the capitalization rate, as it is known in the real-estate industry.

Cap rates, which measure the ratio of a property's annual net income to its value, are a common way of evaluating commercial-real-estate transactions. Falling cap rates typically are a reflection of rising values.

In the case of the St. Johns deal, the cap rate is about 4%, which is thought to be one of the lowest cap rates for the sale of a mall since the real-estate downturn. This year, the average cap rate on mall sales has been 5.8%, down from 6.8% last year, according to Real Capital Analytics.

"It's a really aggressive price," says Real Capital's Mr. Fasulo of the St. Johns deal. "But as much as it feels aggressive to me, you have pools of capital running around the world looking for a premium to government bonds."

The seller of the 50% stake is Ben Carter, the Atlanta-based real-estate developer who built St. Johns Town Center in 2005. The other one-half stake in the mall is owned by Simon Property Group Inc., the world's largest mall owner. Simon is retaining its stake and will continue to manage the property.

Mr. Carter, who also has property investments in Atlanta and Savannah, Ga., said in an interview he sold his stake in the Jacksonville mall because he wants to focus on different projects. He also said he thought he could get a good price because there are few high-quality, superregional malls on the market.

"My new business strategy is outlet malls and urban development. I don't see a great need in the Southeast for regional malls or large outlet centers," Mr. Carter said. "They're not making these assets anymore. There are very few of them in private hands, and the premium assets don't really trade."

St. Johns Town Center had an occupancy rate of 99% and sales of between $650 and $700 a square foot last year, according to Mr. Carter and brokers who worked on the deal.

Target Corp. and Dillard's Inc. own their own stores at the shopping center, and in October, upscale clothing retailer Nordstrom is expected to open a 138,000-square-foot location in the mall. About 70% of retailers at the mall are due for a lease renewal in the next year, Mr. Carter said. That will give the new owners a chance to renegotiate leases and increase rents.

Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management, formerly known as RREEF, invests in publicly traded real-estate investment trusts, private equity and debt, in addition to making direct property investments across the globe.

In recent months, the firm has bought office buildings in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., stakes in French department-store companies, apartments in suburban Chicago and a hotel in Times Square.

In a 2014 strategic outlook report produced by Deutsche in February, the company observed that "the split between the best- and worst-performing shopping centers grows ever wider and seems to be enduring," and said that it prefers to invest in "dominant regional malls and unique retail offerings" such as urban "high street" retail.

Green Street Advisors, a Newport Beach, Calif.-based real-estate research firm, estimates that last year, the highest-quality malls in the country, dubbed "A++" malls, produced $945 in sales a square foot of space. D-malls, the lowest-quality grade, produced $140 a square foot last year. Based on its sales per square foot last year, St. Johns Town Center would fall somewhere between an A and A+-rated mall.

The sale to Deutsche is "a good sign for owners who have this quality of properties in their portfolios," said Daniel Busch, an analyst who covers retail real estate for Green Street. "All the focus recently has been on selling low quality properties, the B malls. That's what's been on the market. These high-end transactions are few and far between. This transaction gives us a lot of confidence that values are holding up at the high end."

Stocks stall as bulls pause for breath

Tuesday 15:55 BST. Bourses are mixed as bulls pause for breath after a rally that left global stocks at record levels.

The more tentative tone is boosting the "haven" yen and leaving industrial metals weaker. The dollar index is up 0.2 per cent at 80.81, challenging four-month highs, while gold is up $9 to $1,261 an ounce.

Wall Street's S&P 500 is down 0.1 per cent from Monday's record closing high of 1,951.3. The FTSE Asia-Pacific index climbed 0.3 per cent to its highest close in six years and the FTSE Eurofirst 300 is inching up 0.2 per cent to its best level since January 2008, even as weakness in resources groups sees London's FTSE 100 retreat 0.3 per cent.

All this leaves the FTSE All-World index easing almost 0.1 per cent from its all-time high of 281.3, having been driven up of late by hopes global monetary policy will remain ultra-accommodative for some time to come despite evidence of improving economic conditions in the US and China.

There is little in the way of fresh news to challenge that rationale, so the timid mood in the current session is being blamed on a bout of caution as some argue that investors are overly sanguine and many developed markets have come too far, too fast.

Historically low volatility gauges suggest a reluctance to hedge amid a belief central bank policy will support asset prices. Meanwhile, the 14-day relative strength index for the S&P 500, a measure of the Wall Street benchmark's momentum, is 71.9, where any figure above 70 is considered in "overbought" territory.

Strategas Research notes that the proportion of bullish US investors "is now in the 95th percentile, which historically has produced below average forward returns".

Investors' attraction to equities has been fed partly by the meagre returns on offer from fixed income products as central banks intervene to suppress yields and inflation is considered quiescent.

Though still near historic lows, in the current session the yields on 10-year US and German paper are up 3 basis points to 2.64 per cent and 1.41 per cent respectively.

"Peripheral" eurozone bond yields are hardening by several basis points but remain near record lows following the European Central Bank's allusion to possible quantitative easing to tackle the bloc's deflationary pressures. The possibility of ECB QE is pushing the euro down 0.4 per cent to $1.3540, close to four-month lows.

More downward pressure on global prices could come from China, where producer prices fell for the 27th consecutive month, down 1.4 per cent in May from a year earlier, versus a decline of 2.0 per cent in April.

The data reflect weak demand as a result of "rampant overcapacity in sectors including steel and cement, which is keeping down prices of raw materials", said Moody'sAnalytics.

China's annual consumer price inflation was 2.5 per cent in May, higher than anticipated and up from an 18-month low of 1.8 per cent in April.

"Today's inflation data confirm our view that broader price pressures are stable and that concerns about [CPI] deflation, sparked by a shortlived fall in headline inflation in April, were overplayed," wrote Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics.

Hopes that the benign CPI would allow the People's Bank of China more leeway in loosening policy bolstered China's stock market, pushing the Shanghai Composite up 1.1 per cent and helping Hong Kong's Hang Seng gain 0.9 per cent.

Indeed, the PBoC is already tweaking financial regulations to encourage more lending, reducing the amount of cash reserves some smaller institutions must hold at the central bank.

Despite the market's gains, some analysts said the move was unlikely to have much of an impact because it targeted only certain banks.

"The PBoC has been resisting calls for blanket RRR [required reserve ratio] cuts as they believe the banking system is not short of liquidity and they do not want to further add leverage to the economy," wrote Jian Chang at Barclays.

Industrial commodities, usually highly sensitive to perceptions of China demand, appear to be focusing on the message sent by falling manufacturing prices. Copper is down 0.1 per cent at $6,667 a tonne, mirroring declines for most other metals. Brent crude is 23 cents lower at $1109.76 a barrel as traders keep a wary eye on violent militant activity in Iraq.

In Japan, the Nikkei 225 started with solid gains, building on Monday's three-month high, but turned as the yen strengthened, weighing on shares of exporters. The dollar is now down 0.2 per cent to Y102.37.

New data were discouraging: Japan's tertiary industry index, a key measure of output from the service sector, showed a 5.4 per cent decline in April, its worst monthly reading since the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The Nikkei 225 closed down 0.9 per cent.

Tech
Index Ventures Raises $543 Million for New Fund; Venture Capital Firm Aims to Seed Early-Stage Startups

LONDON Venture-capital firm Index Ventures said it raised  ¬400 million ($543 million) for a new fund aimed at seeding early-stage startups the latest foray by one of Europe's most active tech investors.

The company, with offices in Geneva, London and San Francisco, scours for investments in the U.S. and Europe. It has traditionally focused on nascent startup hubs like Tel Aviv, London, Berlin, Paris, Stockholm and the Nordics.

The firm is coming off an especially busy 12 months: Seven companies it sunk money into either went through initial public offerings or found buyers in a series of deals each worth some $1 billion or more.

In March, game developer King Digital Entertainment PLC listed in New York. Online restaurant delivery company Just Eat PLC listed on the London Stock Exchange in April. Other listings include software maker Zendesk Inc. and French ad firm Criteo SA.

Another investment, California-based Arista Networks, Inc., said last week it plans an IPO on the New York Stock Exchange.

Meanwhile, Monsanto Co. bought data-science company The Climate Corp. and Japan's SoftBank Corp. bought a 51% stake in Finnish gaming company Supercell Oy.

Not all of these "exits" have gone smoothly for new investors buying into them. King Digital's shares slid sharply after its IPO on March 26. Ben Holmes, an Index Ventures general partner based in London, said the stock market isn't accurately valuing King.

"The fundamentals of all of these businesses are incredibly strong and they're in enormous markets that are just growing and growing," said Saul Klein, another partner at the firm.

Index has so far focused on finding companies in the areas of mobile consumer services and applications, enterprise infrastructure, networks, and financial services. Mr. Holmes said new areas of interest include controls and sensors for mobile phones, artificial intelligence, and robotics.

The latest fund is Index's seventh early-stage fund and part of a total  ¬3 billion raised by Index since its inception in 1996. It typically keeps between 20 and 30 investors in every fund, almost all of them existing investors.

Mr. Klein said that the firm's investment approach in terms of geography is balanced between Europe, Israel, and the U.S.

"While obviously Silicon Valley and the U.S. still looms large in terms of creating very, very big successful tech companies," Mr. Klein said, "we have really seen in the last 12 months this wave of businesses that have grown up either in Europe or in Israel really starting to achieve what is becoming a sort of entrepreneurial threshold of significance."

How fund managers spend your money

In Turney Duff's account of his drug-addled and alcohol-soaked days picking shares for a hedge fund, recounted with great relish in The Buy Side, a broker pitching for trade asks Mr Duff what he can do to get more of his business.

"Well, you can start by taking me to Vegas," he responds. So they do. Not just Las Vegas, but Florida too. They charter private jets and attend sporting events where the thrill of the match is amplified by cocaine and parties where sex is on call.

Why are brokers falling over themselves to offer such expensive inducements to Mr Duff? The answer is simple: each block of shares the hedge fund buys or sells carries a commission. That commission does not come out of Mr Duff's pocket, nor does it come out of the pocket of his employer. Ultimately, it comes out of your pocket.

Amid all the debate about what investors should be told about fees, transaction costs are the elephant in the room. They are not part of the two most commonly-used cost disclosures, the annual management charge (AMC) or the total expense ratio (TER, sometimes also known as the ongoing charges figure or OCF). But by some estimates, they may account for as much as a third of what leaks from investors' portfolios in fees and costs.

"There's a lot of evidence that about 30 per cent of the cost of running a pension fund is lost through trading and other costs," said Richard Balarkas, who runs an independent consultancy that analyses market structure and execution services. "Transaction costs are the murky, murky part of the industry."

Of course, those buying investment funds do "see" transaction costs, in the form of a lower investment return than they might have otherwise had. But because this is rarely spelt out clearly, most investors - even professionals running large corporate pension schemes - are in the dark about it.

A 2013 survey of fund managers by actuaries Lane, Clark & Peacock, whose clients are large UK pension schemes, found that only a third of fund managers disclose transaction fees. LCP noted that managers of funds of hedge funds were particularly unwilling to disclose these extra costs. "It seems that such providers would rather keep investors in the dark about the true cost incurred to manage assets."

-------------------------------------------

What are transaction costs?

Even defining what constitutes transaction costs can be a challenge, but experts broadly divide these into two categories: explicit and implicit costs. Among the explicit costs are things such as stamp duty, exchange fees and brokerage commissions. Some explicit fees, such as charges for custody (holding investments in ringfenced accounts, to protect investors in the event of the provider getting into financial difficulty) and legal and audit services, are included in the TER.

Brokerage fees, which provided the fuel for Mr Duff's hard partying, are easy to define but far from easy to measure. That's partly because their cost does not just reflect the price of buying and selling shares or bonds, but a whole range of other things, such as research or preferential access to corporate clients.

And brokerage commissions are only part of trading costs. "It's not talked about much, but implicit costs can be much more significant than explicit costs," said Yossi Brandes, head of European analytics research at ITG, a company that specialises in measuring them.

Brokers act as introducers for new companies coming to the stock market. A fund manager who puts a lot of business their way is more likely to secure a large tranche of new stock in an IPO. A 2008 study by academics at Babson College and the Universities of Georgia and Missouri found clear evidence that fund managers engage in "churning" - unnecessary stock trading - to gain a leg up on broker allocations of initial public offerings.

-------------------------------------------

Implementation shortfalls

Implicit costs are not only harder to see and measure, but also harder to define. Broadly, the implicit cost is the gap between the price of a security - shares, bonds, traded funds - at the time the investment decision to buy or sell is made and the price change over the course of fulfilling an order. For securities in foreign currencies, it also includes the difference between the rate at which that currency is bought and sold.

One of the trickiest issues is "implementation shortfall". Typically, as an order is executed, other market participants will adjust the price at which they are offering that security to reflect either the rising demand as shares are bought or falling demand as they are sold. There is often a time lag between the point at which a manager decides to buy or sell a share and the time the transaction is complete. That price change is called the implementation shortfall and is almost impossible to measure accurately.

"If you are a large institution and you need to buy a stock, it will drive the price up," Mr Brandes said, adding that such moves can be long-lasting. In that case, investment returns are lower than they might be otherwise.

In trying to understand some of these hidden costs, some broad rules of thumb apply. For example, fund managers buying less liquid securities will see a bigger adverse price movement when they trade than they might when buying more widely traded shares, and securities purchased in less liquid currencies will also prove more expensive than those denominated in, say, US dollars.

Another rule of thumb is that fund managers who buy and sell shares within a portfolio frequently will lose more of their investment returns to frictional trading costs than a manager who trades infrequently.

So-called "portfolio turnover" can vary widely between funds. It can be very low at long-only equity funds, but tends to be higher for bond funds, which must continuously replace maturing holdings.

But size matters, too. "Portfolio turnover matters less for big funds that can negotiate lower transaction costs," says Hugues Gillibert, chief executive of Fitz Partners, a consultancy. He says a big fund with high turnover but low transaction charges could cost investors less overall than a small fund with low turnover.

But portfolio turnover is one reason investors in "passive" funds that track an index are far less likely to be adversely affected by hidden charges than those investing in actively managed portfolios.

Actuarial consultants Hymans Robertson recently sought to quantify the difference in cost between managing various investments in index trackers versus having them actively managed. Its report prompted the Department of Communities and Local Government to urge switching almost half the 178bn Local Government Pension Fund into index trackers.

Even for the highly liquid UK market, the cost differential is huge. The scheme has roughly equal sums of about 25bn invested in trackers and active management. But total fees on the actively managed portion are nearly four times those on the passive portfolios, and there is no evidence that their returns are any better. One factor eating into returns of the actively managed funds are the hidden transaction costs.

-------------------------------------------

Regulators shine a light

Regulators and the industry are moving to require that some of these hidden costs be shown to investors. The main driver for that is the fact that, increasingly, households will have to rely on their own investment decisions for their retirement income. It is becoming more important to ensure that as much as possible of each pound invested is working for the saver.

"We have a huge, looming pensions crisis in Europe and this is an effort to address a problem that is spiralling out of control," said Rebecca Healey, senior research analyst at Tabb Group, a consulting firm specialising in trading market analysis.

The second part of the EU's markets in financial instruments directive (Mifid) will require fund managers to spell out some of these soft costs. "The information on all costs and associated charges must include information relating to both investment and ancillary services, including the cost of advice, where relevant . . ." the directive states. It will be implemented from the fourth quarter of 2016.

Investors can be heartened by the fact that regulators are moving towards illuminating the darker corners of the market, and curtailing the apocryphal golf days and Test match tickets. But for those paying unseen costs today, those moves may still seem rather too slow.

-------------------------------------------

The price of research

Many fund management groups market themselves on the depth of their in-house research, the cost of which is incorporated in their charges. But investment banks also employ analysts to produce research for distribution to clients. This is paid for indirectly via trading commissions.

The Financial Conduct Authority estimates that funds spent 1.5bn a year on external research and 500m on preferential access to senior company managers. Both costs are met through brokerage commissions.

Many experts feel the cost of external research - while legitimate - should be borne by the fund manager and incorporated into the TER, rather than paid for indirectly via opaque commissions.

The regulator agrees; in November 2013, it announced a crackdown on "cash for access" in particular.

A separate report in December 2013 suggested that much of the research that investment bank analysts produce is not even read by fund managers.

-------------------------------------------

A common standard on disclosure

How much information should be disclosed to investors, and in what format, has become a hot issue for the funds industry.

The Investment Management Association, which represents open-ended fund providers in the UK, says it is "absolutely" in favour of better disclosure.

"We have huge sympathy with someone who wants to know how much of the money that they invest is actually put to work," says Guy Sears, director of risk, compliance and legal affairs. The difficulty is agreeing a uniform method for measuring and disclosing costs that is comparable across the market. "We're interested in making sure that the disclosure is uniform and there is clarity on methodology."

Campaigners such as Alan and Gina Miller, who initiated the True & Fair Campaign, say that only a single all-encompassing figure in pounds and pence will do, while the City regulator has urged managers to use the same figure across all marketing literature.

The IMA has committed to provide a standard framework for implicit costs, which would result in a "pounds and pence" figure, but its critics argue that the proposals do not go far enough and that details of the all-in cost will only appear in a fund's annual report - a document most investors don't bother to read.

While fund management groups may protest that it is too difficult to provide costs data to consumers in a consistent format, that does not mean they are not measuring it themselves.

Mr Sears says a very large number of providers are using some form of transaction cost analysis software which constantly monitors the cost of trading for internal purposes. But he adds that there is no standardised methodology across clients or vendors for what is measured and how.

"There is a risk of 'apples to oranges' problems if comparing asset manager A with B."

Many in the funds industry argue that transaction costs of fractions of a per cent are very minor, and that what really matters is performance net of fees. But across an industry where average performance is barely any better than what could be delivered by an index tracker, costs matter - especially over the long term.

A recent report by the Pensions Institute noted that up to 85 per cent of investing costs may be hidden.

And advocates of better disclosure are unmoved. "The question to ask the manager of your fund is 'What would the investment return have been at the end of the year if you did not trade a single share?'" Mr Balarkas says.

He recalls a regulator posing just that question to a room full of fund managers - and being greeted with silence.

European Markets Await ECB Policy Announcement; Central Bank Widely Expected to Cut All Its Main Interest Rates

European markets stuck to their recent holding pattern Thursday while investors awaited the European Central Bank's policy announcement.

The euro, which has weakened since ECB President Mario Draghi last month suggested that easing measures could be on their way in June, was steady against the dollar at $1.3610.

The central bank is widely expected to cut all its main interest rates at Thursday's meeting, including pushing its deposit rate into negative territory for the first time. Some analysts also expect further action such as steps to boost liquidity or a package of cheap loans to banks.

"For recent euro weakness to extend further after today's meeting, the ECB will likely now have to meet high investor expectations and perhaps even hint that more easing is likely later this year," said Lee Hardman, a currency analyst at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.

Investors will also be looking out for signals from Mr. Draghi of future steps particularly the possibility that the ECB could launch a program of large-scale asset purchases if inflation continues at its current sluggish pace.

Data earlier in the week showed consumer price growth in the currency bloc slowed to just 0.5% annually in May.

A survey conducted by Barclays shows that just over 46% of its clients questioned expect the ECB to cut rates and announce targeted credit easing.

In equity markets, the Stoxx Europe 600 index was little changed in early trade.

Outside the euro zone, London's FTSE 100 slipped 0.2%. The Bank of England also makes its monthly interest rate decision Thursday and is widely expected to keep policy on hold.

In the U.S., S&P 500 futures were little changed, with investors eyeing the government's monthly employment report due Friday, which is expected show nonfarm payroll growth of 210,000.

On Wednesday, data compiled by Automatic Data Processing and Moody'sAnalytics showed that 179,000 private-sector jobs were added in May, falling short of expectations of a 210,000 increase. Changes in futures don't always accurately predict market moves after the opening bell.

Back in European equity markets, Smith & Nephew shares climbed sharply after Medtronic Inc. was reported by Bloomberg to be considering an offer for the U.K. medical-device maker.

In a further sign of the market for mergers and acquisitions reviving, German household consumer products maker Henkel AG & Co. said is would pay  ¬940 million ($1.27 billion) in cash for French company Spotless GroupSAS in a move aimed at strengthening its position in Western Europe.

According to Dealogic data from this week, the volume of global consumer-sector M&A stands at $26.6 billion year-to-date, already marking a robust 89% rise on the same period last year.

Elsewhere, shares in online retailer Asos slumped by more than 40% after issuing a profit warning, saying increased levels of promotional activity have hit margins. Year-to-date, that marks a more than 47% tumble in the stock price.

In commodities markets, gold was down 0.1% at $1,243.40 an ounce, while Brent crude oil was down 0.3% at $108.07 a barrel.

Investing in Funds & ETFs: A Monthly Analysis --- How to FIX the 401(k) --- Five suggestions for giving workers a more-secure retirement

The 401(k) is in need of a tuneup.

Originally designed to supplement pension plans, 401(k)s have become the primary retirement-savings vehicle for many employees. But critics say the plans are plagued by a variety of ills, including high fees that can eat into investment returns, as well as certain advisers who may not have a legal obligation to work in the best interests of plan participants.

"The system is broken," says Monique Morrissey, an economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute in Washington. "The best way to encourage people to save more is to give them something that will make them confident that if they put more money away, they will have sufficient and secure retirement income."

Here are five suggestions to strengthen the traditional 401(k).

Simplify fee disclosure

High fees are at the root of many of the criticisms lobbed at 401(k)s.

According to BrightScope, a San Diego analytics firm that rates retirement plans, average total plan fees for large 401(k) plans with more than $1 billion in total assets are about 0.34% of assets annually, or $340 a year for an account with a $100,000 balance. However, at smaller plans with $1 million to $100 million in assets, the average is 1.16%, or $1,160 a year. Total plan fees include various administrative costs as well as the expenses built into the underlying investment choices.

It can be difficult for small businesses and plan participants to get a handle on what fees and expenses are attached to their 401(k) plans because the numbers are often buried in the dense, complex and lengthy disclosure documents that became the norm after the U.S. Labor Department in 2012 required plan providers to reveal detailed information about their services and the compensation they receive.

The Labor Department in March proposed new rules designed to make navigation of these documents easier, citing concern that small businesses in particular might be having trouble.

In addition to plan administrative costs, the expense ratios associated with individual funds also can hurt workers' returns, which has led to calls for simpler, easy-to-read disclosure of these expenses, too. Some have envisioned a disclosure similar to a new car's gas-mileage label or energy-cost labels on appliances, says John Rekenthaler, vice president of research at Morningstar Inc.

The left-leaning Center for American Progress, for example, wants funds to carry a warning label explaining how high fees eat into savings, and showing how the fund's fees compare with a group of comparable, low-fee offerings.

"The ability to see that fee metric in a way that signals to them whether they are buying a low-cost fund or a higher-cost fund would be incredibly valuable," says Jennifer Erickson, the director of competitiveness and economic growth at American Progress.

Require plans to offer low-cost index funds

Some critics say that along with better fee disclosure, 401(k) plans need to include more low-cost index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds.

According to Morningstar, the average expense ratio for an index mutual fund is 0.75%, or $7.50 in annual fees for every $1,000 invested, compared with 1.25% for actively managed mutual funds. ETFs are even cheaper, with an average expense ratio of 0.59%.

The difference in the average expense ratio of actively managed mutual funds and ETFs translates into an extra $8,711 in fees and forgone earnings over 30 years, assuming an initial investment of $10,000 and a 6% annual rate of return, according to a calculator from the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The easiest way for employees to control their own costs is to pick a diversified set of investment options with lower expense ratios, says Ms. Erickson.

Larger employers are more likely to offer low-cost index funds in their 401(k) plans than smaller employers, says Morningstar's Mr. Rekenthaler. Employees, however, can always ask their employer to add index funds and ETFs to the company's 401(k) plan, he says.

Require plan features that nudge people to save more

The 2006 Pension Protection Act made it easier for employers to automatically enroll workers into workplace savings plans, and many in the defined-contribution industry have applauded the practice.

Vanguard Group, one of the biggest U.S. 401(k) plan administrators, says that among companies that use its plans, the employee participation rate rose to 76% in 2012 from 66% in 2006, likely reflecting the adoption of automatic enrollment by larger plan sponsors.

Almost half of 401(k) plans now have an automatic-enrollment feature, according to the Plan Sponsor Council of America. Some employers automatically escalate workers' contributions each year. As of 2012, nearly 40% of employer plans with an automatic enrollment feature included an auto-escalation feature, said the council, while about 18% of plans included an option for employees to opt in for auto-escalation.

The challenge, experts say, is coming up with automatic features that don't inadvertently dissuade workers from saving even more. For instance, if employers have automatic enrollment with auto-escalation, they shouldn't cap the escalating contribution at a relatively low level like 8%, says Jack VanDerhei, research director at the nonprofit Employee Benefit Research Institute, because it might lead employees to believe they can't contribute more.

Mr. VanDerhei also says plan sponsors should encourage new hires not to default to a low starting level if they were contributing more at a former job.

"New employees should be reminded that they've escalated contributions over the last so-many years, so they don't revert to a small percentage at a new employer," says Mr. VanDerhei.

Have those providing guidance be fiduciaries

Fiduciaries are required by law to act in the best interest of their clients when giving certain investment advice.

While those responsible for choosing the specific investment options offered within 401(k) plans (usually the employer or someone they hire) are subject to fiduciary standards under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, those who provide assistance or suggestions to the employer or to individual plan participants aren't necessarily subject to the same rules.

For instance, a broker-dealer may approach an employer about setting up a 401(k) plan, and in that process suggest certain models or groups of funds to offer within the plan. Under current laws, that transaction isn't subject to fiduciary standards, though the employer offering the plan is.

"There are people working with smaller and midsize plans that are providing advisory services in various forms, but aren't calling themselves fiduciaries," says Christopher Jones, chief investment officer for Financial Engines Inc., a Sunnyvale, Calif. company and fiduciary that provides advice and money management to 401(k) participants.

The Labor Department is expected to unveil in January a proposal to update the fiduciary definition, a move supported by consumer groups including AARP, the Consumer Federation of America and the Pension Rights Center.

The potential proposal faces opposition from some in the brokerage industry.

By taking broker-dealers' suggestions for different models off the table, it takes away a tool and potentially drives up costs for small employers, says Kent Mason, a lawyer and partner at Davis & Harman LLP in Washington who represents brokerages and other financial firms.

Start a national 401(k) plan for small employers

While some argue that 401(k) plans at large employers have made improvements, small-employer plans have continued to struggle with high fees that can get passed on to employees.

That's partly because legal and administrative costs can weigh heavily on plans that cover fewer workers. "The 401(k) is a tax-code accident that wasn't written from the top down for retirement, and therefore isn't built for small companies," says Mr. Rekenthaler.

Though the recent focus has been on the individual retirement accounts called "myRAs" proposed by President Barack Obama earlier this year, Mr. Rekenthaler says a national platform for employer-sponsored defined-contribution plans would also help bring better 401(k) plans to American workers.

A national 401(k) plan would allow small companies to benefit from economies of scale by pooling their resources and reining in individual costs, he says. He adds that such a platform would also lift the costs associated with fiduciary responsibility away from individual small employers since the funds in the national plan would be picked by a government entity.

Having individualized plans at small companies just isn't cost-effective, says Mr. Rekenthaler.

Breakneck business-cycle fix for Schroders; Fund focus

Manager keeping just five stocks in European fund's overhaul, finds Bradley Gerrard

Up-and-coming investment manager James Sym has retained just five stocks in a breakneck overhaul of Schroders' 1bn European Alpha Plus fund, as he switches the strategy to "business-cycle investing".

Schroders announced that Mr Sym was taking over the fund from industry veteran Leon Howard-Spink just three weeks ago. But the rising-star investor says he is already "80 per cent" through implementation of the new approach, which evaluates companies in terms of how they perform at different points in the business cycle.

The manager change came after Mr Howard-Spink, formerly of Jupiter, gained just 3.3 per cent on the fund in the year to the end of April, versus a sector average of 14.5 per cent, according to FE Analytics, the data provider.

Mr Sym joined Cazenove Capital - bought by Schroders in 2013 - as an analyst in 2007 before being promoted to co-manager of its European Income fund in 2012 alongside business-cycle expert Chris Rice. The business-cycle investing approach was founded by former Cazenove manager Tim Russell.

Mr Rice quit Cazenove during the Schroders takeover, which resulted in Mr Sym taking the reins of the 309m income fund. Mr Sym has now been tasked with implementing the business-cycle approach on Schroders' much larger European Alpha Plus fund.

"My starting point was not what is in the portfolio, but [to ask] what are the best 40 companies I can find to make money," says the manager. "I am doing away with almost the entire portfolio. The transition process is under way and 80 per cent of the portfolio is already changed."

Mr Sym says there were just three stocks that he and Mr Howard-Spink both had in the portfolios. In the transition process he "took a second look" at two other companies and decided to keep those as well.

"One of the real challenges will be managing a bigger fund, but what has delighted and surprised me most is that clients have left their money in," he says. "There is going to be quite a substantial amount of assets to run."

Mr Sym says "early-cycle" stocks had driven the returns on his income fund in recent years. However, he says many of these types of stocks have now priced in much of the recovery.

He cites a Spanish TV company he bought last year as an example. Its price-to-earnings ratio almost tripled from the time he purchased it.

The manager adds that as the business cycle moves into the "expansion" phase he is focusing on stocks that tend to fare well in this type of environment. As such he is considering a brick manufacturer in Austria, whose share price he expects to "double or triple" because of low earnings expectations from the market.

"I am not going to get all of them right but I have got lots of bets where I can make multiples on initial investments," he says.

Fiduciaries are required by law to act in the best interest of their clients when giving certain investment advice.

While those responsible for choosing the specific investment options offered within 401(k) plans (usually the employer or someone they hire) are subject to fiduciary standards under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, those who provide assistance or suggestions to the employer or to individual plan participants aren't necessarily subject to the same rules.

For instance, a broker-dealer may approach an employer about setting up a 401(k) plan, and in that process suggest certain models or groups of funds to offer within the plan. Under current laws, that transaction isn't subject to fiduciary standards, though the employer offering the plan is.

"There are people working with smaller and midsize plans that are providing advisory services in various forms, but aren't calling themselves fiduciaries," says Christopher Jones, chief investment officer for Financial Engines Inc., a Sunnyvale, Calif. company and fiduciary that provides advice and money management to 401(k) participants.

The Labor Department is expected to unveil in January a proposal to update the fiduciary definition, a move supported by consumer groups including AARP, the Consumer Federation of America and the Pension Rights Center.

The potential proposal faces opposition from some in the brokerage industry.

By taking broker-dealers' suggestions for different models off the table, it takes away a tool and potentially drives up costs for small employers, says Kent Mason, a lawyer and partner at Davis & Harman LLP in Washington who represents brokerages and other financial firms.

Start a national 401(k) plan for small employers

While some argue that 401(k) plans at large employers have made improvements, small-employer plans have continued to struggle with high fees that can get passed on to employees.

That's partly because legal and administrative costs can weigh heavily on plans that cover fewer workers. "The 401(k) is a tax-code accident that wasn't written from the top down for retirement, and therefore isn't built for small companies," says Mr. Rekenthaler.

Though the recent focus has been on the individual retirement accounts called "myRAs" proposed by President Barack Obama earlier this year, Mr. Rekenthaler says a national platform for employer-sponsored defined-contribution plans would also help bring better 401(k) plans to American workers.

A national 401(k) plan would allow small companies to benefit from economies of scale by pooling their resources and reining in individual costs, he says. He adds that such a platform would also lift the costs associated with fiduciary responsibility away from individual small employers since the funds in the national plan would be picked by a government entity.

Having individualized plans at small companies just isn't cost-effective, says Mr. Rekenthaler.

Pritzker's Beach Bet

Hotel investor John Pritzker is preparing one of his largest, most-expensive projects to date: a $200 million Miami Beach resort converted from an apartment complex.

Mr. Pritzker, son of Hyatt Hotel Corp. founder Jay Pritzker, formed boutique hotel company Commune Hotels & Resorts in 2011 by merging hotel operator Joie de Vivre Hospitality with the upscale Thompson Hotels. He and partners acquired the former Miami Beach apartment complex last year for $100 million.

He now is spending another $100 million to transform the property into a 380-room resort, he said. "From a financial standpoint, it will be [Commune's] flagship property for sure," Mr. Pritzker said of the Miami hotel.

The apartment complex is being gutted and is poised to open toward the end of this year as Thompson Miami Beach. The resort will include two pools, tropical gardens, a spa and a brasserie restaurant led by Miami native Michelle Bernstein, said Commune Chief Executive Niki Leondakis.

Have Trains, Want Cranes

Amtrak is hoping the Philadelphia real-estate market will help power a revitalization of the area around the train operator's 30th Street Station.

On Tuesday, Amtrak, Drexel University and Brandywine Realty Trust said they have tapped a team led by architecture firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill LLP to design a master plan for the gritty area around the station, which was built in the early 1930s.

One of the areas of focus: potential for development over rail yards. About 75 acres of rail yards are near the station, potentially offering a large swath of development land, although such construction can be complex and expensive.

Philadelphia-based Drexel already has considerable land nearby where it is developing a mix of commercial space, apartments and academic space. Meanwhile, Brandywine, one of the city's most active developers, broke ground earlier this month on a 49-story tower in the area.

Vegas Venture

Las Vegas is well into its economic rebound, as the high-dollar sale of a luxury rental apartment complex in the suburb of Henderson illustrates.

Hamilton Zanze Real Estate Investments, of San Francisco, has paid $26 million for the 164-unit Elysian Parc apartments opened in 2012. The price is the highest for a wooden-framed, garden-apartment complex in Las Vegas since 2007 in terms of price per unit ($158,536) and price per square foot ($152), according to Newmark Grubb Knight Frank broker Doug Schuster.

"People are coming back to Las Vegas and spending money," said Mr. Schuster, who represented the Elysian Parc's developer and seller, The Calida Group, with fellow broker Curt Allsop. "There is a sense that the town really is in recovery mode."

Visitation to Las Vegas increased by 4.3% in March from a year earlier to nearly 3.7 million people, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Hotel occupancy in the metro area was 91.8% in March, up from 88.4% a year earlier. Sales of commercial real estate in the Las Vegas area increased 44% in the first quarter from a year earlier to $847 million, according to Real Capital Analytics.

The Elysian Parc's vacancy now stands at 6%, with an average monthly rent of $1,040, according to Hamilton Zanze. Wooden-framed structures account for the majority of Las Vegas's apartment stock, though the city's steel-framed apartment towers typically sell for much higher prices.

Moody's Corp. boosted its offer Wednesday to acquire a majority stake in ICRA Ltd., a provider of credit ratings and research in India.

Moody's, a ratings and analytics company, offered to buy up to 2.65 million shares of ICRA at 2,400 Indian rupees (about $40.71) a share, a 20% increase from its February offer of INR2,000 a share.

Full acceptance of the offer would boost Moody's ownership stake in ICRA to just over 50%, from 28.5% currently, Moody's said in a statement. The offer is conditional upon Moody's acquiring at least 2.15 million shares.

Moody's added that the elevated price will be the "only and final revision" to the offer price.

"We are committed to the successful completion of our open offer to ICRA shareholders," said Moody's President and Chief Executive Raymond McDaniel. "Our increased offer price reflects our desire to maximize investor participation in the offer."

Moody's, which relies on its debt-rating operation for the vast majority of its income, said in February it would fund the offer from international cash on hand.

Brookfield Makes Play for Industrial Sector --- Real-Estate Investor Is Poised for Expansion in Warehouses and Distribution Parks; 'Plenty of Capital for Good Deals'

Brookfield Property Partners LP, one of the world's largest real-estate investors, is setting the stage for a rapid expansion in the industrial-property sector.

The field is among the least glitzy in the real-estate industry. But the properties, which include logistics warehouses and distribution parks that companies from Apple Inc. to Whirlpool use to store their products for shipping, can produce strong returns for investors when the economy is expanding.

Over the past two years, New York-based Brookfield -- the real-estate arm of Canada's Brookfield Asset Management Inc., which has $175 billion under management -- has purchased a handful of industrial-property companies. Its acquisitions have included Industrial Developments International, an Atlanta-based firm focused on the U.S., and Gazeley Ltd., which is based in London and has holdings in the U.K., Europe and Asia.

The companies will operate under a new Brookfield Property division called Brookfield Logistics Properties, with assets of about $3.5 billion, and now both will be called IDI Gazeley.

The industrial-property sector plays an important role in the global supply chain for virtually every industry, from manufacturing and construction to retail and food processing. It isn't clear how much Brookfield plans to invest to expand the division. But Brookfield Property Partners tends to have large holdings in its property sectors. Among them are Brookfield Place (formerly the World Financial Center) in Manhattan and Canary Wharf in London.

"There's plenty of capital for good deals," said Richard Clark, chief executive of Brookfield Property Partners. But he also noted that potential deals must meet certain performance requirements, including the ability for a 12% to 15% total return over time.

The industrial sector is attractive to a deep-pocketed owner like Brookfield because it has yet to be consolidated under corporate or institutional ownership to the same extent as have other property types. The sector's relatively scattered ownership leaves it more vulnerable to economic conditions as they change across continents, and that makes the assets themselves easier targets for acquisition.

Brookfield is consolidating its industrial properties at a time when the sector is seeing rising occupancy and rents because of the improving economy and the rise of Internet retailing. The first-quarter vacancy rate in the U.S. fell to 7.7% compared with 8% last year and 10.8% in 2010, according to Cushman & Wakefield. Rents in the first quarter were up 3.1% compared with the same period in 2013, but were still 1.6% lower than their peak in 2008.

Sales of industrial properties in the U.S. rose more than 40% in the first quarter from the same period last year, with prices inching up as well, according to research firm Real Capital Analytics.

Sales have remained flat in Europe and Asia, however, which could signal opportunity to Brookfield Logistics' acquisitions team.

By expanding in the industrial sector, Brookfield is going up against Prologis Inc., the dominant player in industrial real estate, with almost 600 million square feet of industrial assets either occupied or in development. In comparison, Brookfield Logistics controls 58 million square feet of occupied space and an additional 68 million square feet of developable land, 17 million square feet of which should be built out by the end of this year.

Still, some analysts believe Brookfield will grow quickly. "These are active investors," said Neil Downey, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets. "Having operating capability and a development pipeline are very important. They don't just write checks."

Sheila McGrath, an analyst with Evercore, agrees. "Brookfield has a reputation of going after platforms, and this is a compelling opportunity."

Last fall, Brookfield hired Jay Cornforth to run the new operation. Mr. Cornforth was previously president of the East region at Prologis. "We are investors on a global scale," he said of his new platform.

Commerzbank Is Near a Sale of Spanish Loans

MADRID -- Commerzbank AG is in final-stage talks to sell a multibillion-euro portfolio of Spanish real-estate loans and assets to Lone Star Funds and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the latest sign of renewed interest in one of the most-battered property markets in Europe.

According to people familiar with the talks, the two U.S. investors will pay between 3.7 billion euros and 3.9 billion euros ($5.07 billion and $5.35 billion) for the portfolio, which includes loans with a face value of about 4.5 billion euros that are backed by shopping centers, hotels and offices.

The deal, which one of the people said may close within a month, would be the largest property transaction in Spain since the country's real-estate bubble burst six years ago.

Under the terms of the proposed deal, known by the code name Project Octopus, Lone Star would acquire the majority of the loans in the portfolio, while J.P. Morgan would acquire a minority and provide the financing for the deal, one person said.

Demand for Spanish real-estate loans and assets has recovered sharply over the past year, as investors become more confident that the worst of the financial crisis has passed. There were $1.5 billion of commercial real-estate transactions in Spain in the first quarter of 2014, up from $410.9 million a year earlier, according to data from Real Capital Analytics.

The sheer size of Project Octopus could help transaction volumes keep rising, as Lone Star sells and restructures parts of the loan book, said Federico Montero, a partner in corporate finance at real-estate broker Cushman & Wakefield.

"The good news is that you have a private-equity investor with these loans now," he said. "Things will move faster than they were with a German bank."

The auction, run by investment bank Lazard Ltd., initially attracted more than a dozen large international investors, many of which had teamed up with financial institutions to bid.

Blackstone Group LP, Cerberus Capital Management and Apollo Global Management were leading three of the four groups in the final stages of the Project Octopus bidding. U.S. private-equity funds have helped drive the activity in Spain, as well as in Ireland and Italy, as they search for distressed real-estate assets.

The loans originally were extended by Eurohypo AG, a unit of Commerzbank that is being wound down after suffering large losses in recent years.

Finra Wants New Data System to Start in 2015

Despite industry opposition, Wall Street's self-regulator says it will push for a 2015 start to its plan to collect more data on brokerage transactions.

In response to industry concerns about misuse or exposure of sensitive information, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has tweaked reporting requirements of the program, called the Comprehensive Automated Risk Data System, or CARDS. No private data, such as individual account data, will be collected, and brokers won't have to use a uniform format or their clearing firm to submit the data.

But beyond those refinements no big charges are planned, and the program should be able to get under way next year, Finra Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Ketchum told reporters Tuesday at his agency's annual conference in Washington, D.C.

The CARDS program has created significant opposition from industry groups and broker-dealer firms worried about the cost of the program, privacy and the security of the data collected and stored at Finra. And there are still several steps to be taken before it can be implemented. Finra's board must approve a proposal, which then goes to Security and Exchange Commission and will be put out for public comment.

The program will be implemented in at least two phases, Mr. Ketchum said. Finra is looking to collect data that would allow it to spot troublesome trends around transactions, products, and broker practices early enough to stop them before they hurt customers or the markets broadly.

But initially Finra won't seek data around products that brokers don't manage as clearing agents, nontraded real estate investment trusts, variable annuities, and direct mutual funds. That data would be collected in a second phase.

Mr. Ketchum has been adamant that CARDS is necessary for Finra to stay in step with the times, and to become more effective in identifying and resolving potential market and investor issues.

"Finra needs to continue to differentiate itself, and it needs to do so through technology," he said, noting that CARDS "is a profoundly better tool to identify law breakers."

Finra itself has completely overhauled its own technology, he said. It has been "aggressively hiring particularly with regard to big data and computing," he said. Over the last three to four years, Finra increased its technology staff by about 40%, by hiring or converting consultants into full-time staff, Mr. Ketchum said.

Finra Tweaking Broker Data Surveillance; Finra Seeks to Shore Up Support for an Initiative That Would Increase Its Oversight

Wall Street's self-regulator continues to tweak its efforts to collect substantial data from the brokerage industry to shore up support for the heavily criticized initiative that would increase its oversight.

Richard Ketchum, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority chairman and chief executive, said Monday during the organization's annual conference in Washington that the changes would ease the burden that the data surveillance would impose on firms.

Finra said late last year it plans to introduce a proposal that would allow it to collect consolidated data about trading, brokerage products, and practices of firms and individual brokers to better understand and potentially reduce the overall risk in the industry, rather than responding only to individual violations and risks.

The program called Comprehensive Automated Risk Data System, or CARDS has been criticized by firms and industry groups because of its potential costs to firms as well as concerns about privacy and the security of the requested data.

Finra had planned to collect such industry data through custody firms. But not all brokerage firms use custodians, and Mr. Ketchum said Finra would allow those broker-dealers to submit data directly to the regulator. Finra also had wanted the data to be delivered in defined formats, but now is considering allowing various formats of data delivery.

Finra had already backed off from collecting personal information like individual account numbers.

"We recognize that costs tied to CARDS are a real issue for firms," Mr. Ketchum said, adding that Finra is "talking to many of you about the real, bottom-line impact it may have."

Finra already runs a pilot to collect comprehensive industry data from a few custody firms, which it hasn't named. The proposal is expected to be completed this year but has to be submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission and will be made available for public comment.

"CARDS has the potential to be one of the most important investor-protection tools to emerge in recent years," he told a group of about 1,000 brokers, executives and lawyers.

Mr. Ketchum was able to soothe some concerns with the changes and his vigorous defense of the program at the conference.

Robert Muh, chief executive of broker-dealer Sutter Securities Inc., said he remains concerned about CARDS, yet less so after Mr. Ketchum's remarks.

But Hardeep Walia, the chief executive of Motif Investing Inc., said big-data mining is an important tool for regulators to move beyond their traditional examination efforts. CARDS could end up being something "other regulators will be able to learn from," he said.

"We need to return to our board, and I expect that this summer or early fall we'll be back with a formal proposal," Mr. Ketchum told reporters after the speech. "It still will be incredibly powerful."

Blackstone Is Selling Boston Towers

By Eliot Brown and Craig Karmin

Blackstone Group LP has agreed to sell five Boston-area high-rise office towers to a venture led by Canadian real-estate investor Oxford Properties Group for about $2.1 billion, according to people familiar with the deal.

Blackstone purchased the properties in 2007 as part of its acquisition of Sam Zell's Equity Office Properties Trust, in one of the biggest leveraged buyouts ever. The firm resold many of the buildings just before the crash but held on to large holdings in places like Boston and California.

In the past 18 months, Blackstone has picked up sales of those properties, taking advantage of high prices investors are willing to pay for well-located commercial properties. The Boston deal, which includes 3.2 million square feet of office space, would mark its biggest U.S. office sale since the downturn.

Oxford would buy all of 100 High St. and 125 Summer St., the people said. Oxford plans to partner with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s asset-management arm to buy three towers -- 60 State St., 225 Franklin St. and One Memorial Dr. -- in Cambridge.

In addition, Blackstone is selling its stake in a sixth Boston building, waterfront office and hotel property Rowes Wharf, to its existing partner in the property, Morgan Stanley, people familiar with the deal said. The price couldn't be learned.

Urban office-building prices in the first quarter were 11.3% above their 2007 peak levels, according to the Moody's/RCA commercial-property price index. Foreign buyers and institutions increasingly dominate the sales market because they are willing to accept lower returns and pay higher prices than traditional buyers like real-estate investment trusts and local tycoons.

Oxford, the property-investment arm of the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, has been an active U.S. buyer in recent years. Other recent purchases include 450 Park Ave. in Manhattan, which it agreed to buy in February for $575 million, one of the highest prices ever paid for a New York property on a per-square-foot basis. In addition, it is co-developing with Related Cos. the more than $15 billion office and apartment project being built over a set of rail yards on Manhattan's West Side.

Other bidders on the Boston portfolio included the Government of Singapore and a joint venture of Norway's sovereign-wealth fund and MetLife Inc., according to people familiar with the sale. The buildings include some of the most prestigious addresses in Boston's downtown, home to finance companies and law firms including WilmerHale.

Blackstone continues to be an active property buyer, as shown by its deal last week to purchase the Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas, a hotel and casino, for $1.7 billion.

After the Oxford deal, the firm will still have about 3 million square feet of office space in the Boston area, including the large tower 100 Summer St.

But the firm also has been picking up the sales pace at some of its office properties as it seeks to return money to investors in older closed-end funds as values have gradually risen. Its $11 billion 2007-era real-estate fund -- which was used to buy the Boston buildings -- is now valued at more than $22 billion, giving investors a net internal rate of return of 13%, the company reported in the first quarter.

Last year, Blackstone sold $9 billion in office properties, up from $1.8 billion in 2012, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics LLC.

Blackstone has adopted a different strategy for selling office buildings than other property types. Last year, it sold hotel chains Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. and Extended Stay America Inc. through initial public offerings.

The firm is selling office properties individually or in small portfolios. That is partly because the value of a brand matters less in the office world than in the hotel world, and hotels benefit more from having a single national management business.

Asked on an October investor call how Blackstone would sell properties, Blackstone President Hamilton James said: "If it's a hotel chain, it's going to be a business. If it's a collection of offices, it probably is more apt to be either individual properties or properties lumped regionally or locally, or by type."

Euro-Zone Economy Can't

Get Beyond the First Gear

These weren't the growth numbers the euro zone was looking for. Gross domestic product in the economies that share the single currency grew just 0.2% in aggregate in the first quarter, half the pace forecast and a real disappointment that contrasts with upbeat sentiment data.

The numbers challenge the European Central Bank's belief in a gradual economic pickup and will increase fears about persistent low inflation. That will encourage markets to bet even more heavily on ECB action -- even if quantitative easing remains the bank's last-resort option.

Overall, there were more negative surprises than positive in Thursday's data. Of the 13 euro-zone countries that reported quarter-on-quarter data, six contracted, one stagnated and six expanded. Germany grew 0.8%, a strong result thanks exclusively to domestic demand, and Spain showed signs of benefiting from its economic overhaul efforts, gaining 0.4%.

But disappointments were many. France managed to underperform expectations for slight growth and stagnated, while Italy's economy unexpectedly went into reverse, shrinking 0.1%. The big shock came from the Netherlands, where GDP fell 1.4% on the quarter -- although a big chunk may be the result of a warm winter that led natural-gas exports to fall by more than a quarter year-on-year. Still, the decline in Dutch output was enough to knock 0.1 percentage point off euro-zone growth as a whole.

True, the headline numbers are somewhat at odds with survey and other data. Markit's purchasing managers index, the European Commission's Economic Sentiment Indicator and the Banca d'Italia's EuroCOIN index, which has historically tracked euro-zone GDP well, have all been upbeat recently. While a warm winter led to weak industrial production due to lower energy demand, euro-zone manufacturing output has been buoyant, rising at a 3.7% annualized rate in the first quarter, JP Morgan notes. Retail sales have been rising.

Nevertheless, the failure of the euro zone to accelerate will mean more calls for action from the ECB. Had growth improved in general, that would have helped the ECB's case: It could be argued that France and Italy really need domestic efforts to carry out economic reforms rather than just further loose monetary policy. But slow growth across the euro zone is a concern, as it means the output gap will close only slowly, weighing on inflation. The ECB Thursday published its latest survey of professional forecasters, which saw projections for inflation lowered across the board, with 2016 inflation seen at just 1.5%.

The figures support a number of trades that are already in train: Government bond yields could yet fall further on expectation of an ECB response, and euro-denominated corporate bonds should fare well. The euro has fallen sharply in the past week, and could come under further pressure.

ECB President Mario Draghi has said that policy makers were "comfortable with acting" at the bank's June meeting. Faced with a slow-moving euro-zone recovery, the ECB may now need to shift its response up a gear.

IBM's Target Doesn't Compute

For IBM, talk isn't exactly cheap. That much was clear in the reaction to Big Blue's analyst meeting on Wednesday, at which it kept its target of making $20 in operating earnings per share in 2015. Still, shares of International Business Machines slipped, adding to a steady decline since it posted disappointing quarterly results in April.

Even more notable is how the stock had lost nearly 6% through Wednesday against a 30% increase in the Nasdaq Composite since IBM's last analyst day in February 2013. The target of $20 a share was promised then, too, but investors have grown more skeptical since. IBM had a reputation as a reliable generator of earnings-per-share growth despite challenges to expand its enormous revenue base. That now looks tarnished. Earnings fell more than 15% in the first quarter from a year earlier. IBM also reported its eighth consecutive quarterly revenue decline year over year.

Today's tech investors are all about sales growth, and IBM chief Virginia Rometty went on the offensive Wednesday, promising growth "in the right places," including hot areas such as big data.

However that stopped short of promising revenue growth overall, which is a bigger ask. IBM has made 43 acquisitions since the start of 2010, but revenue has expanded by just a little over 4% in that time.

But 2015's target of $20 a share implies growth of almost 23% over a two-year period, which looks ambitious. And IBM admitted Wednesday that it faces a "tax headwind" of about $1.50 a share against that goal. Given the uncertainty around IBM's growth potential, and the risk that it misses its earnings goal, investors shouldn't see that as a compelling reason to buy.

Weak Wind for Indian Leader

Should Narendra Modi end up as captain of India's ship of state, he will enjoy a gentle wind at his back, courtesy of the global economy. But he will still have to contend with a battered vessel.

After a monthlong election, a new government will come to power in New Delhi at the end of this week. Mr. Modi's opposition coalition looks to be the front-runner in various exit polls.

Whoever wins, the next government will take on an economy that is no longer in the crisis mode triggered by the Federal Reserve's taper last summer. The rupee has stabilized and oil prices, vital to India's inflation and current-account problems, remain stable. Just as importantly, global demand is modestly recovering.

Thanks to these factors, India's exports increased by 5.3% in April. HSBC's surveys of purchasing managers show companies receiving more export orders, meaning there will be more manufacturing exports in the future.

That is good news for the overall economy, since every 10% rise in exports tends to boost gross-domestic-product growth by 2.25 percentage points, says J.P. Morgan's Jahangir Aziz.

Yet a real recovery isn't possible without more domestic investment and consumption, which make up the bulk of India's GDP.

Poor investment in roads and factories was the main culprit behind India's growth hitting a 10-year low last year.

On this front, things are still too quiet. The new investments that companies announced, an important measure of future spending, were off 35% in the March quarter from a year earlier, according to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, a data provider.

Equally worrying is the abandonment or stalling of investments previously announced. Though the trend improved slightly in the March quarter, projects dropped were worth $40 billion, while the new projects announced were worth just one-quarter of that. The capital stock of this developing country is hardly growing.

GDP figures for the latest quarter aren't out, but other proxies for growth continue to slump. Cement production grew just 1.2% in the March quarter, according to CMIE. In what was once meant to be the next big global auto market, car sales have shrunk in 15 of the past 16 months.

Mr. Modi promises to get the economy up and running. But that will take time, as the central government doesn't have as much sway as people assume, especially in India's disparate states. And the state-dominated banking system doesn't have enough capital to boost lending.

At least a stabilized, albeit slow-growing economy gives Mr. Modi, or any new prime minister, breathing room to get things going.

The Next Leader of India

Will Inherit a Weak Wind

For IBM to Maintain Its Lofty

Earnings Goal Doesn't Compute

For IBM, talk isn't exactly cheap. That much was clear in the reaction to Big Blue's analyst meeting on Wednesday, at which it kept its target of making $20 in operating earnings per share in 2015. Despite that, shares of International Business Machines slipped that day, adding to a steady decline since it reported disappointing quarterly results last month.

Even more notable is how the stock has lost nearly 6% against a 30% increase in the Nasdaq Composite since IBM's last analyst day in February 2013. The target of $20 a share was promised then, too, but investors have grown more skeptical since.

IBM had a reputation as a reliable generator of earnings-per-share growth despite challenges to expand its enormous revenue base. That now looks tarnished. Earnings fell more than 15% in the first quarter from the same period a year earlier. IBM also reported its eighth consecutive quarterly revenue decline year over year.

Today's tech investors are all about sales growth, and IBM chief Virginia Rometty went on the offensive Wednesday, promising growth "in the right places," including hot areas such as big data.

But that stopped short of promising revenue growth overall, which is a bigger ask. IBM has made 43 acquisitions since the start of 2010, but revenue has expanded by just a little over 4% in that time. To deliver 10% annual revenue growth now would require IBM to find about $10 billion in new sales in a market where its big rivals are hunting for precisely the same thing.

The challenge of doing that explains why IBM maintains its focus on delivering higher earnings growth. But 2015's target of $20 a share implies growth of almost 23% over a two-year period, which looks ambitious. And IBM admitted Wednesday that it faces a "tax headwind" of about $1.50 a share against that goal. Moreover, based on IBM's current forecast, share buybacks will account for less than half of the expected growth.

So reaching 2015's goal is no sure thing. The revenue picture remains unclear and IBM must deliver on promises to arrest the losses in its hardware business.

At about 10 times forward earnings, the valuation isn't demanding. But given the uncertainty around IBM's growth potential, and the risk that it misses its earnings goal, investors shouldn't see that as a compelling reason to buy.

Health
Treasure Trove in Regular Checkups --- Mining Data From Electronic Health Records Helps Physicians Diagnose Disease and Set Cures

Researchers are analyzing pools of patient information collected from routine checkups to help doctors better diagnose their patients.

This type of data is easier to mine thanks to the rise in electronic health records that contain information collected in regular doctor visits.

In one instance, a group of researchers looked at data from patients with sore throats and came up with a way to help determine whether people should see a doctor for a strep throat test or stay home and take aspirin. In another, a pediatrician was able to follow a hunch to study a connection between an eye disease and allergies in young patients with arthritis.

The quantity of data that is collected during routine medical visits is huge. It can include everything from X-rays and blood tests to doctors' written observations.

"We should be learning from the record of routine medical practice," says Nigam H. Shah, assistant professor of medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine. He is one of the authors on a 2013 study published in the journal Pediatric Rheumatology that mined electronic health records of young patients with arthritis to see if there was a connection between allergies and an eye inflammation condition called uveitis.

Some early data-mining results are starting to influence care at clinics through published papers, presentations at conferences and a push by federal agencies interested in finding ways for academic centers and hospitals across the country to learn from big data.

Big data generally refers to information that is too large -- terabytes to petabytes or even exabytes of memory -- to process with older standards of processing power. Researchers say it is important to do additional studies beyond data mining to learn more.

The data is anonymous. Identifying information about patients is hidden when used for research. But many in the field are still figuring out how to protect privacy and collect standardized, useful information from multiple sites. Large national efforts, some supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health , are trying to come up with better ways to extract useful information from these searches.

Kenneth D. Mandl of Boston Children's Hospital is one of the authors of a 2013 paper in Annals of Internal Medicine looking at records from patients who visited a retail health clinic chain with a sore throat. He said many ideas are generated by patients or caregivers during routine care. Data-mining offers a way to test ideas and hypotheses, said Dr. Mandl: "It gives you data over time on millions and millions of patients."

His research team aimed to create a score to help figure out the types of patients who didn't need to come in right away for strep throat testing. The researchers used data from 71,776 patients over the age of 15 with sore throats who visited a chain of health clinics over a 15-month period. Uniform data about the patients was gathered and kept in an electronic health record. The study estimated that 230,000 unnecessary doctor's visits could be avoided annually for those with low enough strep throat risk to stay home.

A 2014 paper published in JAMA Neurology grew out of Dr. Mandl's efforts to help a family member with inflammatory bowel disease and epilepsy. Dr. Mandl wondered if the two might be linked. Neither the neurologist nor the gastroenterologist he consulted saw a connection. So Dr. Mandl's team turned to big data from doctor visits and prescription information submitted to a large health insurance plan.

The paper found that patients with autoimmune diseases, such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis, have a fivefold increased risk of epilepsy, and that seizures tend to begin within the first one to two years after an autoimmune disease diagnosis. Dr. Mandl said more studies need to be done, but that doctors who see people with autoimmune diseases should be monitoring for development of seizures. "Things become evident on the population level that are not evident to the individual practitioner," he said.

Jennifer Frankovich, a pediatric rheumatologist at Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford in Palo Alto, Calif., follows pediatric patients who have juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Doctors know that these patients are at higher risk of getting an eye inflammation disease called uveitis. If not detected and treated in time, uveitis can cause serious eye damage, including blindness.

The difficulty for doctors is predicting which patients will get the condition. Sometimes the children experience blurry vision but don't tell anyone. Other times, there are no obvious signs of a problem until serious damage is done.

As a result, eye exams are done on the patients at random times. When several families mentioned during routine checkups that the uveitis seemed to act up when their children had allergies, Dr. Frankovich wondered if there might be a connection. Stanford researchers used data from electronic health records of unnamed patients from Lucile Packard Children's Hospital from 2000 to 2011, including clinical notes. They concluded that there was an association between allergies and flare-ups of uveitis in patients with juvenile arthritis.

While the doctor says more research must happen to prove the connection, the study suggests that when a patient has allergies, an eye exam should also be scheduled.

Elijah Taurke, a 12-year-old from Pacific Grove, Calif., plays the trombone and is on a travel soccer team. He was diagnosed at age 6 with juvenile idiopathic arthritis and within a year got uveitis too, says his father, Alex Taurke.

Elijah has a cataract in one eye caused by the uveitis. Elijah suffers from sinusitis, and learning of the association between allergies and uveitis has led his parents to be "more vigilant to go see the ophthalmologist when he has nasal issues," his father says.

Dr. Frankovich says that when she is with patients, she collects extensive information, giving detailed physical exams and asking questions about everything from new pets to changes at school or at home.

She wants to know as much as possible, she says, both to help patients now and because, down the road, "we will mine the data."

---

Navigating a Sea of Statistics

Examples of how mining electronic health records has helped doctors:

-- Data about patients with sore throats who visited a national clinic helped create a score to help determine if patients can rest at home or need to see a doctor for a strep test.

-- Doctors' claims to a nationwide health insurance plan helped find elevated risk of epilepsy in patients with common autoimmune diseases such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis.

-- An insurance claims database helped predict which patients were less likely to take their statins and might need programs to encourage them to take their medicine.

-- Electronic health records in an academic medical center database helped determine association between allergies and eye inflammation disease in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients.

Wall Street banks count commodities trading profits

While the world has been writing epitaphs for Wall Street banks' commodity trading desks, Wall Street is counting its profits.

Banks that held firm amid an industry pullback from energy, metals and agricultural markets - even some that beat a partial retreat - have mined a rich seam as North America's coldest winter in three decades drove up energy prices, results show.

Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Macquarie all flagged commodities trading as a bright spot in first-quarter earnings reports. Coalition, a consultancy which tracks banks' performance, estimates revenues for the top 10 banks in commodities rose 20 per cent year-on-year in the three months to March.

The robust earnings are notable because they come just as many banks are scaling back or exiting commodities trading altogether due to high costs and new regulations. Now, the question is whether the rebound can be sustained.

Many are sceptical. "It was a good quarter but overall it doesn't change the narrative," says George Kuznetsov, head of research and analytics at Coalition. "Once you exclude US power and gas, the fundamentals are still weak. Client activity in oil is still very low and metals had a poor quarter."

In the past year, JPMorgan Chase, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Morgan Stanley have all announced a partial or wholesale withdrawal from commodities markets.

But the strong recent performance highlights the potential reward from riding out the tough times. Revenues of the top 10 banks trading natural resources fell last year to $4.5bn last year, down from a record $14.1bn in 2008.

The common denominator across the recent results was the past winter, which triggered steep price rises in North American natural gas and electricity and generated plenty of moneymaking opportunities. Benchmark natural gas hit five-year highs above $6 per million British thermal units and some spot prices breached $100.

Banks able to send molecules of gas to utilities or electrons on to power lines "profited handsomely," says Brad Hintz, banking analyst at Bernstein Research. Both Morgan Stanley and Goldman "controlled power plants that apparently had free capacity," he adds.

Goldman's chief financial officer, Harvey Schwartz, reported "significantly" improved commodities revenues thanks to "really unusually strong volatility".

The bank has defended its franchise as the Federal Reserve reviews limiting banks' ownership of physical commodities such as gas in pipelines. In a letter to the Fed last month, Goldman said banks assured steady supplies of gas, the primary heating fuel for half of US households.

"Transactions of this type facilitated the ability of utilities in the Midwest to meet unprecedented customer demand this winter," the bank wrote.

Goldman broke into the top 10 North American gas marketers after increasing annual volumes by 25 per cent in the prior two years, according to Natural Gas Intelligence. Mr Schwartz told analysts: "The feedback we are getting from clients is that . . . there may be some benefit to those market participants that stay strong in commodities like us."

Citigroup's revenues from commodities trading almost doubled in the three months to March, rising to $224m from $119m in the same period a year earlier and just $43m less than it generated in all of 2013.

"We had a strong first quarter driven by higher volatility in energy markets and the resultant increase in client activity," says Stuart Staley, the bank's global head of commodities.

Morgan Stanley, while in the process of selling its global oil merchant trading business to Rosneft of Russia, said "broad-based strength across the energy complex" had boosted the performance of its wider fixed income business.

Not everyone benedited from the winter's energy price swings. Earnings at Cargill were pinched by a loss in US power in late January, the commodities trading house has said. Citadel, the Chicago-based hedge fund, also lost money in gas earlier in the year, a person familiar with the matter says.

"People who were trading natural gas either made a lot of money or lost a lot of money depending upon where you were positioned," Jeff Sprecher, chief executive of IntercontinentalExchange, told analysts last week.

Banks, then, were simply among those correctly positioned. "Some people are leaving the market, but some people are stepping up," Nicholas Moore, chief executive of Australia-based Macquarie, said after the bank reported annual results earlier this month. "There's never any shortage of competition."

That competition is increasingly coming from the big independent trading houses, such as Glencore, Mercuria, Trafigura, and Vitol. They are filling the void left by the banks' retreat and the trading arms of oil companies such as BP.

From Mr Ike Brannon.

Sir, Edward Luce, in " Hedge funds are testing the quality of US democracy " (May 12) fails to assess correctly the situation regarding the current lawsuits involving Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and ignores the basic tenets of the law regarding the US Treasury's illegal sweep amendment of 2012.

The government set the rules of the road in 2008 when it placed the government-sponsored enterprises into conservatorship, and even the Federal Housing Finance Agency clearly stated in public documents that shareholders would continue to retain all their rights in the companies' stock.

However, in 2012, the law was ignored when the Treasury decided to illegally sweep all future profits from the two companies. These lawsuits have nothing to do with the original bailout agreement, the current reform debate, or the future of the GSEs.

They are focused on upholding the rule of law and holding the government accountable to the contracts to which it agreed.

Congress is free to do with the GSEs what it wishes, either by reforming from within or creating entirely new entities. The lawsuits do not interfere with this in any way. They simply ask that any actions involving housing respect the rule of law and repeal the Treasury's illegal profit sweep.

The US has the most liquid markets in the world because it upholds contracts and legal agreements. However, the Treasury's actions in 2012 threaten that system by illegally ignoring private shareholders' rights. Furthermore, any hope to inject private capital into the mortgage market is seriously threatened if private capital is not confident the government will honour its legal responsibilities to shareholders. Housing reform is complicated, but basic fairness is not, and the government has the obligation to respect private shareholders' investments.

Acquisition of compiler would be biggest in exchange's history, write FT reporters

The London Stock Exchange Group is one of a handful of bidders in the auction for Russell Investments in what would be the UK exchange's biggest acquisition in its 213-year history.

The group confirmed yesterday that it was talking to Russell's parent company, US-based Northwestern Mutual, for the index compiler and asset management group that began a sale process in January.

LSE's interest is principally for Russell's indexing business, which is best known for US equity benchmarks such as the Russell 2000, according to people with knowledge of the situation.

Owning the Russell index and its affiliated products would be a transformational leap for LSE as it would be part of a bold push into the US market where the Russell name is prominent among traders and fund managers.

Russell's business also comprises consulting and asset management, with around $260bn in assets under management. The entire business could fetch a price tag of around $3bn, these people said.

A deal would be part-funded through an equity raising, the LSE said. At 18.08, the LSE's share price is close to an all-time high, but fell 2.5 per cent on the day.

Goldman Sachs, which is advising Russell, however, has pursued buyers for the entire business since the auction was launched, according to two of the people. That has left the status of late-stage interest from LSE and MSCI uncertain as a deal for the entire business would raise questions over the stewardship of an asset management business in the hands of an index business or an exchange operator.

Northwestern, which is being advised by JPMorgan Chase, has also attracted interest from private equity groups and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.

The field may be narrowed further before a final decision is made.

A purchase would also allow the exchange to unite the index business with FTSE International, which it owns outright after purchasing the 50 per cent it did not own from Pearson, the parent company of the Financial Times, for 450m in 2011.

Together the combination would allow the LSE to take on leaders in the indexing business, MSCI and S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a sector which has also seen Nasdaq OMX, Markit and Bloomberg deepen their interest and ambitions in recent years.

The LSE's move is the latest indication of how rival exchanges and financial data companies have sought to tighten their grip on market data compilers as fund managers demand more index-based products, value-added data and analytical tools.

"[A purchase of] Russell would allow LSE Group to compete more effectively with MSCI, would improve liquidity in LSEG's shares, and would provide more recurring revenue but our final opinion would be impacted by price paid, profitability of the underlying asset, potential synergies and deal structure," said Peter Lenardos, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.

Earlier this year, Bloomberg took control of one of the world's top indices for commodity prices from UBS as well as the Swiss bank's Australian bonds indices.

Barclays is in the process of selling its fixed-income index business and risk analytics platform.

The sales come as banks are retreating from setting financial benchmarks in the wake of the Libor scandal.

That could lead to questions about CIBC's interest for Russell, according to market participants, who pointed out that banks are exiting not entering the index business because of regulatory risks.

A switch in market data provider by a large fund manager can provide a significant boosts to earnings. A decision by Vanguard, one of the world's largest asset managers, to move some of its biggest funds from MSCI to FTSE contributed to a 29 per cent rise in interim revenues at FTSE, to 83.9m.

Premier Asset Management's Jake Robbins has bought into a Chinese bank in spite of negative sentiment towards the banking sector in the world's second-largest economy.

The manager of the 72.7m Premier Global Alpha Growth fund has invested in China Construction Bank (CCB) even though there are fears that more of the country's banks will be forced to take losses on bad loans . The government has indicated several times that it is prepared to let loans and bonds default in order to improve the Chinese bond market.

Mr Robbins says: "CCB shares have been poor and people are concerned that bad loans will pick up, and I think they will overall, but CCB has loan coverage of more than 200 per cent.

"It is currently very profitable with a 20 per cent return on equity, but it is trading at less than book value. The market has priced in a huge blow-up of the Chinese economy ."

The manager had 22 per cent of his portfolio invested in Asia at the end of March 2014 and says China looked "particularly cheap".

"Valuations there are easy to buy and at very attractive yields," he adds. "There is a lot of value in emerging markets in general but something needs to change sentiment wise, and I am not sure what that is. Chinese stimulus could do it, but until then it could stay cheap for a bit."

Mr Robbins also questions the wisdom of asset allocators piling into Europe to back its economic recovery, arguing that it is "difficult to find" good-value opportunities that are not priced as if the economy is going to "blow the lights out".

He says some industrial companies were reporting results that are "not very good", which could threaten the fragile cyclical recovery on the continent.

Elsewhere in his portfolio, Mr Robbins has reduced an underweight position in oil and gas stocks through the purchases of three companies specialising in shale-gas development.

The manager has added holdings in Helmerich & Payne and EOG Resources, which are heavily involved in the production of shale gas in the US . He has also bought into Beach Energy, an Australian drilling company at the forefront of that country's fledgling shale-gas industry.

"Beach Energy was the first company with rights to develop shale-gas drilling in Australia," Mr Robbins says.

"The issue is trying to ascertain whether that is commercially viable. The Australian government has signed a lot of agreements to sell gas into Asia and is committed to exporting that. It is a high-risk position, but none of that potential from shale gas is in the share price."

The manager says the improving global economy could prove a positive catalyst for the oil price, while the potential stepping up of sanctions against Russia imposed by Europe and the US could also be positive for the price of oil "in the short term".

Since Mr Robbins took on the Global Alpha Growth fund in November 2011 it has posted a third-quartile gain of 32.2 per cent, compared with the IMA Global sector average of 35.1 per cent, according to data from FE Analytics.

Alibaba IPO Pressures Yahoo Chief

By Douglas MacMillan

The clock is now ticking for Marissa Mayer.

Since she joined the Internet company nearly two years ago, the Yahoo Inc. chief executive has had more time than her predecessors to attempt one of the most unlikely turnarounds in the history of Silicon Valley. But revenue at the company is still flat, its share of the digital advertising market is dwindling and Ms. Mayer has struggled to define a clear corporate vision.

Later this year, investors may lose patience, say analysts who follow the company. Alibaba's expected fall IPO will force Yahoo to sell about 40% of its stake, prompting investors to reassess the true value of its business. Many analysts believe Yahoo's $35 billion market capitalization is mostly made up of its stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan.

Despite ranking second to Google Inc. in Web and mobile traffic, according to researcher comScore Inc., "the financial turnaround hasn't materialized," said Jordan Rohan, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. "Yahoo's core franchise may be a slowly melting iceberg."

Yahoo declined to make Ms. Mayer available to comment.

For a turnaround to get going, Yahoo needs a new revenue growth engine, said Mr. Rohan and others. Yet instead of focusing on one emerging area, Ms. Mayer has spread the company's resources across a dizzying array of businesses to refresh its engineering talent and to add more users.

The CEO has invested more than $1.2 billion on three-dozen small acquisitions, ranging from an e-commerce analytics tool to a Web browser to an image-recognition company. She hired celebrity journalists and touted plans to produce two original comedy series with star talent to fashion Yahoo into a next-generation media company. And she has renewed an emphasis on search and talked up efforts in mobile software.

When asked to describe her vision for Yahoo, Ms. Mayer has variously called it a "daily habits" company, a "personalization company," and a search engine where "you become the query." Some analysts say Yahoo can't shake off its identity as an Internet portal -- a patchwork of websites and apps driven by advertising.

Ms. Mayer has warned investors her priority is building a large audience of users, not selling ads. She has made modest gains: Recent revamps of popular sites like Yahoo Finance and Yahoo's home page helped boost desktop and mobile traffic to an all-time high of 229 million unique U.S. visitors in March, up 2.7% from a year earlier, according to comScore.

Those efforts have yet to pay off. In the first quarter, Yahoo's ad sales minus commissions were $853 million, up 2% from two years ago. In contrast, Google's ad revenue rose 38% while Facebook Inc. has more than doubled ad sales in the same period. The latter have a combined 38% of the global digital advertising market, while Yahoo's market share has fallen to 3%, estimates researcher eMarketer Inc. Yahoo's total revenue last quarter fell 1% to $1.13 billion and earnings slipped 20% to $311.6 million, both year on year.

And yet Yahoo's stock has more than doubled in the two year period mostly because of its 22.6% stake in Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Its shares closed down 15 cents at $33.92 on Thursday.

"Yes, things should always move faster" said Adam Cahan, head of mobile at Yahoo. "But as a company, we're starting to see the results of our work. There is naturally a lag time between hiring the team, creating the products, scaling them, getting users engaged with them and then monetizing."

Ms. Mayer has yet to show she can buy her way to growth. Her biggest deal, to acquire Tumblr for $1.1 billion in 2013, has begun to lose visitors, from a peak of 49 million in December, to 42 million in March, according to comScore. The blogging platform has yet to generate any meaningful revenue, as advertisers haven't figured out how best to sell ads on its pages, said Gian LaVecchia, managing partner at ad agency MEC Global.

"It's not a must for many brands yet," Mr. LaVecchia said. "When Yahoo bought it you worried that Tumblr would lose its swagger and it definitely has."

User growth will be meaningless if Yahoo can't improve its relationship with marketers, which has been strained under Ms. Mayer. In January, she fired her operating chief and top executive, Henrique de Castro, after the pair clashed on numerous occasions, according to a person familiar with the situation. Now, the top ad executive is former AOL Inc. executive Ned Brody. "I need to get all the marketers to start using our products so they can understand them to a better extent," Mr. Brody said in April.

Part of the challenge is that advertiser demand for the premium, higher-priced banner ads that Yahoo specializes in is waning. In their place are newer methods of targeting individual Web surfers using algorithms of the type that Google and Facebook increasingly dominate.

Ms. Mayer hasn't detailed how she plans to use the IPO cash, telling investors only that the company plans to be "good stewards of capital" and continue making strategic and "tuck-in" acquisitions. If she plans to reinvigorate growth through deals, the Alibaba cash may be her last chance. Analysts expect Yahoo to receive about $10 billion after taxes. Added with its $1.7 billion in net cash at the end of March, Yahoo would have close to $12 billion to spend.

An acquisition that could bolster Yahoo's revenue and expand its audience would be AOL, said Colin Gillis, an analyst at BGC Partners Inc. It has about twice the video traffic as Yahoo and a large network of content and advertising. AOL's ad revenue rose 14% last year to $1.6 billion. And with AOL's market value earlier this week dropping to below $3 billion, "the deal size is about right," Mr. Gillis estimated.

A spokesman for AOL declined to comment on the potential for a takeover.

Another area of focus for Ms. Mayer is search, a technology she helped pioneer as one of Google's earliest employees. Though Yahoo relies on Microsoft Corp. to power its search results, the company has hundreds of employees developing new tools for viewing those results and has struck deals to add extra content from partners. Ms. Mayer has attempted to end the search pact before it comes up for renegotiation in 2015.

Search ads account for more than 40% of Yahoo's revenue. This reliance on search presents risk, as more users gravitate toward mobile devices, where Google and Apple Inc. control the operating systems and can direct users to search engines.

Ms. Mayer may need to work quickly before the Alibaba IPO. Yahoo's shares may dip as some investors shift and take a position directly in the Chinese e-commerce site.

"There will probably be a churn in the investor base," said Sameet Sinha, an analyst at investment bank B. Riley & Co. "Because what's left with Yahoo is a non-growing asset with a question about value."

Experian in slow-trade warning over World Cup; SUPPORT SERVICES

Experian shares fell 6 per cent yesterday after the data analytics group warned about the negative effects of the football World Cup in Brazil and a reorganisation of its US consumer business.

Presenting full-year results, the FTSE 100 company said it would struggle with a number of factors in the first half, including a "subdued trading environment" in Brazil.

Experian provides credit-checking services through its Serasa business in the country, which is hosting the World Cup in June - a month-long party that is expected to be a boon for companies such as drinks producer Diageo and temporary power provider Aggreko.

But all major Brazilian cities have the right to grant local public holidays on the dates that World Cup matches are played - which will potentially reduce the amount of client activity, and revenue, for the Serasa operation.

"The country will effectively shut down for commerce, particularly on days when Brazil plays, so people will not be making the type of financial transactions that tend to drive our business," said Don Robert , chief executive, who will succeed Sir John Peace as Experian chairman in July.

However, analysts said changes at Experian's North American consumer services division would be more significant. Experian is phasing out a number of "free" brands - such as freecreditscore.com - in the region, as part of a move to establish Experian.com as a single umbrella brand.

But rising use of Experian.com was keeping pace with the declining use of the "free" services, the company said, which would constrain revenue growth in the first half.

One of those drivers is US healthcare, which Experian believes could eventually eclipse its core consumer credit business in the country.

Its healthcare division - which includes the data provider Passport Health Communications , acquired in November - helps hospitals, clinics and doctors collect payments from patients.

In the UK, Experian's credit business registered record growth in revenues and users.

Brian Cassin, finance director, who is set to take over as chief executive, said: "We're creating demand because we're educating consumers about the importance of knowing their credit history and credit score."

Overall, for the 12 months to the end of March, Experian achieved total revenues from continuing operations of $4.8bn, a 7 per cent rise at constant currencies. Earnings before interest and tax from continuing operations rose 8 per cent to $1.3bn.

The shares closed down 69p at 10.65, and have fallen almost 10 per cent in six months.

WSJ.D Technology: Free-to-Play Wins the Game

For much of the past decade, online-gaming companies poured millions of dollars into developing, marketing and releasing their signature creations to a community of gamers willing to pay set monthly fees to play.

That worked out well -- until the gamers stopped paying.

The shift in consumer preferences from subscription-style games to a free-to-play model has caught some startups off guard.

Gazillion Entertainment Inc., for example, raised $151 million in venture funding over the past nine years to use the subscription model, following the lead of hugely successful games like Activision Blizzard Inc.'s "World of Warcraft." But now Gazillion, the maker of "Marvel Heroes," is hitting the reset button, shifting to free-to-play games at a considerable cost to investors.

The startup, which investors valued at around $300 million last year, was recently recapitalized at a $40 million valuation.

Led by new backer Roth Capital Partners LLC, the $10 million round included participation from existing investors Oak Investment Partners and Temasek Holdings Pte Ltd.

"There are lots of companies that go through twists and turns," said Ren Riley, a partner at Oak Investment Partners and the company's earliest and largest venture investor. "We believe a lot of risk in this company is now behind it."

Gazillion, Trion Worlds Inc. and other online-gaming companies were founded as the frenzy was peaking for massively multiplayer online, or MMO, games.

Thanks to beefier servers and other technology, thousands of players were able to compete and cooperate with each other simultaneously from locations around the globe.

Inspired by "World of Warcraft," whose monthly subscribers quadrupled during 2006 to six million, many startups pursued the subscription model.

Such startups raised large amounts of venture funding to develop high-quality MMOs. But by the time they were ready, the gaming market had changed.

As mobile devices proliferated and free-to-play games became more common, online gamers became less willing to swallow a recurring monthly expense, and the genre largely fell out of favor.

After hitting 12 million subscribers in 2010, "World of Warcraft" has steadily lost players, now hovering around 7.6 million.

Free-to-play games generate most of their revenue from a small portion of players -- the most engaged ones -- who purchase time-saving shortcuts, special weapons and other features to enhance the experience as they advance through different levels.

According to gaming-research firm Newzoo BV, this shift in gaming dollars is increasing. The market for free-to-play MMO games represents the fastest-growing gaming segment world-wide, projected by Newzoo to increase to $13.3 billion in 2016 from $6.5 billion in 2012.

Trion, which since its founding in 2005 has raised at least $185 million from venture investors, including Trinity Ventures and DCM, has made all its games free-to-play.

The Redwood City, Calif., company rebuilt its "Rift" and "Defiance" games to be free in June 2012 and plans for its next two games, "ArcheAge" and "Trove," to be free to play as well.

Gazillion, which relied on a subscription model with its previous games, has rebuilt its primary game, "Marvel Heroes," as free-to-play. The San Mateo, Calif., startup has an exclusive deal with Marvel Entertainment LLC to use the comic-book characters in its MMO role-playing games.

Another company, Electronic Arts Inc.'s BioWare, launched "Star Wars: The Old Republic" in 2011 with significant buzz. It quickly gained subscribers but then lost some 25% of its players before embracing a free-to-play model about a year later.

Other MMO games, including Blue Hole Studio Inc.'s "Tera" and Sony Online Entertainment's "EverQuest," also made the shift.

Meanwhile, subscription MMOs are expected to drop to $6.3 billion from $6.6 billion over the same stretch, according to Newzoo.

Changing business models in the gaming sector requires a major overhaul of information-technology, marketing and other departments.

Unlike subscription games, which rely on a blockbuster launch to get a critical mass of gamers to sign up and create a community in one swoop, the free-to-play games develop in stages.

Servers and other IT infrastructure are added as needed, and marketing is also gradual.

Companies take cues from a game's early users, introducing features, levels and characters based on data the company gathers and community suggestions.

"These companies spend a lot more time getting to know their players before they pump up the marketing," Newzoo Chief Executive Peter Warman said.

Gazillion has hired a head of sales and marketing and will use much of its fresh funding to expand the sales and marketing team and promote "Marvel Heroes," which lets gamers play as comic-book characters such as Iron Man and Captain America to defeat villains.

"The nature of the market is you release it and iterate, iterate, iterate," Mr. Riley said. "Now we're adding more marketing and analytics in the company. That's the DNA that needs to be injected."

Gazillion also plans to introduce the game to France and Germany this year, followed by Brazil, Russia and ultimately Asia.

Gazillion Chief Executive Dave Brevik said the company had $11 million in 2013 revenue and he expects $25 million this year.

The Intelligent Investor: Get Ready for Regulators To Peer Into Your Portfolio

Bad brokers, meet RoboRegulator.

In December, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which oversees how investments are sold, proposed what it calls Cards, an electronic system that would regularly collect data on balances and transactions in brokerage accounts.

If adopted, Cards would revolutionize how regulators do their jobs and could make it harder for unscrupulous brokers to bilk customers.

But some critics think it could endanger the privacy and security of investors' confidential data. And the proposal ups the ante for Finra, which often has been criticized for letting wrongdoers slip through the cracks.

Under Cards (which stands for Comprehensive Automated Risk Data System), Finra would collect -- probably weekly -- a record of activity at all of the more than 4,100 brokerage firms nationwide.

Finra would scour the data continuously, looking for any hints that a firm or a broker might be taking advantage of a client: excessive trading or commissions, switching from one mutual fund to another, overcharging for bond trades, overconcentrating in risky or illiquid securities, and so on.

Cards "would provide us with a treasure trove of information and the ability to focus quicker on firms that are placing investors at high risk," Richard Ketchum, Finra's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview.

Social Security numbers and other personal details won't be included in Cards, so Finra won't be able to identify which investor an account belongs to or to match any investor's holdings across firms. Nor will the data give anyone access to cash or securities.

Finra relies now partly on data analysis and partly on field examiners who gather information piecemeal on potential wrongdoing. With Cards, an ocean of detail would flow into Finra's computers automatically.

That, Mr. Ketchum argues, would enable the regulator to stop at least some misdeeds before too much damage is done. And the sense that a regulatory RoboCop is watching their every move could deter some brokers from doing anything wrong in the first place.

"If we can easily compare information across firms, that will build enormously greater power into our focus," Mr. Ketchum says. "I have no doubt that this is going to be the standard for regulation in the next three to five years."

Some experts, however, worry that Cards could be overkill.

"This goes beyond mere concerns about Big Brother," says Henry Hu, who oversaw data analytics as former director of the Division of Economic and Risk Analysis at the Securities and Exchange Commission and is now a law professor at the University of Texas in Austin. "I think Cards creates a new form of systemic risk."

Mr. Hu worries that Cards would take data that is widely dispersed -- say you have money scattered across accounts at E*Trade, Fidelity Investments, Morgan Stanley and Charles Schwab -- and centralize it for the first time. That could make it more vulnerable.

"It's a Pearl Harbor problem," Mr. Hu says. "All the ships and airplanes are in one place at the same time."

The probability of the data being breached by a disgruntled employee, a terrorist or an unfriendly government is probably very low, Mr. Hu concedes -- but the consequences could be dire.

"Just read any trashy spy novel," he says. "If you were a hostile foreign government, you would immediately put some of your top people to work" trying to crack into Cards.

Finra vehemently disputes that Cards could create systemic risk. The chance that anyone could penetrate the system and exploit the anonymous data for nefarious purposes is "infinitesimally small, out on the fringe of all possibilities," says Steven Joachim, an executive vice president at Finra.

"The good that will come from the dramatically increased ability to reduce fraud will way overwhelm that extraordinarily remote risk," Mr. Joachim adds.

Mr. Ketchum says he hopes that Cards will go to the Securities and Exchange Commission for final approval by next year, after further refinements and input from brokerage firms and the public.

Consumer advocates have long claimed that Finra is insufficiently tough on the brokerage industry that helps fund it. But if Cards does go through as planned, Finra's new powers could leave the regulator itself with nowhere to hide.

"If they get all this information and fail to find a problem or to do enough about it, they could be open to serious criticism," says Mike Stone, formerly a senior regulator at the SEC and a top legal officer at Morgan Stanley, now an adjunct professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York.

"We would welcome that scrutiny," Mr. Ketchum says. "If we're not using the data [from Cards] properly, that's where we should be held accountable."

Access to Big Data can still leave big problems festering. After all, the recent prosecutions of insider trading were set off as much by informants wearing wires as by computers running sophisticated analysis on data.

But if Finra does end up putting all its cards on the table, it will have to follow the data wherever it leads.

Gazillion also plans to introduce the game to France and Germany this year, followed by Brazil, Russia and ultimately Asia. The company, which now employs around 100, is also planning to announce products related to Marvel's "Guardians of the Galaxy" theatrical release in August.

Gazillion Chief Executive Dave Brevik said the company had $11 million in 2013 revenue and he expects $25 million this year. based on the number of daily active users and the number of players converting from free to paying customers.

He said "Marvel Heroes" has three million registered users, and the game has doubled the number of daily active users and its monthly revenue during the past five months. The conversion from free to paid users is also strong, with roughly 14% of total users now paying for special characters, time savers and other items to make the games more enjoyable. The ARPPU, or average revenue per paying user, is more than $50 a month, Mr. Brevik said.

Roughly 85% of Gazillion's revenue comes from "Marvel Heroes," and the company's recent valuation reflects the promise of the game, Mr. Brevik said.

"The sins of the past are going to be erased. This [recapitalization] gives us a way to put that in the past and really flourish," said Mr. Brevik, a gaming veteran who helped create Blizzard Entertainment Inc.'s "Diablo" before assuming leadership of the reorganized company last year. "We've just begun to scratch the surface."

Abreast of the Market
Dow Edges Higher On Mixed Reports

U.S. stocks were uneven in choppy trading Wednesday, as investors weighed a mixed bag of economic data.

Investors were awaiting the Federal Reserve's monetary-policy statement due in the afternoon.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose eight points, less than 0.1%, to 16544 in midday trading. The index had climbed within seven points of its Dec. 31 all-time record of 16576.66 early in the session.

The S&P 500 index edged up less than 0.1% to 1879, and the Nasdaq Composite Index slipped eight points, or 0.2%, to 4095.

U.S. gross domestic product grew just 0.1% in the first quarter, far shy of the 1.1% growth economists had expected from the fourth quarter's 2.6%. Automatic Data Processing and Moody'sAnalytics reported that 220,000 jobs were created in April, above expectations for a rise of 210,000. Many view the report as a preview of the government's monthly jobs report due Friday.

The Institute for Supply Management's Chicago-area purchasing-managers index for April rose more than expected.

Economists were expecting the Fed to announce a further trimming of its bond-purchase program, a process known as tapering, by $10 billion a month to $45 billion.

Twitter's stock slumped 9.6% after the company reported late Tuesday that its user growth in the first quarter fell below Wall Street expectations. Shares fell despite first-quarter adjusted earnings and revenue that beat forecasts.

Some other consumer Internet stocks were also lower. LinkedIn lost 1.3%, and Yelp, which was to report results after the close, fell 4.2%.

EBay shed 4.9% after the company's first-quarter adjusted earnings topped forecasts but it provided a second-quarter outlook that was below current projections.

Vikram Pandit, the former chief executive of Citigroup, has become chairman of TGG Group, a consulting company co-founded by Steven Levitt, who co-wrote the pop economics book Freakonomics .

Promising to harness two popular themes - behavioural economics and "big data" - TGG, short for The Greatest Good, pitches itself to companies as a way to "improve performance, better serve customers, hire and retain the best talent and reduce cost".

Andrew Rosenfield, chief executive, said he met Mr Pandit when consulting for Citi and persuaded him to join after he was ousted from the bank in 2012.

"He would have been an extremely successful academic, which is an unusual characteristic for someone who became the CEO of one of the world's largest companies," said Mr Rosenfield, who is a managing partner at Guggenheim Partners, the asset manager.

Since then Hamid Biglari, former head of emerging markets at Citi, Lewis Kaden, former vice-chairman, and Shannon Bell, former head of communications, have also joined. TGG's office on Madison Avenue in New York is 200m from Citi's Park Avenue headquarters.

"In certain areas where we work clients may wish to have their expertise as part of the process," said Mr Rosenfield of his Citi alumni.

In an internal memo to staff, which he said included about 50 young economists and statisticians, Mr Rosenfield spared no buzzword, saying the company was about "unpacking the knowledge hidden in 'big data'. We also exploit the newest thinking in behavioural economics and are the leading experts in designing 'nudges' and 'choice architectures'."

Nudge is a book co-written by Cass Sunstein, who is also listed as a partner at TGG, which argues human behaviour can be altered better by suggestion than instruction, and whose adherents have included David Cameron, the UK prime minister.

"Big data" is the ability to analyse vast amounts of stored information.

Mr Rosenfield said TGG had a policy of charging only for success. "We don't charge if we don't deliver value," he said. But that also meant it did not make outsized returns when advice was highly successful - "That seems sort of unsporting," he said - which is why the company is founding its venture arm.

Error By BofA Scuttles Buyback

An apparent communications blunder inside Bank of America Corp . forced the lender to shelve a plan to buy back shares and boost its dividend for the first time since 2008, another setback for Chief Executive Brian Moynihan 's efforts to escape the long shadow of the financial crisis.

The second-largest U.S. bank by assets Monday said it discovered a mistake in certain figures submitted to the Federal Reserve for the regulator's annual "stress tests" of major U.S. financial institutions. The error leaves the Charlotte, N.C., bank with $4 billion less in capital than it thought it had. The bank had been making the same calculation error since 2009, according to a person close to the bank.

Bank of America brought the mistake to the Fed's attention. The regulator revoked its prior approval of a dividend increase and gave the bank until May 27 to submit a new plan. But the bank said the cash returned to investors in the new plan will be less than in the previous one.

Disappointed shareholders pushed the stock down 6.3%, to $14.95 a share, the biggest one-day plunge since 2012.

The blunder shows the difficulties executives and regulators face in overseeing financial firms that have become more complex and more sprawling since a wave of forced mergers during the financial crisis.

Despite numerous federal regulators in its offices, and a huge apparatus of compliance employees and risk controls, neither Bank of America nor its overseers caught the mistake until last week.

Analysts said the capital shortfall was relatively small, but the mistake sparked concerns about whether Bank of America has enough control over its far-flung businesses.

The news "re-highlights broader questions of too-big-to-manage," said Evercore Group analyst Andrew Marquardt , while also underscoring the Fed's grip on the banking industry.

The problem on this year's test can be tied to a misunderstanding between two internal units about a change in the value of debt securities, said people close to the situation.

One of the units had been created to make sure the bank's capital plan didn't get rejected following a previous stress-test miss in 2011, these people said. The unit's head was promoted to chief risk officer for the bank Thursday.

Mr. Moynihan on Monday tapped another executive to oversee the bank's resubmission to the Fed. Terry Laughlin , the bank's president for strategic initiatives and a trusted ally of Mr. Moynihan's for two decades, also will helm an internal investigation about what went wrong, alongside corporate general auditor Christine Katziff . The bank declined to make Mr. Moynihan, Mr. Laughlin or Ms. Katziff available for comment.

A month ago, Bank of America appeared to be putting much of its financial-crisis woes behind it when it announced the Fed had granted it permission to raise its quarterly dividend and buy back stock.

"We are pleased," Mr. Moynihan said in a release on March 26, the day the Fed offered its initial approval.

Regulators in 2008 had forced Bank of America to drop its dividend payout to a penny per common share after it took a double helping of bailout loans to absorb its acquisition of troubled securities firm Merrill Lynch & Co .

The dividend became a major priority for Mr. Moynihan after he took over from his predecessor, Kenneth Lewis , in 2010.

The bank still has enough high-quality capital to meet regulatory requirements. Bank of America said the change has no impact on previously announced earnings results.

One former shareholder, John Moore , of Charlotte, N.C., said he is glad he sold the last of his shares earlier this month following a first-quarter loss fueled by huge legal expenses. "After a while, you finally give up," said the chairman of Moore Companies, a commercial real-estate investment firm.

Bank of America executives had been using the wrong calculations since 2009, but the problem didn't come to light until the last week when one finance employee discovered that numbers provided to an internal unit known as the enterprise capital management group were incorrect, said people familiar with the situation.

This is the second time in four tries Bank of America has flubbed the test. In March 2011, executives were taken aback when the Fed denied a modest dividend increase planned for the second half of that year.

The Fed has had problems of its own with how the stress tests are handled. This year it had to restate some of its initial analysis of big banks' capital levels in a downturn after finding what it called "inconsistencies" in some of the results. Banks for years have complained about premature test leaks, misunderstandings about when certain information could be disclosed and wide gaps between the banks' calculations and the Fed's.

The fact that Bank of America , rather than its regulator, detected its latest problem highlights how, despite a range of new risk-management requirements imposed since the financial crisis, bank supervisors remain reliant on megabanks to keep tabs on their own sprawling operations.

"Note that the Fed didn't catch this," ISI Group analyst Glenn Schorr said in a note Monday.

Bank of America 's disclosure is "a reflection of the work-in-progress nature" of the stress tests, said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of the policy-analysis firm Federal Financial Analytics Inc .

While the Fed checks the capital data banks submit for irregularities, the regulator doesn't examine each of the thousands of data points it receives, and Bank of America 's submission doesn't appear to have raised red flags. Still, Fed staff are reviewing how they study banks' submissions of regulatory capital data to see if improvements are needed, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Sam Pappas, CEO at Mystic Asset Management in Warwick, R.I., said he planned to hold on to his Bank of America shares.

"It's positive that Bank of America found the mistake and reported it to the Fed," Mr. Pappas said. "But it also makes you wonder what else could be lurking."

McGraw Hill Financial Results Helped By Strength at Indexes Division; Indexes Division Helped Offset Declines in Standard & Poor's Ratings Services

McGraw Hill Financial Inc. said first-quarter earnings from continuing operations grew 9%, as strength in its fast-growing indexes division helped offset declines in Standard & Poor's Ratings Services.

The New York-based company earned $248 million, or 89 cents a share, versus $735 million, or $2.59 a share, in the year-prior quarter, which included a $612 million gain from the sale of discontinued operations.

Excluding special items, earnings from continuing operations were 89 cents a share, up from 80 cents a year earlier. McGraw Hill's first-quarter revenue rose 4.7% to $1.24 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected adjusted earnings of 87 cents a share on revenue of $1.24 billion.

The company also reaffirmed its full-year earnings outlook of $3.75 to $3.85 a share.

McGraw Hill shares were down 1% in early afternoon trade at $74.33, putting the stock down 4.9% for 2014.

The S&P Ratings segment reported revenue growth of 1% to $569 million and operating profits fell 4%, as global debt issuance started slowly this year. Overall company revenue was driven by financial information divisions S&P Dow Jones Indices and Platts, which grew 18% and 14%, respectively.

The two units also represent a bigger slice of McGraw Hill's profits: Some 48% of operating profits were derived from non-rating businesses, up from 41% during the same quarter a year ago.

"Bond issuance was erratic during the quarter, but overall it was weak," said McGraw Hill Chief Executive Douglas L. Peterson during Tuesday's earnings call with analysts. Excluding sovereign debt, the total number of bond issues declined by 27% compared with the first quarter of 2013, he added. The indexes unit and Platts, which offers analytics for global commodity markets, "have grown into major contributors," Mr. Peterson said.

Jack Callahan, McGraw Hill's chief financial officer, said on the call that S&P Ratings' performance this year could be "flat to modestly down." But growth could pick up in the third and fourth quarters, he added.

"Indices was the standout," Douglas Arthur, an analyst with Evercore Group LLC, wrote in a note to investors following the quarterly report.

McGraw Hill's first-quarter profits were "driven by expenses, as revenues were weaker than we anticipated," Patrick O'Shaughnessy, an analyst with Raymond James & Associates, Inc., wrote in a note to investors following the quarterly report. The company's operating margins of 34.8% beat Mr. O'Shaughnessy's estimate of 33.1%. But revenues in McGraw Hill's four major divisions each failed to meet projections, he added.

Formerly called McGraw-Hill Cos., the company has streamlined its operations, selling its education unit to private-equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC for $2.4 billion in 2013. It has also sold off trade publication Aviation Week and a broadcasting unit.

The company said last month it plans to sell its construction division, which provides commercial-real-estate information to developers and manufacturers. The company previously said it would also consider finding a partner to run the construction business.

McGraw Hill also said it would target $100 million in cost cuts over the next three years, focusing on its real-estate portfolio and consolidating technology, data acquisition and finance costs

S&P, which is facing a $5 billion fraud lawsuit brought by the federal government, said it had $1.5 billion in cash and equivalents at the end of the first quarter.

More broadly, the company has seen some cases filed against S&P dismissed, leaving it with "a couple dozen nongovernment cases," Mr. Peterson said.

The U.S. lawsuit alleges S&P ignored its own standards when rating mortgage bonds that eventually were downgraded during the financial crisis. A trial date has not been set, but both sides have indicated an acceptable start would be September 2015.

The other suits referred to by Mr. Peterson are largely civil actions, filed by private plaintiffs, challenging whether S&P's mortgage ratings were made in good faith.

S&P and other ratings firms had been expected to post robust profits for the latest quarter as they continue to benefit from a global spike in bond sales. S&P rival Moody's Corp. said last week its earnings rose 16% from the year-ago quarter, exceeding analysts' expectations with a boost from its analytics division.

Power Shifts to Pick at Morgan Stanley

By Justin Baer

Standing before a roomful of clients in Morgan Stanley's New York headquarters, Edward "Ted" Pick couldn't hold back tears.

His voice wavering, the investment bank's equities boss thanked money managers from firms such as Wellington Management Co. and Viking Global Investors during the June 2009 meeting for not abandoning Morgan Stanley even as it teetered near collapse during the financial crisis.

"The folks in this room stuck with us during the worst time in the history of this firm," he said, according to people familiar with the matter. "We're open for business."

Five years later, Morgan Stanley's success in the postcrisis era rests, in part, on how Mr. Pick and his business perform.

The equities division puts buyers and sellers together in the $60 trillion global stock market, while also handling stock derivatives, big blocks of shares and hedge-fund relationships. Once overshadowed by flashier businesses at the New York bank, Mr. Pick's unit has emerged from the crisis as one of its biggest growth engines.

At a time when debt securities, currencies and commodities businesses muddle through a slump in client activity, and new regulations threaten to rein in fixed-income trading well beyond the current malaise, stock trading is taking on more importance across Wall Street.

The shift has played to Morgan Stanley's strengths and helped catapult Mr. Pick, an executive known for his fierce devotion to the firm where he has spent his entire career, into a leading role.

In the precrisis years, when fixed-income trading boomed, and for a brief stint in 2009 when demand for fixed-income products exploded after the crisis, Morgan Stanley was an also-ran to the likes of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. But as debt trading subsided and the stock market began motoring, spurring a flurry of listings, Morgan Stanley's fortunes have changed.

The firm posted a 16% jump in stock-trading revenue in the first three months of the year, snatching the crown as revenue leader from Goldman for the second time in three quarters.

Morgan Stanley has repositioned itself since the crisis under Chief Executive James Gorman, moving away from riskier trading and toward steadier businesses such as wealth management and equities.

Mr. Pick, who declined to be interviewed for this article, was one of the people Mr. Gorman charged with executing that turnaround. A former capital-markets banker who spent most of his career taking clients public, the 45-year-old executive was reassigned in 2009 to lead an equities trading arm gravely wounded by the crisis.

Under the direction of his mentor, Colm Kelleher, who now heads the firm's securities business, Mr. Pick and his team remade the prime brokerage, which provides services and loans to hedge funds. They also invested heavily in electronic-trading platforms and led Morgan Stanley's traders back to the riskier corners of the business, including derivatives and block trades.

The revival, also engineered by lieutenants such as top sales executive Richard Portogallo and head trader Sam Kellie-Smith, has put Mr. Pick's name in the mix for bigger jobs at the firm, executives said, even if no promotion is imminent. He remains very close to Mr. Kelleher, and in his former role was among the bankers who secured key capital infusions for the firm during the crisis.

Yet Mr. Pick's current mission is far from complete. Competitors such as J.P. Morgan and UBS AG also are charging hard in equities, and Goldman remains a formidable foe whose executives loathe finishing second to Morgan Stanley in anything. Morgan Stanley lags behind some of its peers, including Goldman, in derivatives and block trades.

There are also no assurances the stock-trading renaissance will continue. The debate over the role of high-frequency traders could lead to new rules that crimp profit. Stocks could fall out of favor. The market also remains at risk to technology glitches that have roiled investors in recent years.

Colleagues say Mr. Pick is up for the task. Described as passionate and intense, he is skilled at dissecting the possible outcomes of a decision and imposing his process onto those who work for him. "You better be on your game" during meetings, one colleague said. He isn't hard to read, and will destroy ill-formed arguments, the colleague said.

Five-foot-nine and trim, with light brown hair that frames a prominent brow, Mr. Pick was born in New York. At age three, he moved to Caracas, where his father ran a petrochemical business, before returning with his family five years later to live on Long Island.

In April 2009, Morgan Stanley tapped Mr. Pick to be co-head of stock sales and trading from his capital markets post.

Mr. Pick had started at the firm in 1990 as an investment-banking analyst, then returned after collecting a master's degree in business administration from Harvard. He spent most of the next 15 years in the equity capital-markets unit, which takes companies public and manages their stock sales. Mr. Pick helped manage some of the biggest stock sales of the era, including Google Inc.'s auction and China Construction Bank's IPO.

When he took over the struggling equities division, Mr. Pick sought to shore up relationships with clients and extol the firm's virtues.

"He bleeds Morgan Stanley blue," said Roberto Mignone, a hedge-fund manager whose almost $2 billion firm, Bridger Management, continued to do business with Morgan Stanley in the wake of the crisis.

Hedge-fund clients pulled more than half their money from Morgan Stanley between October 2008 and March 2009, people familiar with the matter said.

Mr. Pick rolled out a strategy called the "nine boxes," a matrix of three businesses -- trading in stocks and derivatives as well as prime brokerage -- across three regions, the Americas, Europe and Asia. The goal: improve everywhere.

The firm also started its own electronic-trade order-entry system, called Passport, ahead of many of its rivals, allowing it to move some clients' trades onto a lower-cost platform, people familiar with the matter said.

"It's given them a huge advantage in the market," said Richard Prager, global head of trading and liquidity strategies at BlackRock Inc., the world's largest money manager.

By 2011, Morgan Stanley had overtaken Goldman and others to become the biggest trader of New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market-listed shares, according to an analysis of the exchanges' data by ModernIR, a data-analytics firm. That same year, Mr. Kelleher appointed Mr. Pick sole head of equities.

The unit's transformation was on full display on April 17, when Morgan Stanley reported first-quarter earnings that handily beat analysts' forecasts. During a conference call, Chief Financial Officer Ruth Porat called the prime brokerage "our gem franchise."

In a memo to senior staffers that day, Mr. Pick urged them to "be proud and be humble."

WEEKEND INVESTOR --- The New Basics -- Upside: Measuring Up the New 'Alternative' Funds

By Joe Light 
880 words
26 April 2014
The Wall Street Journal

English

Investors poured nearly $50 billion into "alternative" mutual funds in the past year, according to investment researcher Morningstar.

If only there were an easy way to see how well the funds perform.

The fast-growing category is something of a catchall, combining dozens of funds whose chief similarity is that they don't just buy stocks or bonds, like plain-vanilla funds do.

Some of the funds use strategies common in hedge funds, such as betting that stocks will fall in price or that a proposed company merger or acquisition will be completed. Some combine many different strategies under one umbrella. In general, the funds are supposed to give returns that aren't tied to the performance of stocks or bonds.

The end result is that investors and financial planners -- many of whom allocate money to alternatives in their portfolios -- are hard-pressed to select a good benchmark index against which a fund's performance can be measured.

It is a challenge that even fund companies struggle with.

The prospectus of the Neuberger Berman Absolute Return Multi-Manager Fund, which allocates money to subadvisers using various hedge-fund strategies, compares the fund to three indexes: the S&P 500, the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and the HFRX Absolute Return Index, an index of hedge funds.

"Hedge funds can have very different strategies. Sometimes there's no hedge at all," says Matthew Rubin, Neuberger's director of investment strategy.

That can make it inappropriate to compare one particular alternative fund to a general category that includes many different funds, Mr. Rubin says. In an email, he said that the Neuberger fund is more focused on meeting absolute-return and volatility objectives than on beating a single benchmark.

New York Life's MainStay Marketfield Fund has pulled in nearly $13 billion from investors over the past 12 months.

Marketfield is a so-called long/short equity fund, which can both buy stocks and sell them "short," betting that their prices will fall. Because of their ability to short stocks, such funds typically are much less volatile than funds that can only buy stocks.

And yet the Marketfield fund -- and many other alternative funds -- benchmarks itself against the S&P 500, a large-cap stock index that Marketfield, by design, doesn't track.

In 2008, for example, as the S&P 500 tumbled 37%, Marketfield lost only 13%. Last year, when the index rose 32%, including dividends, Marketfield rose only 17%. A New York Life spokeswoman said that no one was available to comment.

If a fund intentionally hedges its exposure to stocks, it isn't really fair to say that the fund did well in 2008 or poorly in 2013, says Jonathan Boersma, head of professional standards and a benchmarking expert at the CFA Institute. The problem is that it wasn't really designed to beat the S&P 500 during up markets in the first place.

One way to see why is to look at a metric called "standard deviation," a statistical measure of the variability in a fund's returns. A higher number means that a fund's or index's returns are more volatile.

Over the past five years, Marketfield has had a standard deviation of 10.5, versus 14 for the S&P 500. Over three years, it has been a little more than half as volatile as the index.

So how do you decide what to compare an alternative fund to?

The first step: Figure out what you might have invested in instead.

For investors new to alternatives, that could mean finding a combination of stocks and bonds -- or stocks and cash -- that comes close to the level of volatility of the alternative fund.

For example, because the Marketfield fund has been half as volatile as the S&P 500 for the past three years, an investor might appropriately expect it to gain -- or lose -- about as much as a portfolio of 50% stocks and 50% cash over that period. The Marketfield fund did better than that, returning 9.5% annually through Thursday, versus 15% for the S&P 500.

Investors can find a fund's standard deviation under the Ratings & Risk tab on the fund's page at Morningstar.com.

Another yardstick: What does the fund manager say his ultimate goal is?

Bruce Feibel, head of performance analytics at BNY Mellon Investment Management, notes that some alternative funds promise to protect investors in down markets. To see if a given fund has done that, an investor can look at its "downside capture ratio" -- also found on the Ratings & Risk page -- which measures the proportion of the stock market's downdrafts that a fund suffers.

A ratio of 50, for example, would mean that the fund only falls by 5% when the S&P 500 falls by 10%.

Ultimately, the fund should do what it says it will do. A "downside protection" fund should protect on the downside, while a fund that promises to deliver in both up and down markets, should show consistently positive returns.

 Analytics  Business Boosts Moody's Profit

Moody's Corp. posted record first-quarter profit on Friday, despite a slowdown in global bond issuance earlier this year that cooled some demand for its credit ratings.

Earnings rose 16% from a year earlier, and exceeded analysts' expectations with a boost from Moody'sanalytics division. But overall revenue fell short of Wall Street forecasts.

Moody's established its analytics business in 2007. It sells investors its proprietary analysis, research and market data and now represents about 31% of Moody's Corp.'s overall revenue. Its growth helps guard the company against slowdowns in bond issuance.

The global bond markets -- with record-high new issuance last year amid low interest rates set by central banks -- were quieter in January and February, before turning busier in March.

There are some early indications that issuance could continue to pick up, with 79% of leveraged loans last week being earmarked for corporate deal making, said Moody's Chief Financial Officer Linda Huber during an earnings conference call with analysts.

"That's an interesting statistic that might speak to increased M&A activity," Ms. Huber said in an interview.

An increase in deals could be a boon for ratings firms such as Moody's, because issuance would increase. "You have firms borrowing that otherwise would not be borrowing; that's beneficial for us," Moody's Chief Executive Raymond McDaniel said in an interview.

Moody's reported a quarterly profit of $218 million, or $1 a share, up from $188.4 million, or 83 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 4.8% to $767.2 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had projected per-share earnings of 91 cents and revenue of $770 million.

Moody's also backed its full-year earnings outlook of $3.90 to $4 a share. Its shares fell 52 cents to $79.13 on Friday.

Moody's had previously posted quarters with higher profits. But the $218 million tops all of the company's previous first quarters, which has traditionally been a slower time of year for bond issuance.

The strong earnings at Moody's underscore the recent rebound of credit-ratings firms, an industry that drew intense scrutiny from legislators and critics for its role in the financial crisis. This resurgence, industry executives say, is driven by demand for corporate and noninvestment-grade bonds -- not the complex, residential-mortgage securities that got top grades from the firms, but later soured.

Since the crisis, the industry has been subjected to more regulation, changed some of its ratings methodologies and invested in risk management, but it hasn't endured a major overhaul as some critics had hoped.

For the first quarter, the analytics division posted $241.4 million in revenue, a 15% rise from a year earlier, due in part to the firm's acquisition of Amba Investment Services in December.

Still, the bulk of the firm's revenue comes from its Moody's Investors Service debt-rating operation, which posted a revenue increase of less than 1% to $525.8 million during the most recent period. Within the unit, global corporate-finance revenue rose 2.4% to $264.4 million.

World News: Asia: Thailand Holds Rates Steady Despite Slowdown

Thailand's central bank held interest rates steady despite a fast decelerating economy caused by continuing political tensions.

The Bank of Thailand kept its key rates at 2%, in line with economists' expectations. Bank officials also said Wednesday they now expect growth this year to come in below 2.7%, already much lower than a forecast of 4.8% before Thailand's opposition launched a series of political protests in the fall. The bank expects an economic contraction in the first three months of 2014 versus the last quarter of 2013.

The central bank already has cut rates twice since antigovernment protesters, led by former opposition lawmaker Suthep Thaugsuban, began street rallies to oust Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra. The turmoil remains far from resolved after Thailand's Constitutional Court nullified in March the inconclusive Feb. 2 general election -- a move that further delayed the formation of a new government. New polls are unlikely to take place before July.

The situation has slowed government expenditure and damped domestic spending and investment. Tourist arrival numbers have plummeted. Exports have picked up recently but not by enough to counterbalance the fall in domestic demand which accounts for 80% of economic activity.

The central bank likely has decided rate cuts are a "blunt tool" that won't help boost growth while the political fighting continues, ANZ Bank said in a note to clients. Household debt also remains high, which makes it difficult for the bank to ease monetary policy too much, ANZ said.

Capital Economics is betting rates will remain on hold for the rest of 2014.

The central bank will want to keep rates high enough to ensure foreign capital doesn't flow out of the country, the London-based research firm said.

Some analysts say the deteriorating situation could force more easing. Su Sian Lim, an economist at HSBC, said the bank could possibly cut rates by 0.25 percentage point at its June meeting.

But Paiboon Kittisrikangwan, an assistant governor at the bank, said Wednesday that rate cuts won't help Thailand's economy.

"It should be noted that the restriction to the local economic recovery, at present, barely has much to do with the issues of liquidity and financial costs," he said.

"Our survey has found that the number one issue among entrepreneurs is political uncertainties in the country."

Thailand's deputy prime minister, Niwattumrong Boonsongpaisan, said Monday the government predicts growth of between 1% and 3% in 2014. "If the political unrest drags on until the end of the year, Thailand's GDP may contract or register no growth," he added.

The country will announce first-quarter gross domestic product data on May 19. The bank's next monetary policy meeting is in mid-June. "The political situation does not appear to be improving, and we expect this will take a significant chunk out of first quarter GDP growth," said Fred Gibson at Moody'sAnalytics.

Short sellers have slightly increased their bets against insurance claims processor Quindell, wagering that its shares are still overvalued even after hundreds of millions of pounds were wiped from its market value.

Quindell, which has promised to "revolutionise the insurance industry", is the subject of a scathing dossier of allegations from a US investor, which questions the company's profitability and acquisitions strategy.

Its shares closed up 12.6 per cent yesterday at 26.65p, but remain nearly one-third below their level before the dossier was published.

Quindell has said it "entirely rejects" the claims made by Gotham City Research , a little-known outfit linked to a short seller called Daniel Yu.

It has threatened legal action, and has promised to publish a full rebuttal this week.

Short sellers, however, do not appear to have taken advantage of Tuesday's share price fall to exit their positions at a profit.

The proportion of the company's shares that is on loan to short sellers rose from 6.2 per cent last week to 6.3 per cent on Tuesday, according to financial data provider Markit.

The rise "suggests short sellers believe holding on to their positions is still likely to still offer them results", said Karl Loomes, a market analyst at Astec Analytics.

Quindell was one of the best-performing stocks on London's junior market AIM following a flurry of acquisitions and contract wins which it said were worth over 1bn in revenue.

It signed a significant deal this month with RAC, handing Quindell the right to handle the car insurer's telematics customers.

Quindell had been targeting a move to a full London listing in May, with inclusion in the FTSE 250 share index by June. A prospectus for its London listing was due to be published today, although it is unclear this will go ahead.

In its dossier Gotham argued that Quindell's shares are worth 3p each. That contrasts with a price target of 87p set by analysts from Canaccord, a broker to Quindell.

Before this week, Quindell and its founder Rob Terry were dismissive of the prospects of short sellers criticising their business.

"[T]o the company's knowledge no one has made any significant money out of shorting Quindell's stock, whereas private individuals and institutions have made significant money from investing in it," it said in a statement to the FT last week.

Quindell's largest shareholders include fund managers M&G, Investec and Fidelity, which together own over 16 per cent of the business.

Mr Terry, who invested 11.5m in Quindell when its major business activities included a leisure club in Hampshire, has seen the value of his personal stake in the company fall to about 160m.

FT REPORT - WORKING IN INTERNATIONAL BANKING
IT staff move to centre stage as customers take to their tablets

Technology Changing habits are boosting demand for digital leaders and specialists, says Virginia Marsh

Any doubt that IT drives today's banks has just been dispelled by Michael Lewis's book Flash Boys . Delving deep into the world of high-frequency trading, the American writer describes the astonishing lengths to which US investment banks go to gain milliseconds over their rivals.

But while their traders compete with upstarts that go as far as boring through mountains to lay hundreds of miles of fibre-optic cable between US exchanges, banks' customers are demanding new technology of a less controversial kind.

Many already expect to perform their mainstream banking in seconds using smartphones and tablets, a way of life that was a novelty five years ago.

Francesco Gonzlez, chief executive of Spain's BBVA, a digital pioneer, believes that within three years only 5 per cent of consumer interaction will be through physical banks. In the US, Bank of America customers already pay in 9 per cent of their cheques by emailing a digital photo.

As banks scramble to keep up, information technology and the people who make it work have moved centre stage.

"IT has gone from being a service to being a core part of how a bank faces its market," says Mike Beresford, managing director of specialist recruiter Randstad Technologies in the UK.

"Previously, a [chief information officer] would have input into board discussions. Now, CIOs work very much arm in arm with the [chief operating officer] or chief executive. They have become integral."

Moreover, there is a bigger C-suite to fill: enter the CDO, which can stand for both chief digital and chief data officer.

The former - described by Wired, the technology magazine, as the new "it" position for fast-growing businesses - oversees digitisation and new digital technologies, while the latter is responsible for the governance and use of an organisation's information, or data.

How banks manage "big data" - the vast amounts of information generated by online activity and storable relatively inexpensively - is critical. But it is something they are only just waking up to.

"Banks can use this data to forge ahead," says Kimberly Kelly Fahey, at Randstad in New York. "But they need real people to analyse it and make it usable."

As such, demand for specialists in data mining, analysis, management and storage is "beyond belief", says a senior financial services executive. Other hot areas include: message-based services architecture and design skills; cyber security; and good "change team" and project managers.

Creating chief digital and chief data officers is far from straightforward and banks are struggling with their organisational structures. For example, with web design being intrinsic to business models, should those working on it be classed as IT or marketing staff?

"Banks are in transition," says Rob Toguri, enterprise intelligence partner for the Emea region at EY, the professional services firm. "How are they doing technology and where does it sit in the organisation? No longer are technical staff confined to technical discussions. They need to know the vocabulary of business first."

To that end, banks are pulling in staff from sectors such as retail and media.

"The biggest thing I am looking for, in one word, is diversity, not just nationality, but diverse sets of opinions and experiences, and ways of working," says Aman Narain, global head of digital banking at Standard Chartered, the emerging markets specialist (see article, right) .

In the US, banks underinvested in IT talent after the 2008 financial crisis and staff sat tight. Now many, otherwise satisfied with their jobs, are prepared to move for better pay - and are finding offers, says Ms Fahey.

There is movement in the UK too, says Mr Beresford, but the bigger trend is for counter-offers. His team saw more of them in the first quarter than in the whole of last year. For Mr Narain, who is based in Singapore, attrition comes from staff forming start-ups.

Not surprisingly, reliance on IT contractors, long a feature of banking, is on the increase. In UK investment banking they constitute as much as 40 per cent of IT staff, says Stephen Rutherford, managing director at Michael Page, the recruiter. This not only reflects market dynamics, it is structural, he says, noting that contracting is becoming a career choice rather than something done between jobs or pre-retirement.

Nearshoring, often to southern and eastern Europe, is also on the rise. Deutsche Bank, for example, last year opened a global technology centre in Bucharest, the Romanian capital.

The cost difference with India has narrowed. However, recruiters say banks in Europe also want higher value functions and processes near at hand.

This reflects pressure for faster turnround times and a belief that local teams have the educational edge and language skills both to create the richest new content and apps, and to cope with the new, tougher regulation and compliance demands that prompted the need for more robust IT departments in the first place.

Ratings Firms Ride Bond Resurgence

Six years after getting a failing grade for their role in the financial crisis, credit-rating firms are at the top of the class.

Riding a global bond boom, the two biggest U.S. firms, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Moody's Investors Service, this month are expected to post record first-quarter profits. Fitch Ratings said in its annual filing this month that 2013 was "one of its best years ever."

Beyond the spike in bond deals, the resurgence is due largely to the absence of any major changes to the industry since the crisis: The business model, in which debt issuers pay for ratings, remains in place; regulations proposed years ago are yet to be implemented; and new competitors have gotten little more than a toehold.

This is despite heated rhetoric from regulators and legislators in the wake of the crisis, in which they castigated the firms for giving elevated ratings to mortgage-related bonds that later soured. The industry's ability to escape relatively unscathed is in contrast to others, most notably big Wall Street banks, that have been the target of a wave of regulation designed to change behavior that contributed to the meltdown.

"There was a lot of talk, but there wasn't a lot of action," said Marc Joffe, a former senior director at Moody's and now principal consultant at Public Sector Credit Solutions in Walnut Creek, Calif., who has been critical over the lack of major changes to the ratings world.

The issuer-pay model has been lucrative for the ratings firms, as guidelines for many institutional investors still require bonds to be rated, often dictating that it be done by the larger firms.

The firms say the recent surge in profits ratifies efforts to patch up internal trouble spots after the crisis and highlights their success in selling clients even more analysis and cutting certain costs.

Some litigation remains pending, including a $5 billion lawsuit by the U.S. government against S&P, but executives say the storm clouds over the industry largely have passed.

"By virtually every measure that we have, we see that investors are coming to us more. There is a thirst for more information," said Mark Oline, global head of business and relationship management at Fitch Ratings.

Stock investors have taken note. Over the past year, shares of the parent companies of the two big firms, Moody's Corp. and McGraw Hill Financial Inc., have outpaced the broader market by more than two times. Fitch Ratings is owned by Fimalac SA and Hearst Corp.

The three big firms, which held 95% of market share before the crisis, have roughly the same amount today. Moody's reports earnings on Friday, and McGraw Hill reports on Tuesday.

Credit-rating companies measure an issuer's ability to repay debt, assigning alphanumeric grades, like "Aa1" for safer entities or "C" for riskier ones. The firms are paid by the issuers, on the grounds that the ratings serve as a guide for investors, and their grades accompany nearly all bond deals.

The global surge in bond issuance, prompted by low interest rates set by central banks, has been the main driver of the firms' profits, analysts say. The U.S. corporate-bond market hit a record $1.48 trillion in borrowing last year, according to data provider Dealogic. The overall debt markets hit a combined $12.7 trillion in 2012 and 2013, the second highest two-year stretch ever, Dealogic said.

But the firms also have expanded further into other products besides basic ratings. Most notably, they are selling their proprietary analysis, the research and market data that shape ratings, for additional fees. These new analytics businesses are highly profitable because they mostly bundle research that has been compiled already.

Moody'sAnalytics has nearly doubled in size since the unit was formed by combining several separate business lines in 2007, bringing in $913 million in revenue last year. It now represents 31% of Moody's Corp.'s overall revenue.

Revenue at S&P's subscription-based analytics division was $1.1 billion in 2013, up 27% in the past four years. Revenue at Fitch Solutions, which entices customers with access to 35 years of historical ratings, has increased 69% during the same stretch.

S&P, meanwhile, also cut labor costs by sending data-heavy work to operations in India.

S&P employees each produce about $679,000 of revenue a year on average, the company said at an investor day this year. That outpaces every Wall Street investment bank except Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley, according to FactSet. The average information-technology firm produces about $467,000 per employee. The other ratings firms declined to provide information on revenue per employee.

The surge in profits, and the industry's comeback in general, raises the hackles of critics who feel the rating firms were never held to account for their role in the financial crisis.

Following the housing-market collapse, ratings firms saw revenue bottom out in 2008. Fitch dropped 21%, Moody's sunk 32% and S&P declined 49%. Critics zeroed on the conflicts inherent in the issuer-pays business model, noting that it provided incentives for firms to give rosy ratings to deals to win business.

The ratings firms say less reliance by investors on ratings is healthy and lead to lower risks, as they tend to perform more due diligence. They also point to internal adjustments they have made in recent years. "People underestimate the amount of change that the business has gone through," said Moody's Corp. Chief Executive Raymond McDaniel. He said Moody's has established more internal controls separating its research analysts from its sales team. Likewise, S&P says it has spent $400 million on compliance and risk-management tools since 2008.

Douglas Peterson, McGraw Hill's chief executive, who previously led S&P Ratings, also noted that the economic environment is different than it was in the years before the crisis.

Most of the growth in bond issuance is in corporate and noninvestment-grade debt, which is relatively well understood by investors as compared with mortgage-backed securities that were in vogue leading up to the crisis. "That's a very different story," Mr. Peterson said.

Former Citi Executive Sanjiv Das to Join First Data; Mr. Das Had Served as Chief Executive of CitiMortgage From 2008 to 2013

The former head of Citigroup Inc.'s mortgage unit has joined First Data Corp., the credit card processor owned by KKR & Co., according to an internal memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Sanjiv Das, who served as chief executive of CitiMortgage from 2008 to 2013, has taken the role as First Data's chief of staff and is joining the company's management committee, according to the internal memo sent Thursday.

Mr. Das is the latest Wall Street recruit to join First Data. He was hired by Frank Bisignano, the former co-chief operating officer of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., who joined First Data last April as chief executive. Mr. Bisignano has been charged with making the company profitable to prepare it for a possible initial public offering.

Mr. Bisignano has recruited so many former colleagues that First Data agreed in January to pay millions of dollars to J.P. Morgan in exchange for a promise that the bank wouldn't contest new hires, said people familiar with the agreement.

Former J.P. Morgan executives that have joined First Data include Cindy Armine, the bank's former chief compliance officer, and Heidi Miller, the former president of J.P. Morgan International. Ms. Armine, who left J.P. Morgan in February, serves as First Data's chief control officer.

Ms. Miller joined First Data's board of directors in April.

First Data has struggled with a heavy debt load since KKR took it private in 2007 for roughly $26 billion in one of the biggest leveraged buyouts of all time. The company, which processes thousands of credit and debit card transactions, has lost money every year since the deal was completed as consumers slashed spending during the financial crisis.

Mr. Bisignano has moved quickly to cut costs. He replaced 401 (k) contributions to employees and cash bonuses with stock grants. The moves took effect Jan. 1 and are expected to save the company $60 million in cash this year.

He has also been trying to grow the company beyond a processor to a provider of services like data analytics to merchants. First Data recently launched Clover Station, a point-of-sale system for small and medium-size businesses.

Mr. Das, a former Morgan Stanley and American Express executive, spent five years beginning in 2008 trying to clean up Citigroup's mortgage business. He was replaced in 2013 by Jane Fraser.

In the memo, Mr. Bisignano said that Mr. Das would look at opportunities for the company and become more familiar with its international businesses.

Hedge Funds Don't Bud This Spring

By Rob Copeland

A tough winter is turning into an ugly spring for top hedge funds, as a tendency to cluster into the same trades is stinging many star managers.

A number of multibillion-dollar funds are down sharply this month, pushing losses into double digits on a percentage basis for the year at some firms, according to investor communications reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Some of the common losing positions in recent weeks were in technology and biotechnology shares, including Google Inc. and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.

The downturn at many funds, including Viking Global Investors LP and JAT Capital Management LP, surpasses the decline in the broader market, where the S&P 500 index was down 1.2%, including dividends, for the year through the end of last week. That is the same period covered in the latest investor communications.

Entering the year, many fund managers were betting that last year's bull-market rally would continue, and they boosted their exposure to certain top-performing stocks.

"The big momentum trade has come off. It's a bit of a no-man's-land out there," said Jon Yalmokas, head of the Americas prime brokerage for Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch. He noted he hasn't seen evidence of hedge funds capitulating on their positions, or rotating into betting against more stocks.

For the first three months of the year, hedge funds across the industry gained on average 1.1%, the lowest since 2009, according to research firm HFR Inc. The slide accelerated for some firms this month, especially those focused on stocks. The median equity-focused hedge fund lost more than 2% in the first two weeks of April, according to Morgan Stanley.

Viking, a $28 billion Greenwich, Conn., firm led by amateur triathlete Andreas Halvorsen, lost 4.2% in March -- its second-worst month in a decade, according to investors -- and has dropped almost an additional 4% in the first two weeks of April. The bulk of the losses were in technology and health-care shares, investors said.

John Thaler's JAT saw a similar trajectory. The Greenwich firm dropped 9.3% in March and has slid more than 4% this month, leaving it down about 10% for the year, people familiar with the firm said. A spokesman for the $2.2 billion firm declined to comment.

The turmoil comes amid a spate of market volatility that theoretically should benefit funds that can place bets both on and against stocks. But analysts said many firms piled into the same names -- with both long and short bets -- and thus saw their fortunes fall together.

"Among hedge-fund managers, rampant duplication has become common. Everything is so saturated. As soon as anyone gets an idea, everyone else jumps on board," said Brian Shapiro, founder of hedge-fund analytics company Simplify LLC.

Some funds bucked the trend. The $1.7 billion Horseman Capital Management Ltd.'s Global fund rose almost 10% in the first quarter, fueled by contrary positions betting against stocks in sectors such as oil exploration and real estate, according to an investor update. The London-based firm wasn't immediately available for comment.

But recent losses were more common. Even so-called macro funds, which can invest globally and across various asset classes including stocks, bonds and currencies, have been hit hard.

Discovery Global Macro Fund Ltd., part of Robert Citrone's $15 billion South Norwalk, Conn., firm, has slid 6% this month and is down more than 14% on the year, according to an investor document. The fund has been felled by bearish bets on emerging markets and wagers that technology stocks would rise.

In a previous investor communication, Mr. Citrone described the start of the year as a "perfect storm" of negative events for the firm.

Many funds are standing their ground. Mr. Halvorsen of Viking told investors in a letter this month the firm had actually increased its exposure to rising stocks.

The principals of Contour Asset Management, a $1.7 billion hedge fund part-owned by Swedish alternatives firm Brummer & Partners, wrote to investors that the New York firm had reduced leverage by about 20% amid the "frustrating" decline in technology, media and telecommunications equities.

Founders David Meyer and Seth Wunder, who were sanguine that the pullback may have helped in "removing the froth and some of the excessive optimism," added they are not yet betting on a long-term sector-wide decline.

"Calling a price bubble is not an easy feat," they wrote.

Libyan wealth fund to appoint investment managers

The Libyan Investment Authority plans to outsource its investment management, expand in London and implement international standards of governance, as it seeks to move beyond allegations of past mismanagement, cronyism and failed investments.

"LIA will no longer manage investments as it did in the past - we will manage external managers", Abdulmagid Breish, the chairman of the Libyan Investment Authority, told the Financial Times in an interview today.

As part of its restructuring plans, the LIA wants to expand its operations in London, where is already owns a valuable commercial property portfolio. "[London] will be a centre of excellence where a lot of the analytics, a lot of the research and the management of external managers will be handled," Mr Breish said.

"We will have to prepare our risk profile and allocation," he added. "Once that is done, we will identify which best in class fund managers will be suitable".

Mr Breish, a former banker at Arab Banking Corporation, took over the reins of the ailing Libyan sovereign wealth fund last year and continued previous efforts to restructure what was previously one of the world's most opaque state investment vehicles.

After the fall of the Gaddafi regime nearly three years ago, the LIA began to take stock of its portfolio of holdings. According to a recent valuation by Deloitte cited by Mr Breish, the LIA is now worth $66bn. It still owns some 550 companies and direct investments in north Africa, the Middle East and Europe - some of which it intends to wind up.

Most of LIA's assets remain frozen. Nonetheless, Mr Breish says, the LIA is already being courted by international financial organisations looking to pitch their business.

"We've had many different financial institutions pitching for the past three months," he said. "We've been telling them we're not ready, we're building restructuring and enhancing our capabilities and when we're ready we can engage."

The LIA also plans to establish a "future generations fund", to be replenished through oil income, and a "budget stabilisation fund", from which the Libyan government could borrow if it has a budget deficit.

This overhaul of investment strategy and governance is being carried in tandem with a quest to recover some of the massive losses the LIA suffered on investments with some of the world's biggest banks, before the Libyan revolution.

After its inception in 2006, the LIA sought investment opportunities for Libya's oil wealth. By 2010, it had built a cash-heavy portfolio, which also featured equity stakes in companies such as Italy's UniCredit bank and Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, in which it still has a 2.98 per cent shareholding.

However, the fund also entered into a series of risky derivative transactions which led to billion-dollar losses, some of which the LIA is now looking to recover through the courts. In January this year, the LIA sued Goldman Sachs over derivative trades in excess of $1bn. In March it filed a $1.5bn claim against Socit Gnrale accusing the French bank of helping to funnel bribes worth tens of millions of dollars to close associates of Saif al-Islam, the son of former Libyan leader Muammer Gaddafi.

Both banks deny the claims made against them, and Goldman Sachs has applied for summary judgment on its case.

In addition, the LIA is considering taking action to recover $700m it invested in Netherlands-based Palladyne International Asset Management and to investigate several other smaller transactions.

Palladyne International Asset management, which is led by Ismael Abudher, the son-in-law of Libya's former oil minister, is accused in a separate lawsuit filed by a previous employee in the United Staes of serving as a "kickback and money laundering operation" for the former Libyan regime.

A spokesperson for Palladyne International Asset Management said:

"Palladyne has always conducted its business to the highest of standards. Its chief executive, Ismael Abudher, has never been part of any Libyan regime, and he and the company have only ever acted in the best interests of their clients."

Steering the LIA in post-Gaddafi years has not been plain sailing. "We were starting form zero" Mr Breish said. " The LIA was an institution that's been left to rot".

Mr Breish's predecessor, Mohsen Derregia, was ousted in February last year, and blamed interference from well-connected individuals and entrenched interests for his dismissal.

"I am not inhibited by pressure by any party," Mr Breish said. "This does not mean that there isn't pressure. You see this coming from certain quarters who are anxious about their future or are anxious about uncovering certain things that may pertain to them."

However, he remains positive for the future of the LIA. "I will put into LIA whatever is best practice and what international sovereign wealth funds do."

Fintech start-ups chip away at banks; News analysis

High street lenders strike back by launching their own digital products, writes Sally Davies

The tipping point for Jozef Wallis was when he discovered he was paying nearly 500 a month to transfer the salaries of his small team of software developers from London to Slovenia.

"Traditional banks in the UK aren't good at managing international accounts for companies of our size," says the entrepreneur, 34, whose start-up, Toothpick, helps users find and book dentist appointments online.

So for the past year, Mr Wallis has been using TransferWise - a three-year-old London-based app and website that allows people and small businesses to transfer money between international accounts more cheaply than they can with banks.

More than just a disgruntled customer, Mr Wallis typifies the growth of new technology start-ups in London that threaten to shake up financial services in the UK and beyond. As well as money transfer , innovation in the consumer-facing so-called fintech sector is happening in asset management, mobile payments and crowdfunding.

"There is no better place in the world to set up a fintech firm than in London," says Ismail Ahmed, the Somali co-founder of WorldRemit, a money transfer service that raised $40m from venture capitalists last month. "As the global centre of financial services and a tech hub , London gives fintech entrepreneurs access to an unparalleled pool of talent, from developers to product managers to compliance officers to sales."

Financial technology start-ups in the UK raised $700m from investors between 2008 and 2013, according to research from Accenture. While that is less than the funding raised by Silicon Valley fintech companies over the same period, the growth in funding for UK companies during that time was much faster. As with disruptive start-ups in industries ranging from air travel to retail, fintech entrepreneurs use their lower costs to undercut established companies.

"The incumbents make so much money and with such an easy life, why would they change?" says Nick Hungerford. The former wealth manager at Barclays is now chief executive of Nutmeg, a two-year-old start-up that allows consumers to set up online investment portfolios. Nutmeg has about 25,000 users with portfolios ranging from 1,000 to millions of pounds.

The company charges a 1 per cent fee, which drops to 0.3 per cent for portfolios valued at more than 500,000. Partly because it communicates with clients online rather than by phone or in person, the service is about four to five times cheaper than traditional asset managers - who also tend to deal with only wealthy people, Mr Hungerford says.

The sea change promised by fintech start-ups extends far beyond a race to the bottom on price. The proliferation of smartphones has made consumers demand more convenient and intuitive ways of purchasing financial services products, while the data they generate could reveal valuable insights about how to improve products.

In 2013, 12.4m people in the UK downloaded banking apps, and conducted 18.6m transactions a week on their mobile phones - more than double the rate for the previous year, according to the British Banking Association.

Anthony Browne, the BBA's chief executive, says: "The seismic decline in the use of banks' high street outlets is largely explained by a quiet, but dramatic, revolution in the way we spend, move and manage our money."

But for all its promise to improve the lives of consumers, fintech is still small. FundingCircle, a four-year-old online platform that allows people to lend directly to small businesses, has processed just 240m of loans, compared with the 38bn that UK banks lent to small businesses in the past year alone.

Several obstacles stand in the way of fintech growing big enough to seriously challenge the likes of high street banks such as HSBC, NatWest and Barclays.

Regulation is one hurdle. "The payments industry is highly regulated and has an intense focus on security at every step of the often-convoluted payments processing network," says Richard Moulds, head of product strategy at Thales e-Security, a company that sells software to protect data relating to digital payments. "It can be tricky to get new technologies approved."

Big banks are also striking back by launching their own digital and mobile services.

Barclays launched Pingit two years ago - a smartphone app that allows customers from any UK bank send money to one another using only a telephone number.

The bank says that the app is responsible for attracting between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of its new corporate customers.

Similar initiatives include Paym , a service run by the Payments Council, the industry body responsible for UK payment mechanisms. The service lets consumers send money by punching in a mobile telephone number. Another example is Zapp, a mobile payments service controlled by a consortium of high street banks that is due to be introduced this year.

Established companies are also co-opting promising start-ups. London now has four corporate-sponsored fintech accelerators - intensive courses for start-ups that usually involve exchanging the start-ups' equity for an injection of cash, as well as free office space and mentorship about how to grow.

The latest of these accelerators is Barclays', announced last month in Mile End in a building once known as "The Harrods of the east".

Barclays will give the companies accepted to its accelerator access to the software code for Pingit, so that the start-ups can build smartphone apps and programs to integrate with the payments service. "What started as a product is evolving into a platform," says Derek White, chief design officer at Barclays.

Meanwhile, MasterCard, Rabobank and Lloyds Banking Group have put their weight behind Startup Bootcamp, a global accelerator group that is launching a specialist fintech initiative near Tower Bridge in London. They will provide cash as well as mentorship, data and access to their systems' software code.

Traditional financial services groups argue that their scale, experience and brand - as well as the resources they can bring to bear - make them better placed than lone start-ups to offer consumers the choice they crave.

But some observers are sceptical that the incumbents, facing increased capital constraints and regulation, will be willing to cannibalise their own businesses.

"Innovators are nibbling away at all the different financial services," says Mr Hungerford. "One day soon the big banks will turn round and realise that half their sector has been taken out."

What London's key start ups are hoping to revolutionies

International money transfer

WorldRemit, Moni Technologies, Azimo, TransferWise

What the problems are: Wire services and banks often charge high fees to send and receive money, take a long time to process it, and are not always clear about the forex rates they are charging customers. Going into a branch is inconvenient, and the agents in corner shops do not always do reliable identity checks.

What fintech is doing: Using mobile technology and social networks to make money transfers cheaper, quicker, and more convenient and secure. Azimo integrates with Facebook, for example, to verify users' identity.

Payments

Pingit, Photopay, Zapp, Paym

What the problems are: Sending money via online banking to another person or paying bills requires finding out and typing in lots of numbers.

What fintech is doing: Finding ways to speed up payment by cutting out the numbers. Photopay - a start-up from Croatia that is part of Accenture's FinTech Innovation Lab in London - is an app that lets users take a photo of a bill and make a payment with one tap using their mobile banking app.

Personal finance and asset management

Nutmeg, Rplan, Blue Speck Financials

What the problems are: Private wealth managers have high minimum thresholds, opaque fees structures and confusing jargon.

What fintech is doing: Start-ups are helping different kinds of users manage their investments via data visualisation, analytics and mobile apps.

Nutmeg offers users a choice of investing around particular goals, such a child's university fees. Rplan lets you plug in your existing assets and then provides you with a risk profile as well as plan new investments.

Crowdfunding

FundingCircle, Seedrs, Zopa

What the problems are: Small companies are starved for credit from banks and traditional lenders, and regular people who want to make money by lending to individuals and small businesses have not had a way to do so.

What fintech is doing: Start-ups offer a software platform - essentially a market for loans and equity - for people to make money by financing small businesses and individuals.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Bolton: 'I was wrong about the market in China'; Fund focus

Gearing was main problem for China Special Situations trust, writes Bradley Gerrard

Star manager Anthony Bolton has admitted he was wrong about the Chinese stock market , as he hung up his fund management hat after 35 years.

Mr Bolton, who is best known for his stellar performance while managing Fidelity's flagship Special Situations fund for 28 years, will now become a member of the board but will no longer run any money.

He came out of retirement in 2010 following a trip to China, and the launch of his Fidelity China Special Situations investment trust was a feeding frenzy for his hoards of faithful investors.

After an initial surge the Chinese market slumped and Mr Bolton's focus on smaller companies and his use of gearing - borrowing money to boost the trust's pool of investments - magnified his investors' losses.

In early 2012 Mr Bolton extended previous plans for a three-year tenure to try to turn the trust's portfolio around. It has now beaten the wider Chinese stock market, but it is still trading only slightly above its launch value.

"The most disappointing thing for me - and I am happy to admit it - is that I was wrong about the market in China," the manager said during a press briefing on his last day in the office on March 31.

He points to the trust's borrowing as a main detractor of performance.

"I had a geared fund when everything was going down. I made a big play to 'new China' and in the past 18 months that has really come into its own. But I would have liked to have seen a better share price at the end of my tenure," he says.

In share price total return terms the trust gained 5.2 per cent from launch to the end of March, versus a 4 per cent loss on the MSCI China index, according to FE Analytics, the data provider. A year ago it lagged behind the index with an overall loss of 4 per cent. Management of the trust has now passed to Dale Nicholls.

One of the trust's heavy exposures is in technology, a sector in which Mr Bolton made key calls during his tenure on the Special Situations fund.

His decision to back Nokia, the mobile phone maker, in 1993 and to buy shares in security company Securicor in the belief that its stake in Cellnet, the mobile subsidiary it co-owned with BT, would push its value up proved to be major moves.

While the tech stocks in his China trust may not all have paid off in the same way, his predictions about technology have been proved right overall.

Mr Bolton is pessimistic about economic growth prospects in China, predicting 6 per cent a year as a likely figure - lower than the consensus 7.5 per cent.

He welcomes the current Chinese government, headed by premier Li Keqiang, saying it has made significant attempts to enact positive economic change and eradicate corruption.

Mr Bolton says Chinese stock market valuations are "very low against history" and as far as two standard deviations below their long-term level.

U.S. Banks Facing New Capital Curb

By Ryan Tracy and Stephanie Armour

WASHINGTON -- U.S. regulators are set to impose another curb on risk taking at the largest U.S. banks Tuesday as part of a continuing push to force big banks to gird themselves against periods of market stress.

Under the new "leverage ratio," scheduled for a vote by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Federal Reserve, the eight biggest U.S. firms would have to double the amount of capital they hold as protection against every loan, investment, building, security and other asset on their books -- not just the risky ones.

The rule could force big banks to add tens of billions of dollars in new capital, though many have been bulking up since regulators first floated a leverage ratio in July. It would require the biggest companies to maintain loss-absorbing capital worth at least 5% of their assets, and their FDIC-insured bank subsidiaries would have to keep a minimum leverage ratio of 6%. That compares with the 3% set by international accord.

For the largest banks, satisfying the new requirement will likely be manageable in the near term, but analysts warned it could constrain future growth since it would limit each bank's ability to increase its asset base, forcing it to either raise more cash from investors or shed assets elsewhere if it begins to bump up against the ratio's limits.

"In an environment where you are getting strong economic growth, it could be a limiting factor with how much you can grow," said Brian Kleinhanzl, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods.

KBW, in a report issued after regulators proposed the new limits in July, estimated the eight banks faced a net collective shortfall of about $50.2 billion to meet the 6% threshold, with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. facing the widest gaps as a percentage of their existing capital. Many banks have been building up capital since that July analysis, Mr. Kleinhanzl said.

Tuesday's regulatory move is just one of several pending rules targeted at banking behemoths like Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo & Co. Regulators also are expected to impose an additional risk-based capital charge for banks considered central to financial stability and perhaps another capital penalty for banks that are involved in potentially volatile markets for short-term borrowing and lending.

In addition to the capital rules, regulators also are implementing the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial law, which included a number of curbs on banks, such as the Volcker rule's ban on speculative investing.

"We're just accepting a public policy of really stringently regulating banks, especially the biggest ones, and then letting the chips fall where they may," said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of the advisory firm Federal Financial Analytics Inc.

When it was proposed last year, the leverage ratio sent a shock wave through the banking industry, which hadn't expected U.S. regulators to take such an aggressive tack.

Now, after months of continued debate about whether large banks remain "too big to fail" come the next financial crisis, the same rules are "remarkably, and in seemingly short order, becoming noncontroversial," Ms. Petrou said.

Banks have balked at the increased minimum ratio since it was proposed last year, saying it will curtail lending and saddle them with more costs that leave them at a competitive disadvantage. But of late, much of their attention in Washington has been focused on fighting even more radical proposals from Capitol Hill, such as a hefty new tax on their assets or a 15% minimum capital requirement.

Still, the exact impact remains to be seen. J.P. Morgan and Bank of New York, for instance, have brokerage businesses that involve holding large books of assets that could count against them in a leverage ratio, depending on the specifics of how it is calculated.

Bank of New York had no comment Monday but has previously said the regulators' proposal is "unwise" and would "totally change the fundamental balance" of the current U.S. capital rules. A J.P. Morgan spokesman didn't respond to a request for comment.

While regulators will finalize the overarching 5% and 6% requirements, they also will propose tweaks in the way certain types of assets are tallied for calculating the denominator of the ratio, according to people familiar with the matter. Those tweaks will hew closely to revisions agreed to by international regulators on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in January, these people said.

In general, the new parameters for counting derivatives and other assets are expected to make the leverage ratio tougher on banks than the original U.S. proposal, though they are less stringent than an earlier version published by the Basel Committee.

Wealth Management Journal
The Bull Market Isn't Making All Clients Happy; 'We're seeing higher rates of attrition across all sizes.'

Financial advisers who think they can coast as a bull market fattens clients' portfolios may risk losing those clients.

New data suggests that may be playing out.

"We're seeing higher rates of attrition across all sizes of clients," says Patrick Kennedy, co-founder and vice president of client management and analytics at PriceMetrix, a consultant and data provider to advisers. "Usually, you see smaller clients sort of come and go at a faster rate than larger clients, but...we're seeing higher rates of attrition for even the most affluent clients."

The Toronto firm, which examined its database of 7 million retail investors and more than $3.5 trillion in assets, found that assets managed by advisers grew on average last year, but having more money to handle didn't help some advisers retain clients or attract more wealthy investors.

However, a top tier of advisers was able to hold onto desired clients and attract more high-net-worth investors, the firm said.

PriceMetrix's database reflects assets managed by major broker-dealers as well as regional and independent advisory firms.

Assets managed by advisers rose 11% in 2013 and revenue increased 6%, the firm found. But households that closed accounts detracted 5% from the asset growth and the overall client retention rate decreased to 90% in 2013 from 92% in 2012.

Certainly, many advisers have been working to move small accounts--those with less than $100,000 in assets--off their books, so some of the attrition was deliberate. Yet the largest decrease in annual retention rates occurred among households with $1 million or more in investable assets, to 93% in 2013 from 96% in 2012, PriceMetrix said.

But investors aren't leaving the full-service advisory model, Mr. Kennedy says. Instead, the data indicate that clients are playing a game of musical chairs by changing advisers "at a higher rate than they have historically," he says.

The firm, whose data goes back only one full business cycle, last saw attrition rates like those advisers experienced in 2013 during the market crisis of 2008.

"It suggests that when markets are sort of significantly or anomalously down or up, it may be driving higher rates of attrition," Mr. Kennedy says.

With strong markets, investors may compare their returns to others who may be doing better, which could prompt them to consider changing advisers, he says: "You shouldn't, as an adviser, assume that because markets are great, clients are happy and are going to stay."

Advisers overall also failed to attract clients with $2 million or more in investable assets, PriceMetrix found.

While there were more of these high-net-worth clients on advisers' books overall in 2013, there were 10% fewer new accounts for households with $2 million or more, the firm said. The number of high-net-worth households tracks the rate of market appreciation, which suggests the market's rise is responsible for the larger number of those households rather than advisers' efforts to win them, Mr. Kennedy says.

Advisers and industry experts see several factors at play that may explain why firms have trouble keeping clients and attracting wealthier investors.

Kenton Shirk, associate director at Cerulli Associates, says advisers often struggle to tell their stories and position their practices in ways that are specific and compelling enough to attract new investors. And those who target the high-net-worth market must address their hot-button issues, such as how they can sustain their wealth, he says.

Some advisers may be losing clients because they fail to properly service clients and to set their expectations, says Kim Brown, president of JNBA Financial Advisors in Minneapolis, which has maintained a 96% retention rate since the firm began tracking it in 2001.

"If you only build your advisory practice around good returns, it's not going to be conducive to retaining clients," she says.

In addition, too many advisers see their clients only as numbers, says Mrs. Brown, whose firm manages $580 million.

She recalled, for instance, the time she received a call from a prospective client with $900,000 in investable assets who was being kicked out of his firm because it had raised its minimum to $1 million.

"I find that absolutely astonishing," she says. "There's this philosophy that the size of the account is what matters most. But the mindset of the client, their needs, and the solutions you can provide for them--that's what's going to win all day long."

Clients are looking for depth in a firm and want to know that it has experience in various markets, Mrs. Brown says. While many firms today say they can assign an entire team to a client, many simply lack the manpower and resources to back that up--and that's something clients will realize, she notes.

David Tager, founder of Tager & Co., a New York strategy and communications firm, adds that with many advisers now in their 50s, some younger clients are reevaluating their advisers who were first chosen by their parents.

"What some large firms have done is to try to create the sense of mini family office, but if the firm doesn't have the genuine capabilities to offer a team, it will be exposed, he says.

Special
High Hopes for 'Low Volatility' Funds; These Conservative Stock Funds Are Popular, but Some Pros Say They Are Now Too Pricey

Does slow and steady really win the race?

Investors in recent years have placed heavy bets on "low volatility" funds, vehicles that invest in stodgy, slow-moving stocks such as utilities and consumer staples the kind of stocks that weather periods of volatility well. Over the past three years, investors have put more than $10 billion in low-volatility mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, many of which were launched after 2010, according to fund tracker Lipper, a unit of Thomson Reuters Corp.

But now some experts say the enthusiasm for low-volatility stocks has made them overvalued.

"Low-volatility stocks in general do look quite pricey compared to the market and compared to where they've traded historically," says David Allison, vice president of Allison Investment Management LLC, a wealth-management firm in Columbia, S.C. "The financial crisis left investors shellshocked, and the safer stocks have been very popular." Many low-volatility stocks pay high dividends, Mr. Allison notes, adding to their popularity in this low-interest-rate environment.

"If you're buying the lowest-volatility segment of the market," Mr. Allison says, "you're buying some fairly expensive stocks there."

Multiple academic studies since the 1970s have shown that low-volatility stocks outperform the highfliers over long periods, though normally one might expect higher risk to give higher returns. This surprising result has become known as the low-volatility anomaly.

Researchers have traditionally explained the anomaly in behavioral terms: Investors are drawn to fast-moving stocks which have potential for spectacular gains, which then become overpriced and struggle to sustain their high valuations. The slow and steady stocks tend to be overlooked, making them bargains that are more likely to rise in value.

Now, however, the anomaly may have run its course.

"There's a sense that, at least for a while, the voguish popularity of 'low volatility' as a strategy has annihilated the low-volatility anomaly," says Matthew Hougan, president of analytics and publications at ETF.com. The newfound popularity of these stocks, in other words, has driven up their values, so there is less reason to assume they will keep on outperforming.

A group of researchers studied stock data back to 1925 and found that low-volatility stocks are popular in recessions but tend to underperform as markets recover and so become undervalued. In the financial crisis of 2008, valuations followed the predictable pattern. But they have stayed high even as the economy has picked up and stocks have rallied.

"We found that low-risk stocks are still trading at a premium," says Rodney Sullivan, editor of the Financial Analysts Journal at CFA Institute and a co-author of the study. "That's the opposite of where they've been for most of the past 35 years." Mr. Sullivan says that low-volatility investing does have worth, but that investors should also consider current valuations. "As Warren Buffett and Ben Graham taught us, you also have to pay attention to the price you pay. Price matters."

Others believe low-volatility stocks are still compelling.

Malcolm Baker, a professor at Harvard Business School and director of research at Acadian Asset Management LLC in Boston, says that while the volume of low-volatility investing has grown, it hasn't reached the point where it affects the performance or valuations of these stocks.

Andrew Schlossberg, head of U.S. retail distribution and global ETFs at Invesco Ltd., says: "The important thing on low-volatility investing is to look at it over a full market cycle. The research has shown that low-volatility investing can reduce risk in your portfolio and allow you to get adequate return, which is what everyone is trying to do."

For fund investors considering the strategy, there were recently 37 low-volatility mutual funds and 14 ETFs. The mutual funds had assets of $6.7 billion and the ETFs, $9.7 billion, according to Morningstar Inc.

There is an important distinction to note as well. The two largest ETFs, iShares MSCI USA Minimum Volatility and PowerShares S&P 500 Low Volatility, track separate indexes with distinct methodologies that can make a big difference in performance, says Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF research at S&P Capital IQ.

"The PowerShares fund should capture the low-volatility effect better," he says, "but the flip side to that is that you're taking on more sector risk." That's because the PowerShares fund tracks an index composed of the least volatile stocks in the S&P 500, and becomes heavily weighted toward sectors like utilities (recently around 25% of the index, compared with about 3% for the S&P 500). The iShares fund, on the other hand, tracks an index that places limits on the weightings of each sector. The same divide exists in low-volatility international-stock ETFs from the two companies, Mr. Rosenbluth says.

Meanwhile, for actively managed funds, he says, avoiding overvalued stocks will be key. "With some low-volatility stocks being overvalued, that's where active management should in theory come in," he says. "The managers should be able to rotate into stocks that are lower-volatility but not as richly valued. The proof will be in the performance, and I think it's too soon to say whether the active approach is better or worse than the passive approach."

Two actively managed mutual funds, Invesco Low Volatility Equity Yield and the recently launched Vanguard Global Minimum Volatility, aim to put together a mix of holdings that will be less volatile overall than their benchmarks. The Invesco fund has a 1.18% expense ratio, whereas the new Vanguard fund has a 0.3% expense ratio, which is more in line with the ETFs.

Other professionals point out that buying funds dedicated to low-volatility stocks isn't the only option for reducing volatility in a portfolio.

"If someone's currently 100% in equities, and they're looking to reduce volatility, an alternative would just be to add more short-term bonds or cash to that portfolio," says Philip Straehl, senior research consultant at Morningstar Inc.'s Morningstar Investment Management in Chicago. "If you look at the returns of a balanced portfolio over the past four or five decades, it's fairly attractive from a risk/return perspective."

A final piece of advice comes from Mr. Hougan at ETF.com. Even if the low-volatility anomaly persists, he says, there will be periods when the market is rising strongly and these funds significantly underperform.

"The strategy is capitalizing on behavioral biases, and you have to overcome your own behavioral biases to get the payoff," Mr. Hougan says. "If you're the kind of person who will sell as soon as these underperform, then you're doomed to buy and sell at exactly the wrong time, over and over again. It takes the right kind of investor to make them a success."

In Depth: Rapid-Fire Traders Fight Over Secret Computer Code --- SXP's Founders Stand Accused of Stealing Algorithms Owned By Houston Company Quantlab Financial

Houston -- The meeting that started the trouble took place at a monastery in Florence, Ariz.

Under a gazebo's shade, a Ukrainian physicist who aspires to be a monk met with a Milwaukee lawyer seven years ago and began planning a firm whose profits from rapid-fire stock trades would go mostly to charity. They and another founder eventually named it SXP Analytics LLC after St. Xenia, an 18th-century Russian who gave the poor her possessions.

Today, SXP's founders stand accused of stealing someone else's prized possessions: the algorithms of a powerful Houston high-frequency-trading company.

Eleven months after the gazebo meeting, more than 70 Federal Bureau of Investigation agents raided SXP offices and employees' homes in seven states, seizing computers, servers and flash drives. The search target was computer code belonging to the Houston firm, Quantlab Financial LLC.

SXP's journey from St. Anthony's Greek Orthodox Monastery to a Texas federal courthouse provides a look into an unusual corner of the secretive high-frequency-trading industry and the brilliant, often eccentric, people who populate it. This account is based on thousands of pages of court filings, FBI files and interviews with people familiar with both sides of the dispute.

High-frequency traders use powerful computers to zip in and out of markets, earning tiny profits on hundreds of thousands of transactions a day. Such trading is about half of U.S. stock-market volume, estimates TABB Group, a financial consultancy.

Among these companies' most-guarded assets are algorithms for computerized trading, and they often hire Ph.D. researchers to create code that can give even the slimmest edge over rivals.

Such code is at the heart of the SXP story. Quantlab alleges that two Ukrainian Ph.D. researchers it fired in 2007 took algorithms and other code to use at SXP. A federal criminal prosecutor declined to pursue a case. But Quantlab is pressing a federal civil suit against SXP's founders, calling the code "the lifeblood of Quantlab."

The founders in court documents said they didn't steal or use Quantlab intellectual property. Quantlab's general counsel, Tim McInturf, says the defendants "engaged in a massive, surreptitious and systematic theft of the company's intellectual property."

Quantlab's suit, which lawyers expect to go to trial by 2015, is among other such disputes. Goldman Sachs Group in 2009 accused a trader of copying high-frequency code before leaving for another company. The trader, who was convicted in federal court, got the verdict overturned on appeal but faces related state charges, which he denies.

Such disputes come at a time when regulators are scrutinizing high-frequency trading as part of a wider review of markets' fairness and stability. The Federal Bureau of Investigation is probing whether such traders are engaging in insider trading by exploiting information unavailable to other investors.

Quantlab, a leading industry proponent, led the creation of a trade group in January that aims to highlight how such trading brings efficiency and liquidity to markets.

The complexity of high-frequency trading and its billions in potential profits are among the factors that can draw unusual casts of characters like those in the Quantlab-SXP dispute.

Quantlab today is a major player in high-frequency trading, accounting for 1.9% to 3% of daily U.S. stock-market volume, estimates ModernNetworks IR, a research concern. Yet it keeps a low profile: Its headquarters are one floor in a red-brick building in Houston's low-rise Montrose neighborhood, known more for mansions and museums than high finance. Its name is in small text on a board by the elevators, sandwiched between a life coach and a law firm.

Quantlab was a hedge fund when founded in 1998 by Wilbur "Ed" Bosarge Jr., now 75 years old, an oil-company executive and Rice University mathematics professor who often sports a beret, and Bruce Eames, 59, a businessman from Wisconsin.

Seeking a new strategy, Quantlab in 2001 hired Andriy Kuharsky, a mathematician, now 44. A Ukrainian who also holds a Canadian passport, he earned his Ph.D. at the University of Utah studying blood coagulation; he hadn't worked in finance before.

Two months later, Quantlab hired Vitaliy Godlevsky, the Ukrainian physicist who would eventually plan his own company under the monastery gazebo. Now 44, he was previously at the University of Minnesota, Yale University and Rutgers University. His Ph.D. dissertation was titled, "First principles simulations of liquid semiconductors: Electronic, structural and dynamic properties." Like Mr. Kuharsky, a childhood friend, he was a finance newcomer.

High-frequency concerns often don't require finance backgrounds of researchers, hiring them for their ability to make complicated mathematical calculations using large data pools.

Joining Quantlab near the high-speed-trading boom's beginning, the two men were part of a team writing algorithms that based short-term-price predictions on analyses of vast quantities of data, including details of all bids and offers on stocks at any given millisecond. Using "signals" in the data largely hidden from slower-moving value investors, their code grabbed tiny profits on many of sometimes millions of trades a day.

While most high-frequency algorithms use similar strategies, companies guard code details closely. Judges and lawyers in Quantlab cases have called its code the "philosopher's stone" and its "secret sauce."

The research team tinkered with the algorithms, tailoring code in new ways to help Quantlab expand into new asset classes and markets such as Europe and Asia.

Quantlab presented a sometimes-colorful milieu. Its founders once turned to a consultant on issues from office layout to personnel decisions, according to Quantlab emails from the FBI investigation. Her recommendations often related to "energy" surrounding people and spaces, and Quantlab appeared to follow them in some cases, the emails suggest.

The consultant "was not a psychic or spiritual adviser to Quantlab" as the defendants alleged, says Quantlab's Mr. McInturf. She "was initially hired as a consultant on organizational development issues," he says, adding that Quantlab ended its affiliation with her more than seven years ago.

"It would not be appropriate for the FBI to comment due to the pending civil litigation," an FBI spokeswoman said of the agency's investigation.

Mr. Godlevsky, who emigrated from Ukraine in 1993, is a devotee of the Orthodox Church who has long wanted to become a monk. Sporting a long beard, he often spent time with other Ukrainians at Quantlab, celebrating holidays together.

The algorithms he and Mr. Kuharsky helped write led to huge profits, the two said in court documents. Starting with trading capital of about $1.5 million, Quantlab brought in revenue in the hundreds of millions between 2001 and 2007, they said. Quantlab declines to disclose financial details.

Court documents and public records suggest Quantlab's founders became wealthy. In 2008, Mr. Bosarge's family office bought a 72-acre Bahamian island and commissioned construction of a 55-meter yacht. Babydoll Museum Inc., a nonprofit controlled by his wife, Marie, has spent millions on Marilyn Monroe paraphernalia, according to its filings. Mr. Eames is an art patron in Houston.

Quantlab declines to comment on its founders' wealth.

Messrs. Godlevsky and Kuharsky came to feel they weren't getting their share of profits. Their salaries were in the high-five figures and their bonuses in the hundreds of thousands of dollars some years, according to court documents, and they felt underpaid. Around 2006, they began asking their bosses about the compensation plan and challenging some other operational matters.

Quantlab fired both in March 2007 for insubordination and disrupting others' work, says Quantlab's Mr. McInturf. The two denied insubordination and disruption, saying in court documents that they didn't know for sure why they were fired.

The next month, Mr. Godlevsky made a semiannual visit to St. Anthony's. A priest introduced him to Emmanuel Mamalakis, 38, a former Milwaukee securities litigator and frequent visitor to the monastery's meditative grounds. A Greek American, he had earned millions from a class-action suit and sought a new project.

Under the gazebo, Mr. Godlevsky talked of starting a high-frequency concern and giving away much of its profits. Mr. Mamalakis says he liked the idea and suggested he could run the business while Mr. Godlevsky oversaw trading strategies and programmers.

At about that time, Quantlab began to suspect the two men it fired of planning to start a company and use Quantlab algorithms. In June 2007, it sued them in Harris County, Texas, civil court seeking to prevent their using the code.

Messrs. Godlevsky, Kuharsky and Mamalakis in court documents said they didn't steal or use Quantlab's intellectual property.

The two fired men sent Quantlab a letter asking for $25 million each, arguing they were entitled to that much of the company's equity, court documents show. Quantlab called the request extortion.

In July 2007, Messrs. Godlevsky, Mamalakis and Kuharsky founded SXP with main offices in Houston. They hired computer scientists and mathematicians, planning to base algorithms on new indicators and to trade in markets such as Brazil to find an edge.

A falling-out at SXP added to Quantlab's concerns. Mr. Kuharsky, disgruntled with some of SXP's religious tones, quit in January 2008 and emailed Quantlab's Mr. Eames under a pseudonym to say SXP was using Quantlab's code, according to court documents. Mr. Kuharsky later recanted his assertions, saying they were an attempt to get Quantlab to end its dispute with him.

Quantlab complained in February 2008 to the FBI, which in March raided SXP offices and employees' homes. When agents interviewed Mr. Kuharsky in SXP's Houston parking lot, he said Quantlab code was on his computer from when he worked at home but denied stealing it or using it for trading. "Kuharsky repeatedly stated that he could not understand why Quantlab made a complaint to the FBI as Quantlab had not suffered any damages," the FBI report reads.

FBI agents tapped Mr. Kuharsky's and Mr. Godlevsky's phones and Quantlab hired private investigators to sort through their trash, according to FBI files. "The case started ruining our lives," Mr. Kuharsky says. "Everywhere we went, we were paranoid and wondering if we were being followed."

Quantlab's Mr. McInturf declines to discuss the private investigators but says that, given its allegations, "one would expect Quantlab's legal counsel to take appropriate action to protect key company assets."

The Harris County court dismissed Quantlab's suits without prejudice after the FBI probe began. In 2009, Quantlab sued Messrs. Godlevsky, Kuharsky and Mamalakis in the U.S. district court of the Southern District of Texas, alleging copyright infringement, trade-secret misappropriation and other civil claims.

Mr. Godlevsky and Mr. Mamalakis continued to build their company while their researchers designed algorithms. SXP started with trading capital of $1 million and had $44 million in revenue over 3 1/2 years, according to court documents.

In August 2011, the office of the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Texas said it wouldn't prosecute, giving no information about why it wouldn't bring a criminal case. Its summary of FBI findings said that Quantlab code was on Mr. Kuharsky's and Mr. Godlevsky's computers, and that there was evidence Mr. Kuharsky downloaded code from Quantlab servers after his firing.

Mr. Kuharsky told the FBI that a Quantlab employee seeking help with a coding problem had logged on using Mr. Kuharsky's home computer. He and Mr. Godlevsky in court documents said there was Quantlab code on their computers that came from work done at home while still employed.

SXP closed in 2012 after Mr. Godlevsky alleged that Mr. Mamalakis misdirected funds. In January, the receiver that controls SXP alleged in a civil suit in the Milwaukee County Circuit Court in Wisconsin that Mr. Mamalakis fraudulently diverted funds, including to charities he was associated with.

Mr. Mamalakis denies the fraud allegations. He says SXP donated several million dollars to "churches, battered women's shelters and drug rehab clinics," among other nonprofits.

Quantlab's federal suit seeks to bar the men from using Quantlab code and requests unspecified damages. Mr. Godlevsky and Mr. Kuharsky alleged in court documents that Quantlab is trying to drive them out of high-frequency trading. Quantlab in court filings denied the allegation.

Mr. Godlevsky lives outside Milwaukee, trying to make ends meet by writing code while raising chickens and bees and tending an orchard, he said in an October hearing. "I contributed to make Quantlab billionaires from nothing," he said, "and personally I am bankrupt."

He and Mr. Kuharsky in 2012 started another company, which Mr. Kuharsky says is about to close down.

Mr. Kuharsky says he can't find work because employers worry Quantlab will subpoena them. "I spend my days working on code, but I don't know if it'll ever be used."

London house price gap widens

Cost of a home now twice UK average

Data fuel concerns for market bubble

The surging property market in London has produced the widest price gap on record between the capital and the rest of the UK, according to Nationwide's latest figures.

First-quarter figures show that average London house prices had shot up 18 per cent in a year, compared with the same period in 2013, with the cost of a typ-ical home in the capital at 362,699 - more than twice the level of the rest of the UK when London was excluded. It is the largest gap in the 40-year history of the Nationwide house price index. At the previous 2007 peak, homes in the capital were worth roughly 40 per cent more.

The data have fuelled concerns about a property bubble in London in which investors, both international and domestic, have been piling into the market in search of yield they cannot find in other asset classes. Moreover, the ripple effect of London's booming market is driving rapid house price growth in a ring around the capital.

With annual growth rates of more than 13 per cent, the affluent commuting cities of Oxford, Cambridge and Brighton take three of the top four slots for price increases outside London, according to the Nationwide house price index .

Outside the southeast, the picture is different. Although rising consumer confidence and improved lending conditions saw prices rise in all regions in the first quarter, for most areas those changes come on the back of years of stagnation and decline. Residential property consultancy Hometrack's analysis of 3,000 postcode districts shows 78 per cent of markets in the UK as a whole remain below peak levels, with 41 per cent still 10 per cent or more below peak.

Richard Donnell, director of research at Hometrack, said the housing market recovery was fundamentally about demographics - and low interest rates.

"It is a credit story: it is all about the people in the local market and their access to finance," he said.

"A lot of this recovery is concentrated in the higher demographic areas, the higher managerial professions. Growth just doesn't seem to be happening in the mid-market. In the big regional cities prices are starting to pick up but it is from a low base."

Manchester, the only city outside the southeast to make Nationwide's list of the fastest growing areas, is a good example. While growth year-on-year was an exuberant 18 per cent, the typical house was still worth 4 per cent below 2007 levels, at 211,748.

But Manchester is outperforming its wider region: in the northwest as a whole, houses are still more than 12 per cent below peak. Melanie Bowler, an economist at Moody'sAnalytics, said the pick-up outside London was still "very tentative".

For homeowners in properties where values have fallen sharply and are often in negative equity, "the demand to move house is still very weak", she said.

In London, price growth is no longer driven by prime central areas. Hackney, the country's second- most deprived borough overall, has seen a 23 per cent rise in the past year, compared with more genteel Richmond's 10 per cent. "We are wondering whether this level of price growth in London is sustainable," said Susan Emmett, residential research director at Savills.

Facebook, Google Share Vision

Despite Facebook's new virtual-reality goggles, its investors may be more puzzled than ever about the company's vision for its own future. One clue comes from a rival that makes some nifty glasses of its own: Google.

Facebook has been on a shopping spree lately, spending $19 billion on messaging service WhatsApp and snapping up goggle maker Oculus VR for $2 billion. The two deals call to mind Facebook's surprise $1 billion purchase of photo-sharing platform Instagram two years ago. Chief Mark Zuckerberg has said the recent acquisitions fall under his goals of "connecting everyone" and "building the knowledge economy." In plainer language, the purchases are big bets on the future of social networking.

This high-stakes strategy of throwing stuff against a wall to see what sticks is redolent of Google. The technology industry, by its nature, must acknowledge that today's incumbent platforms won't necessarily be tomorrow's. Facebook and Google are using their highly profitable advertising businesses -- and, in Facebook's case, a very high stock valuation -- to invest in what might become the next big thing, even if that this is only tangentially related to their core businesses.

For every Oculus, WhatsApp and Instagram, Google has a Nest Labs, a Waze and a YouTube, for which it paid $3.2 billion, just over $1 billion and $1.65 billion, respectively. Both companies have invested in artificial intelligence and have projects devoted to expanding Internet services to underserved populations.

Both also are helmed by founder-CEOs with controlling stakes, giving them relatively free rein to do big deals without approval. By buying in, shareholders essentially sign up for the ride; an implicit expression of faith that these companies' visionary leaders can keep coming up with brilliant ideas.

Granted, there are some differences. Facebook has stuck to purchases that could all be considered loosely related to its core business. All are new platforms for social interaction. Instagram is another way to share photos with friends; WhatsApp is another way to send messages to them; and if virtual reality takes off, Oculus's product could offer another portal for interaction.

Google has embarked on many more so-called moonshots: projects mostly unrelated to search advertising. Among these are its acquisition of biotech company Calico, which focuses on combating aging; multiple robotics deals; and its investment in Google Glass and Fiber. Google X, the company's secretive laboratory, has researchers working on projects such as self-driving cars, balloon-powered Internet and airborne wind turbines.

But for both companies, most of these options on the future are still just that. Google got nearly 91% of its core business revenue from advertising in 2013, and that likely generated the vast majority of its profit, too.

Facebook's recent acquisitions come with virtually no revenue, let alone profits, so investors must return to what they know and can more easily predict: the prospects for the core business. And those look strong. Analysts forecast earnings per share to nearly double over the next two years, compared with a 41% increase at Google.

So Facebook's stock likely deserves some premium. Even so, 46 times the next 12 months' earnings looks rich compared with Google's 20.4 times. Both companies have built highly profitable, world-changing businesses and represent options on the future. It is difficult to see the edge that justifies Facebook's 120% premium -- which is bigger still if you adjust for Google's cash pile of $58.7 billion, roughly five times Facebook's.

The implication is that Google's investors are paying a reasonable multiple for its core business. By extension, they are paying relatively less for those options on the future than Facebook's shareholders are paying for their company's vision thing.

There is an added wrinkle: Google's cash position gives it plenty of firepower for more deals. Facebook has favored stock deals. And why wouldn't it, given the multiple awarded by the stock market? Investors with a nervous eye on Mr. Zuckerberg's predilection for bold moves should remember that they enable him by supplying the currency.

Air France

Can Take

Cue From

Lufthansa

Deutsche Lufthansa is showing its pilots union a lot of muscle. That is the kind of tough stuff Air France-KLM could use.

The German carrier is standing firm over proposed changes to retirement provisions for its heavily unionized pilots. The cost: a three-day strike that will ground 3,800 flights, affect almost half a million passengers through Friday and clip tens of millions of euros off profits.

But sticking to its guns could have merit: Lufthansa's ground and cabin crew agreed to terms after striking.

Lufthansa and Air France-KLM are both partway through restructuring plans aimed at making them more competitive against low-cost rivals. But labor looms larger as a problem for Air France-KLM: Staff accounted for 30% of its cost base in 2012 compared with 20% at Lufthansa, estimates Barclays. Assuming Air France gets the full benefits of its turnaround plan, employee productivity will still be between 10% and 15% below rival full-service airlines, estimates Barclays.

Air France-KLM really needs a wider restructuring of its European short-haul business. It could benefit from moving all short-haul traffic that doesn't feed its hubs to its low-cost carrier Transavia -- like Lufthansa is doing with Germanwings. But that looks unlikely to pass muster with the unions.

Instead, Transavia, which has just 11 jets in France, is left chasing leisure travelers on routes Air France typically doesn't fly, which means it competes more directly with low-cost operators. And cuts to capacity at the full-service airline out of Paris Orly and regional bases such as Toulouse, Marseille and Nice only go so far. Despite the changes, Air France-KLM could still log a 300 million euro ($414 million) loss in the short-haul business in 2015. Lufthansa's broke even last year.

Air France-KLM shares -- up 50% this year -- could keep defying gravity. Ongoing cuts to the airline's 5.3 billion euros in net debt should help, as would an expected return to profit this year after three years of losses.

Yet Air France-KLM and Lufthansa are both valued at about 3.6 times forecast 2014 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, according to FactSet. Lufthansa should have the greater thrust from here.

Bank Lending

Begins to Bloom

While much of the country spent the first three months of 2014 sheltering against snow and ice, banks began to fire up the lending furnaces.

That is welcome news for bank investors. Loan growth has been the missing ingredient for banks for some time. Without it, they have been left to try to bolster earnings through repeated rounds of cost cutting and reversals of loan-loss reserves, even as the Federal Reserve's superlow interest-rate policy has weighed heavily on margins.

While loan growth seen in the first quarter isn't yet strong enough to suggest banks are anywhere near out of the woods, it does provide some reason to hope the lending environment is improving. And it could bode well for banks' coming first-quarter results, especially as firms continue to grapple with lower mortgage-origination activity.

Not that any lending gains have been immediately apparent. In the first quarter through the third week of March, the latest date for which Federal Reserve data are available, overall bank loans grew from a year earlier at an average of 2.5%.

The pace is the same as seen in the final quarter of 2013. While this at least marked stabilization following a long period of declining rates of loan growth, it wasn't anything for bank investors to write home about.

But the average figure doesn't tell the whole story. For one, it reflects extremely low growth in January -- the lowest monthly growth since 2011. More important, it conceals a marked trend of rising growth. Better to look at the monthly averages. These rose from 2% in January to 2.5% in February to 3.4% through the third week in March.

And business lending has picked back up, reversing six quarters of decelerating growth.

This type of lending rose in 10 out of the year's first 12 weeks; with one week to go in the first quarter, such loans were 9.7% higher than a year before.

Business loans alone aren't enough to pull banks up out of revenue-growth doldrums. But the sudden turnaround in their growth rate signals that prospects for the economy may be better than weak first-quarter data has indicated.

China's Pork Play Has Good Taste

When China's largest pork distributor acquired America's largest pork producer, it was a tasty match. Now the two are going to the public market to sanctify their union as the world's top pork firm.

WH Group, the company formerly named Shuanghui International Holdings that acquired Smithfield Foods last year, is set for an initial public offering of up to $6 billion in Hong Kong, The Wall Street Journal reported. Shuanghui borrowed heavily to buy Smithfield, and the IPO proceeds will help pay down debt. That should leave a financially solid firm ready to harvest the gains of the combined operations.

First WH Group will move the pork. Then it will move the pigs. The legacy Smithfield operations in the U.S. raise 16 million hogs a year, says BOC International, one of the IPO sponsors. Some of this can be exported to China, which consumes nearly six out of every 10 servings of pork world-wide, according to Euromonitor.

Despite lower labor costs in China, raising hogs is actually 15% cheaper in the U.S., according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. That is thanks to lower feed prices and more efficient industrialized farming.

Smithfield was successful in recent years in moving away from distributing unbranded pork chops and the like through butchers to developing branded end products such as packaged sausages. That formula will serve WH Group well in China, where consumers have become hypersensitive to food safety.

The longer-term synergy may come from China bringing over Smithfield's hog-producing efficiencies. Beijing has made food supply and safety a priority and sees large-scale industrialized agriculture as the key. A substantial proportion of Chinese pigs still is raised on small farms. The government has provided incentives to companies such as WH Group, whose hog capacity will be around 350,000 in 2015, to ramp up substantially and capture market share.

Smithfield's buyout price was about 13 times forward earnings, which makes the suggested 20 times multiple for the IPO seem rich. But combined with WH Group's higher margin distribution business, and the potential for the company to serve as a key player in China's modernized pork supply chain, it isn't unreasonable to think the value should inch toward Chinese milk giant Mengniu Dairy, which commands 26.3 times, or a branded-product distributor such as Hormel Foods, which trades at 20.7 times forward earnings.

The price of this pork play may seem high, but the flavor could be worth it.

Stocks were broadly higher Wednesday, with the S&P 500 holding in record territory.

The S&P 500 index added three points, or 0.2%, to 1889. On Tuesday, the S&P 500 rallied 0.7% to close at a record high of 1885.52, the seventh record so far this year.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average tacked on 13 points, or 0.1% to 16546, about 0.2% shy of its Dec. 31 record high of 16576.66. The Dow rose 75 points, or 0.5%, on Tuesday to close at the highest level of 2014.

The Nasdaq Composite Index added two points, less than 0.1%, to 4270.

Stocks rose on the heels of a pair of economic reports that gave investors more reason for optimism about U.S. growth. Private-sector employment rose by 191,000, just shy of expectations of 200,000, and February's gain was revised up to 178,000 from 139,000. The report by Automatic Data Processing and Moody'sAnalytics is seen as a preview of the government's much-anticipated February employment report due Friday. Factory orders for February were stronger than expected, rising 1.6% on the month, while a rise of 1.2% was expected.

"There has been this worry that [economic] numbers might disappoint," said Stephen Auth, chief investment officer of equities for Federated Investors, which manages $376 billion. "The risk has been that if we didn't get improvement, you'd see markets pull back. But generally, the tone of the numbers has been as expected, or slightly better."

Apple edged up less than 0.1% after The Wall Street Journal reported that the company was in talks to buy Japan's Renesas SP Drivers, which makes power-saving smartphone chips, for as much as $1 billion.

Goldman Sachs Group added 0.6% after The Wall Street Journal reported that it is close to selling a trading business based on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, formerly known as Spear, Leeds & Kellogg, to Dutch firm IMC Financial Markets. The companies are discussing a price of as much as $30 million, the report said, which is a fraction of the $6.5 billion Goldman paid for the business in 2000.

MannKind surged 74% after a Food and Drug Administration committee recommended approval of the company's inhaled therapy for diabetes.

In Europe, stocks added small gains to lift the region's equity benchmark to a seventh consecutive win.

The Stoxx Europe 600 index advanced 0.2% to 336.93.

Data showing producer prices for February fell on the month, versus expectations of an unchanged reading, stoked some hopes for further stimulus when the European Central Bank meets on Thursday.

Shares of Deutsche Post climbed 4.6% following a projection of earnings growth from the logistics and mail company.

Deutsche Boerse shed 2.2% as the German exchange operator said its Clearstream Banking unit is subject to a criminal investigation in the U.S. related to alleged violations of money laundering and Iran sanction laws.

US
More Than Seven Million Sign Up for Health Coverage, Obama Says; President Adds That 'Debate Over Repealing This Law Is Over'

WASHINGTON President Barack Obama, applauding the news that 7.1 million people signed up for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act, set the stage Tuesday for Democrats to move beyond the law's rocky rollout and go on the offense.

Speaking in the White House Rose Garden, the president offered one of his most forceful defenses of the law in months after a surge in sign-ups Monday pushed enrollment past the seven million mark. That figure generally was viewed as unattainable after technical problems with HealthCare.gov impeded sign-ups for weeks after the Oct. 1 launch.

His remarks signaled a new front where Democrats will more aggressively trumpet the law. They can point to the millions of Americans who gained coverage under it and contend that Republicans who have pushed to repeal it would be taking away tangible benefits.

"In the end, history is not kind to those who would deny Americans their basic economic security," Mr. Obama said. "Nobody remembers well those who stand in the way of America's progress or our people. And that's what the Affordable Care Act represents. As messy as it's been sometimes, as contentious as it has been at times, it's progress."

Republicans didn't back down from their tough criticism of the law, accusing the White House of cherry-picking data while neglecting to provide key information about who has enrolled and how the law is functioning. A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner (R, Ohio) reiterated Tuesday that Republicans would continue to work to replace the law with an alternative.

"We don't know of course exactly what [policies] they've signed up for," Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said. "We don't know how many have paid" their premiums.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office initially projected that seven million people would enroll in private health plans under the act, then later lowered that by one million after federal and state enrollment sites stumbled. The 7.1 figure includes enrollments via HealthCare.gov through midnight Monday and sign-ups through state exchanges at various points after Sunday.

Administration officials emphasized that more work remains to successfully implement the law. A big question is how federal and state officials will process the many people who couldn't complete applications by Monday's deadline. Those who started by Monday can finish their applications, though the exact time frame and process for doing so remains unclear.

In California, state officials said their website and call center were overwhelmed Monday and they will allow people who couldn't sign up to contact the state or an insurance assister through April 15 to enroll in a plan.

Senior administration officials credited a range of high-tech and low-tech efforts with spurring the last-minute enrollment wave. The White House tested whether the analytics tools and get-out-the-vote strategies that helped Mr. Obama win re-election would aid health-care enrollment, officials said. They found some, though not all, of them did.

In promoting the law, the White House harnessed its outreach and social-media expertise but also developed new ideas for identifying people who need insurance, educating them and walking them through the sign-up process, senior administration officials said.

The administration targeted young adults, their mothers, Latinos and African-Americans, as well as the geographic areas that have the highest rates of uninsured people, officials said. They pointed to a jump in enrollment in the cities they focused on as evidence that their all-hands-on-deck, last-minute push worked.

In all, 4.8 million people visited HealthCare.gov on Monday by midnight, officials said. On Dec. 23, a deadline for people who wanted coverage effective Jan. 1, the site had 1.8 million visitors. There were also two million calls to the call center on Monday, compared with 500,000 on Dec. 23.

Chris Jennings, a Democratic policy consultant who until recently was a White House health adviser, said the latest enrollment numbers would create a steep challenge for critics to campaign for repeal because "when you switch from the 'what you may have' to 'what you could lose' dynamic, this law becomes very difficult to pull apart."

Democrats, he said, "are now feeling far more comfortable about advocating for it and defending it."

Corrections & Amplifications The White House said that more than seven million people signed up for health insurance on Tuesday. An earlier version of this story erroneously said the statement came Thursday.

European Stocks Rise as Ruble Weakens; Positive U.S. Data Buoy Global Stocks as Ruble Falls on Russia's Reserve Plans

European stocks edged higher Wednesday, notching a seventh straight day of gains, helped by signs that the U.S. economy continues to improve.

Elsewhere, the ruble weakened after "http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303847804579477282553083564" for its depleted reserves fund in the coming days.

The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 index closed 0.2% higher, with investors looking ahead to Thursday's European Central Bank policy meeting.

Expectations that the central bank could introduce further stimulus measures to stave off dangerously low inflation have buoyed markets over the past week, but many analysts and investors believe this week could be too soon for further steps.

"With the recent data on inflation the ECB has been pushed into a corner, but we don't believe they will do anything in a hurry," said Patrick Moonen, senior equity strategist at ING Investment Management. Mr. Moonen is bullish on European equities due to relatively cheap valuations and the potential for corporate earnings growth.

Germany's DAX added 0.2% while the U.K.'s FTSE 100 closed 0.1% higher. Italian stocks lagged behind, falling 1.0% as banks gave up some of their recent gains.

The moves came as the "http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303532704579477091860308368" above Tuesday's record high, after "http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303532704579477111362779356" nearly in line with forecasts in March, according to data compiled by Automatic Data Processing and Moody'sAnalytics. Although the report fell slightly short of forecasts, it helped cement the perception that the world's largest economy is strengthening after some weak data early this year, analysts said.

"The market does appear to be gradually becoming more confident on the U.S. economy as the data slowly improves," said Derek Halpenny, European head of global markets research at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, said.

Reassurance from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen on Monday that "http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304432604579473202058577752" continued to underpin sentiment across markets.

In other news, the ruble weakened more than 1.1%, as the dollar rose as high as 35.47 rubles after Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov's comments.

"The reason they [the Russian authorities] are doing it now is they have the view the situation has calmed down and that additional dollar purchases aren't going to push the [ruble any lower]," said Peter Kinsella, a currencies strategist at Commerzbank in London.

Russia's currency slumped to record low levels against the dollar and euro in early March as concerns over the country's actions in neighboring Ukraine hit markets. In March, Russia's central bank sold foreign currencies at its fastest clip since January 2009 to prop up the ruble.

Rite Aid Corp. acquired Boston-based Health Dialog Services Corp., adding a provider of health coaching, analytics and other services.

The move is expected to bolster the U.S. drugstore chain's health-management collaboration program.

Financial terms weren't disclosed.

Rite Aid Chairman and Chief Executive John Standley said the acquisition will provide Health Dialog with an expanded geographic reach as the drugstore operator aims to bring its health-alliance services to more of its markets and customers. Rite Aid also will benefit from Health Dialog's analytics and shared-decision making tools, Mr. Standley said.

Rite Aid's health-alliance services program works with health-care providers and patients with chronic and/or more than one long-term health condition to create a personalized health care action plan in coordination with the patient's physician. Pilot programs are under way in Rite Aid pharmacies in Buffalo, N.Y.; Greensboro, N.C.; and the greater Los Angeles area.

The No. 3 U.S. drugstore chain by sales behind Walgreen Co. and CVS Caremark Corp. has posted a profit in recent quarters due to a boost from its loyalty program and renovations that have expanded clinical-pharmacy services and health and wellness products.

Rite Aid plans to release its fiscal fourth-quarter financial results on April 10.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Political risks are Baring down on Asean Frontiers; Fund focus

Indonesia and Thailand are risky, but manager likes Vietnam, says Bradley Gerrard

Baring Asset Management's Soo Hai Lim is facing up to looming political risks within his Asean Frontiers fund.

The $515m (312m) Dublin-based fund, which is sold to investors across Europe, invests in the group of emerging markets that make up the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean).

But the manager says Indonesia and Thailand in particular are facing political uncertainty. The portfolio has weightings of 17 per cent and 16 per cent to the markets respectively.

" Indonesia has a presidential election this year and we will need to see a credible reformer and government because the country needs to embark on further reforms," Mr Lim says.

"And Thailand , of course, at the moment, is so messy that not many people know what shape the resolution will be in this round of political impasse. The country really needs a well-functioning government."

The manager says foreign investors in Thailand have been "quite nervous" about political risks in recent times.

He claims there have been $900m of net sales of Thai stocks by foreign investors in 2014. "This comes on top of $6bn of outflows last year, so very large," he says.

"In the short term, investors definitely are concerned about the political developments. But whether that affects foreign investors in the long term - we will need a bit of clarity to see how these political situations will clear out."

He says Indonesia, however, should be able to battle its current-account deficit and high-inflation problems. It continues to allow its currency to depreciate after its central bank raised rates by 175 basis points.

"The effect of this is to slow down domestic demand and therefore import growth," he says.

"That would actually result in a smaller trade deficit. In fact, if you look at the trade numbers last quarter, there was a huge surplus and current-account deficits for the fourth quarter last year actually came in below 2 per cent. So that trend is an improvement."

Mr Lim says any negative political news from giants such as China or Turkey could also have an impact on the Asean economies, as could a weaker than expected recovery in developed markets integral to the region's export recovery.

Elsewhere, the manager says he is currently most bullish on Vietnam , which has "undergone the macro adjustment that is needed after the bubble year in 2007".

"We are starting to see the final phase of restructuring, which is tackling the bad debts in the banking sector," he says.

"This is important because once the loans are tackled, banks can start lending again and the economy can grow strongly once more. So we like Vietnam."

Since launch in August 2008 the fund has delivered a top-quartile return of 90 per cent compared with the average 55.3 per cent return from funds in the IMA Asia Pacific ex Japan sector, according to FE Analytics, the data provider.

Sowing seeds of Monsanto's harvest

Whether farmers are ready to plant as much corn as they did during a record 2013 will be in the spotlight at Monsanto , which makes genetically engineered seeds, as it reports second-quarter earnings on Wednesday , writes Neil Munshi .

The three-month period ended in February is historically the St Louis-based company's most important quarter because it includes the run-up to the North American growing season, when farmers begin to stock up on seeds.

With corn prices down sharply from the same period last year, and planted corn acreage set to drop, analysts are focused on whether the company was able to offset potential volume declines with price increases.

Analysts will also keenly await any figures the company can provide on farmer uptake of its big data offerings related to Climate Corp, the weather data firm that Monsanto acquired for nearly $1bn last year. Hugh Grant, chief executive, has said data represents a potential $20bn sales opportunity for the industry.

Also important will be any update on the rollout of its soyabean seeds in Brazil, a key growth market that is becoming increasingly crucial to the company's long-term plans.

Wall Street analysts predict Monsanto will report earnings of $3.08 a share on $5.81bn in sales.

Easier Money: It's a Pretty Good Time to Be Borrowing

No one's ready to say "party like it's 2007," but it's looking more and more like bankers are finally putting the financial crash behind them.

It's easier to get a loan these days for a new home or new car than it's been in five years the darkest days of the Great Recession.

To be sure, for some borrowers the purse strings are being loosened only a little. So while money is easier to borrow than it had been, the lending landscape is far from normal, experts say.

It's still very difficult for borrowers with tarnished credit to borrow, and even on credit cards, where banks are more willing to lend, regulatory changes have generally lowered borrowing limits.

Even borrowers with strong credit can still expect much more scrutiny than in recent years.

'Loosening Up Again'

In general, however, lending "is loosening up again after being extremely tight," says Michele Raneri, vice president for analytics at Experian Information Solutions, a major consumer credit-rating company. "For years, it was really difficult to get different kinds of loans, bank cards, as well as mortgages."

Melanie Welsh, president of Envision Mortgage, a Wilmington, N.C., mortgage broker, says she's seeing some loosening of credit standards for mortgages, with banks willing to underwrite loans on slightly lower credit scores than a year or so ago.

"Banks are becoming more open to [borrowers] who don't have perfect credit scores," she says. That even includes loans for second homes, an area where it had been particular hard to get credit.

For individuals looking to borrow money, the post-financial-crisis landscape has been a study of futility. Because the crisis was born out of the collapse of a real-estate lending bubble, the ability of banks to lend took a direct hit.

Strict Regulations

Even after the worst of the financial crisis has passed, banks have found themselves in a much stricter regulatory environment as government clamped down on the lax lending practices that led to banks being saddled with billions of dollars in bad loans.

As a result of regulatory pressure, "banks had to back away from the [lower-rated but still] creditworthy customers who are exactly the people that need loans the most," says Rick Spitler, co-chief executive officer of Novantas, a firm that provides consulting services to banks.

Because the financial crisis largely revolved around residential real estate, home lending took the biggest hit. It's also taken the longest to thaw.

"We continue to have tight credit in the housing sector," says Michele Girard, economist at RBS Americas.

But, she notes, there are "hints" that is changing. Better news for borrowers is evident in the credit scores of those getting loans.

In late 2011, for example, 50.1% of all mortgage loans were for borrowers categorized by Experian as "super prime," a group that makes up 20.6% of the 220 million credit-active U.S. consumers in the firm's database.

Meanwhile, "prime" borrowers got 32.7% of loans, and "near prime," 14%. Those categories account for 33.9% and 13.3%, respectively, of Experian's consumers.

But in the final quarter of 2013, "prime" borrowers accounted for 36.5% of all mortgages and "near prime," 22%.

And importantly, there are simply more loans being granted. The volume of "near prime" loans rose 9.5% in the fourth quarter of 2013 from a year earlier. Loans to "prime" borrowers rose 7.7%. Subprime loans, meanwhile, have risen to 5.2% of mortgages from 3.9% a year earlier.

"That's telling you that there is pent-up demand from consumers who want to borrow and they are now finding it easier to borrow," says Experian's Ms. Raneri.

While regulators are still keeping a tight lid on lending practices, "banks are relaxing their credit standards slowly and carefully," says Mr. Spitler.

When it comes to interest rates, it's a good news, bad news story. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage stood at 4.4% this past week, up from 3.6% a year ago, according to Freddie Mac.

Attractive Interest Rates

"There's a lot of focus on affordability based on where interest rates are today compared to a year ago &but if you look at it on a historical perspective, they're still so attractive," says Envision's Ms. Welsh.

Banks are also granting more home-equity loans and lines of credit, in part because rebounding home values leave more homeowners with equity they can tap. There were $111 billion in new home-equity lines of credit handed out in 2013, up from $86 billion in 2012, according to Experian. In addition, the limits on these Helocs have also been rising.

In contrast to home loans, auto credit rebounded quickly from the crisis. That was due to a combination of factors, including a tendency of people to keep making car payments even when they stop paying a mortgage, as well as the fact that it's often easier for a bank to resell a car that has been repossessed than a foreclosed house.

As a result, even those with the worst credit are finding it easier to borrow to purchase a car these days. The dollar value of subprime car loans rose by 31% in 2013.

Potential credit-card users, meanwhile, may be noticing more pitches in their mailbox. But a closer look may show that the borrowing limits are lower than they used to be.

The reason: laws passed in 2009 that rewrote the rules on credit cards. Those new rules made it much harder for issuers to raise interest rates on borrowers who don't make timely payments.

As a result, banks are less willing to offer high credit limits to untested customers, says Novantas's Mr. Spitler. Otherwise, he says, when it comes to willingness to lend via credit cards, "banks have gone pretty much back to normal."

BEIJING China Merchants Bank Co. said Friday its 2013 profit rose 14.3% from a year earlier, driven by growth in interest income and higher fees.

But the chairman of the bank said the nation's sixth-largest lender has been facing increasing pressure from problem loans as China's economic growth slows.

The bank said its profit was 51.7 billion yuan ($8.5 billion) in 2013, up from 45.27 billion yuan a year earlier.

The result was generally in line with the 51.8 billion yuan average forecast of 31 analysts polled by Thomson One Analytics.

The bank's net-interest income rose 12% on year to 98.9 billion yuan and net fee and commission income climbed 48% on year to 29.18 billion yuan.

Its net-interest margin, the difference of interest rates paid and received, fell to 2.82 percentage points in 2013 from 3.03 a year earlier.

The bank's nonperforming loan ratio rose to 0.83% in 2013 from 0.61% in 2012. Its outstanding bad loans were 18.3 billion yuan, up 6.64 billion yuan from a year earlier.

Fu Yuning, chairman of China Merchants Bank, said the bank faced increased credit and liquidity risks last year and will need to closely monitor global and domestic market conditions this year.
