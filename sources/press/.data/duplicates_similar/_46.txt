U.S. Dollar Rises on Positive Outlook; Currency stronger as report shows U.S. economy added 204,000 workers last month

The U.S. dollar advanced Wednesday as economic data continued to point to solid U.S. growth, even as the pace of expansion in Europe appears to be slowing.

The WSJ Dollar Index, which measures the currency against a basket of 16 others, rose for a third consecutive session, climbing 0.3% to 86.35 its highest close since Dec. 27. The index is now up 0.4% for the year. The dollar rose 0.4% against the euro to $1.195.

The dollar extended its gains after Federal Reserve officials "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-holds-rates-steady-and-sees-strong-growth-in-hiring-investment-1525284123" without countering market forecasts that officials will raise them at their next meeting. Policy makers acknowledged the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-inflation-hits-federal-reserves-2-target-in-march-1525093405?", which they had forecast for many months, but signaled no plans to pick up the pace of rate increases in response.

"The Fed is on track to achieve its dual mandate" of price stability and maximum employment, said Alessio de Longis, who manages currency investments at OppenheimerFunds Inc . At the same time "we have seen a substantial deceleration" of growth in Europe and Asia.

The dollar rose earlier after a private report showed firms across the country "https://www.wsj.com/articles/private-sector-posts-another-month-of-employment-growth-1525265382?", according to payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc . and forecasting firm Moody's Analytics. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected the addition of 190,000 jobs in April. Job growth has increased by 200,000 or more in each of the six previous months.

The dollar has been buoyed by strong economic data, which has contributed to investor expectations for the Fed to raise interest rates four times in 2018. In December and March, the Fed forecast that it would raise interest rates three times this year. Fed funds futures late Wednesday showed the market sees a 46% likelihood for four rate increases, up from 30% a month ago, according to CME Group data early Wednesday.

"There's momentum behind this," said Mark McCormick, head of foreign exchange strategy at TD Securities .

Higher interest rates tend to attract investors to a currency by offering higher returns.

The euro fell as data released Wednesday showed eurozone economy slowed in the first three months of this year. The eurozone had entered the year on a high after "http://www.wsj.com/articles/french-economy-accelerates-at-fastest-pace-in-six-years-1517303003?" for the second straight year in 2017, inspiring early claims by business leaders that Europe's economy had bounced back from years of crisis.

The currency area's gross domestic product the most comprehensive measure of the output of goods and services in an economy increased at an annualized rate of 1.7%, down from 2.7% in the fourth quarter of last year. That was a weaker expansion than the 2.3% recorded in the U.S. during the same period.

There has been "an unraveling of the European reflation trade," Mr. McCormick said.

Mark Mobius, the veteran emerging markets investor, has announced the formal launch of his new asset management boutique which will focus on companies that have the potential to deliver improvements in environmental, social and governance standards.

Mr Mobius aims to raise up to $1bn for the new company, Mobius Capital Partners, which was co-founded by Carlos Hardenberg and Greg Konieczny.

All three previously worked together at Franklin Templeton, the US asset manager, where Mr Mobius spent 30 years of his career building an emerging markets arm that controlled assets of around $60bn at its peak.

 During my career as an emerging markets investor, I have always been a passionate advocate on corporate governance issues. I have two partners with an enviable track record in Carlos and Greg. Our combined knowledge and experience in sustainable investing is what sets us apart, and gives us the leading edge in delivering the changes we want to see in emerging and frontier markets,  said Mr Mobius.

Mobius Capital Partners received authorisation this week from the Financial Conduct Authority, the UK regulator, and will be headquartered in London. It intends to launch a Luxembourg-based fund (open-ended Sicav) in June, subject to regulatory approval, with initial seed funding provided by the three founding partners, family members and other chosen investors.

Nine portfolio managers will be employed by the company. Back-office functions will be outsourced to UBS which has been chosen as the fund administrator.

The new company will build a concentrated portfolio of around 30 holdings and push for improvements in ESG scores to drive up returns.

MSCI, the indices and data analytics provider, will supply ESG information to Mobius Capital Partners which intends to supplement this advice with its own insights.

Mr Hardenberg said that every company in emerging and frontier markets would be  put under the microscope  in an effort to find suitable targets and that Mobius Capital Partners would strive to seek representation on the boards of investee companies.

 Our strategy will champion governance and will reach beyond simple ESG exclusion screens,  said Mr Hardenberg.

Mr Mobius said that the huge scale of investor inflows into passive exchange traded funds that follow broad benchmarks had become  a major challenge  that had resulted in rising demand for actively managed emerging market strategies that did not blindly follow an index.

Details of fees for the institutional and retail share classes of the new fund will be announced at the launch in June.

In an unusual move for the firm, the fund will invest in companies, infrastructure assets and real estate using the same pool of capital. Partners Group typically raises dedicated funds for asset classes such as private equity, infrastructure or real estate.

Standard Life Aberdeen PLC, Edinburgh

The investment arm of Standard Life Aberdeen PLC has joined forces with European firm 21 Partners to set up a  ¬1 billion ($1.23 billion) private-equity fund. The Standard Life arm, named Aberdeen Standard Investments, and 21 Partners established a joint venture with the intention of launching the fund this year. The fund will buy noncontrolling stakes in European companies and will be able to hold investments for up to 15 years. Standard Life Aberdeen was formed last year when Aberdeen Asset Management PLC merged with Standard Life PLC.

Verdane Capital Advisors, Oslo

Verdane Capital Advisors closed a new fund named Verdane Edda with 3 billion Swedish kronor ($365.5 million). The fund closed at its hard cap and will aim to take controlling stakes in Nordic software companies, online consumer businesses and other companies where digitalization could boost growth. Verdane Edda is the firm's first fund dedicated exclusively to direct investments, Bjarne Lie, managing partner at Verdane, wrote in an email. The firm typically buys secondhand investor stakes in private-equity funds but also makes direct investments on a discretionary basis. Sixty percent of the fund's investors came from outside the Nordic region. The fund will spend up to  ¬15 million ($18.4 million) for an initial equity investment, Mr. Lie said.

MEZZANINE & OTHER DEBT

AlbaCore Capital, London

AlbaCore Capital, a credit firm set up by former Canada Pension Plan Investment Board executive David Allen, raised  ¬1.46 billion ($1.79 billion) for its maiden fund. The fund exceeded a  ¬1 billion target and has invested more than that amount so far in primary and secondary deals. AlbaCore Partners I seeks to lend to mid- to large-cap companies, said a person familiar with the matter. Canada's Public Sector Pension Investment Board committed  ¬500 million to AlbaCore in 2016.

Intermediate Capital Group PLC, London

Intermediate Capital Group PLC is seeking  ¬4 billion ($4.9 billion) for a new debt fund, according to documents from the Pennsylvania Public School Employees' Retirement System, which committed to ICG Europe Fund VII. The fund will target 15 to 25 European debt investments in companies with enterprise values of  ¬100 million to  ¬1.5 billion, according to the documents. Intermediate Capital has the ability to invest across Europe but historically has been focused on the U.K. and France. The firm is expected to be the largest investor in the fund, the documents state. The fund's predecessor closed on  ¬3 billion in 2015.

SECONDARY

Coller Capital, London

Coller Capital is seeking $9 billion to buy secondhand private-equity fund stakes, according to people familiar with the matter. If Coller hits its target for its new fund, it will be the largest the firm has raised since its founding in 1990. The firm closed its seventh secondary fund, Coller International Partners VII, in 2015 with $7.15 billion.

VENTURE CAPITAL

Idinvest Partners, Paris

Idinvest Partners held a  ¬180 million ($221 million) first closing for its third digital fund, which will focus on investments in European technology companies. The fund is more than halfway to its  ¬300 million target and already surpassed the  ¬154 million Idinvest gathered for its previous fund in the series.

Sofinnova Partners, Paris

Sofinnova Partners, a life sciences firm that made its name by financing startups, is trying its hand at late-stage investing. The firm raised  ¬275 million ($338 million) so far toward a crossover fund. Sofinnova beat its  ¬250 million goal for the fund's first closing and may add to Sofinnova Crossover I, said Chairman Antoine Papiernik. Through a dedicated crossover team, Sofinnova aims to find late-stage businesses and help them attract interest from U.S. and other international investors. The firm plans to invest in about 15 companies from the new fund. Investments will go to private and public biopharmaceutical and medical-device companies. About 80% of the fund's deals will be in Europe and the rest outside of the continent, primarily in North America. Limited partners include investment bank Bpifrance and insurance company CNP Assurances. Sofinnova closed its most recent early-stage health-care fund, Sofinnova Capital VIII, at  ¬300 million in 2015.

ASIA

VENTURE CAPITAL

Cathay Capital, Paris

Cathay Capital, Total SA's venture-capital arm and Hubei High Technology Investment Guiding Fund Management Co. are launching Cathay Smart Energy Fund, a pool of capital focused on China's energy sector. Total Energy Ventures and Hubei High Technology each will invest about 300 million yuan ($47.7 million) in the fund, which has a total target of more than CNY1.5 billion.

Qiming Venture Partners, Shanghai

Qiming Venture Partners closed three new funds totaling about $1.39 billion. The firm, an investor in the consumer-internet, health-care, information-technology and clean-technology sectors, closed its sixth dollar-denominated fund at $935 million and its fifth yuan-denominated fund at 2.1 billion yuan ($334.6 million). Both funds are focused on investments in China. In addition, Qiming closed a fund focused on early-stage health-care investments in the U.S. with $120 million. The health-care fund also is the firm's first fund dedicated to investments outside of China. Qiming named the funds Qiming Venture USD Fund VI, Qiming Venture RMB Fund V and Qiming U.S. Healthcare Fund I, respectively.

Former National Security Agency Director Keith Alexander's startup, IronNet Cybersecurity Inc., has raised a sizable round of venture financing as it seeks to leverage its founder's government experience to defend customers against sophisticated hackers.

The $78 million Series B round was led by C5 Capital Ltd., with participation from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and ForgePoint Capital, formerly known as Trident Capital Cybersecurity. IronNet's funding is one of the latest signs that cybersecurity entrepreneurs with government ties are turning to Silicon Valley firms for capital.

C5 Capital has several global offices, and its investment comes as the company seeks to expand to Europe, Asia and the Middle East.

Mr. Alexander "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-nsa-chiefs-cybersecurity-startup-draws-funding-1445819345"the company in 2014, along with veterans of the Pentagon, the National Counterterrorism Center and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

The company touts its team's government experience with an eye toward doing business with companies being targeted by foreign hackers.

Mr. Alexander served as NSA director in 2013, when former contractor Edward Snowden revealed details about the agency's surveillance practices.

Fulton, Md.-based IronNet is one of several cybersecurity companies gathering large sets of data and using analytics to detect suspicious activities on its customers' networks.

The company says it offers multiple cybersecurity products, including IronDome, which is used by several energy companies to share cybersecurity data. Other IronNet customers include Thomson Reuters and several companies in the financial services sector.

Longevity Startups Come of Age

Silicon Valley's often-mocked quest for drugs to stave off the aging process is making a comeback, only this time investors aren't laughing.

A new breed of entrepreneurs in the so-called longevity sector today is betting on data-science and drug-discovery advancements that are being taken far more seriously than yesterday's ventures in young-blood infusions, cryogenics and unproven potions aiming to prolong life.

Rather than treating aging as a disease by itself, longevity startups are developing therapeutics that target specific conditions tied to aging such as inflammatory joint diseases, vision loss and neurodegenerative diseases. Entrepreneurs from Unity Biotechnology Inc. to Human Longevity Inc. to BioAge Labs Inc. hope that drugs treating these problems may also have life-extending powers.

"Aging has the biggest correlation with almost all diseases, even more so than genetics," said Robert Nelsen, whose ARCH Venture Partners has invested billions across the biotech and broader health-care landscape since 1986. "The serious, institutional biotech investors see the science and understand how it could have pretty profound impacts on health and health care."

As investment has soared, both established biotech venture capitalists as well as those new to life sciences are setting the stage for continued growth with the launch of longevity-focused incubators. No longer content to simply accept early-stage life sciences companies into its generalist accelerator program, Y Combinator announced a special track in January that would be dedicated to biotech. The first focus of that track: longevity.

Y Combinator President Sam Altman said the decision came from the excitement in the investment world as well as the advancement of technology that has drastically reduced some of the risks associated with life sciences.

"Whenever we see a new area where critical ingredient costs have come down and there is a lot of talent in the field, then we start paying more attention," said Mr. Altman.

Y Combinator also is paying more money and taking a larger stake in the longevity track than for previous cohorts. Although the program typically invests $120,000 for a 7% stake in startups, YC Bio will invest between $500,000 and $1 million for a 10% to 20% ownership stake.

Mr. Altman isn't alone on his emerging interest in longevity among nonscientists. WeWork Cos. co-founder and Chief Executive Adam Neumann teamed up with notable longevity scientist David Sinclair to launch Life Biosciences LLC, a Boston-based company that aims to form a new generation of startups around the world that are working on therapies for age-related diseases and ways to extend healthy human life.

Silicon Valley hype may play at least some role in piquing the interest of this new class of life sciences investors, but entrenched scientists and biotech investors are equally excited.

Laura Deming, a known figure in the longevity ecosystem for her research and her antiaging therapeutics development-focused Longevity Fund, said a proliferation of researchers and budding entrepreneurs in the field prompted her to move beyond her venture-capital fund and launch a longevity-focused accelerator called Age 1. Ms. Deming serves as the sole partner of Age 1, with Marc Andreessen and Felicis Ventures serving as key investors and advisers.

Clearly, this emerging niche of biotech is gaining credibility and venture-capital attention. Investment in U.S. longevity companies has surged nearly sevenfold to about $567 million in 2017, up from $82 million in 2012, according to PitchBook Data Inc.

The largest funding rounds last year were a $151 million financing for Unity and a $113 million deal for Human Longevity, which is developing genomic and cell therapy-based therapeutics to treat age-related diseases. Unity commanded a valuation of $447.2 million following its round, according to PitchBook. Human Longevity had a valuation of $1.55 billion, according to a company spokeswoman.

Those beyond the venture world also are about to have their shot at getting behind antiaging companies. Unity filed for an initial public offering in early April.

Mr. Nelsen, whose firm is Unity's top shareholder with a 27.5% stake, and other investors in longevity are still trying to turn the page on the ridicule surrounding fountain-of-youth schemes of the past. Although tech moguls such as Peter Thiel and Larry Ellison have funded research grounded in sound science, controversial ideas like enzyme supplements, stem-cell injections and parabiosis have been deemed by critics to be far out of reach.

Parabiosis, or linking circulatory systems of older animals to younger ones, originated in the 19th century but has been revived periodically since then. Alkahest Inc., founded in part by Stanford University neurologist Tony Wyss-Coray in 2014, is studying potential benefits of injecting blood plasma of young people into people with Alzheimer's disease.

"This isn't some B.S. driven by selfish rich people who just want to live longer, but by research that demonstrates the underlying biology that impacts how we age," said Mr. Nelsen, 54 years old. "We've gotten to the point where we can really think about making drugs."

To test their theories behind that kind of drug discovery, aging-related biotech startups today also are turning to far more powerful tools such as machine learning.

"You have data from people to derive the understanding that solves the mouse-human gap," said Vijay Pande, a physicist and structural biologist who also is a general partner at Andreessen Horowitz, which secured $450 million for a bio-focused fund last year. His firm has invested in BioAge Labs, an early-stage startup that applies machine learning to genomics data to measure aging.

As with all high-risk startups, many longevity ventures will fail. ARCH itself lost some $20 million on Elixir Pharmaceuticals, which was founded in 1999 to develop drugs for metabolic diseases, but it went out of business by the mid-2000s. Mr. Nelsen said the science wasn't ready to be translated into drug development.

GlaxoSmithKline PLC paid $720 million in 2008 to acquire Sirtris Pharmaceuticals Inc., which was developing an antiaging compound. Glaxo shut it down in 2013 amid skepticism over the compound's benefits.

Undeterred, Sirtris co-founder David Sinclair is at work on another compound that goes by the shorthand NAD+ that he says has resulted in mice acting younger and living longer.

"Now, the world is more optimistic, and we have invented and made synthetic compounds that extend life in animals," Dr. Sinclair said. "That has helped make this more of a valid business endeavor."

But making the leap from mice to humans is one of the toughest parts of longevity science, said Thomas Rando, a researcher in aging at Stanford. Last year, his lab published a paper that showed injecting mice with a stem-cell-activating protein helped injured muscles to heal faster. Dr. Rando is planning to launch his own longevity startup soon.

"The tough part that entrepreneurs and investors still need to remember is just because animal studies show one thing, it doesn't always mean it will work with humans," he said. "There could be a big drop-off, and people need to know how solid their foundation of science is. And it's not going be an area where you are going to see returns in two years."

Hiring at private U.S. employers grew more than expected in April, according to a report, as employment continued to grow despite signs of potential labor shortages.

Firms across the country added 204,000 workers last month, according to payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody's Analytics.

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected the addition of 190,000 jobs in April.

April marks the sixth straight month of job growth at 200,000 or more, the report said. The March figure was revised down to 228,000 from 241,000.

"The labor market continues to maintain a steady pace of strong job growth with little sign of a slowdown," said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of the ADP Research Institute. "However, as the labor pool tightens it will become increasingly difficult for employers to find skilled talent."

Midsize businesses added the most jobs in the month, though small and large firms also contributed, the report said. The job growth came from across industries, with the high-skilled professional and business services industry accounting for more than half of all jobs added in the month.

The ADP report is based on private-payroll data in addition to government data.

The ADP report comes ahead of the monthly jobs report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday. Economists expect nonfarm jobs to rise by 195,000 for April, compared with a gain of 103,000 the prior month.

Morgan Stanley s Clare Woodman is set to become the first woman to lead a major investment bank in the City after the US lender named her as its new head of Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Ms Woodman s appointment was announced in a memo to Morgan Stanley s staff on Tuesday, which was seen by the Financial Times. She replaces American Rob Rooney, who is returning to Morgan Stanley s New York base as head of technology.

Ms Woodman was already one of the most senior women in the City through her role as chief operating officer for Morgan Stanley International. The straight-talking Englishwoman has been with Morgan Stanley since 2002, when she joined as a derivatives lawyer.

 Clare s years of experience working in London and her deep understanding of ISG (Institutional Securities Group) uniquely position her to lead the firm in our largest international market as Brexit s impact continues to unfold,  wrote Morgan Stanley chief executive James Gorman.

Her appointment is subject to regulatory approval.

Women s role in the City has come into sharp focus this year, as a succession of banks reported that their women were paid average wages and bonus sharply lower than those earned by men. Most blamed the  gender pay gap  on the fact that there are fewer women in senior roles.

In a profile on Morgan Stanley s website, Ms Woodman, who has three sons, said she  left the legal world and came to a bank because I wanted better work-life balance. I always had career aspirations, but family is incredibly important to me, too. 

She has played a central role in Morgan Stanley s London programmes for women s advancement. Other senior women in the City include UBS s chief operating officer Beatrz Martin and Virgin Money chief executive Jayne Anne Ghadia.

Mr Rooney previously held his head of technology title alongside his Emea chief executive role.

 Given the rapid pace of technological change and the ever-increasing importance of technology in both furthering our business leadership and protecting our firm and our clients, I am grateful that Rob has agreed to make technology his sole focus,  Mr Gorman wrote.

In his new role, Mr Rooney and his team will  work with the Operating Committee to set firmwide strategy on critical technology issues including artificial intelligence, automation, cyber security and digital , according to Mr Gorman s memo.

Mr Rooney will reported directly to Mr Gorman.

The Exclusive Airport Lounge Has Become a Lot More Inclusive --- Travelers bemoan the crowds jamming the buffet, using their credit-card perks

By AnnaMaria Andriotis

Dustin Scott didn't mind a six-hour layover in Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport. The 30-year-old was looking forward to using an airport lounge, courtesy of his Sapphire Reserve credit card.

What he envisioned: a quiet space where he could relax and eat free before boarding his flight to Ukraine. What he found: A packed room with no available seats. A buffet with barely any food left. Toilet paper on the bathroom floor.

"You think, 'Oh man, I have this lounge access, I can go in there and chill and there will be a bunch of business people on their laptops,'" said Mr. Scott, who works in promotions for a bike-share company. "And you go in and it's like Disney World."

Airport lounges were once a perk for business travelers and high spenders, a haven from the chaos of modern travel. Then more rewards credit cards started offering lounge access. And what was once an oasis now is more like a mall food court.

Losing that "1%" feeling has been jarring. Grousers say gourmet meals once on offer are now finger foods, and beverages are more likely to be guzzled than sipped. Overcrowding means seats often aren't available.

Bruce Douglass, a 63-year-old IT executive who has been visiting airport lounges for 25 years, said lounge staff used to approach him to ask if he would like a drink, and the food available would be a full entree.

Today, Mr. Douglass has to stand in line for a Coke. He said the food options consist of cheese squares, crackers, soup and "what passes for salad."

Lounges in the U.S. "have really gone downhill," he said.

Travelers say a turning point came in 2016 when JPMorgan Chase & Co. launched its Sapphire Reserve credit card. It became a huge hit, offering big rewards to offset a $450 annual fee. One of those was a Priority Pass membership that provides entry for the cardholder to around 60 lounges at U.S. airports and around 1,200 world-wide -- with as many guests as desired.

Other cards also offer Priority Pass access, including the Platinumcard from American Express Co. and the Prestigecard from Citigroup Inc.

Priority Pass benefits have become so widespread that wait lists at lounges are now a thing. Mary Osorno and her husband tried to visit one in March at the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport. A receptionist told Ms. Osorno to expect a 45 minute wait to get in. Ms. Osorno said they didn't bother -- the wait would be longer than their layover.

Still, Ms. Osorno has been on the other side. After running the Boston marathon in April, she visited a lounge at Boston's airport, and brought in seven of her friends as guests. They spent an hour or so drinking and eating popcorn before their flight.

Sheryl Pflaum, an executive vice president at Collinson, the parent company of Priority Pass, said "unfortunately, lounges may reach capacity from time-to-time" and that the company works with lounge operators to address problems. The company said a new lounge in the Dallas airport will open this summer and will more than double the current seating.

Bill McGuinness, a 57-year-old real-estate developer, was at a Centurion Lounge, which is open to certain American Express cardholders, in Seattle in April when a woman placed her toddler on a bar table. She stripped him down to his diapers and changed him into his pajamas. Mr. McGuinness said the woman then ordered a cocktail and talked on her phone while her son was "running laps" around theloungefor the next hour.

His biggest pet peeve about the various lounges he has visited: people stacking piles of food from the buffet on their plates and loading up on cheap Chardonnay. "The whole thing is so bleak," he said. People are behaving like "farm animals."

"The majority of our card members report having very positive experiences within our Centurion lounges," said an AmEx spokeswoman. Spokeswomen for Citigroup and JPMorgan, which don't own or manage Priority Pass affiliated lounges, declined to comment.

Garett Ng admits to getting carried away. He had drunk three glasses of free "bottom-shelf whiskey" he said at a Priority Pass affiliated lounge in Boston last November when he realized his flight to San Francisco was boarding. The 36-year-old health-care analytics manager ran to the snack bar and stuffed five granola bars into his jacket -- "the chewy ones for kids."

"It was just a panic," he said. "I often joke I have this undergrad mentality, 'Oh free food, you have to grab it quickly.'"

Lounges are trying to rein things in. Following complaints from cardholders, AmEx is expanding some of its Centurion lounges and restricting access to holders of Platinum and Centurion cards, which carry annual fees of $550 and $2,500, respectively, and some business cardholders.

Priority Pass, meanwhile, is dealing with the crowds in a new way. It's offering food and booze credits of around $28 per person, with one catch: People have to leave the lounge to use them at restaurants in the airport.

Government Scrutiny of Mergers Poised to Rise; In two important areas antitrust law and national security the government is starting to take a more skeptical view of mergers, which could present challenges for private-equity firms.

Amplifications: This article appeared in the May 2018 issue of Private Equity Analyst, a monthly magazine published by WSJ Pro. The story has been updated from the print version to include news that the Federal Trade Commission confirmed five new commissioners on April 26.

The era of easy mergers could be coming to a close.

Changes in the U.S. government's approach under the administration of President Donald Trump could make it harder for companies to merge, lawyers and regulatory experts say. After years of offering relatively light resistance to companies combining, the federal government appears to be taking a more skeptical posture toward mergers they feel may not be in the public interest especially those involving Chinese entities.

This shift comes amid a growing backlash against corporate concentration, which has led to demands for tougher antitrust enforcement, as well as a broader frustration among some segments of the U.S. public with the free-trade policies endorsed by past administrations.

For private equity, more stringent merger rules could have damaging consequences: closing delays, higher legal costs, broken deals and a smaller pool of potential buyers if some foreign companies are excluded. Investment in the U.S. from China already has started to crater, in part because of regulatory hurdles. There was a 36% decline in 2017 from the prior year, according to data from the National Committee on U.S.-China Relations and the Rhodium Group.

"The deal environment is very important to private equity, and this means less predictability," said an antitrust lawyer who currently has cases before the Federal Trade Commission, the main antitrust enforcer in the U.S.

These shifts in mood seem to be influencing the two key federal agencies with merger-review authority: the FTC and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., or CFIUS.

Mr. Trump recently overhauled the FTC's leadership, which could have broad implications for merger policy for many years. He named a full slate of five new FTC commissioners to lead the agency, all of whom were approved by the Senate last week.

There are signs the new FTC commissioners may want to tighten merger scrutiny. Joseph Simons, the former Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP attorney Mr. Trump tapped to be the agency's chairman, wrote last year that the agency needs to address criticism its lax approach to greenlighting mergers may have hurt consumers and workers. Mr. Simons and other new commissioners also want the agency to look back at mergers it approved in the past to see if they actually benefited the American public.

Although none of the commissioners made firm statements against corporate concentration in their congressional hearings, they did seem responsive to the changing public mood and the growing frustration with corporate power, said William Kovacic, a professor at George Washington University who served as FTC chairman from 2008 to 2009.

"I think you have an apparent consensus that merger scrutiny will become somewhat more demanding," said Mr. Kovacic.

A more assertive FTC could also try to ramp up enforcement of other antitrust issues that have tangled up private-equity firms in the past, attorneys said. These include the possibilities of collusion between firms in consortium and club deals, and the issue of firm employees serving as directors of competing businesses, which sometimes arises when firm executives sit on the boards of many portfolio companies.

Changes also have begun at CFIUS, a federal committee with power to review any merger in which a foreign entity could take control of a U.S. company.

CFIUS is tasked with identifying deals that might harm U.S. national security, and it has played a much more assertive role under the Trump administration, especially for deals with Chinese buyers. The committee has quietly squashed several private equity-backed deals in the past year, lawyers who worked on the negotiations said.

CFIUS can't block a deal on its own it sends its recommendation to the president, who can then block it but in practice, a merger usually is doomed if the agency opposes it, and the vast majority of companies withdraw their deals in that situation.

Last year, CFIUS reviewed almost 240 mergers, a 40% increase over the then-record 172 deals it reviewed in 2016. Reviews are private, so it is hard to say exactly how many deals it effectively scuttled last year, but it was likely around 20, according to an estimate by law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati. In a normal year, it is rare for the agency to block even half that many.

It also publicly opposed two deals Mr. Trump blocked: the acquisition of Lattice Semiconductor Corp. by Canyon Bridge Capital Partners, a private-equity firm based in the U.S. but reportedly backed by the Chinese government; and the hostile takeover of chip maker Qualcomm Inc. by Broadcom Inc., which since has moved its headquarters from Singapore to the U.S.

"I think there is undoubtedly a change in policy in the Trump administration," said Stephen Heifetz, a partner in regulation and compliance at Wilson Sonsini. "Obviously, the Trump administration is more hawkish on trade and security issues than the Obama administration."

The Return of Antitrust

Antitrust now has a political importance that it hasn't had in many years not since 1912, when Theodore Roosevelt ran for president attacking corporations and trusts, said Carl Shapiro, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has written extensively on antitrust matters.

Most of this discussion has been about the possibility of using antitrust law to curb the power of the technology giants Facebook Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google. In Mark Zuckerberg's testimony in April, for instance, several members of Congress challenged the Facebook chief executive over whether his company is a monopoly that should be reined in with antitrust law.

There has also been a revival of talk about using merger reviews to prevent excessive concentration and cut down the market power of large companies. Influential academic literature has concluded that in recent years, "the government has let too many dodgy deals go through, or accepted ineffective settlements," said Mr. Kovacic.

But as this antimerger sentiment has grown, the FTC has been hobbled. The agency, which along with the Justice Department is responsible for antitrust law, had been at less than half strength for more than a year, with just two of the five seats on the commission occupied during that time.

Despite being short-handed, the two-member court was impressively active last year, lawyers said. FTC challenges required six planned mergers to be abandoned or restructured due to antitrust concerns last year, compared with eight mergers for the previous four years in total, according to the agency's annual report on competition.

Having a full complement of commissioners instead of two will probably mean "more questions, more perspectives, more scrutiny" for proposed deals, according to an antitrust attorney who has both worked at the FTC and argued cases before the commission. It will also mean companies will have to persuade three commissioners to let a deal go through, compared with one on the current two-person board.

During Mr. Simons' previous tenure at the FTC, when he was the director of the Bureau of Competition between 2001 and 2003, he had the reputation as a tough antitrust enforcer, lawyers who have argued cases in front of the FTC said.

Mr. Kovacic thinks the new FTC likely will be more reluctant to allow mergers that reduce the numbers of competitors, or to permit voluntary settlements in which companies promise to change their conduct after the merger closes. It is also likely to be skeptical of vertical mergers in which two companies in the same production cycle combine, such as the proposed AT&T Inc.-Time Warner Inc. deal that was challenged this year by the Justice Department, Mr. Kovacic said.

America First, China Last?

CFIUS used to be very reluctant to oppose mergers because of the general desire to encourage investment in the U.S., but that reluctance has eroded under the Trump administration, lawyers said.

Since the agency was formed in 1975, the president has blocked a deal at CFIUS's urging only five times but twice already under Mr. Trump.

Both of Mr. Trump's rejections were motivated by the perceived threat of Chinese competition. The Broadcom-Qualcomm merger, while not involving any Chinese entities, "would leave an opening for China to expand its influence" in the technology sector, a CFIUS official wrote.

"CFIUS today, unlike in the past, views China deals through the lens of strategic competition, as opposed to analyzing each deal in isolation," said Mr. Heifetz of Wilson Sonsini.

CFIUS is particularly vigilant about deals involving technology for automation, artificial intelligence, semiconductors and wireless networks, lawyers said. The committee is also wary of mergers through which foreign entities could acquire information about American citizens, like the proposed acquisition of insurer Genworth Financial Inc. by China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co., a deal whose closing deadline has been extended four times during CFIUS review.

But CFIUS review extends beyond sensitive industries. "Now it can be absolutely anything," said Judith Lee, who co-chairs the international trade practice at law firm Gibson Dunn & Crutcher LLP.

For instance, in 2016, Blackstone Group LP reportedly canceled its planned sale of a $1 billion hotel in Coronado, Calif., to China's Anbang Insurance Group. CFIUS had raised concerns about the deal because the hotel is located close to U.S. military installations.

A bill to reform CFIUS introduced late last year and currently making its way through Congress could make that sort of objection more common. The bill would allow the agency to review sales of real estate located near U.S. government facilities, rather than just companies, as well as joint ventures and deals in which foreign investors take passive stakes in companies. It would also make certain sales subject to mandatory review, and would lengthen the time the agency has to scrutinize transactions, all changes likely to make CFIUS review more burdensome and expensive.

The bill has support from both Republicans and Democrats and has a good chance of making it into law, said Ms. Lee.

"It's going to increase the number of cases and the length of time they take," she said. "That's good from a CFIUS perspective but not from a private-equity perspective."

CFTC Unlikely to Change Horses Midstream

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission hasn't had a full dais in four years. Now that the Senate finally "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-nominate-dan-berkovitz-to-cftc-1523903847" in the coming months, Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo wants everyone to know that the new roster is built to last.

When he was being considered for the chairmanship after President Donald Trump's election, Mr. Giancarlo made clear to the transition team and then the White House that he didn't want to be nominated for an entirely new term and would prefer to serve out his current five-year term as a Republican commissioner, which began in 2014.

But things move slowly in Washington, and Mr. Giancarlo has spent much of 2017 and early 2018 orienting the CFTC to his management style. He came up with a top-to-bottom budgeting process (which Congress largely ignored, to his chagrin), hired several new division directors, and instituted new policies for data collection and enforcement. In the meantime, he became one of the most prominent faces of the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rise-of-bitcoin-futures-prompts-regulator-to-revisit-hands-off-approach-1517394600".

In short, Mr. Giancarlo feels he has much to do beyond April 2019, when his current term expires. The chairman can continue serving at the pleasure of the president, and there's no indication that the White House has any interest in booting Mr. Giancarlo from the job.

To quiet any rumors of his impending departure, Mr. Giancarlo "https://twitter.com/ISDA/status/989503701143388161" at an industry conference last week.

"I'm not someone to drop the mic and walk off the floor," he told an audience at the International Swaps and Derivatives Association conference. "There's work to be done and I'm a good patriot and I'd like to see this work done."

His to-do list for the next year and beyond is already quite full. The commission "https://www.wsj.com/articles/swaps-rules-due-for-overhaul-in-bid-to-boost-liquidity-1524715260" dictating which market participants need to register as swap dealers, set position limits for speculative derivatives trading, and begin to revisit certain postcrisis rules that some believe are overly prescriptive.

But given that a position-limits rule has gone through two chairmen without being finalized, it's clear there's plenty on Mr. Giancarlo's to-do list that he might not accomplish, even with some extra time.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

World's Second Most Valuable Cryptocurrency Under Regulatory Scrutiny

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/worlds-second-most-valuable-cryptocurrency-under-regulatory-scrutiny-1525167000", but regulators are examining whether other widely traded cryptocurrencies should be regulated as securities, according to people familiar with the matter.

The inquiry includes a focus on ether, representing a significant threat to virtual currencies, which so far haven't been drawn into a regulatory crackdown on potential fraud in the market for the assets. Until now, regulators hadn't questioned whether rules designed for stocks should apply to virtual currencies such as ether, the world's second most valuable cryptocurrency after bitcoin with a market value of $67 billion.

The analysis, by federal securities and commodities regulators, turns on whether the creators of virtual currencies other than bitcoin exert significant influence over their value, in the same way a company's stock price depends on its managers and their strategy, performance and investments, the people said.

Panasonic Unit Admits Accounting Offense

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/panasonic-unit-admits-accounting-offense-1525116607" to violating an accounting provision of the main U.S. antibribery law, triggering payments to authorities totaling more than $280 million.

Panasonic Avionics Corp., a wholly owned subsidiary of Panasonic Corp. of Japan, agreed to pay a $137.4 million criminal penalty to resolve claims it violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The law bars bribing foreign officials to get, or keep, a business advantage, as well as hiding those payments in a company's books.

The parent company, Panasonic Corp., will pay about $143 million of disgorgement giving up funds gained via its wrongdoing to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

WSJ Pro: Dodd-Frank Overhaul  Should Get Done Now,' Mnuchin Says

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said an overhaul of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law "should get done now" and he is hopeful it will happen in the next 30 to 60 days. Mr. Mnuchin, speaking at the Milken Institute Global Conference, said the desire to make changes to Dodd-Frank is bipartisan and he's optimistic about the overhaul. He said it is a "long time past the financial crisis," and making changes to Dodd-Frank are particularly important for smaller banks, ranging from community banks to regional firms. Mr. Mnuchin said he spoke with House Financial Services Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) about the overhaul recently and has been in touch with others across different agencies.

Tough Choices Loom for Theresa May to Meet Brexit Promises

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-on-brink-of-crisis-as-theresa-may-struggles-to-deliver-on-brexit-promises-1525062600" Brexit referendum, the U.K. stands on the brink of a full-blown political crisis.

Until now, Prime Minister Theresa May has been able to hold a divided government, party and country together by ducking hard choices or denying that hard choices need to be faced. Although she voted to remain, she embraced the Brexiter fantasy that quitting the European Union would be easy: that the U.K. could halt payments to Brussels, stop EU citizens from coming to work in Britain, ditch EU single-market rules and negotiate the U.K.'s own free-trade deals while maintaining all the benefits of existing trade with the EU.

But now that strategy has run out of road. Mrs. May is in trouble because she has made three apparently incompatible pledges, including a promise to hard-line Brexiters that the U.K. will quit the EU's customs union and single market to give Britain the control over its own tariffs and regulatory rules that it needs to strike its own free-trade deals. Now Mrs. May is under pressure both domestically and from the EU to spell out which of these promises she is going to break.

SEC Wants Boards' Views on Contested Shareholder Proposals

"https://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2018/04/30/sec-wants-boards-views-on-contested-shareholder-proposals/" wants to hear from boards when determining if shareholders' proposals amount to meddling with a company's day-to-day business.

The agency in April denied a request by General Motors Co. to omit from its proxy materials a shareholder resolution asking for its fleet's future emissions. In the denial, the SEC specifically made reference to the lack of context from the company's board.

The SEC had indicated in guidance released November that a company's board was in a better position than the agency to determine the relevance to a company's business operations any policy issue raised in a proposal. It is unclear if including the board's opinion would have helped GM's request or not.

JPMorgan Returns to Indonesia's Good Graces

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgan-returns-to-indonesias-good-graces-1525102615" Chase & Co. as a primary dealer of government bonds almost a year and a half after the U.S. bank was kicked out of the business over a negative research report.

The finance ministry said in a statement Monday that America's largest bank by assets would be a primary dealer again beginning May 2 along with 19 other banks and financial institutions. It didn't give a reason for the reinstatement. The ministry had previously said the bank would be eligible to reapply after 12 months of sitting out.

Analysis: The Real Risk Is Believing That Volatility Is Risk

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-real-risk-is-believing-that-volatility-is-risk-1525106959" by: American cities being vaporized by North Korean nuclear missiles, or the VIX spiking above 20? Judging by recent market reactions, investors are much more worried about volatility than they are by the prospect of nuclear armageddon.

In one way this is a grossly unfair comparison, but it also goes to the heart of one of the most important questions in investment: What is risk?

Big Tech's Head Is in the Cloud

With consumers increasingly turning to their mobile devices for money transfers and financial advice, some analysts have predicted that tech companies will supplant traditional banks as providers of many banking services. But "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-amazon-and-google-havent-attacked-banks-1524758594".

The biggest banks, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS Group AG, are themselves investing billions of dollars in new technology and, for the first time, starting to use public cloud-computing platforms, in which computing power and storage are purchased over the web. The leading providers of those fast and sophisticated shared computing services include Amazon's AWS, Alphabet's Google Cloud and Microsoft's Azure.

Cloud spending by banks is expected to skyrocket. By 2021, banks globally are forecast to spend more than $12 billion on public cloud infrastructure and data services, up from $4 billion last year, according to market research firm International Data Corp.'s public cloud spending guide.

By many metrics, the cloud business offers better opportunities to tech firms than, say, retail banking. Overall cloud-industry revenues are growing at about 60% year-over-year, Jefferies estimates. Meanwhile, retail-banking revenue, comprising products such as checking accounts and cards, at most big banks is growing at a fraction of that rate. And any real foray into banking or financial products could also entail substantial regulatory issues and expense.

On Improving the Accuracy of Stress-Test Models

Alternative stress-test models used to mimic federal regulators' tests for forecasting bank performance during a crisis "can be significantly improved by using information theory and machine-learning calibration techniques," according to "http://www.aei.org/publication/on-the-accuracy-of-alternative-approaches-for-calibrating-bank-stress-test-models/" by Paul H. Kupiec of the American Enterprise Institute. Using the 2008 financial crisis as a "natural experiment," Mr. Kupiec compared the accuracy of alternative stress-test models that mimic the Federal Reserve's model and others that used different variables and calibration techniques. "A simple single-equation stress test model that uses only macroeconomic factors as explanatory variables produces, by far, the most accurate forecasts," he writes.

How to Secure Retirement Savings

A $140 billion drop in the value of General Electric Co.'s stock during the past year was especially hard on company retirees whose savings were tied to the stock, but their pain "could easily have been avoided," Barry Ritholtz "https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-04-23/how-to-avoid-a-retirement-disaster". He highlights some of the pitfalls of saving for retirement, such as faulty expectations for future returns on investments, a poorly diversified portfolio and the lack of a financial plan. "If those GE employees had created a long-term financial plan, I believe it would have been obvious to most if not all that they were taking on more risk than was necessary to achieve those goals," he says.

Brexit saps London s appeal to tech founders

UK capital benefits from a broad investor base but bosses are nervy

For Rob Bishop, head of one of Europe s fastest growing tech companies, now is the time for start-ups to relocate operations elsewhere in the EU, ahead of the UK s departure next year.

 You don t want to get caught out at the eleventh hour,  he says.  You can t assume things will be fine after Brexit and then find out they aren t. 

The managing director of London-based payments start-up Optal says it has applied for a regulatory licence in Ireland, in the event that the UK does not retain passporting rights. These currently enable fintech companies to sell financial services across the EU single market.

Mr Bishop plans to base five people in Dublin, including an executive. For now the start-up has stopped short of a wholesale relocation.

Optal is just one of several tech start-ups that have told the Financial Times they will shift staff and operations out of the UK because of prolonged uncertainty caused by Brexit.

Founders and venture capital investors describe a less attractive environment for start-ups, including a drop-off in investment from the European Investment Fund, as well as problems hiring skilled EU developers and the question mark over passporting rights.

Despite these worries over London s status as Europe s start-up hub, this year s FT 1000 list of Europe s fastest growing companies   judged by revenue growth between 2013 and 2016   finds the UK capital is home to 74 of these businesses, again more than any other city. Paris came in second with 62, up from 45 last year.

The list, compiled with research company Statista, suggests a strong environment in general for high-growth companies. The lowest compound annual growth rate in revenue was 34.6 per cent, compared with 16.1 per cent last year.

According to Mark Tluszcz, chief executive and co-founder of venture capital group Mangrove Capital Partners, the numbers for fast growing tech companies in Europe suggest a better environment for start-ups overall, without proving an advantage for any particular country.

 More and more capital is flowing into Europe and when you re [on] top of the pile, as London has been, you will be the centre of that,  he says.  Ten years ago if you were a remotely interesting entrepreneur you would move to London.  He adds that people who at one time  may have moved from Berlin to London 	. 	. 	. 	don t have to any more .

The UK government has attempted to reassure the country s tech industry about Brexit with a crop of initiatives including plans to double  exceptional talent  visas and establish a new office in the government to promote start-ups and academics researching artificial intelligence.

Recruiters and start-ups say that hundreds of developers from the EU have rejected jobs in London, however, because of anxieties about their future immigration rights, creating a vacuum in terms of skilled workers.

A fifth of tech jobs in London are filled by workers from the bloc, according to data from the Recruitment and Employment Confederation. Across the country as a whole, they hold 7 per cent of all tech roles, according to an analysis by the Department for Exiting the EU.

Data from Atomico, the venture capital group, in November showed French tech start-ups had closed the most funding deals in Europe for the first time in five years. Germany was the top destination for developers.

The FT 1000 list also suggests other countries well represented in the ranking have more developed corporate hubs outside their capital cities.

Almost half of the UK s high-growth tech, ecommerce and fintech start-ups on the FT 1000 list are based in London. In Germany, Hamburg and Berlin together account for only about a fifth.

A view among entrepreneurs, however, is that London still leads in terms of access to investors at each stage of a company s development.

 I would characterise the UK a bit closer to the US in terms of the way the investor scene is structured,  says Gerhard Trautmann, co-founder at Global Savings Group, a Munich-based start-up that is 10th on the FT 1000 list.

 For a company like ours, which is moving to late-stage capital, you need not just a venture capital scene but a private equity scene,  he adds.  London is definitely ahead here.

Financial regulators turn their sights on banks  use of cloud

Financial regulators on both sides of the Atlantic have turned their attention to the cloud, as concerns mount over how to supervise online storage services, which hold information from the world s biggest banks.

Global financial institutions are becoming increasingly reliant on the cloud   using it to store customer-account data and their banking systems, leading supervisors to fret about what might happen if a bank collapses.

As well as cyber risk, regulators  are worried about concentrating so much information in the hands of Amazon, Google and Microsoft   the three big companies that dominate cloud provision   without the same level of supervisory oversight as banks, according to people familiar with regulatory discussions.

The Bank of England is considering whether to test banks  resilience this year, analysing what would happen if access to the cloud were disrupted. The BoE s Prudential Regulation Authority is also expected to publish more detailed thinking on the subject as a prelude to possible regulation. Meanwhile, the United States Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is reviewing banks  relationships with third-party vendors, including cloud providers.

EU watchdogs have also had discussions with tech companies in recent weeks, according to people familiar with the situation, and have asked to see commercial agreements with banks.

Regulators were most concerned about continuity of service for customers in the event of a problem, and for banks to have the ability to move off the cloud and back on to their own databases, those people added.

 Given regulators  increasing concerns about operational resilience, they are bound to scrutinise systemically important firms  use of the cloud,  said David Strachan, a former regulator at Deloitte.

The fresh scrutiny comes as Big Tech faces growing headwinds, from how personal information is used and stored, to the dissemination of misinformation and propaganda, to how much tax they pay and where. There have been calls from politicians around the world for more rigorous regulation.

Meanwhile, banks have an uneasy relationship with their tech providers and senior bankers have called for a more level playing field: on the one hand, they are providing valuable services and products, but on the other they are increasingly competing with them for customers. Amazon offers payment services and loans for merchants on its website, while Facebook recently secured an electronic money licence in Ireland.

Europe s introduction this year of   open banking  regulation, which forces lenders to provide access to accounts of customers who authorise it, has also left senior bankers worrying that tech groups will cherry-pick the best parts of their business.

A top UK banking executive said regulators were  taking a much keener interest as more and more systems move to the cloud, not just HR and accounting systems but also core banking systems .

 The cloud is basically an external provider with almost unlimited capacity,  said the executive.  But you need to make sure that they are secure, particularly in a world of cyber attacks and fraud that are becoming more prevalent. 

Financial institutions beyond banks are also looking to exploit new computing trends such as artificial intelligence, big data and automation.

Critical market infrastructure operators such as DTCC and OCC, the US clearing houses, are planning to moves operations fully into cloud services over the next few years because, they argue, they are now more secure, cheaper and sophisticated than in-house IT systems.

Indeed, regulators themselves are using the cloud: the US Financial Regulatory Authority is a client of Amazon.

The BoE declined to comment, pointing to the PRA s annual business plan published this month that revealed it would  run another sector-wide exercise to assess the sector s ability to respond to major disruption. 

The PRA plans to  continue to develop the microprudential supervisory approach to operational resilience. This includes identifying the firms where an operational failure could have a significant impact on the real economy and considering the level of resilience we expect firms to demonstrate .

Microsoft said:  Microsoft believes the key to successful cloud adoption in financial services will be a tight partnership between regulators, financial institutions and cloud providers to ensure that the right frameworks, programs and processes are in place as financial services providers increase their usage of cloud services. 

Amazon declined to comment and Google did not respond to requests seeking comment.

TPG backs Baidu plan to spin out financial services arm

Chinese search engine Baidu is to spin out its financial services arm with the help of a group of investors led by TPG in a $1.9bn deal.

The transaction will value the unit at $4bn, one investor who was briefed on the matter said. Baidu will retain a 38 per cent stake in the newly re-named Du Xiao Man, while TPG will invest almost $1bn for a 26 per cent share.

Other investors, including Carlyle Group and Beijing-based Taikang insurance, will put in another $900m, making it one of the biggest ever private equity deals in China.

The transaction comes after venture capital has transformed the investment landscape in China in recent years, forcing private equity groups like TPG to the sidelines. "This marks the rebooting of TPG in Asia," one investor said.

Baidu's financial services unit, which was established in 2015, is a fraction of the size of its rivals' operations; it has assets of $7.5bn and liabilities of $6.6bn while its loan book is expected to amount to $8bn by the end of this year.

While it makes a small profit on revenues that are expected to reach $600m this year, the operation has been a drag on its parent's balance sheet.

The deal comes at a time when many fintech companies are under scrutiny as Beijing tries to rein in shadow banks, encourage financial groups to lower debt and reduce risks in the system.

Groups like Baidu have argued that its unit is in line with policy objectives and offers financing to individuals and small businesses that cannot get access to the banks as China moves to a consumption driven economy from one that relied for growth on investment.

"As savings and lending activities move online, technology companies are able to use their big data analytics to offer flexible micro-financing to the younger generation of consumers," said Chang Sun, TPG's managing partner for China.

Baidu is helped by the fact its business model looks on the banks as allies rather than competitors, even working with them on lending decisions through its artificial intelligence tools. The company has also been trying to turn itself into a data driven AI business, and reduce its dependence on its search engine.

The bulk of TPG's commitment is coming from its latest $4.5bn Asia fund.

Lim's Take: ESG-Driven Investing Is Only as Good as the Data Powering It

Private equity continued last week in its quest to show that altruism and returns can coexist. Former U.S. Secretary of State "https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-26/john-kerry-joins-tpg-s-2-billion-rise-fund-as-senior-adviser" as an adviser to its social investing arm, Bloomberg reported. "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-kkr-privateequity-investment-exclusiv/exclusive-kkr-launches-unit-focused-on-impact-investing-sources-idUSKBN1HX3CA", according to Reuters.

The rise of these large pools results in part from efforts by institutions to marry the art of investing with the ability to measure social and environmental effects of their wagers.

As more firms try to bring this lens to how they manage money, however, do they have the data to make it work?

Evaluating how the trio of environmental, social and governance considerations, known as ESG, strengthens or sinks a company can help investors prepare for unforeseen problems such as labor disputes and environmental disasters.

Except that not all investors may be able to access the tools or data to factor in ESG concerns in a systematic way. What defines "social good" remains a topic of debate as millennials challenge the cultural norms on issues from gender diversity to guns to animal rights. The metrics used to measure good can also be a matter of contention.

As organizations such as the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and MSCI Inc. devise standards of disclosure on ESG for public companies, they could pave the way for private-equity investors to come up with their own frameworks. Groups like Cambridge Associates and the Global Impact Investor Network, or GIIN, are developing more data-driven approaches to thinking about ESG for private markets as well.

But the private-equity industry's efforts are still works in progress.

Other questions abound. Is there integrity in the data investors have? Because some portfolio companies may have incentive to provide overly optimistic numbers on accomplishments such as jobs created or energy saved, investors need to find ways to be confident they're getting the full picture. And are they making logical leaps about how certain metrics affect returns?

So far only a fraction of institutions view environmental, social and governance concerns as top of mind, a sign that even as many investors integrate ESG into how they make decisions, it isn't yet an overriding priority, a study shows.

Only 18% of fund investors and consultants in North America rated ESG concerns as extremely or very important, according to a survey of about 40 private markets investors and consultants and about 60 fund managers by data analytics provider eVestment. North American investors and consultants lagged behind their peers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, 46% of whom said these were key parts of the due diligence process.

In theory, evaluating investments through an ESG lens isn't any different from what investors do all day: seeking relevant information to make the right decisions. As interest in ESG grows, so too will the pressure to hone tools that allow investors to effectively measure private-equity's social benefits or harm.

After all, no amount of good intention can make up for a lack of rigor.

Baidu Spinoff Gets Cash --- A $1.9 billion infusion gives Du Xiaoman the firepower to challenge China's fintech leaders

Baidu Inc.'s former financial-services unit has attracted a $1.9 billion investment from firms including U.S. private-equity giants TPG and the Carlyle Group, giving it fresh ammunition to compete in China's increasingly crowded financial-services space.

The new firm, Du Xiaoman Financial, spun off from Chinese search giant Baidu as part of a corporate strategy to shed peripheral businesses and focus on a push into artificial intelligence.

It also has attracted other investors including Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. and Taikang Group. Baidu announced the new investment on Saturday.

The financing will be used to develop new financial-technology platforms and to expand the unit's presence in China's financial ecosystem, Baidu said.

Launched in 2015, the Beijing-based financial-services group runs a mobile-wallet service as well as provides consumer loans and wealth-management services for its users.

By the end of 2017, Baidu had built up its financing business to a loan balance of 28 billion yuan ($4.42 billion), TPG said.

This latest investment will give the company, previously known as Baidu Financial Services Group, more firepower to compete in China's increasingly competitive fintech space.

Alibaba Group Holding affiliate Ant Financial Services Group, and rival WeChat Pay, run by Chinese social media giant Tencent Holdings, are currently the dominant players in China's mobile-payments space. But Du Xiaoman Financial sees room for growth in the broader market.

Investible assets in China's private wealth market were predicted to grow 14% year over year to reach 188 trillion yuan by the end of 2017, according to a study by Bain & Co and China Merchants Bank released last August. Official figures were unavailable to confirm that.

TPG, which manages more than $82 billion in assets world-wide, said the firm was eager to tap into China's growing financial services market. "As savings and lending activities move online, technology companies are able to use their big-data analytics to offer flexible micro-financing to the younger generation of consumers," said Chang Sun, TPG's China managing partner.

Baidu first revealed the unit's spinoff last July in a conference call with investors, with chief operating officer Lu Qi adding that a new shareholding structure would allow the financial-service group to obtain new market licenses and expand further.

Big Banks, Tech Step Delicately Over Turf

By Telis Demos

Technology giants and big banks have been warily circling each other, especially in the payments arena. So far, they are more frenemies than rivals.

The reason: Banks are rapidly emerging as big potential customers for the fast-expanding cloud-computing businesses of Amazon.com Inc ., Alphabet Inc . and Microsoft Corp . That is making technology companies think twice about alienating them by becoming direct competitors.

"We are very intentionally approaching banking customers with an opportunity to empower them rather than to be in their space," said Judson Althoff , executive vice president of world-wide commercial business at Microsoft. "Banks see other cloud providers investing in mobile payment capabilities, and there is a concern about disintermediation."

With consumers turning to their mobile devices for money transfers and financial advice, some analysts have predicted that tech companies will supplant traditional banks as providers of many banking services.

But the dynamic emerging is not so straightforward. The biggest banks, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co . and UBS Group AG , are themselves investing billions of dollars in new technology and, for the first time, starting to use public cloud-computing platforms, in which computing power and storage are purchased over the web.

The leading providers of those fast and sophisticated shared computing services include Amazon 's AWS, Alphabet's Google Cloud and Microsoft 's Azure.

For years, banks had resisted moving sensitive data or processes to the cloud, citing the security concerns of allowing data outside of their leased or owned data centers. Financial firms also had already invested billions into their own internal data platforms, including private clouds.

But recently, momentum shifted after regulators began using the cloud for data storage and reporting, including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority , which works with Amazon 's AWS. That has led many banks to start doing the same.

Moving from traditional mainframes to the cloud also makes it easier for banks to use artificial intelligence and other new technologies that consume huge computing resources. This is used to create better mobile products and trading tools.

"The ability of the banks to get out from under their legacy cost pile is limited," said Jason Gurandiano, head of financial technology banking at RBC Capital Markets . "So banks moving to the cloud gives them leverage with the tech providers."

Cloud spending by banks is expected to skyrocket. By 2021, banks globally are forecast to spend more than $12 billion on public cloud infrastructure and data services, up from $4 billion last year, according to market research firm International Data Corp .'s public cloud spending guide.

By many metrics, the cloud business offers better opportunities to tech firms than, say, retail banking.

Overall, cloud-industry revenue is increasing at about 60% year over year, Jefferies estimates. Meanwhile, retail-banking revenue, including products such as checking accounts and cards, at most big banks is expandingat a fraction of that rate. And any real foray into banking or financial products could also entail substantial regulatory issues and expense.

"Tech companies are going to get far more consistent and repeatable revenue being infrastructure providers than by being in banking," said Ami Grewal, head of digital strategy at GFT Group, an engineering services firm that works with banks and partners with tech firms including Amazon and Google .

A handful of banks, such as Capital One Financial Corp ., are already significant cloud customers. Capital One began working with Amazon in 2013 and made AWS its predominant cloud provider in 2016.

The bank's deal has incentives for it to spend at least $150 million a year on the service, people familiar with the agreement said. A spokesman for the bank declined to comment.

The upshot is that while big tech firms continue to dabble in banking services, they tend to do so almost entirely through banking partners.

For example, Amazon , Google and Microsoft offer digital wallets that allow users to link their bank-issued credit and debit cards.

Citigroup Inc . enables its credit-card customers to pay for goods at Amazon using credit-card rewards points.

Amazon 's AWS says working with banks is a priority. Frank Fallon, vice president for global financial services at AWS, said "interest has grown exponentially over the last few years" in cloud services in the financial-services industry. Rather than competing with banks, he said AWS was instead focused on making sure it was offering the bestsecurity, performance and function.

AWS's team keeps "financial-services customers at the core of everything we do," he said.

Tariq Shaukat, president for global alliances and industry platforms at GoogleCloud, said Google begins meetings with banks by assuring them they aren't interested in gathering banking data for its own sake.

"We see ourselves as an enabler and platform for many of those institutions, as opposed to in any way trying to compete with them in their core businesses," he said. "We start cloud conversations with an ironclad rule: A customer's data is a customer's data."

FT BIG READ. US HOUSING

The government had to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac during the housing crisis a decade ago. Now critics say the home loan agencies are using taxpayer support to be a force in commercial property. By Alistair Gray

From the spotted bronze pumpkin in the valet court to the light sculpture above the marble concierge desk, few expenses have been spared at Sky Residences. Residents of the glistening 71-storey tower in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen have access to a basketball court, a private art collection and a billiards lounge. The luxury lifestyle does not come cheap: one-bedroom apartments are on the rental market for as much as $6,500 a month.

High-earning New York professionals who live in the building take the rents in their stride, though they may be surprised to discover who financed it.

Last summer, Freddie Mac, the home loans guarantor propped up by US taxpayers a decade ago after the subprime housing crisis, backed a $550m loan to the building's owners   Moinian Group, among New York's largest private landlords, and SL Green Realty, an S&P500-listed real estate investment trust.

It was the latest in a series of deals to support top-end commercial property developments by Freddie Mac and its counterpart Fannie Mae, the twin pillars of US mortgage finance. For critics, it is projects such as Sky Residences that highlight questions over what role the two institutions should be playing in the housing market   10 years after the property bubble and subsequent financial crisis they were accused of helping to create.

Established to make mortgages more affordable and expand US home ownership   Fannie during the Great Depression and Freddie in 1970   the Treasury propped them up with about $188bn in bailout funds after the housing market meltdown. While Fannie and Freddie have private shareholders, they send most of their profits to the Treasury.

Since then, far from being reined in as critics demanded in the aftermath of the crisis, the two "government-sponsored enterprises" remain as important as ever; even more so for commercial real estate markets.

Fannie and Freddie are best known for their principal role as the leading source of financing for owner-occupied mortgages. But for decades, they have played another role in supporting the market for rental housing, by helping finance property companies that acquire or refinance investments in apartment blocks. This second, lowerprofile, part of their business has boomed since the crisis.

By the end of last year the pair had a financial interest in almost $500bn of commercial mortgages, equivalent to 38 per cent of the total outstanding across the US. That compares with almost $200bn, or 25 per cent of the market, a decade ago. Last year alone, the pair financed almost 1.6m rental units.

The expansion has raised eyebrows in the industry. Competitors that provide this type of finance   banks, life insurance companies and other institutional investors   say the taxpayer's backing allows Fannie and Freddie to offer borrowers better terms than they can.

Sam Chandan, real estate economist at New York University, says there is evidence that the government guarantees were crowding out some private sector capital. "They play a critically important role in the underserved, affordable segment," he says. "But do they compete in the segments of the market where we see robust competition? I think those are legitimate concerns."

Borrower benefits

In keeping with their mission to support "workforce" housing, most of the apartments that Fannie and Freddie finance are designed to be affordable to tenants on low and moderate incomes.

A quarter of the almost 1,200 units at Sky were set aside for such households, who competed for tenancy in a lottery. Overall, more than four in five of the units that Fannie and Freddie funded last year had rents that cost less than 30 per cent of the local area's median monthly income, a widely used measure of affordability.

Fannie and Freddie do not lend directly to apartment investors. Instead, they shoulder financial risks on loans that are underwritten by commercial mortgage companies. In a process known as securitisation, the agencies buy the loans, package them up and sell them on to investors. If borrowers default, Fannie and Freddie potentially have to cover big chunks of the losses.

For critics, their involvement in commercial real estate means that just as US taxpayers back individual homeowners through Fannie and Freddie mortgages, so they also subsidise some of the largest investment groups in the world.

Blackstone Group, Starwood Capital, the Canadian pension fund manager Caisse de Dpt et Placement du Qubec and Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC are among the biggest borrowers on GSE commercial loans, according to Real Capital Analytics.

The investors pay cheaper rates because of the federal insurance afforded by Fannie and Freddie, says Jim Costello, senior vice-president at Real Capital Analytics. Mortgages on rental apartments are on average about a tenth less expensive than those for other types of commercial real estate, such as offices and shopping malls.

How much of the lower funding costs provided by Fannie and Freddie trickle down to residents   and how much is captured by the property owner   is open to question. "With owner-occupied homes, the subsidy is direct," says Prof Chandan. "On the multi-family side [large apartment complexes], it's less clear how you provide subsidy for the renter."

Although they remain a small part of the total, the proportion of more expensive apartments financed by the pair has risen over the past decade. Last year, almost one in five units in which Fannie acquired a financial interest had rents that cost more than 30 per cent of the area's median income. In 2006, little more than one in 10 were so expensive.

Other apartment complexes supported by the pair charge even higher rents than Sky. Among the New York properties that Fannie Mae has helped finance is 456 Washington Street, which overlooks the Hudson River in Lower Manhattan. The building is owned by Related Companies, founded by Stephen Ross, the billionaire and Miami Dolphins American football team owner. About 20 of the 107 units were reserved for low-income households. The rest were let at market rates   several for more than $30,000 a month, according to listings website StreetEasy.

Fannie and Freddie finance such developments in part because they are one of the main ways cheaper properties is made available in expensive markets. To help deal with a shortage of affordable housing, policymakers in urban centres including New York give developers tax breaks if they reserve some units for lower-income residents.

"It's not because we're trying to do more high end or more expensive properties," says Manuel Menendez, Fannie Mae's multi-family chief credit officer.

The group also needs to "balance" affordable units with apartments that generate higher returns to ensure "prudent credit risk management", adding: "From time to time there will be certain assets that you might consider to be higher end."

During the financial crisis, Mr Menendez says, the agencies were a crucial source of funding for multi-family housing when commercial lenders retreated. Supporters say the pair have also helped stave off an affordable housing crisis, especially as a new generation of renters has been locked out of the postcrisis recovery. "If they didn't exist, there would be a major problem for multi-family housing," says Shekar Narasimhan, managing partner at the real estate group Beekman Advisors, who was the first chair of Fannie Mae's advisory committee on this type of housing.

Fuelling a boom?

Shortly before she stepped down as chair of the Federal Reserve this year, Janet Yellen sounded the alarm about US commercial property. High valuations, she said, were "a source of some concern", adding that "prices are quite high relative to rents".

It was the latest warning about a frothy market. In its 2017 annual report the Financial Stability Oversight Council, chaired by Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, pointed to concerns over "inappropriate risk pricing" in the asset class. Price rises for rental apartment properties had outpaced other parts of commercial real estate, it noted.

Neither Ms Yellen nor the FSOC mentioned the role played in the sector by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

For critics, the pair have played a central role in financing a boom. Developers have completed about 1.3m rental units in the US over the past five years, according to RealPage data, including a record 365,000 in 2017.

"Apartment developers and investors have overdone it in a very big way   fuelled by Fannie and Freddie," says Douglas French, a real estate consultant who advises building companies in Nevada. "We're definitely seeing it in Las Vegas. This apartment market is extremely hot."

Demand has risen in part because millennials have put off starting families, making them more likely to rent downtown than settle in the suburbs. Still, there are signs of a supply glut in popular markets. Landlords in some parts of New York are offering one or two months rent-free on high-end properties.

"Aggressive lending practices by the GSEs this cycle have been an important factor in the degree of over-investment and overvaluation of multi-family properties in certain key markets," says Michael Shaoul, chief executive of Marketfield Asset Manage-ment.

"I do not think that the GSEs have been as critical in commercial real estate as they were in traditional mortgages a decade ago   but they have perhaps allowed some of the more marginal projects to minimise equity capital this time around."

David Brickman, head of multi-family at Freddie Mac, says: "I firmly reject the notion that we are contributing to a bubble. The growth we've seen is largely fuelled by strong demand drivers and healthy fundamentals. Even though we have supply growing, we are still not producing enough affordable housing."

Fannie and Freddie's difficulties in 2008 were caused not by rental properties but owner-occupier mortgages, in which their interests are far bigger.

Apartment default rates remain low.

Yet if losses do rise, taxpayers should have some protection. Fannie and Freddie share chunks of the risks they take on with the private sector: in a typical Freddie Mac rental transaction, for instance, known as a "K-Deal", private investors would have to pick up the first 20 per cent of losses.

Instead of limits on each deal, the GSEs' commercial real estate businesses are subjected to overall limits imposed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The restrictions are a sign that policymakers recognise the risk that the taxpayer guarantee could crowd out private capital from the market, and the cap for each agency is tightening this year from $36.5bn in 2017 to $35bn.

Several types of properties are exempt from the FHFA's cap, however. Last year more than half the rental apartment debt that Fannie and Freddie took on   54 per cent, or $75bn   was not subject to the restriction.

The complex set of restrictions make it look like Fannie and Freddie could "game" the system, says Mr Narasimhan.

"I don't think that's what going on, but you can get that perception," he says. "Are they doing a good job in making sure they serve affordable housing in underserved markets? Yes. Should they be given a different set of rules? Yes."

DC's 'dirty little secret'

Pressure for reform blunted by profits

A decade since Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's multibillion-dollar losses prompted the Treasury to seize control, Washington is still ruminating over what to do with the pair. With a combined $5.4tn in assets, their status is the biggest piece of unfinished business from the crisis.

Neither fully public nor private, Fannie and Freddie pay most of their profits to the Treasury to compensate taxpayers for the risk they bear in providing a financial backstop. Investors who own the shares claim the arrangement is unfair and untenable, and several have taken legal action against the government.

Steven Mnuchin, Treasury secretary, has repeatedly said that a shake-up is on the Trump administration's agenda. Some lawmakers in Congress have also drawn up proposals to inject more competition into the market.

But reform has yet to be delivered. "There's no appetite to take it up," says Beekman Advisors' Shekar Narasimhan. "It's pretty much a dead duck at this point."

For all their ideological misgivings about the central role of the government, Republicans know the agencies provide relief to millions of voters. The taxpayer's support of Fannie and Freddie underpins the unique US system of fixed 30-year mortgages, which allows homeowners to pay back home loans over decades without worrying about interest rates.

"The dirty little secret is that the GSEs largely work," says Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Washington-based Compass Point Research. The Treasury has more than recouped what it spent on bailing them out 10 years ago.

Another crisis could spur action, Mr Narasimhan adds. But for now, they are making money that goes into the public coffers. "Who looks free money in the face and thinks that's not a good thing?"

Insurance

The insurance industry is losing its relevance by failing to address its clients' changing needs, according to the chief executive of insurance broker Aon.

Speaking to the Financial Times, Greg Case said that the industry had not innovated enough, and so had not kept pace with client demands.

Cyber insurance is one example. "The industry has $3bn of premium written in cyber at a time when clients in the US have $450bn in reported loss. That's not response, that's not relevant."

He pointed out that property and casualty insurance losses as a proportion of US gross domestic product had almost halved since the 1980s, to 1.8 per cent. "If I ask you, how is the risk industry doing in terms of relevance to the global economy, you have to say, we're becoming less relevant."

Mr Case was speaking after announcing that he had extended his contract with Aon, the world's second-largest insurance broker by market capitalisation, for another three years. He is now due to leave in 2023, by which time he will have held the job for 18 years.

Christa Davies, Aon finance chief, has also extended her contract until 2023.

Mr Case said that one of his main priorities was to change Aon so that it focused more on broad risks to clients' strategies, and less on selling individual insurance products that address specific risks.

He said that the insurance industry had focused on selling products for too long, with the result that there had been little innovation.

"CEOs want us to be able to respond to a broader definition of risk ... across their business, operating performance and balance sheet strength ... even across pension and retirement or healthcare," he added.

Aon will try to fulfil that demand by providing more data and analytics services. He said that the insurance industry as a whole had failed to turn all its data into usable ideas.

The changes could have an impact on Aon's business model. Insurance brokers have historically generated income from commissions on policies sold, but Mr Case expects the company's revenue mix to "evolve over time".

"Traditional insurance broking will always be part of what we do," he said, adding: "As we create value and get recognised for the value we create on behalf of clients we're quite comfortable that we'll be compensated fairly."

Who would you trust more to tell you about the future of insurance? The personwith half a century of experience, or someone who has only been in the business since 2015?

Both were putting their views across at the FT s recent insurance innovation summit in New York, and it was a tale of wariness versus idealism.

The voice of experience came from Hank Greenberg, the former AIG chief executive who has been in the industry for over 50 years. Now in his 90s, he still runs insurance and investment companyCV Starr. There is not much he has not seen or dealt with, from pushing the industry through the first phase of the computer revolution to convincing the Chinese government to give his company an insurance licence in 1992.

 The next generation of tech is going to have an important effect in the industry,  he said, but added:  Finding the right technology companies and products is the hard thing. 

CV Starr, which focuses on commercial insurance, has placed its insurtechbets, and continues to do so. Last year, Mr Greenberg s company joined a funding round forCytora, which is using artificial intelligence to help insurers, and this year itteamed upwith SkyWatch, a data analysis company, to help provide insurance for drones.

He said that his company was looking at technology that can improve existing processes rather than technology that can totally replace humans.

 I don t think [computers] can underwrite, but they can help an underwriter underwrite better,  he said.  It can be helpful on the claims side as well. In many claims that are very complex you have to go back and research, for argument s sake, whether there have been similar claims &doing it by hand is endless. Is it possible to do it by technology? We think so. We re working on that. 

Overall though, he said that the latest wave of change has not lived up to expectations so far:  [Change] is not as rapid as you d like to think. There s more technology companies finding niches &whether or not it achieves what you expect it to achieve - many times it's disappointing. 

That cautious optimism was a stark contrast to the more expansive view of change put forward by Daniel Schreiber, chief executive ofLemonade.

Lemonade is one of the mosthigh profileof the 1000+ insurtech start-ups around the world. It sells home insurance in New York and other parts of the US, was started in 2015 and sold $10m of insurance last year. It has attracted backing fromSoftBank, Google Ventures, Sequoia Capital and Allianz.

 We re taking a run at trying to establish a different kind of insurance company,  he said.  We ve been intellectually fascinated by why consumers don t absolutely love insurance. It s a social good, it s an economic necessity and yet its one of the least loved sectors of the economy so we re trying to use a mixture of behavioural economics and artificial intelligence to go back to basics. 

Lemonade s idea is that it earns a flat fee for its services and to give any profits beyond a fixed threshold to charity. By saying that it does not earn extra profits if it refuses to pay claims, Mr Schreiber hopes that will change the relationship between insurers and their customers in a fundamental way.

 I think there genuinely is a perception of a deeply seated conflict of interest in the insurance space," he said. For us, until you tackle that hard nut, until you can tell the customer &I am denying your claim but I am not going to profit by denying your claim, if you can t get to that level of dialogue then building trust becomes difficult. 

That is why Lemonade took the tough decision to become a fully regulated insurance company itself, rather than partnering with more established insurers as many start-ups in the industry have done.

To fulfil his ambitions, said Mr Schreiber, he needed total control of the whole process.

 Our vision for the transformation does run much deeper,  he said.  we re looking to make changes at the business model level at how you do underwriting, and how you assess claims and what you make money from, incentive structures, the basic policy and what kind of insurance products you can produce. 

 Our ambitions are much more expansive than just cheap and cheerful customer acquisition for an insurance company. 

Further fintech fascination

Building blocksVitalik Buterin, the Russian-Canadian creator of Ethereum, is arguably the most successful of the hundreds of copycat cryptocurrencies to have emerged in the seven years since bitcoin rose to prominence. On the damp, overcast morning earlier this year when the FT's Cloe Cornish took a Lyft car (an Uber equivalent) to his San Francisco headquarters, Ethereum s market value was some $125bn   second only to bitcoin. Buterin s particular genius was to see the potential to create a blockchain of his own that other services could build on, from payments to games. Readthe full Lunch with the FT here.

Fintech  la franaise.French phone operator Orange launched its bank just last year, but it already has 100,000 customers. Boursorama, Socit Gnrale s digital banking arm, is alsogrowing apaceas the French take a shine to online and mobile banking. Can the newcomers turn a profit?And how can the incumbents respond?

Giant Ant.Alibaba's Ant Financial could achieve avaluation of $150bnin its latest funding round, ahead of a possible IPO next year. It boasts more than half of China's $15.5tn payments market, so it is easy to see where a huge valuation might come from. Butcompetition, regulation and turmoil at the top could combine to make such a hefty figure look unrealistic.

Teething troubleRegulators are probingcomputer problemsat TSB that left account holders at the high street bank unable to check their balances and gave some customers access to other people s money after it switched to new systems over the weekend.

Fintech views in the FT banking podcast

Bits and bobs

Funding record.Funding for fintech companies reacheda new recordin the first quarter of the year, with CB Insights calculating that $5.4bn was raised, thanks partly to several $100m plusfunding rounds, reports FinExtra. US banks have been slowing their investment activity lately, just as European banks seem to be splashing the cash - Santander, for example, made three new investments in the first quarter.

TransferWise takes hold.TransferWise has taken a big step in its battle with the UK banks, becoming the first fintech group to gaindirect accessto the Bank of England's interbank payment system. The move will allow the company to process payments without going through a commercial bank, making its transfers quicker and cheaper. Chief executiveKristo Krmann said that he would be able to cut fees in response. 

Asymmetry in Africa.Kenyan fintech start-ups are taking a huge 99 per cent share of all fintech funding in east Africa, leaving companies in Uganda, Rwanda and Tanzania to fight over the rest,reports The Observer. Over $206m was raised by fintechs in the region between 2010 and 2017 but almost all of it went to Kenya, the region's largest economy.

Coverfox collects.Indian insurance price comparison site Coverfox has raised $22m from a clutch of investors including the World Bank's IFC and US insurance company Transamerica,reports TechCrunch. The money will be used to push the company's offering into rural parts of the country.

Life
The Crypto Crime Wave Is Here; From stickups and drug deals to white-collar scams, cryptocurrency-related crime is soaring and law enforcement is scrambling to keep up

On a Saturday afternoon in November, Louis Meza made plans to meet a friend and fellow cryptocurrency enthusiast for drinks at Ruby Tuesday in New York City's Times Square. "We're going to have a great time," Meza said in a text. "And by the way, I'm putting you in an Uber car at the end of the night."

A former salesman at the food-delivery service Grubhub, Meza is described by friends as gregarious and courteous a 35-year-old poker buff with an entrepreneurial streak and an appetite for risk. The two men had known each other for about 15 years. They met for drinks and, around 7:40 p.m., Meza's friend said he was heading to the subway. Meza insisted on an Uber and ushered his friend listed in court documents as "the victim" into a gray minivan waiting outside.

According to the Manhattan district attorney's office, a gunman hiding in the back seat of the van popped up and demanded the victim's wallet, keys, cellphone and a USB drive, which contained "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-cash-litecoin-ether-oh-my-whats-with-all-the-bitcoin-clones-1514037600". The victim handed over everything but the drive, which wasn't on his person; the gunman pulled a hood over the victim's head. "Where is your 24-word passphrase?" he demanded again and again.

After two hours, the victim managed to escape. He found himself in Harlem, where, according to prosecutors, he called 911 from a deli. The victim had made a "very small investment" in cryptocurrency as early as 2010 that had since mushroomed to $1.8 million. He kept the ether on a USB drive in his apartment, along with a piece of paper containing the passphrase required to access it. By the time he got home, both the drive and the passphrase were gone.

An indictment unsealed in December accuses Meza of robbery, kidnapping and other crimes. Meza pleaded not guilty. But according to prosecutors, security-camera video shows Meza unlocking the victim's apartment with keys and emerging about a minute later with a small white box, which, according to the victim, held his ether. The day after the theft, Meza transferred $1.8 million in ether to an online account in his own name. "We see the $1.8 million get deposited into that account on the morning of November 5, and then we see it being moved all over the place," Assistant District Attorney James Vinocur told the judge in the case.

Vinocur told the judge that prosecutors had been able to seize only about $600,000 of the money. "$1.2 million is still outstanding, and we don't know where it is," he said. "That is the nature of cryptocurrency, that we can see the address it was sent to. It doesn't mean much to us. It's just a string of numbers and letters."

And what seemed like an open-and-shut robbery case is proving much more complicated.

The Meza case is part of a recent spike in cryptocurrency crime, prompted by the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-bitcoin-a-year-like-no-other-1514721601"like bitcoin. Chainalysis Inc., a firm that analyzes cryptocurrency transactions, says reported thefts of bitcoin worldwide increased from $3 million in 2013 to $89 million last year.

For many criminals, cryptocurrency is less cumbersome than cash. Hackers hold computer systems hostage and demand instant, anonymous payment in bitcoin. Drug dealers sell in dark corners of the internet, obscuring their names and locations. Narcotics traffickers move and launder their profits with clicks of a mouse. "The cases have exploded," says Gabriel Bewley, a special agent in the virtual-currency initiative at the Drug Enforcement Administration.

Blockchain Intelligence Group Inc., which makes software that tracks cryptocurrency use, estimates illegal activity accounts for about 20% of the transactions of five major cryptocurrencies bitcoin, Monero, Zcash, ether and litecoin or about $600 million each day. Researchers working at the University of Sydney used artificial intelligence to identify cryptocurrency transactions consistent with criminal behavior and estimated $72 billion of illegal activity last year using bitcoin alone.

What exactly is cryptocurrency?

In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, bitcoin's anonymous creator published a white paper under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" described the major impetus behind the digital currency: Eliminate the need for third-party financial institutions like banks and brokerages. "A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash," Nakamoto wrote, "would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another."

Every bitcoin transaction would be recorded on an encrypted public ledger now known as the blockchain, preventing someone from spending the same bitcoin twice or counterfeiting the currency. And because the blockchain is stored on a decentralized network of computers, the records of these transactions would be theoretically impossible for hackers to corrupt. But removing banks from the equation poses a problem for law enforcement, which relies on financial institutions to provide records needed to secure convictions.

Bitcoin is one of about 1,500 cryptocurrencies, all of which exist in a legal and regulatory gray area. The Internal Revenue Service"https://www.wsj.com/articles/do-you-own-bitcoin-the-irs-is-coming-for-you-1521192601" not like a currency or a security but like an asset. The Securities and Exchange Commission, meanwhile, has said that initial coin offerings, or sales of new cryptocurrencies, should be subject to securities laws to protect investors from fraud. In the court system, the definition is similarly ambiguous.

A federal judge in Brooklyn is expected to rule on one issue in the coming months. The case involves a Brooklyn businessman named Maksim Zaslavskiy who, in July and September, launched initial coin offerings for two new cryptocurrencies: REcoin, purportedly backed by real estate, and Diamond Reserve Coin, supposedly backed by diamonds. Federal prosecutors charged Zaslavskiy with fraud, arguing that he sold unregistered securities. Zaslavskiy's lawyers have asked the judge to dismiss the charges, arguing that cryptocurrencies aren't securities and therefore aren't subject to securities laws. "Virtual currencies such as the ones at issue here present regulatory challenges for securities laws that were written in the 1930s decades before the invention of the computer," the lawyers, Mildred Whalen and Len Kamdang, wrote in February. Zaslavskiy's case is pending.

In 2014, Florida state prosecutors charged website designer Michell Espinoza with money laundering after he sold bitcoin to an undercover detective who said he would use the currency to buy stolen credit-card numbers. Espinoza, prosecutors argued, was acting as an unlicensed money-services business and facilitating illegal activity. The judge disagreed. "This Court isn't an expert in economics," she wrote. "However, it is very clear, even to someone with limited knowledge in the area, that bitcoin has a long way to go before it is the equivalent of money." Prosecutors have appealed the ruling.

This legal uncertainty, combined with cryptocurrencies' volatility, is complicating the prosecution of Louis Meza. The Manhattan district attorney's office asked to sell the seized ether because prosecutors feared its value would decrease, says Moshe Horn, Meza's lawyer.

"They wanted to turn it into cash so they couldn't be blamed," Horn says. "Then the question becomes, do they have a right to?"

The district attorney's office ultimately decided not to sell it. The answer to his lawyer's question is still unclear.

Digital currency's criminal history

Criminal activity has plagued digital currency since its inception. "Remember E-gold?" says Serrin Turner, a cybersecurity lawyer in New York. E-gold was the name of both a digital-currency service and a currency that was purportedly backed by actual gold. Its founder designed it as a payment system that would allow for the easy, anonymous transfer of funds. This made it popular with criminals, according to federal prosecutors, who claimed E-gold facilitated child exploitation, investment scams and other criminal activities. In 2008, E-gold's directors pleaded guilty to money-laundering charges. The service subsequently closed, but similar payment systems quickly took its place.

"This notion has been around for a long time," Turner says. "Digital currency has greased the wheels of the cybercriminal ecosystem."

Before joining the firm Latham & Watkins, Turner was a prosecutor in the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan, where he prosecuted E-gold successor Liberty Reserve, a Costa Rica-based digital-currency business that enabled anonymous payments. In 2016, Liberty Reserve founder Arthur Budovsky admitted to laundering more than $250 million in criminal proceeds and was sentenced to 20 years in prison.

Turner's best-known case, the one that put bitcoin on the map, was the prosecution of the founder of Silk Road, the first large-scale "darknet" market to use cryptocurrency. Darknet markets exist on the so-called Dark Web, a section of the internet accessible only with software designed to make users anonymous. Silk Road was an online marketplace that accepted only bitcoin as payment, allowing its vendors and customers to conceal their locations and identities. From 2011 to 2013, more than 100,000 Silk Road users bought and sold over $200 million in drugs and illegal goods, ranging from weapons to forged driver's licenses, according to prosecutors.

Authorities closed Silk Road in October 2013. Silk Road 2.0 appeared the next month and remained active for about a year before authorities shut it down. Other illicit marketplaces emerged to take its place. The July 2017 takedown of the darknet market AlphaBay involved the cooperation of law-enforcement agencies in more than seven countries. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the site had twice as many users as Silk Road, and from 2015 to 2017, transactions totaled more than $1 billion in bitcoin and other digital currencies.

Headline-grabbing arrests and seizures have done little to slow the flow of money to darknet markets. Last year, $660 million in bitcoin was sent to darknet marketplaces, up from $57 million in 2012, according to Chainalysis.

"It's kind of like Whac-A-Mole," says Greg Cipolaro, the chief executive of Digital Asset Research, a cryptocurrency-analysis firm. "Every time they close one down, another one opens."

One of the largest darknet marketplaces operating today is Dream Market, where, on a recent afternoon, Turkish heroin was advertised as "topquality!" and "Vanilla Kush weed" as "100% organic." There were weapons for sale tasers, butterfly knives, a "wallet ninja multi-tool" along with Nike tracksuits and "lifetime" porn-account subscriptions. A vendor named Bizzey advertised "5x XTC 220mg Donald Trump," for 0.004038 bitcoin, or $31.68. A photo showed orange tablets resembling children's multivitamins in the shape of Donald Trump's head. Bizzey had 4.94 stars and 36 reviews. "Amazing speed and stealth," read a five-star review. "Even got a freebie. would recommend!"

How criminals cover their tracks

In December, officers led Louis Meza into a Manhattan courtroom, where a clerk informed him that he had been charged with grand larceny, kidnapping, robbery and other crimes. The clerk asked Meza how he would like to plead.

"Not guilty," Meza said.

During the hearing, Vinocur, the assistant district attorney, said the prosecution's case was strong, citing the security-camera video and statements Meza made to police.

According to Meza's lawyer, the case will be uncommonly difficult for the prosecutors. "The burden of proof is on the prosecution to show where the cryptocurrency is, how did it get there and who put it there," Horn says. "It's not like walking into a bank vault and saying,  There's the cash.' "

The missing ether underscores a larger issue facing law enforcement: the difficulty and occasionally the impossibility of investigating and prosecuting crimes involving cryptocurrency. "Prosecutors are always about following the money," says Scott Christie, a white-collar criminal-defense lawyer at McCarter & English, who previously headed the computer-hacking division at the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey. "If you can't follow the money, you can't prove your case."

A number of firms have developed software designed to follow the flow of cryptocurrency transactions. In a financial-technology co-working space in Manhattan, Kim Grauer, a senior economist at Chainalysis, opens a software program called Reactor. "When you go into Reactor, you're going into the world of bitcoin," Grauer says. Reactor and other so-called blockchain-analysis programs visually depict the trail of cryptocurrency transactions, allowing law enforcement to see the movement of funds in a way that would be impossible with cash. But these programs have their limits. Many transactions are associated only with anonymous addresses, represented by the "string of numbers and letters" that confounded prosecutors in the Meza case.

To identify an individual associated with one of these addresses, Grauer says, an investigator would look for an "off ramp," the point where cryptocurrency is converted into fiat, or government-backed, currency. This is typically done through exchanges, websites that let users trade cryptocurrencies and convert them to traditional currency.

Exchanges are the part of the cryptocurrency ecosystem most accessible to law enforcement. If a criminal uses an exchange that collects its customers' personal information, prosecutors can attach a name to a transaction provided the exchange cooperates with authorities. But tech-savvy criminals are increasingly opening accounts with fake names at overseas exchanges that don't comply with U.S. laws.

In June, Kathryn Rodriguez, a former assistant U.S. attorney at the Justice Department in Washington, testified about cryptocurrency in front of a U.S. House of Representatives committee. Rodriguez said subpoenas are ineffective when exchanges don't require names or identifying documents to open an account. "Even though investigators can follow the funds by analyzing the blockchain, they may not be able to connect those funds to a culprit in the real world," she said. "We have received  Mickey Mouse' who resides at  123 Main Street' in subpoena returns."

Noncompliant exchanges are just one of the tools criminals use to evade authorities. "What we're seeing crooks do now is use a mixer or a tumbler," says Tom Flattery, a deputy district attorney in the high-tech unit of Santa Clara County's district attorney's office. "It's a service that will mix transactions with several others, moving through multiple accounts and multiple countries. There's no way for law enforcement to track it."

One cryptocurrency mixer, Bitcoin Blender, claims to make transactions "100% anonymous." According to the company's website, "Bitcoin Blender completely removes any connection you have with the coins you buy or sell, meaning nobody can use Blockchain Analysis to track you down." Unsurprisingly, Bitcoin Blender could not be reached for comment.

Criminals seeking additional protection have abandoned bitcoin in favor of currencies that offer additional privacy protections. Monero, a currency its website calls "secure" and "untraceable," uses technology that hides the sender, receiver and amount of transactions. Although recent research has pointed to possible security flaws, a Monero spokesman has said developers have made improvements designed to increase privacy.

Mixers and identity-shielding currencies point to a future where criminals' financial transactions could be impossible to trace. Large narcotics traffickers and money launderers are hiring increasingly sophisticated technicians to move cryptocurrencies as discreetly as possible, says Jean Walsh, chief of the investigations division at the Bronx district attorney's office, a trend she expects to continue until cryptocurrency is adequately regulated. "The amount of effort to evade being traced and tracked, both on computers and on electronic transactions it's something they spend 24 hours a day concentrating on," Walsh says. "Once the criminals continue to improve their technology, our fear is that they will be anonymous."

From the spotted bronze pumpkin in the valet court to the light sculpture above the marble concierge desk, few expenses have been spared at Sky Residences. Residents of the glistening 71-storey tower in Manhattan s Hell s Kitchen have access to a basketball court, a private art collection and a billiards lounge. The luxury lifestyle does not come cheap: one-bedroom apartments are on the rental marketfor as much as $6,500 a month.

High-earning New York professionals who live in the buildingtake the rents in their stride, though they may be surprised to discover who financed it.

Last summer,Freddie Mac, the home loans guarantor propped up by US taxpayers a decade ago after the subprime housing crisis, backeda $550m loan to the building s owners   Moinian Group, among New York s largest private landlords, andSL Green Realty, an S&P 500-listed real estate investment trust.

It was the latest in a series of dealsto support top-end commercial property developments byFreddie Mac and its counterpartFannie Mae, the twin pillars ofUS mortgage finance.

For critics, it is projects such as Sky Residences that highlight questionsover whatrole the two institutions should be playing in the housing market   10 years after theproperty bubble and subsequent financial crisis they were accused of helping to create.

Established to make mortgages more affordable and expand US home ownership  Fannie during the Great Depression and Freddie in 1970   theTreasury propped them up with about $188bn in bailout funds after the housing market meltdown. WhileFannie and Freddie have private shareholders, they sendmost of their profits to the Treasury.

Since then, far from being reined in as critics demanded in the aftermath of the crisis, the two  government-sponsored enterprises  remain as important as ever; even more so for commercial real estate markets.

Fannie and Freddie are best known for their principal role as the leading source of financing for owner-occupied mortgages. But for decades, they have played another role in supporting the market for rental housing, by helping finance property companies that acquire or refinance investments in apartment blocks. This second, lower-profile, part of their business has boomed since the crisis.

By the end of last year the pair had a financial interest in almost $500bn of commercial mortgages, equivalent to 38 per cent of the total outstanding across the US. That compares with almost $200bn, or 25 per cent of the market,a decade ago. Last year alone, the pair financed almost 1.6m rental units.

The expansion has raised eyebrows in the industry. Competitors that provide this type of finance   banks, life insurance companies and other institutional investors  say the taxpayer s backing allows Fannie and Freddie to offer borrowers better terms than they can.

Sam Chandan, real estate economist at New York University, says there is evidence that the government guarantees were crowding out some private sector capital.

 They play a critically important role in the underserved, affordable segment,  he says.  But do they compete in the segments of the market where we see robust competition? I think those are legitimate concerns. 

In keeping with their mission to support  workforce  housing, most of the apartments that Fannie and Freddie finance are designed to be affordable to tenants on low and moderate incomes.

A quarter of the almost 1,200 units at Sky were set aside for such households, who competed for tenancy in a lottery. Overall, more than four in five of the units that Fannie and Freddie funded last year had rents that cost less than 30 per cent of the local area s median monthly income, a widely used measure of affordability.

Fannie and Freddie do not lend directly to apartment investors. Instead, theyshoulder financial risks on loans that are underwritten by commercial mortgage companies.In a process known as securitisation, the agencies buy the loans, package them up and sell them on to investors. If borrowers default, Fannie and Freddie potentially have to cover big chunks of the losses.

For critics, their involvement in commercial real estate means that just as US taxpayers back individual homeowners through Fannie and Freddie mortgages, so they also subsidise some of the largest investment groups in the world.

Blackstone Group,Starwood Capital, the Canadian pension fund manager Caisse de dpt et placement du Qubec and Singapore s sovereign wealth fundGIC are among the biggest borrowers on GSE commercial loans, according to Real Capital Analytics.

The investors pay cheaper rates because of the federal insurance afforded by Fannie and Freddie, says Jim Costello, senior vice-president at Real Capital Analytics. Mortgages on rental apartments are on average about a tenth less expensive than those for other types of commercial real estate, such as offices and shopping malls.

How much of the lower funding costs provided by Fannie and Freddie trickle down to residents   and how much is captured by the property owner   is open to question.  With owner-occupied homes, the subsidy is direct,  says Prof Chandan.  On the multi-family side [large apartment complexes], it s less clear how you provide subsidy for the renter. 

Although they remain a small part of the total, the proportion of more expensive apartments financed by the pair has risen over the past decade. Last year, almost one in five units in which Fannie acquired a financial interest had rents that cost more than 30 per cent of the area s median income. In 2006, little more than one in 10 were so expensive.

Other apartment complexes supported by the pair charge even higher rents than Sky. Among the New York properties that Fannie Mae has helped financeis 456 Washington Street, which overlooks the Hudson River in Lower Manhattan. The building is owned byRelated Companies, founded by Stephen Ross, the billionaire and Miami Dolphins American football team owner. About 20 of the 107 units were reserved for low-income households. The rest were let at market rates   several for more than $30,000 a month, according to listings website StreetEasy.

A brief history of Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac

For decades, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have helped Americans secure cheaper mortgages. They buy the loans from lenders then either hold them or sell them on to investors in financial markets   making good on payments if the borrower defaults. The system was credited with enlarging the pool of homeowners but came unstuck in the 2008 housing slump

Fannie and Freddie finance such developments in part because they are one of the main ways cheaper properties are made available in expensive markets. To help deal with a shortage of affordable housing, policymakers in urban centres including New York give developers tax breaks if they reserve some units for lower-income residents.

 It s not because we re trying to do more high end or more expensive properties,  says Manuel Menendez, Fannie Mae s multi-family chief credit officer.

The group also needs to  balance  affordable units with apartments that generate higher returns to ensure  prudent credit risk management , adding:  From time to time there will be certain assets that you might consider to be higher end. 

During the financial crisis, Mr Menendez says, the agencies were a crucial source of funding for multi-family housing when commercial lenders retreated.

Supporters say the pair have also helped stave off an affordable housing crisis, especially as a new generation of renters has been locked out of the post-crisis recovery.  If they didn t exist, there would be a major problem for multi-family housing,  says Shekar Narasimhan, managing partner at the real estate group Beekman Advisors, who was the first chair of Fannie Mae s advisory committee on this type of housing.

Shortly before she stepped down as chair of the Federal Reserve this year, Janet Yellen sounded the alarm about US commercial property. High valuations, she said, were  a source of some concern , adding that  prices are quite high relative to rents .

It was the latest warning about a frothy market. In its 2017 annual report the Financial Stability Oversight Council, chaired by Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin, pointed to concerns over  inappropriate risk pricing  in the asset class. Price rises for rental apartment properties had outpaced other parts of commercial real estate, it noted.

Neither Ms Yellen nor the FSOC mentioned the role played in the sector by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.The two groups do not fund construction, although they do finance purchases or refinancings by investors once the buildings are completed.

For critics, the pair have played a central role in financing the boom. Developers have completed about 1.3m rental units in the US over the past five years, according to RealPage data, including a record 365,000 in 2017.

 Apartment developers and investors have overdone it in a very big way   fuelled by Fannie and Freddie,  says Douglas French, a real estate consultant who advises building companies in Nevada.  We re definitely seeing it in Las Vegas. This apartment market is extremely hot. 

Demand has risen in part because millennials have put off starting families, making them more likely to rent downtown than settle in the suburbs. Still, there are signs of a supply glut in popular markets. Landlords in some parts of New York are offering one or two months rent-free on high-end properties.

 Aggressive lending practices by the GSEs this cycle have been an important factor in the degree of over-investment and over-valuation of multi-family properties in certain key markets,  says Michael Shaoul, chief executive of Marketfield Asset Management.

 I do not think that the GSEs have been as critical in commercial real estate as they were in traditional mortgages a decade ago   but they have perhaps allowed some of the more marginal projects to minimise equity capital this time around. 

David Brickman, head of multi-family at Freddie Mac, says:  I firmly reject the notion that we are contributing to a bubble. The growth we ve seen is largely fuelled by strong demand drivers and healthy fundamentals. Even though we have supply growing, we are still not producing enough affordable housing. 

Fannie and Freddie s difficulties in 2008 were caused not by rental properties but owner-occupier mortgages, in which their interests are far bigger.

Apartment default rates remain low. Yet if losses do rise, taxpayers should have some protection. Fannie and Freddie share chunks of the risks they take on with the private sector: in a typical Freddie Mac rental transaction, for instance, known as a  K-Deal , private investors would have to pick up the first 20 per cent of losses.

Instead of limits on each deal, the GSEs  commercial real estate businesses are subjected to overall limits imposed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. The restrictions are a sign that policymakers recognise the risk that the taxpayer guarantee could crowd out private capital from the market, and the cap for each agency is tightening this year from $36.5bn in 2017 to $35bn.

Several types of properties are exempt from the FHFA s cap, however. Last year more than half the rental apartment debt that Fannie and Freddie took on   54 per cent, or $75bn   was not subject to the restriction.

The complex set of restrictions make it look like Fannie and Freddie could  game  the system, says Mr Narasimhan.  I don t think that s what going on, but you can get that perception,  he says.  Are they doing a good job in making sure they serve affordable housing in underserved markets? Yes. Should they be given a different set of rules?Yes. 

Status still in limbo

A decade since Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac s multibillion-dollar losses prompted the Treasury to seize control, Washington is still ruminating over what to do with the pair. With a combined $5.4tn in assets, their status is the biggest piece of unfinished business from the crisis.

Neither fully public nor private, Fannie and Freddie pay most of their profits to the Treasury to compensate taxpayers for the risk they bear in providing a financial backstop. Investors who own the shares claim the arrangement is unfair and untenable, and several have taken legal action against the government.

Steven Mnuchin, Treasury secretary, has repeatedly said that a shake-up is on the Trump administration s agenda. Some lawmakers in Congress have also drawn up proposals to inject more competition into the market.

But reform has yet to be delivered.  There s no appetite to take it up,  says Beekman Advisors  Shekar Narasimhan.  It s pretty much a dead duck at this point. 

For all their ideological misgivings about the central role of the government, Republicans know the agencies provide relief to millions of voters. The taxpayer s support of Fannie and Freddie underpins the unique US system of fixed 30-year mortgages, which allows homeowners to pay back home loans over decades without worrying about interest rates.

 The dirty little secret is that the GSEs largely work,  says Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at Washington-based Compass Point Research. The Treasury has more than recouped what it spent on bailing them out 10 years ago.

Another crisis could spur action, Mr Narasimhan adds. But for now, they are making money that goes into the public coffers.  Who looks free money in the face and thinks that s not a good thing?

Tech
Why Amazon and Google Haven't Attacked Banks; Banks' move to cloud computing makes them attractive clients to tech giants

Technology giants and big banks have been warily circling each other, especially in the payments arena. So far, they are more frenemies than rivals.

The reason: Banks are rapidly emerging as big potential customers for the fast-growing, cloud-computing businesses of Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Microsoft Corp. That is making technology companies think twice about alienating them by becoming direct competitors.

"We are very intentionally approaching banking customers with an opportunity to empower them rather than to be in their space," said Judson Althoff, executive vice president of world-wide commercial business at Microsoft. "Banks see other cloud providers investing in mobile payment capabilities, and there is a concern about disintermediation."

With consumers increasingly turning to their mobile devices for money transfers and financial advice, some analysts have predicted that tech companies will supplant traditional banks as providers of many banking services.

But the dynamic emerging is not so straightforward. The biggest banks, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and UBS Group AG, are themselves investing billions of dollars in new technology and, for the first time, starting to use public cloud-computing platforms, in which computing power and storage are purchased over the web.

The leading providers of those fast and sophisticated shared computing services include Amazon's AWS, Alphabet's Google Cloud and Microsoft's Azure.

For years, banks had resisted moving sensitive data or processes to the cloud, citing the security concerns of allowing data outside of their leased or owned data centers. Financial firms also had already invested billions into their own internal data platforms, including so-called private clouds.

But recently, momentum shifted after regulators began using the cloud for data storage and reporting, including the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which works with Amazon's AWS. That has led many banks to start doing the same.

Moving from traditional mainframes to the cloud also makes it easier for banks to use artificial intelligence and other new technologies that consume huge computing resources. This is used to create better mobile products and trading tools.

"The ability of the banks to get out from under their legacy cost pile is limited," said Jason Gurandiano, head of financial technology banking at RBC Capital Markets. "So banks moving to the cloud gives them leverage with the tech providers."

Cloud spending by banks is expected to skyrocket. By 2021, banks globally are forecast to spend more than $12 billion on public cloud infrastructure and data services, up from $4 billion last year, according to market research firm International Data Corp.'s public cloud spending guide.

By many metrics, the cloud business offers better opportunities to tech firms than, say, retail banking. Overall cloud-industry revenues are growing at about 60% year-over-year, Jefferies estimates. Meanwhile, retail-banking revenue, comprising products such as checking accounts and cards, at most big banks is growing at a fraction of that rate. And any real foray into banking or financial products could also entail substantial regulatory issues and expense.

"Tech companies are going to get far more consistent and repeatable revenue being infrastructure providers than by being in banking," said Ami Grewal, head of digital strategy at GFT Group, an engineering services firm that works with banks and partners tech firms including Amazon and Google.

A handful of banks, such as Capital One Financial Corp., are already significant cloud customers. Capital One began working with Amazon in 2013, and made AWS its predominant cloud provider in 2016.The bank's deal has incentives for it to spend at least $150 million a year on the service, people familiar with the agreement said. A spokesman for the bank declined to comment.

The upshot is that while big tech firms continue to dabble in banking services, they tend to do so almost entirely through banking partners.

For example, Amazon, Google and Microsoft offer digital wallets that allow users to link their bank-issued credit and debit cards. Citigroup Inc. enables its credit-card customers to pay for goods at Amazon using credit-card rewards points.

Amazon's AWS, says working with banks is a top priority. Frank Fallon, vice president for global financial services at AWS, told the Journal that "interest has grown exponentially over the last few years" in cloud services in the financial-services industry. Rather than competing with banks, he said AWS was instead focused on making sure it was offering the best security, performance, and function. AWS's team "keep financial services customers at the core of everything we do," he said.

Tariq Shaukat, president for global alliances and industry platforms at Google Cloud, said Google begins meetings with banks by assuring them they aren't interested in gathering banking data for its own sake.

"We see ourselves as an enabler and platform for many of those institutions, as opposed to in any way trying to compete with them in their core businesses," he said. "We start cloud conversations with an ironclad rule: A customer's data is a customer's data."

Microsoft said last year it had partnered with Bank of America Corp. to work on public-cloud applications for the bank. As recently as 2016, top Bank of America executives said they didn't see a way to use the public cloud, due to security risks.

Cathy Bessant, the bank's chief operations and technology officer, said the lender was still only spending a small part of its $3 billion annual computing infrastructure budget on public cloud. The bank now plans to increase that, following a rapid improvement in security technology, and with a variety of partners.

Ms. Bessant added that the firm takes into consideration the possibility of tech partners someday seeking to compete with banks, in part by learning from banks' own data. "We're not naive to that potential," she said. "We're sensitive to making sure that...we work with infrastructure providers that are like-minded and have our best interests at heart."

Davis's Take: Fighting VC Bias With Data; A nonprofit offers founders a data-driven ratings system to win that elusive first check from venture investors

What will it take for women-led startups to get more of the $80 billion that venture capitalists invest each year?

If women and other minority entrepreneurs have trouble raising their first round of venture capital because of investor bias, an obvious question is whether that bias can be removed from the equation.

June Manley says it can, and her nonprofit called F4 Capital aims to help venture capitalists to evaluate funding startups based on data analytics, instead of whether a founder matches the investor's notion of an ideal entrepreneur.

"If you look at the way VCs talk about how they invest in a startup, they talk about the team but that usually means a single white male founder," said Ms. Manley, a Silicon Valley tech veteran.

F4 Capital is offering investors and founders a ratings system that she says takes the bias out of pitches and keeps VCs focused on cold, hard facts about the startup, regardless of the gender of the founder and team. To come up with ratings, F4 (it stands for Female Founders Faster Forward) created a scoring methodology that puts startups through a self-assessment exercise that measures their company in eight categories (such as stage of maturity, market opportunity and risk).

Ms. Manley, who likens the rating to FICO scores of creditworthiness, said F4's scoring index uses baseline data culled from a mix of almost 800 founders and investors. She's targeting the scoring index, which is free of charge to both sides, at seed and other early-stage investors.

Her goal is ambitious to say the least to increase female founders' share of venture dollars to 20% by 2020, vs. around 2% today. And her motivation is partly personal because of her own startup's failures in fundraising.

"I was measured me as a female, as a founder," she said. "My startup never got a chance objectively.''

 Artificial intelligence  research boosted by 300m of public money

The UK government will invest 300m in artificial intelligence research as it seeks to fend off competition from France and Germany and secure its status as Europe s leading centre for  deep tech .

The new AI sector deal, announced on Thursday, follows last year s publication of a government review of the UK s artificial intelligence industry. The review found that only 5 per cent of international venture capital funding in the sector went to British companies in the five years to 2016.

The government will hope to stimulate private companies with the new investment programme, which will be directed through its publicly-funded Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council .

The investments will be overseen by the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport and the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy , which declined to specify a timeline for when the funding would be released.

"Artificial intelligence is at the centre of our plans to make the UK the best place in the world to start and grow a digital business,  said Matt Hancock, culture secretary.  We have a great track record 	. 	. 	. 	but there is so much more we can do. 

Britain has long sought to position itself as a leader in cutting-edge data science and artificial intelligence research, as the home of well-known businesses, including Deepmind, which was bought by Google for 400m in 2014.

However, concerns have been raised that Brexit could upend London s status as a hub for technology start-ups and entrepreneurship, especially after a reduction in funding from the European Investment Bank .

The AI sector deal announced on Thursday includes plans to establish a new 9m centre for data ethics and innovation to examine the possible structural changes to jobs, data privacy and safety that could result from the new technology.

 As with all innovation there is also the potential for misuse which puts the whole sector under scrutiny and undermines public confidence,  said Greg Clark , business secretary.

Private companies and universities also committed on Thursday to investing in AI.

Rolls-Royce has partnered with the Alan Turing Institute to explore how data science can be applied to supply chains and predictive maintenance, while Global Brain, a Japanese venture capital group, will open its first European headquarters in the UK, with plans to invest 35m in  deep tech  start-ups.

The University of Cambridge said it would open a new 10m supercomputer to boost AI research, adding to the UK s current stock of 15, according to a list compiled by Top500, a group that maps computing power around the world.

Britain s lack of supercomputers, which can support the faster processing speeds required to crunch vast amounts of data, is seen as a key factor hindering AI businesses.

Earlier this month, British chip designer Arm Holdings said it would team up with HPE, the US enterprise computing group, and SUSE, the German software company, to build three new supercomputers in the UK.

FUD, inglorious FUD

IOTA, an internet-of-things-focused cryptocurrency designed to allow machines to send data and micropayments between each other, has the backing of some big industrial companies and a $6bn valuation - more than Slack, the SoftBank-backed workplace messaging app with 6 million users.

It also has a buzzy investor following. Veteran Wall Street analyst and hedge fund manager, James Waggoner, wrote a post on Hacked.com last week explaining why it should be on investors'  focus lists . It's a  techno triple play  on three of the biggest trends going, he enthused: cryptocurrencies, the internet of things, and artificial intelligence.

Yet IOTA also highlights something else, a factor not unique to the crypto boom but one which highlights the tensions between tech utopianism and the big money at stake. An open and collaborative approach to developing standards, software and security protocols can be hard to sustain in a gold rush.

A tangled web

IOTA is one of a new wave of cryptocurrencies that aren't actually underpinned by a blockchain. (We'll explore the rise of postblockchainism in future posts.)

Instead, it is underpinned by what techy types call a   directed acyclic graph  or DAG, which IOTA calls the  tangle . It says the tangle can solve the problems of scalability and high transaction fees suffered by bitcoin and other cryptos because rather than using a network of miners to process transactions, they are processed by those involved in the transactions.

Here's an illustration of the tangle, from IOTA's white paper:

The promise of a decentralised cryptocurrency that can enable machines to send data and micropayments to each other has pulled in a lot of hype and investment, including from Bosch. The 132-year-old German engineering and electronics firm in December became the first major company to buy crypto tokens, via RobertBoschVenture Capital, which it said had bought a   significant amount  of IOTA.

Security is numero uno

But it turns out that IOTA, for the time being anyway, is not decentralised (remind you of anything?). IOTA says that's because it's in a  transition period , and that until it become deployed on a large scale, it needs a  Coordinator  to protect against attacks on the IOTA network.

If it's not decentralised, and therefore not censorship-resistant, IOTA's USP becomes a little less clear. To quote one developer who wanted to stay anonymous, If I don't have to build a decentralized system, I can build much faster, better schemes than IOTA. It's like a plane that travels on land. You really shouldn't design it with wings. It only goes on land. A car body would be far better in every conceivable way.

IOTA founder David Sonstebo told us the following:IOTAitself is decentralised, however, due to the fact that it's built for real-life applications in large-scale deployments it needs to reach a critical mass before it's 100% safe against attacks, therefore there is a Coordination node that you can voluntarily follow instructions from for security purposes. The people that think this is a problem simply know nothing about development. It is safety wheels, would you put a toddler on a bike without a helmet and kneepads? Hopefully not, likewise with cutting-edge tech. For us security is numero uno, and we didn't createIOTAfor some opaque fringe ideological reason, we made it for the real world, thus we follow the sane and iterative development and deployment.

OK, so security is numero uno for IOTA. That makes sense.

Thing is, a whole lot of people don't think much of IOTA's security, either.

In September, a group of researchers from MIT's Digital Currency Initiative (DCI) published a post on online platform Medium saying they had found a  cryptographic vulnerability  in IOTA's hash function, which IOTA calls  Curl , which had enabled them to forge signatures on IOTA payments.

(The hash function is a mathematical process that all cryptocurrencies rely on, which takes a bunch of data of any size and spits out output data of a fixed size - the so-called hash. The one bitcoin uses was designed by the U.S. Government - the NSA to be precise - and hash functions are generally considered very difficult to get right, so the researchers had suspected IOTA's hash function might not be bulletproof before undertaking their research.)

Such forgery, the team said, could be used by a bad actor to steal funds.

IOTA, which has since fixed the flaw, denies that, saying the Coordinator would have prevented the forgery. (Turns out centralised authorities are quite effective for security!) It says there's a conflict of interest in the research because of the work of one of the lead researchers, Ethan Heilman, on other DAG protocols, and the DCI's association with bitcoin core developers.

But it also says it wrote the flaw into the code deliberately, to protect investors. Some might think that sounds a bit far-fetched; others - including Ethereum's prodigy creator Vitalik Buterin - think writing malicious code into open-source protocols goes against the open-source spirit somewhat.

Here's how Sonstebo put it to us:This is anenvironment where a lot of scammers copypaste code and create nonsense ICOs that effectively lead to the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars for people, keeping this in mind we decided that we'd do what we could to prevent anyone from exploitingIOTAto exploit others, thus temporary copy protection.

Thin skin in the game

IOTA talks a lot about FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt), a term adopted by the crypto community to refer to critical commentary. The acronym might also reasonably be applied to its own approach to dealing with critics.

For instance, here's Sergei Ivancheglo, an IOTA founder who uses the Twitter handle Come-from-Beyond, on Mr Heilman's work:

Asked about the tweet, Mr Sonstebo said neither he or theIOTAFoundation has ever threatened any legal action against researchers. He said for Mr Ivancheglo it was a matter of reputation, and   Sergey felt he had no choice but to seek legal counsel. This never had anything to do withIOTA, it was a personal dispute between two people. 

Mr Sonstebo also said IOTA had been  the target of a smear campaign  and that a series of leaked emails between the DCI researchers and IOTA corroborated their side of the story.

One of those, email #76, was from Mr Sonstebo to Neha Nerula, the author of the Medium post and one of the DCI researchers. It said:We will use all resources to elucidate this as publicly as possible if Ethan does not effective immediately contact all the people he has been spreading this premature story to and retract all his statements.

Mr Sonstebo didn't respond to a question on what  all resources  meant.

When Amy Castor, a freelance contributor to Forbes, wrote this piece on the MIT findings, the reaction inside IOTA was not a happy one, according to this guy on Twitter. He posted what appears to be a screenshot of an edited Slack conversation featuring Dominik Schiener, another IOTA co-founder:

Mr Schiener responded to the original unedited version, which was then shared by Castor, with the following:

There is also swearing at other journalists on Twitter, and   blacklisting  news sites that publish critical articles.

IOTA's  troll army  - which is how its team of online disciples is often referred to as - have scared off some people enough for them not to want to speak out. Two people we asked to speak to for this story told us they didn't want to because they were worried about the consequences of doing so. One was worried about being threatened with physical harm.

Tim Swanson, founder of tech consultancy Post Oak Labs and a leading authority in the space, told us he undid a retweet of a story that was mildly critical of IOTA because he felt intimidated by Skype messages from a senior person from theIOTA team that were sent after sharing the article.*

Swanson is concerned that these kinds of incidents could provide a chilling effect, discouraging other researchers from doing the important work of testing the network before investors put their money into it:Ignoring for the moment any of the technical problems that independent researchers may have highlighted about the cryptography or the platform itself, it s the reaction to any kind of critical feedback that is a concern.

Once you start threatening independent research teams that do vetting and verification...you re not just creating ill will, but you re actually creating an environment in which security researchers no longer feel safe to provide independent verification of claims which benefit society as a whole.

If the ethos of the distributed ledger world is to be open and transparent, and to be inclusive of different ideas... then suing people because they think they found some problem just seems like the antithesis of what this is about.I m not all about the philosophy of distributed ledger technology; I just think this is ironic.

Did we mention this project is apparently valued at $6bn?

*Update: we have edited this to show it was Skype messages, not an email, that were sent to Mr Swanson.

Aon chief warns that insurance industry is losing its relevance

The insurance industry is losing its relevance by failing to address its clients  changing needs, according to chief executive of insurance broker Aon.

Speaking to the Financial Times, Greg Case said that the industry had not innovated enough, and so had not kept pace with client demands.

Cyber insurance is one example.  The industry has $3bn of premium written in cyber at a time when clients in the US have $450bn in reported loss. That s not response, that s not relevant. 

He pointed out that property and casualty insurance losses as a proportion of US gross domestic product have almost halved since the 1980s, to 1.8 per cent.  If I ask you, how is the risk industry doing in terms of relevance to the global economy, you have to say, we re becoming less relevant. 

Mr Case was speaking after announcing that he has extended his contract with Aon, the world s second-largest insurance broker by market capitalisation, for another three years. He is now due to leave in 2023, by which time he will have held the job for 18 years.

Christa Davies, Aon chief financial officer, has also extended her contract until 2023.

Mr Case said that one of his main priorities was to change Aon so that it focuses more on broad risks to clients  strategies, and less on selling individual insurance products that address specific risks.

He said that the insurance industry had focused on selling products for too long, with the result that there had been little innovation.

 CEOs want us to be able to respond to a broader definition of risk 	. 	. 	. 	across their business, operating performance and balance sheet strength 	. 	. 	. 	even across pension and retirement or healthcare,  he added.

Aon will try to fulfil that demand by providing more data and analytics services. He said that the insurance industry as a whole has failed to turn all its data into usable ideas.

The changes could have an impact on Aon s business model. Insurance brokers have historically generated income from commissions on policies sold, but Mr Case expects the company s revenue mix to  evolve over time .

 Traditional insurance broking will always be part of what we do,  he said, adding:  As we create value and get recognised for the value we create on behalf of clients we re quite comfortable that we ll be compensated fairly. 

Mr Case said that Aon could invest $10bn in the business over the next five years as he builds up data and analytics, or  content , capabilities.

In 2016 the company bought Stroz Friedberg, a cyber security specialist, to boost its ability to help clients facing cyber attacks.

 They brought a massive database,  he explained.  [A] 50,000 incident database on what s happened in cyber. 

Mr Case also defended one of the most controversial recent developments in insurance broking   so-called facilities where brokers bundle up demand from a large number of clients, and take it en masse to insurers, rather than shopping around for each individual policy.

The UK s Financial Conduct Authority is looking at facilities as part of a wider study of wholesale insurance broking. It is particularly interested in whether the facilities give clients the best possible coverage.

Mr Case said that Aon s facility, called Aon Client Treaty, was a good example of how it has used data to analyse and aggregate client demand, creating a better overall product.

 Aon client treaty has been an absolute home run. We have clients every day taking part. 

On the growing regulatory interest in his industry, he said:  We all have the same vision which is making sure clients have full transparency and full choice and are getting a set of solutions that are responding to their needs.

GE and Wells Fargo face shareholder calls to end KPMG audits

Support services

KPMG faces the prospect of rebellions this week from shareholders in two of its oldest and highest-profile clients, Wells Fargo and General Electric, over its audits of the beleaguered groups.

The titans of US industry and banking are facing calls to end their audit relationships with KPMG. Firms that are now part of KPMG have audited Wells since 1931 and GE since 1909, and last year it collected almost $200m in fees from the two.

KPMG's role has come under the spotlight at Wells and GE, both of which have been laid low by mishaps.

Fake accounts and other scandals at Wells, run by chief executive Tim Sloan, have cost the California-based company its status as the world's most valuable bank. GE shares have lost half their value in the past year over financial difficulties, including a need to prop up reserves over unexpected insurance liabilities. Both are under investigation by regulators.

Glass Lewis, the shareholder advisory service, has recommended that investors in Wells vote against retaining KPMG as auditor. At GE, both Glass Lewis and ISS, another adviser, have called for a vote to replace it.

GE shareholders should reject the reappointment of KPMG "in light of several ongoing concerns" including Securities and Exchange Commission investigations and the firm's "extremely long tenure", Glass Lewis argued.

Of KPMG's relationship with Wells, Glass Lewis said: "While cognisant that an auditor is not expected to inspect every instance of potential fraud at a company, we believe that this unique case warrants additional scrutiny."

Shareholders in US companies, whose votes are not binding, rarely rebel over audit contracts. Support levels were higher than 90 per cent at all but four of the past 1,500 meetings at S&P 500 companies, according to ISS Analytics.

Yet the influence of ISS and Glass Lewis makes such a revolt a possibility at Wells and GE this week. KPMG declined to comment.

Protests by bank workers and consumer activists were expected at Wells' annual meeting in Des Moines, Iowa, yesterday. The gathering comes a year after a fiery meeting in Florida, when shareholders cast almost half their votes against the re-election of some of the bank's directors.

KPMG's role may come under further scrutiny at GE's annual meeting in Imperial, Pennsylvania, today.

The meeting will be the first since the company revealed in January that it was under investigation by the SEC over reported revenues from long-term service contracts, and liabilities from insurance operations it offloaded in 2006. GE's board said it had chosen to stick with KPMG for a 110th year in 2018, after a "rigorous review". Having a longtenured auditor with deep institutional knowledge and expertise "keeps costs competitive", and saves management time and resources by avoiding the need to help bring a new team up to speed. It added that KPMG had a process for maintaining independence, with the lead audit engagement partner rotating every five years.

WorldQuant aims to raise more than $1bn with its first fund open to outside investors

Equities

WorldQuant, the computer-powered hedge fund that manages about $5bn on behalf of Izzy Englander's Millennium Management, is launching its first fund open to outside investors.

The quantitative investment firm is in talks with investors and expects to raise more than $1bn over the next few months for a fund that will invest in global stock markets and aim to outperform its benchmark by 3 to 6 percentage points annually, according to people familiar with the matter.

WorldQuant was set up in 2007 by Igor Tulchinsky, a Belarusian computer engineer who previously worked at Millennium, one of the biggest "multistrategy" hedge funds on Wall Street. As part of the spin-off from Millennium, WorldQuant agreed to only manage money on behalf of Mr Englander's firm, which has meant it has often flown under the radar while other algorithmic money managers have basked in the attention and investor inflows enjoyed by the broader industry in recent years.

But the quantitative money manager in 2015 set up a joint venture with Millennium that would allow it to set up new vehicles for outside investors, and the fund now being marketed is the first one under that structure. WorldQuant will manage the money, while Millennium will contribute the backing infrastructure, according to people close to the situation. WorldQuant and Millennium declined to comment.

The hedge fund employs 650 people in 26 offices in 15 countries, of which 120 have PhDs. Since it has so far only managed funds for Millennium its performance has never been reported publicly, but WorldQuant is expected quickly to raise more than $1bn for its debut fund.

Quantitative asset managers have suffered a setback this year, with many strategies and managers rattled by the turbulence of financial markets in February. Quant equity hedge funds lost 0.1 per cent in the first quarter, while quantitative "macro" funds   which invest in a broader array of markets   dropped 2.7 per cent, said HFR, a data provider.

Nonetheless, investors are expected to continue to allocate money to the industry, given the optimism that "quants" are better equipped to use artificial intelligence to sift through reams of digital data for profitable signals. As a result, only 4.3 per cent of clients polled by JPMorgan at an investment conference in March said they had no plans to use AI and "big data" in their process.

Moreover, the funds worst affected by the recent turmoil have been "trend followers" that surf the momentum of markets   which reversed sharply in early February   while WorldQuant's new vehicle will be a "170-70" fund.

This involves using leverage to juice up its market exposure to 170 per cent on the "long" side, and 70 per cent on the "short" side, so it has a net long bias, as opposed to more common hedge fund structures that aim to be "market neutral" or offer "absolute" returns in any market environment.

It will also have a longer typical holding period, aiming to stay invested in stocks for more than a year.

In Shift, Pimco to Lean Less On Humans, More on Robots

Corrections & Amplifications

Pacific Investment Management Co.'s name was incorrectly given as Pacific Investment Co. in a Page One article Wednesday about Pimco.

(WSJ April 28, 2018)

(END)

Bond titan Pimco -- which once relied heavily on one man to make many of its key investment decisions -- is betting a big part of its future on millions of lines of software code.

Pacific Investment Co. will open an office in Austin, Texas, this year to help recruit more tech-savvy workers who might otherwise spurn the bond manager for traditional software companies, people familiar with the matter said. The Newport Beach, Calif.-based firm plans to increase its work force by 10% this year, adding about 250 staff.

Many of those new employees will be engineers tasked with modernizing Pimco's technology systems, from the tools used to harness new databases of information to the platforms that trade bonds electronically. The changes aim to sharpen investment ideas and lower costs.

The new investments mark the next phase of a strategy set in motion three years ago, when co-founder Bill Gross's bitter departure wrenched the firm from its overdependence on a single bond manager. Investment chief Daniel Ivascyn and former hedge-fund firm executive Emmanuel Roman have since stemmed the flow of client money from Pimco's core bond funds and are looking to stay ahead of the relentless growth of exchange-traded funds and other low-cost passive investments.

Net inflows into passively managed bond funds have outpaced their active counterparts for the past five years, according to Morningstar Direct. Active bond mutual funds still hold an edge in total assets, but ETFs and other funds that track bond indexes are gaining ground.

Pimco's mutual funds had $33 billion in net inflows in 2017, reversing a four-year stretch of client withdrawals, Morningstar said. While Pimco, a unit of Germany's Allianz SE, remains one of the world's biggest investors, with about $1.7 trillion in assets, the firm still manages less than the roughly $2 trillion it oversaw at the height of the Gross era.

Mr. Roman, Pimco's chief executive, is placing his bets on computer-driven and private-debt investing -- investing in loans and other debt securities that aren't traded publicly. He believes those areas offer promise without veering outside the firm's traditional focus on the debt markets.

"Our strategy remains the same: to be the premier fixed-income manager in the world," Mr. Roman said in an interview. "But to do this we need to invest."

Mr. Roman's plan isn't without risk. While most of Pimco's core bond funds are performing well, a slump could lead to questions about whether it should stick to its knitting, clients and consultants have said.

The company plans to launch a slate of investment funds driven by trading algorithms -- mathematical formulas used to buy or sell securities rapidly based on preset commands -- he said, but many other initiatives are designed to give Pimco's traditional portfolio managers an edge in finding profitable trading ideas or lowering costs.

Mr. Roman said Pimco plans to expand its current portfolio-management analytics team. Led by Ravi Mattu, who joined the firm in 2011, the group currently employs about 65.

"We're turning up the volume, so to speak," the CEO said.

Pimco plans to build out its capabilities in trading bonds and other securities electronically, in a bid to reduce execution costs.

The firm is also on the lookout for new databases its managers can tap to help form investment ideas and plans to add new analytical tools. Mr. Roman said he expects to form at least one partnership with an outside technology company.

One area of focus: predicting inflation. The firm aims to add consumer data that will help managers make faster and more-accurate forecasts on the consumer-price index, a benchmark that informs investment decisions on most debt securities, Mr. Roman said.

Finally, Pimco is also exploring partnerships with research universities to study how asset managers can apply machine-learning techniques that have worked in other industries, including retailers, Mr. Roman said.

Mr. Roman unveiled plans to add another U.S. office in a Feb. 26 memorandum to staff. In that memo, previously reported by Bloomberg News, Mr. Roman listed three cities as contenders: Austin, Dallas and Denver.

Pimco negotiated with officials from the three cities before choosing Austin earlier this month.

The Texas city is close to a number of institutional investors, including some Pimco clients, boasts a technology corridor and is home to the University of Texas. "That is a key factor as we look to build up the office to about 200 employees by the end of 2019," Mr. Roman wrote in a memo sent Monday to employees.

Patrick Feigley, head of U.S. sales at Pimco's wealth-management business, will run the new office, according to the memo.

Mr. Roman is also leading Pimco's push into private credit, real estate and other alternative investments, a direction many clients predicted he would take given his experience with hedge-fund firms.

Mr. Roman worked for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for 18 years before joining GLG Partners. He spearheaded GLG's sale to Man Group PLC, which he ran before joining Pimco.

Hundreds of billions of dollars in client money fled Pimco in the months following Mr. Gross's exit, threatening to oust the company from its spot as one of the world's largest bond managers and denting morale. The firm's assets under management dropped to about $1.5 trillion.

Improved investment returns, led by Mr. Ivascyn's Pimco Income Fund, helped stem outflows and calm nerves among the firm's portfolio managers.

"Things are much better," said Mr. Roman, noting that employee pay was up in 2017.

Chinese Rival to Uber May Go Public First

China's Didi Chuxing Technology Co. is holding discussions about a multibillion-dollar initial public offering as early as this year, a move that would vault the ride-hailing company into the public markets ahead of American rival Uber Technologies Inc., according to people familiar with the matter.

Didi -- which operates China's largest ride-sharing platform and is expanding in Latin America and other parts of Asia -- is hoping to fetch a valuation of at least $70 billion to $80 billion if it goes public, one of the people added. That would make it one of the largest technology IPOs ever.

The Beijing-based company in recent weeks has been in talks with bankers about the feasibility of tapping the public markets for cash in the second half of 2018. The discussions are in early stages, the people familiar with the matter said. It also isn't clear whether an IPO will happen this year and Didi hasn't decided on a listing venue, they added.

Representatives for Didi were unavailable to comment. According to people familiar with the matter, Didi is looking to amass a large war chest to fend off rivals in China and other countries.

While Didi and Uber compete directly in some overseas markets, they are also partners. In 2016, Didi acquired Uber's China operations after a costly battle for dominance in the Chinese market. Under that deal, Uber and investors in its China unit took a 20% stake in Didi, which itself invested $1 billion in Uber.

Uber, for its part, has been considering an IPO, but Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi has said it is unlikely to take place before 2019.

Separately on Tuesday, Didi executives said they were considering developing a smartcar customized for ride-sharing and is seeking auto makers that could manufacture the vehicle. The car is anticipated to be an electric vehicle and would be connected to the internet, allowing Didi to monitor data from the car for safety by applying artificial intelligence technology.

Initiatives like Didi's plans are prompting auto makers to reconsider their relationship with ride-sharing companies. Car makers have long seen ride-hailing firms as competitors but are increasingly having to find ways to work with them as their presence grows. Didi's plans show how tech companies are trying to provide the software that runs cars' core functions, which could relegate auto makers to mere hardware manufacturers.

Didi was founded in 2012 and has become one of the world's largest tech unicorns, private companies with valuations of more than $1 billion. It was valued at $56 billion in a private fundraising round in late 2017 that raised $4 billion from investors that included Japan's SoftBank Group Corp. and an Abu Dhabi state fund, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.

San Francisco-based Uber, by comparison, had a valuation of $68 billion in June 2016, before a SoftBank-led consortium late last year bought more shares in the company at a $48 billion valuation. SoftBank in that deal also invested some money in Uber at the higher valuation.

Didi's website says it has more than 450 million users, facilitates an average of 30 million rides a day, and has investment and technology partnerships with seven ride-share companies around the world, including Lyft Inc., Grab Inc., Uber and others.

Didi has accelerated talks on a potential IPO in part because one of its new rivals, China's Meituan-Dianping, is moving forward with plans for a public listing later this year, according to people familiar with the matter.

Meituan-Dianping, an online services platform that counts Tencent Holdings Ltd. as a backer, rolled out ride-sharing services in Shanghai in March in a direct challenge to Didi.

Meituan-Dianping's IPO could value the company at around $60 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter, and is expected to list on exchanges in Hong Kong and mainland China.

To contend with rising competition and defend its market position, Didi is considering other capital-raising options, including the sale of convertible bonds, according to people familiar with its strategy. Such bonds could be structured to pay investors interest initially and could later convert into shares in the company at the time of, or after, its public listing.

It isn't known if Didi will proceed with a bond sale and the company hasn't made a final decision on its capital-raising plans, the people cautioned.

As of December, Didi had raised more than $20 billion in equity and debt funding, according to Dow Jones VentureSource, reflecting how building market share in the global ride-sharing business has been a costly endeavor.

Earlier this year, Didi took on Uber in Latin America when it bought a majority stake in Brazilian ride-hailing service 99 for $600 million, the Journal has reported. Didi said Monday that it would begin offering ride-hailing services in Mexico, part of its plan to expand overseas and challenge Uber in that market.

More deal activity is likely, say people familiar with Didi's strategy, especially as consolidation continues in the sector. Uber last month agreed to give up its business in Southeast Asia in exchange for a 27.5% stake in Singapore-based Grab, the regional dominant player in which Didi holds a stake. Didi and SoftBank invested $2 billion into Grab last summer as part of a larger financing round.

Didi's moves come as Chinese tech giants flock to list at exchanges around the world. Tencent Music Group Entertainment, the music-streaming business of internet giant Tencent Holdings, is planning an IPO in the U.S. as soon as the second half of this year that could value it in excess of $25 billion, the Journal reported Sunday.

Smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. is targeting an IPO in mainland China and Hong Kong as soon as this summer that could value it at about $100 billion, people familiar with the offering have said.

And e-commerce titan Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which is already listed on the New York Stock Exchange, is also working on a plan to list on the mainland.

Tech
Google and Facebook Likely to Benefit From Europe's Privacy Crackdown; Big tech companies gain while smaller online ad firms are squeezed under the European Union's GDPR, which takes effect in May.

When the European Union's justice commissioner traveled to California to meet with Google and Facebook last fall, she was expecting to get an earful from executives worried about the Continent's "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-amazon-and-google-also-are-bracing-for-privacy-regulations-1523188801".

Instead, she realized they already had the situation under control. "They were more relaxed, and I became more nervous," said the EU official, Vra Jourov. "They have the money, an army of lawyers, an army of technicians and so on."

Brussels wants its new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, to stop tech giants and their partners from pressuring consumers to relinquish control of their data in exchange for services. The EU would like to set an example for legislation around the world. But some of the restrictions are having an unintended consequence: reinforcing the duopoly of Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google.

On May 25, the EU will begin enforcing the new rules, which in many cases require companies to obtain affirmative consent to use European residents' personal information. The change has sent shudders through the digital-advertising sector, from online publishers to the analytics firms, data brokers and buying platforms that use personal data to aim ads at individuals in real time.

Google and Facebook, however, are leveraging their vast scale and sophistication as they seek consent from the hundreds of millions of European users who visit their services each day. They are applying a relatively strict interpretation of the new law, competitors say setting an industry standard that is hard for smaller firms to meet.

Google told website owners and app publishers last month "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-wants-publishers-to-get-users-consent-on-its-behalf-to-comply-with-eu-privacy-law-1521749003?mod=searchresults&page=3&pos=3" on behalf of each of their digital-ad vendors or risk being cut off from Google's ad network.

At the same time, Google told digital-ad vendors using its products they would be blocked from targeting any user who hadn't given specific consent to the vendors and to each of their partners, according to a letter reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

Facebook has started showing its 277 million daily users in Europe detailed prompts urging them to approve Facebook's use of their personal information, including sensitive items such as religion. One pop-up asks permission for Facebook to use data from other sites and advertisers to target ads at people on all of its apps, as well as on other websites where it sells ads.

Digital advertising companies, known as ad tech firms, say Google and Facebook's strict interpretation of GDPR squeezes their business. The ad tech firms embed their own technology in publishers' websites and apps, putting them in competition with the tech giants.

Unlike the giants, the ad tech firms have no direct relationship with consumers. They say Google's and Facebook's response pressures publishers to seek consent on behalf of dozens of ad tech firms that people have never heard of.

Irked internet users are apt to click "no," the ad tech firms say. Or, publishers may decide it's simpler to just stop using smaller ad-tech companies.

A digital-advertising firm called AdUX recently closed a service that harvested location data from people's smartphone apps to show them targeted ads, said CEO Cyril Zimmermann, because his firm had little hope of asking for much less getting consent from users. Instead, AdUX will aggregate data from bigger companies. He said the shift has cut into revenue.

"For them, it's easy," he said. "The problem is, who knows AdUX?"

Some advertisers are planning to shift money away from smaller providers and toward Google and Facebook, the smaller firms say. "They are moving their money where there is clear, obvious consent. The huge platforms are really profiting," said Joachim Schneidmadl, chief operating officer for Virtual Minds AG, which owns ad tech firms in Germany.

"We're aware that our customers and partners...have significant obligations under these new laws," Google said in a blog post published when it informed partners of its policy changes.

Asked by the Journal about its policy, Google said, "Under existing EU law, Google already requires publishers and advertisers to get consent from their end users for the use of our advertising services on their websites. We're asking our partners to refine the way they get consent for the use of Google's services on their sites, in line with GDPR guidance."

At Facebook, Emily Sharpe, a privacy and public-policy manager, said the firm has created a website and is holding workshops to help small and medium-sized businesses comply. CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently told the U.S. Congress: "A lot of times regulation by definition puts in place rules that a company that is larger, that has resources like ours, can easily comply with but that might be more difficult for a smaller startup."

The EU's Ms. Jourov said she believes European national regulators charged with enforcing the law "will focus on those who can potentially do the biggest harm to the privacy of people, and here I do not speak about small companies."

"On the big guys increasing market share? I don't believe [the law] will have such a consequence," said Ms. Jourov.

It's not as though Facebook and Google ever could hope to face no headaches from the law. Activists have vowed to file complaints against them.

Scrutiny will be high following revelations in March that Facebook let political-data firm Cambridge Analytica siphon personal information of as many as 87 million users without their consent. The new law authorizes fines of up to 4% of a violator's global annual revenue, or  ¬20 million, whichever is larger.

Court battles over whether companies are meeting GDPR's requirement that consent be "freely given" are likely to drag on for years, said Eduardo Ustaran, a privacy lawyer at Hogan Lovells.

In the meantime, Google and Facebook are building on their powerful positions in the digital ad market. They have reams of information on hundred of millions of people who use their websites and apps in Europe. They also use "share" buttons and ad tools on millions of websites to collect data on how people use the internet. That is important information for determining consumers' interests before showing them ads.

In one study of 850,000 internet users last year, mainly in the U.S. and Europe, Google tracked 64% of all pages loaded by mobile and web browsers and Facebook tracked 29% more than double the next-biggest tracker, according to Cliqz, which makes anti-tracking tools for consumers. The two giants are expected to collect a combined 49% of all digital ad spending world-wide in 2018, says eMarketer.

That heft multiplies the advantages they have in requesting consent. Even if a large number of users opt out of targeted ads from Google and Facebook in Europe something Facebook in Europe something "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-doesnt-expect-revenue-impact-over-privacy-concerns-1523555498" the two will remain by far the largest sources of consenting consumers, making the duo must-buys for advertisers.

"I'm stumped at how this will fundamentally change Facebook's ad revenue" or "impact the targeting of Google search," said Mark Mahaney, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.

The idea of requiring consent to use personal information stretches back to the 1970s, when countries began passing data-protection laws. Germany's 1977 law helped shape Europe's future approach: It forbade all but a few narrow uses of personal information without an individual's permission which had to be in writing.

With the rise of the internet in the 1990s, the EU decided to harmonize privacy rules. The definition of consent remained somewhat open, referring to any "specific and informed indication of wishes." The new law says consent must be "unambiguous" and communicated "by a statement or by a clear affirmative action."

That effectively rules out the widespread practice of pre-checked boxes. Consent in the EU becomes something that is "opt-in" rather than "opt-out," regulators say.

Business-lobby groups howled when the text was made final in 2015. Smaller companies soon were ringing alarm bells.

"The politicians wanted to teach Google and Facebook a lesson. And yet they favor them," a Brussels lobbyist for an media-measurement firm said at the time.

Once the law passed in spring 2016, Google and Facebook threw people at the problem. Google involved lawyers in the U.S., Ireland, Brussels and elsewhere to pore over contracts and procedures, said people close to the company. Facebook mobilized hundreds of people in what it describes as the largest interdepartmental team it has ever assembled.

Facebook lawyers spent a year scrutinizing the law's lengthy text. Designers and engineers then toiled over how to implement changes, according to Stephen Deadman, Facebook's global deputy chief privacy officer.

During the process, Facebook got frequent access to regulators across Europe. It met with Helen Dixon, the data protection commissioner in Ireland, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/irelands-privacy-cop-picks-up-the-beat-1482855575", and her staff to run through changes Facebook was planning. Ms. Dixon's agency provided the firm with feedback on the wording of its consent requests, Facebook said.

"We've been getting their guidance over many months," Mr. Deadman says.

Ms. Jourov, the EU's justice commissioner, said the tech giants seemed scared when she met with them in Washington a year ago. Google and Facebook then went from trying to fight GDPR to deciding to use it to their corporate advantage, said a person familiar with the meetings.

Travelling to Silicon Valley in September, this person said, Ms. Jourov sat down with Facebook officials to discuss privacy, and met with Facebook Chief Operating Office Sheryl Sandberg. The next morning, at a meeting at Google headquarters, employees spent much of a two-hour breakfast meeting taking Ms. Jourov through Google's approach to compliance.

In mid-April, just before unveiling new opt-in consent pages, Facebook started running ads in European newspapers saying the new law "means better protection" and Facebook will ask users to "review how we can use your data." Analysts at Barclays said last week they expect the opt-ins will have a low-single-digit impact on Facebook revenue, and might end up being immaterial.

"We've hit the mark," Mr. Deadman says. "We'll be fully compliant."

Some publishers and ad tech firms, particularly in Germany, were taking a different approach. Fearing users would consider detailed consent forms intrusive, they zeroed in on an exception in the GDPR called "legitimate interest."

It would let companies use personal information without asking for consent so long as they took other strict privacy measures. The companies remained confident in the strategy even after EU privacy regulators raised questions in February about the validity of using that exception for marketing-related tracking across multiple devices or websites, as many firms do.

Then in March, Google forced the issue. It published an updated "User Consent Policy" that will, as of May 25, require publishers and app owners that sell ads through Google to request consent that specifically mentions every company that might collect or process their users' data, or risk being kicked off Google's system, according to a copy seen by The Wall Street Journal.

Because Google is involved in so many layers of the ad business, some publishers say they have no choice but to comply, and others say they're not sure what they'll do yet. "It's the classic Google approach: Either you take it or leave it," said Carsten Schwecke, chief digital officer of Media Impact, Axel Springer's media sales division. "It is not a pleasant situation for a publisher like us."

Third-party data collectors that rely on websites to reach consumers, meanwhile, worry that Google's stance on consent will cut into their businesses.

"If you put the list of 120 companies on your home page, how is a user going to make an informed decision?" said Alain Levy, chief executive of Weborama, a Paris-based ad tech company. "We are a B2B company. We have no relationship with the consumer."

Some ad-tech companies have decided to pull out of Europe. Verve, which helps marketers target people with ads using location data, said last week it will shut its European operations, including offices in London and Munich, because it feared publishers wouldn't get consent from enough consumers, said Julie Bernard, chief marketing officer.

Drawbridge, which helps marketers track users as they switch from one device to another, also abandoned its ad business in Europe as a result of GDPR, shutting its London office, said a spokesman for the California-based company.

Publishers worry that without a thriving third-party ecosystem of companies that can help them sell targeted digital advertising, they will be forced increasingly to turn to Google and Facebook which also compete with them to sell ads on their own websites. That would further increase the big companies' market share.

In an attempt to cut a path to consent for these smaller tech firms, online-ad trade group IAB Europe has put together a standardized system for websites and apps to ask for user permission on behalf of the sometimes dozens of companies that collect data or place advertising on a given destination. Vendors feed information into the system about what they do with users' data, and their listings are available for the publishers to display in their consent requests.

As of Friday, only 13 vendors were listed as available to gather consent through the system, according to an IAB Europe website.

"It is paradoxical," said Bill Simmons, co-founder and chief technology officer of Dataxu, Boston-based company that helps buy targeted ads. "The GDPR is actually consolidating the control of consumer data onto these tech giants."

KPMG faces shareholder protests over GE and Wells Fargo audits

KPMG is this week facing the prospect of a rebellion from shareholders in two of its oldest and highest profile clients, Wells Fargo and General Electric, over its role auditing the beleaguered companies.

The two titans of US industry and banking are facing calls to end their decades-old audit relationships with the firm. Professional services firms that are now part of KPMG have audited Wells since 1931 and GE since 1909. Last year it collected a combined total of almost $200m in fees from the two blue-chip groups.

However, KPMG s role has come under the spotlight at Wells and GE, both of which have been laid low by a series of mishaps.

Fake accounts and other scandals at Wells, run by chief executive Tim Sloan, have cost the California-based company its status as the world s most valuable bank. GE shares have lost half their value in the past year over financial difficulties including a need to prop up reserves over unexpected insurance liabilities. Both companies are under investigation by regulators.

Glass Lewis, the shareholder advisory service, has recommended that investors in Wells vote against retaining KPMG as the bank s auditor. At GE, both Glass Lewis and ISS, another adviser, have called for a vote to replace it.

GE shareholders should reject the reappointment of KPMG  in light of several ongoing concerns  including Securities and Exchange Commission investigations and the firm s  extremely long tenure , Glass Lewis argued.

Of KPMG s relationship with Wells Fargo, Glass Lewis said:  While cognisant that an auditor is not expected to inspect every instance of potential fraud at a company, we believe that this unique case warrants additional scrutiny. 

Shareholders in US companies, whose votes are not binding, rarely rebel over audit contracts. Support levels were higher than 90 per cent at all but four of the past 1,500 meetings at S&P 500 companies, according to ISS Analytics.

Yet the influence of ISS and Glass Lewis makes such a revolt a possibility at Wells and GE this week. KPMG declined to comment.

Protests by bank workers and consumer activists are expected at Wells  annual meeting in Des Moines, Iowa, on Tuesday. The gathering comes a year after a fiery meeting in Florida, when shareholders cast almost half their votes against the re-election of some of the bank s directors.

Thousands of Wells employees under pressure to hit sales targets signed up customers for services they knew nothing about. Since then, Wells has been embroiled in further problems. Last week, regulators slapped a $1bn fine on the bank over mortgage fees, unwanted car insurance and other compliance failures.

KPMG s role has come under fire from senators including Elizabeth Warren, who has said the firm s failure to spot the problems at the bank  raises questions about the quality of your audits .

The accounting firm has responded by saying that the misconduct at Wells  did not implicate any key control over financial reporting .

 KPMG is confident that its audits and reviews of Wells Fargo s consolidated financial statements were appropriately planned and performed in accordance with applicable professional standards. 

Its role may come under further scrutiny at GE s annual meeting in Imperial, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday.

The meeting will be the first since the company revealed in January that it was under investigation by the SEC over two issues: reported revenues from long-term service contracts, and liabilities from insurance operations it offloaded in 2006, which required a $9.5bn pre-tax charge to cover expected future costs. The liabilities relate mainly to policies for long-term care.

GE is KPMG s longest-standing client, according to data provider Audit Analytics. It has also been a lucrative one. Last year the group paid KPMG $142.9m for audit, audit-related and tax fees, including $30m for an audit of its oil and gas services business for the merger with Baker Hughes, which closed last year.

Wells Fargo paid KPMG $54.9m in fees last year, including $5.8m for tax-related services.

GE s board said it had chosen to stick with KPMG for a 110th year in 2018, after a  rigorous review process . In its proxy filing for the annual meeting, GE argued that having a long-tenured auditor with deep institutional knowledge and expertise  keeps costs competitive , and saves management time and resources by avoiding the need to help bring a new team up to speed. It added that KPMG had a strong process for maintaining independence, with the lead audit engagement partner rotating every five years.

Similarly, Wells Fargo said the retention of KPMG was  in the best interests of our company and its shareholders .

Pimco's New Bond King Could Be a Robot in Austin

Pacific Investment Management Co. used to rely heavily on one man to make many of its key investment decisions. Now it's betting a big part of its future on millions of lines of software code.

Pimco will open a new office in Austin, Texas, later this year to help recruit more tech-savvy workers who might otherwise spurn the bond manager for traditional software companies, people familiar with the matter said. The Newport Beach, Calif.-based firm plans to grow its workforce by 10% this year, adding about 250 new staff.

Many of those new employees will be engineers tasked with modernizing Pimco's technology systems, from the tools used to harness new databases of information to the platforms that trade bonds electronically. The changes aim to sharpen investment ideas and lower costs.

The new investments mark the next phase of a strategy set in motion three years ago, when cofounder Bill Gross's "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bond-king-bill-gross-loses-showdown-at-firm-1411773652" wrenched the firm from its overdependence on a single bond manager. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pimcos-new-bond-king-is-nothing-like-bill-gross-1497605409" and former hedge-fund firm executive Emmanuel Roman have since stemmed the flow of client money from Pimco's core bond funds, and now are looking to stay ahead of the relentless growth of exchange-traded funds and other low-cost passive investments.

Net inflows into passively managed bond funds have outpaced their active counterparts for the past five years, according to Morningstar Direct. Active bond mutual funds still hold an edge in total assets, but ETFs are gaining ground.

Pimco's mutual funds had $33 billion in net inflows in 2017, reversing a four-year stretch of client withdrawals, Morningstar said. While Pimco remains one of the world's biggest investors, with about $1.7 trillion in assets, the firm still manages less than the some $2 trillion it oversaw at the height of the Gross era.

Mr. Roman, Pimco's chief executive, is placing his bets on computer-driven and private-debt investing, believing those areas offer promise without veering the firm outside its traditional focus on the debt markets.

"Our strategy remains the same: to be the premier fixed-income manager in the world," Mr. Roman said earlier this month in an interview. "But to do this we need to invest."

Mr. Roman's plan isn't without risk. While most of the firm's core bond funds are performing well, a slump could lead to questions about whether Pimco should stick to its knitting, clients and consultants have said.

The firm plans to launch a slate of investment funds driven by trading algorithms, he said, but many other initiatives are designed to give Pimco's traditional portfolio managers an edge in finding profitable trading ideas or lowering costs.

Mr. Roman said Pimco plans to expand its current portfolio-management analytics team. Led by Ravi Mattu, who joined the firm in 2011, the group currently employs about 65 people.

"We're turning up the volume, so to speak," Mr. Roman said.

Pimco plans to build out its capabilities in trading bonds and other securities electronically, in a bid to reduce execution costs. The firm is also on the lookout for new databases its managers can tap to help form investment ideas, and plans to add new analytical tools. Mr. Roman said he expects to form at least one partnership with an outside technology company.

One area of focus: predicting inflation. The firm aims to add consumer data that will help managers make faster and more-accurate forecasts on the consumer-price index, a benchmark that informs investment decisions on most debt securities, Mr. Roman said.

Finally, Pimco is also exploring partnerships with research universities to study how asset managers can apply machine-learning techniques that have worked in other industries, including retailers, Mr. Roman said.

Mr. Roman unveiled plans to add another U.S. office in a Feb. 26 memorandum to staff. In that memo, previously reported by Bloomberg News, Mr. Roman listed three cities as contenders: Austin, Dallas and Denver.

Pimco negotiated with officials from the three cities before choosing Austin earlier this month. The Texas city is close to a number of institutional investors, including some Pimco clients, boasts a technology corridor and is home to the University of Texas. "That is a key factor as we look to build up the office to about 200 employees by the end of 2019," Mr. Roman wrote in a memo sent Monday to employees.

Patrick Feigley, head of U.S. sales at Pimco's wealth-management business, will run the new office, according to the memo.

Mr. Roman is also leading Pimco's push into private credit, real estate and other so-called alternative investments, a direction many clients predicted he would take given his experience with hedge-fund firms.

Mr. Roman worked for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for 18 years before joining GLG Partners. He spearheaded GLG's sale to Man Group PLC, which he ran before joining Pimco.

Hundreds of billions of dollars in client money fled Pimco in the months following Mr. Gross's exit, threatening to oust the firm from its spot as one of the world's largest bond managers and denting morale. The firm's assets under management dropped to about $1.5 trillion.

Improved investment returns, led by Mr. Ivascyn's "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-pimco-fund-just-became-the-biggest-active-bond-fund-and-it-wasnt-bill-grosss-1491335572", helped stem outflows and calm nerves among the firm's portfolio managers.

"Things are much better," said Mr. Roman, noting that employee pay was up in 2017.

KPMG avoids shareholder revolt over Wells Fargo audit role

KPMG avoided a rebellion on Tuesday from Wells Fargo shareholders over its role in auditing the bank, although it faces another vote this week from its oldest US audit client, General Electric.

At Wells  annual meeting, shareholders who hold only about 9 per cent of its stock supported a call from advisory group Glass Lewis for the bank to ditch KPMG after 87 years.

GE has also faced calls to end its even longer audit relationship with the firm dating back to 1909. Both Glass Lewis and another adviser, Institutional Shareholder Services   which supported KPMG s role at Wells Fargo   have called for its replacement at GE.

Last year KPMG collected a combined total of almost $200m in fees from Wells and GE. Its role has come under the spotlight at both companies, which have been hit by mishaps.

Search Marketing Firm SEMrush Raises $40 Million to Fund Expansion; Company will expand to platforms owned by Amazon.com Inc. and Baidu

For all the talk about publishers and marketers gaming the Facebook news feed algorithm, jockeying for position in search results is an even bigger priority.

Search analytics firms like SEMrush say they have the answers. SEMrush, an analytics and software company founded in Russia in 2008, has raised $40 million to expand its operations, according to Eugene Levin, chief strategy officer at SEMrush.

The funding round, the firm's first, was co-led by venture-capital firms Greycroft, e.ventures and Siguler Guff.

SEMrush helps marketers and publishers optimize their websites for discovery by consumers using popular search engines like Google, Bing and Yahoo. The company charges a base fee of $99.95 for freelancers and in-house marketers and has additional pricing tiers for optional features.

The company's customers include Ebay, Quora, Booking.com, Hewlett Packard Enterprise and BNP Paribas.

The investment in SEMrush comes as search is becoming increasingly important to marketers and publishers alike. Google now accounts for more than 50% of referral traffic sent to digital publishers, "https://www.parse.ly/resources/data-studies/referrer-dashboard/", compared to 27% from the second-biggest referrer, Facebook. Together, Google and Facebook control about 56% of the U.S. digital ad market, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rivals-chip-away-at-googles-and-facebooks-u-s-digital-ad-dominance-data-show-1521457321"; competitors like Amazon and Snap, Inc. each have less than 5% of the market.

Search-engine optimization firms like SEMrush are in some ways engaged in a game of cat-and-mouse with Google, helping marketers navigate the company's shifting algorithm for ranking links. Because the rules of search marketing are constantly in flux, the company's services are perpetually in demand, said Dylan Pearce, a partner at Greycroft who leads the firm's growth-stage technology and internet investments.

"When there is a shift in the Google algorithm, the traffic to SEMrush spikes," Mr. Pearce said. "Because people are going to SEMrush to help them understand what the algorithm change means."

SEMrush has revenues between $50 million and $100 million, Mr. Levin said. The company now has nearly 500 employees in Russia, the United States, the Czech Republic and the Republic of Cyprus, he said.

SEMrush plans to use some of the financing to expand beyond U.S.-based search engines and onto platforms owned by Amazon.com and the Chinese internet company Baidu. SEMrush also plans to buy companies that produce software it can include in its platform and purchase search data from emerging markets to make its platform more effective to marketers in those countries.

One potential area of interest for acquisitions is software firms that help public relations firms work with news organizations better, Mr. Levin said. Companies can increase their ranking in Google's search results by getting links in articles published by authoritative publications.

"In some cases, links from specifics news portals are more valuable than the traffic and brand recognition that you are going to get from content you create," Mr. Levin said.

Aspire Ventures Precision Medicine Fund will be co-led by Aspire Universal and Penn's community hospital arm Lancaster General Health, or LG Health. The partnership allows for shared licensing on intellectual property and resources, said Aspire Ventures Managing Partner Essam Abadir.

It's the second fund for the Lancaster, Pa.-based firm, which first launched in 2014. Portfolio companies include digital health startup Connexion Health LLC and diabetes-management company Tempo Health LLC.

The new fund will back startups developing artificial intelligence and Internet of Things technologies. The fund has earmarked $50 million for early-stage venture capital, $150 million for growth, and $100 million for private equity investing.

In addition to Aspire Universal's artificial intelligence platform, portfolio companies will also have access to proprietary health data, clinical expertise and data science. The firm also operates specialized accelerator programs, such as one in partnership with Capital Blue Cross that aims to get startups' products reimbursed by insurance within 12 weeks.

Mr. Abadir said the partners designed the funding and operation to facilitate faster development, testing and commercialization of precision medicine technologies with less capital.

In addition to the partnerships with LG Health and Capital Blue Cross, Aspire is actively looking for strategic investing partners that could enable faster, more capital-efficient development for precision medicine startups.

"We think precision medicine is really the way the industry is going, and we are actively looking to add more capabilities in areas like drug availability and material science," Mr. Abadir said.

Pro Private Markets
Kang's Take: The Science of Private-Equity Exits

Navigating a successful exit can be both an art and a science. Increasingly, private-equity firms are banking on the science.

Private equity continues to take advantage of what has been a three-year seller's market, fueled by high valuations and an abundance of cheap debt. As they look to capitalize on these conditions, more firms are relying on data to determine when and how to sell their portfolio companies.

About 68% of private-equity investors used data analytics during buyer negotiations in their latest exit and approximately 81% used it to make an exit decision, according to a new report by Ernst & Young LLP. The study is based on 100 interviews with private-equity executives that were conducted between October and December 2017.

Over the past year, more private-equity firms started using data analytics to better understand inflection points for portfolio companies and to subsequently determine when to sell them, explained Bill Stoffel, U.S. private-equity leader at Ernst & Young.

"Every incremental day doesn't necessarily help IRRs," he said, adding that investors are currently utilizing analytics more for exits than investments.

For example, firms can build customized scenario models or examine the effects of potential market conditions to better grasp the prospective performance of their portfolio companies. Doing so can help them weigh more effectively the risks and benefits of continuing to hold those companies.

Private equity is also having broader discussions internally about choosing between outsourcing and building capabilities in-house, with about 83% of firms seeking operating partners with digital or technology expertise, according to the report.

The change in mind-set among private-equity firms is taking place as competition for deals intensifies, forcing investors to be more forward-thinking. But as firms incorporate data into exit decisions, they must remain cautious.

Although technology can certainly enhance investment decision making, it won't make or break a deal. At the end of the day, growth ultimately drives valuations and that often requires the expertise borne from human judgment.

INTERVIEW Nicolas Moreau aims to steady DWS after years of leadership change

N icolas Moreau is addressing the elephant in the room: the purge at Deutsche Bank that has been splashed across Europe's business pages for weeks.

As a member of the German lender's management board, Mr Moreau was at the top table when John Cryan was sacked as chief executive this month and retail banking boss Christian Sewing was hastily installed. Investment banking boss Marcus Schenck left at the same time.

Mr Moreau, chief executive of DWS, the  ¬700bn fund group majority-owned by the German bank, is guarded about a succession process widely derided as chaotic.

"Difficult for me to comment on that, but it was done and there's some continuity, that's good," he says from DWS's London office overlooking Buckingham Palace a few weeks after the asset manager's public listing. "There's John and Marcus that have left but, otherwise, we are all still together." A few days after our interview, however, chief operating officer Kim Hammonds and another management board member quit.

The 52-year old Frenchman describes his new boss as a "trusted counterpart". "Until last week he was my colleague on the board and my main client because he was running the private bank business," he says.

DWS, previously Deutsche Asset Management, floated on the Frankfurt stock exchange a month ago, raising  ¬1.4bn of cash for its parent, which retained a 77.5 per cent stake. Floated with an  ¬32.50 offer price, the shares are now just over  ¬31.

Mr Moreau adds that Mr Sewing, a 30-year veteran of the bank, is focused on "accelerating the execution of the strategy rather than changing the strategy". He describes German governance, which typically includes a chairman-led supervisory board and a chief executive-led management board, as "interesting". "The governance of the bank is collegial governance; that's the way German corporations are organised. So, I think his [Sewing's] success will be his success and we need to contribute to that in delivering our targets, in growing our business, in making sure that we have the right stewardship of the activities of the bank."

Mr Moreau has experienced upheaval before. In 2016 he missed out on the top job at Axa after a 25-year stint at the French insurer. "I was chair and CEO of Axa France and I was seen as the incoming [group] CEO," he says. "I would have loved to take over ... you know, a group in which you've worked so long, you've got attachment to the people, the business. But, the board chose someone else."

The French insurer went for someone younger, picking Thomas Buberl, the head of the group's German operations, to succeed Henri de Castries, who had held the job for 16 years.

Within weeks Mr Moreau quit and soon after landed the top job at DWS. In the dark days after losing the battle, friends told him "there's always good news in bad news". And the rugby and golf fan   who is a father of four and splits his time between Notting Hill in London and Frankfurt   appears at peace over his career.

"I love asset management, I love investment. I think this is a very powerful way to put your impact on the world," he says.

"It is a huge transformation we are going through; all this shift between fossil energy to green energy is fantastic, it's requiring a lot of investment; the role of the cities in the world; the demographic changes that are happening; all the artificial intelligence. "As an asset manager, we've got a way to finance it, influence it. Our role in corporate governance is also a way to change the way companies are governed or, at least, influenced."

In a dig at his former industry, he adds: "As an insurer, sometimes you are stuck in minutiae."

Mr Moreau has a job on his hands, not least to steady the DWS ship after decades of leadership change. Assets under management fell from  ¬714bn in 2015 to  ¬689bn the next year, before recovering to  ¬700bn in 2017. The roll call of men running the asset manager is long and includes Quintin Price, Michele Faissola, Kevin Parker and Michael Dobson.

"The number of changes in this business has been absolutely mad," he says in another candid moment.

Some of his predecessors came from investment banking and had a hunter mentality, while Mr Moreau has been described by one industry veteran more as a "farmer".

"I like to shape a business to build it on long-term foundations. When I come back ten years after having left, you can see that I've left something," he says. "If that's the way you define a farmer, that's what I am."

The big driver of DWS's growth is its European exchange traded funds business. "Some months we are even larger than BlackRock, we are one or two, depending on the month," he says. DWS's US ETF business has struggled, though. This part of the operation suffered net outflows of more than $1bn in the first quarter after net outflows of $1.8bn in 2017, according to ETFGI, the consultancy.

Mr Moreau says much of that weakness is due to a global equityhedged ETF. "We are hedging the currency risk to US dollars and we sold this product a lot to asset allocators, and with the weakness in the dollar we've seen outflows, and that's on this single ETF. As we don't have a huge, very diversified range, this type of volatility goes directly into our figures," he says.

DWS, which counts Nippon Life, Japan's largest life insurance company, as a 5 per cent shareholder, has also come under fire for its governance structure. DWS was listed as a partnership limited by shares, or KGaA, which gives non-Deutsche Bank investors less control.

"Rome was not built in a day. I know this is not seen as a very pure governance structure, but it's a structure where the rights of shareholders are absolutely respected in terms of access to cash flow, sharing of cash flow," he says. "It's not very different than an Amundi or company controlled by a shareholder, or even Schroders that is controlled by a family." He adds that if Deutsche Bank goes below a 40 per cent stake "we revert to a regular [corporate] structure".

SoftBank and Google Funds to Invest in Chinese Truck-Hailing Firm Manbang; Deal marks Alphabet fund's first investment in China since 2014

Japan's SoftBank Group Corp. and Alphabet Inc.'s late-stage venture investment fund are among investors plowing close to $2 billion into a Chinese truck-hailing company, according to people familiar with the investments.

Manbang Group, which runs a mobile app platform that matches truck drivers with shippers looking to transport cargo, is raising more money than it originally set out to fetch, according to these people. The Wall Street Journal previously reported the company was planning to raise "http://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-considers-1-billion-investment-in-chinese-truck-hailing-firm-1522056949".

Manbang's previous backers have included internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. and a private-equity firm co-founded by Chinese billionaire Jack Ma.

The latest fundraising round, which is likely to be north of $1.9 billion, would value Manbang at more than $6 billion, according to the people familiar with the transaction. Representatives from Manbang couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

SoftBank is providing $1 billion of the fresh funds, the people said. That investment will be made from SoftBank's Vision Fund, a nearly $100 billion investment vehicle that has backed other ride-hailing companies such as Uber Technologies Inc. and Didi Chuxing Technology Co. in China.

Alphabet's CapitalG, which was founded in 2013 and used to be known as Google Capital, is investing $30 million in the Chinese company, the people said. The deal marks its first investment in China since 2014, when it invested in Innolight Technology Ltd., a Suzhou-based maker of high-speed optical communications devices.

CapitalG describes itself as a growth-equity investment fund whose goal is to "make return-driven investments in leading companies around the world," according to its website. A person familiar with the fund's strategy said it typically invests for profit and not strategically for Google parent Alphabet.

Most of Google's services have been unavailable in China since 2010, when the U.S. technology company withdrew from the market due to censorship concerns.

Since then, the company has been trying to make small steps to re-enter the market. It launched an artificial intelligence lab in China last December, and Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai has visited the country at least twice in the past six months to speak at Chinese forums.

Manbang, which is also known as Full Truck Alliance, is trying to grow on the back of China's expanding logistics industry. Besides matching shippers with truck drivers, the company also provides vehicle loans, insurance and working capital to its users.

With new chief on the way, Goldman undergoes a transformation

There s a sense that everything is up for grabs atGoldman Sachs. For years after the financial crisis, the elite investment bank was accused of dragging its feet, not reacting quickly enough to structural forces eating away at its trading business. At one point in 2010it had a $60bn advantage overMorgan Stanleyin terms of market capitalisation. This week, after another strong set of figures from Goldman s midtown rival, the gap is down to $3bn.

 You have to give James [Gorman] credit for courage, and for execution,  says one former top executive at Goldman, musing on how it lost its edge over the rivalrun by Gorman.  Goldman stuck with a business model of everything they did before the crisis but their key competitor built a less capital-markets, more investor-oriented business model. 

But now Goldman has a CEO on the way out (in an orderly fashion, of course), an aggressive replacement waiting in the wings, and a big plan to generate at least $2bn in annual revenues from lending, a business insiders used to scorn as lightweight and low-margin.

Ben McLannahan, US banking editor,takes a good lookat the transformation under way, as Goldman edges towards the universal-banking model adopted by the likes ofJPMorgan ChaseandCitigroup. There ll be friction, of course, and to some extent there already is; some M&A bankers are grumbling about the heightened pressure to supply Goldman s balance sheet, as well as its brainpower.

And not all the new recruits  many of them with a background in fintech  are taking to Goldman s stiffer working environment.Will Hurley, a chin-bearded entrepreneur who once wowed investors with a mind-controlled skateboard, left in January after less than two years as a managing director.

Better the devil you know

Bill Ackmancouldn t help but take a swipe at his one-time nemesis.

When asked at the 13D Active-Passive conference on Tuesday in New York what he thought ofStarboard Value s proxy fight atNewell Brands, Ackman snipped that the company had  made a deal with the devil  by allying withCarl Icahn.

 I mean that in the most positive way about Carl!  he hastily added as the room erupted in laughter.

The men were famously on either side of theHerbalifetrade, with Ackman shorting the shares while Icahn went long.

Icahn has boasted he made $1bn off the investment. Ackman, who exited the short earlier this year, didn t fare quite so well: the stock was trading at around $45 when he first took the position. By the time he closed it out, its share price had doubled. 

Ackman also added that he had hopes to nominate an all-female, ethnically diverse slate of board candidates at a company at one point. The main problem, he said, was finding female candidates who were willing to join an activist slate.

The other was that in this particular situation, he also wanted to nominate himself.

 I wasn t prepared to do anything about my own gender,  he said.  There s only certain lengths I m willing to go to. 

For a short while,a Shire bidding war loomed

For a few hours on Thursday it appeared that abidding war loomedfor Irish drugmakerShire.

Hours after the company rejected a42.4bn takeover offer from Japanese rivalTakeda,Botox-makerAllergandisclosed it was considering a run at the company.The news sent Shire shares higher, and had some prognosticators thinking that another big drugmaker could join in the battle for Shire.

But shortly after, Allergan beat a retreat, disclosing that it no longer intended to make a bid. (Read this from Lexon why the deal didn't make sense to begin with.)

That left Takeda, at least publicly, as a suitor. Shire said that Takeda's latest 46.50 a share offer still undervalued the company, but that its advisers had continued "a dialogue" with the Japanese group to see if a better offer could still be had.

If a deal had been clinched at the current price, it would have ranked as one of the largestthe pharmaceutical sector had ever seen, trailingPfizer s $112bn takeover ofWarner Lambertin 2000, according toDealogic.

Back to the negotiating table for Shire. Just one other wrinkle for those hoping for a deal to come to fruition: Takeda said it would remain "disciplined" on the terms of any future offer and that it intended to maintain its investment grade credit rating. Takeda is A1/A- rated from Moody's and S&P, and a 42bn deal (including a16bn cash component) will push its leverage higher.Breakingviews reckons debt-to-ebitda could hit 4 times. The question for all involved: how much higher is Takeda comfortable pushing leverage?

Power play overshadows Saudi Arabia's huge solar deal

Only last monthMasayoshi Son, founder ofSoftBank, andMohammed bin Salman, the Saudi Crown Prince, shook hands and smiled at each other.

The cameras showed the two men celebrating a joint venture between SoftBank and Saudi Arabia to create the world's largest solar power generation project in the kingdom with the goal to invest $200bn by 2030.

During a press briefing at New York's Plaza Hotel, the Saudi Crown Prince said: 'It s a huge step in human history."

But infighting within the Saudi government illustrates tensions between two powerful government bodies in the kingdom   the energy ministry and the sovereign wealth fund  report the FT's Anjli Raval, Arash Massoudi and Simeon Kerr.

The country's big renewable energy push is now shrouded in uncertainty, highlighting how competing factions could stand as a hurdle to Saudi Arabia s new economic vision.

The energy ministry, in charge of the kingdom s multibillion-dollar renewables strategy, andSaudi Aramcowhich has provided assistance, were kept in the dark about the announcement, according to several people familiar with the matter.

"These are intensely complex projects. Announcements shouldn t come as a surprise to people whoneed to be involved,  said one of the people.

This exposed a struggle for power betweenKhalid Al Falih, the energy minister, and Public Investment Fund chiefYasir al-Rumayyan.

Tech
Merger Isn't the Only Option for Renault and Nissan, Ghosn Says; Tech leaders gather in Hong Kong for D.Live conference

A Wall Street Journal Roundup

HONG KONG Carlos Ghosn, chairman and chief executive of the Renault-Nissan alliance, said he is open to a merger of the two companies something he has long opposed but added that there may be other alternatives once he eventually retires.

"I've been opposed [to a merger] for a very long time because I've seen how much damage mergers have done into the industry," he said, citing the example of the merger between Daimler, Chrysler and Mitsubishi Motors two decades ago that ultimately dissolved.

"But at the same time I have to take in consideration the concerns of the stakeholders," Mr. Ghosn said at The Wall Street Journal's D.Live conference in Hong Kong Friday.

Renault and Nissan have been in a partnership since 1999, when Renault bought a 43.4% stake in the then-struggling Nissan. Nissan owns 15% of Renault but has no voting rights. The arrangement allows the French and Japanese auto makers to share costs and technology.

Mr. Ghosn, 64 years old and widely seen as the glue of the alliance, said concerns have been voiced about the sustainability of the partnership once he retires.

"I consider that the sustainability and what's going to happen in the long term is a real concern. And I need to answer it," he said. "We are listening to people...We are going to be bringing the solution."

Mr. Ghosn was one of several speakers discussing some of the most compelling ideas emerging globally. Asia's top companies, particularly from the tech industry, are making some of the world's most rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and self-driving cars, creating a wave of innovation and investment opportunities.

Among major themes discussed was how venture-capital investment from Asia is skyrocketing, challenging America's tech dominance in Silicon Valley.

Here's a roundup of the event.

Alibaba Backing Is Invaluable, Executives From Paytm and Lazada Say

Having e-commerce titan Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. as an investor in Paytm Mall is a huge advantage due to the Chinese company's vast experience, said Amit Sinha, the Indian company's chief strategy officer.

"Alibaba has been a great source of learning for us," said Mr. Sinha. Paytm is known for its popular mobile payment app but has moved into e-commerce.

Hans-Peter Ressel, chief international officer of Singapore-based Lazada Group, agreed. Mr. Ressel said the Southeast-Asia focused e-commerce firm had long wanted to bring more companies' goods onto its site but struggled to do so.

After Alibaba in 2016 poured $1 billion into Lazada, however, Alibaba Chief Executive Daniel Zhang said, "Give me a list of the brands and I'll call them up myself." That comprised some 84 companies, Mr. Ressel said.

"Within a couple weeks and months we had introductions" and eventually "onboarded all of them," Mr. Ressel said. "That is the value of Alibaba."

China May Produce the Next Regeneron, But Not So Soon

Beijing has poured billions of dollars into cultivating a homegrown biotechnology industry, but it could be at least another decade before domestic companies begin to challenge U.S. rivals, Chinese health-care investors say.

"This is literally a billion-dollar question," said Judith Li, a partner at Lilly Asia Ventures, whose investors include Eli Lilly & Co. Investors, she said, expect Chinese companies to produce innovative drugs over the next five to 10 years.

"From that point on to building the next Regeneron [Pharmaceuticals Inc.] I think is probably another decade or so," she said. But "China always moves faster than we think it will, so maybe we are underestimating" its speed and capabilities, she added.

China's biotech boom has been driven by a wave of Western-trained Chinese scientists, who the government has lured back over the past decade by offering incentives such as massive research grants and tax benefits.

Nisa Leung, managing partner at Qiming Venture Partners, however, warned that many companies are pouring money and resources into the same areas, such as immuno-oncology drugs that aim to program the immune system to fight cancer.

"Every time when something is really hot a lot of Chinese companies go into it," she said.

Huawei: In Cloud Business 'We Don't Touch the Data'

Huawei Technologies Co.'s cloud business puts emphasis on customer trust and steers clear of the data that its customers put on its servers, said Yan Lida, the head of Huawei's enterprise business.

"We don't touch data," Mr. Yan said. "We are a hardware and infrastructure maker in the market. We don't provide applications. We don't do the software business &We don't monetize our customers' data."

Mr. Yan said that has helped earn business from 197 of Fortune 500 companies. He said Huawei is focused on growing the cloud business outside China.

"Our overseas market are something like two or three years behind the development of the China market," he said. "We carefully select those leading companies to work together."

The Dark Side of Facebook

Andreas Weigend, director of the Social Data Lab and former chief scientist at Amazon.com Inc., said the privacy scandal at Facebook Inc. was worse than a computer hack because Facebook had the ability to prevent it from happening.

"The fact that data was given to a company [Cambridge Analytica] and then [Facebook] didn't get around to deleting it is very different from somebody hacking the system and getting access to the data," he said.

The episode has made people more aware of how important it is for people to protect their data, says Nicole Eagen, chief executive of the cybersecurity firm Darktrace.

"The internet and especially social media has been a little bit of the Wild Wild West," she said. "What has happened with this Facebook situation is that once people realize democracy can be at risk, tough questions started getting asked. I think that's a good thing &it was ultimately inevitable."

Climate for Asia Tech Listings and Deals Is Positive, Says GGV Capital's Lee

Jenny Lee, managing partner at China-focused venture-capital firm GGV Capital, said she is "pretty bullish" on the prospects for public listings and deals for tech companies, despite escalating tensions between the U.S. and China.

She said her firm has seven to eight portfolio companies preparing for IPOs this year one in China and the rest in overseas markets.

Among the big trends she and her colleagues are watching: how e-commerce is moving into offline services, emerging social networks for specific demographics in China, robotics, and disruption in the automotive sector.

Peng T. Ong, managing partner at Southeast-Asia focused Monk's Hill Ventures, likened the region of 600 million people to where China was a decade ago. "We have somewhat of a fuzzy crystal ball" for how startups will develop there, he said.

Chinese Electric Car Maker to Raise $1 Billion This Year

Chinese electric car manufacturer Xiaopeng Motors plans to raise more than $1 billion in additional funding this year, according to President Brian Gu.

Mr. Gu, who was one of JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s top bankers in Asia before joining the startup last month, cautioned that while liquidity is "abundant in this market," companies "have to be very careful selecting the right shareholders and investors."

The company, commonly known as Xpeng, is backed by Alibaba and Foxconn Technology Co., which co-led a 2.2 billion yuan ($347 million) funding round in January.

Mr. Gu also said China's recent move to ease rules on foreign auto makers will allow companies to have a greater presence on the mainland over the next few years.

Beijing said it would phase out rules requiring foreign auto makers to share factory ownership and profits with Chinese companies by 2022. That puts additional pressure on incumbent players in China to establish themselves now. And if they wait, they could face "very dark competitive pressure," he said.

Chinese Consumers Are Now Paying for Content

China is experiencing a revolution in terms of consumers paying for content, according to Patrick Grove, chairman and co-founder of iflix, a Southeast Asian video-streaming service.

Mr. Grove said there are more than 100 million consumers in China paying monthly subscriptions for video content on Chinese platforms, up from virtually nothing two years earlier.

By comparison, Mr. Grove said, Netflix Inc. has signed up 125 million people in seven years.

Three factors are driving online subscriptions, he said: exclusive content, mobile payments and Beijing's crackdown on piracy.

The popularity of mobile payments in China has been a key factor in growth by making it simple for consumers to subscribe, he noted. "For Hulu and Netflix, you have to pull out a credit card, which can be annoying &and in other countries you don't even have mobile payments, and it's freaking hard to get money out of people," Mr. Grove said.

Mr. Grove said iflix analyzes its own viewer data and information from other sources like YouTube to determine what original content to produce. He said iflix churned out seven original productions last year and is planning to produce 50 this year in multiple countries.

Microsoft and SenseTime: Expect More AI in Your Life

The artificial intelligence revolution is expanding into more areas of daily life, executives at Microsoft Corp. and SenseTime Group Ltd. said.

"We're training computers to recognize faces, recognize objects," said Bing Xu, co-founder of SenseTime, the world's most highly valued AI startup. "Computer vision has entered into 'Moore's Law' &sooner or later it's going to beat humans in recognizing things"

Ralph Haupter, president of Microsoft Asia, said one of the challenges confronting AI in the home is bringing a standard experience to the array of devices that are available to consumers.

"There is no standard at this stage and I think that's blocking to some extent the experience right now," he said.

Mr. Haupter said China's tech companies have unique opportunities and challenges.

"If you look at AI, you need data. China has that. You need talent. China has a lot of that," he said. "At the same time, all of the companies which are building businesses in China, they struggle because they either don't find a way to get out of the domestic market or they go to the U.S. immediately, and it's a very different company."

Separately, Mr. Bing said SenseTime is weighing a public offering.

Hyundai to Launch Self-Driving Car Effort

Hyundai Motor Co. will produce high-level self-driving cars and make them available in 2023, a senior executive said.

Hyundai plans to sell level-four autonomous driving vehicles, or cars that can perform all critical driving tasks and don't require a human to intervene, said Youngcho Chi, Hyundai's executive vice president.

Mr. Chi also said auto makers and technology companies will likely become less optimistic about rollout dates after a self-driving car struck and killed a pedestrian in the U.S. in March.

"I think auto makers, including the ICT companies, are less, let's say, rosy about their target date. It will most likely slip by six months or a year," he said.

Traditional auto makers have generally been cautious about quickly introducing autonomous-driving technologies due to safety concerns, while some tech firms have been less hesitant.

"No matter how they want to publicize it as being quite ready, there is a long way to go for full-autonomous capability," Mr. Chi said. "I hope that both auto makers and the new ICT companies stop this publicity game and try to focus more on the safety of the consumers."

Google to Introduce New India Mobile-Payment App to Other Markets

A unique mobile-payment app that Alphabet Inc.'s Google launched in India last year is reporting solid growth and will be introduced to other markets at some point, according to Caesar Sengupta, who leads the company's Next Billion Users team.

Mr. Sengupta said Google's Tez which means "fast" in Hindi now has 16 million active users. He said more than 350 million transactions have been performed since the app started operating in September.

"We thought we were late to the payments game in India, but we think we're already the number two player in this space," he said.

The free app allows users to transfer money to individuals and businesses without the use of a credit or debit card via a simple interface that resembles a chat app. It works in several Indian languages.

India's market leader is Paytm, which is backed by investors like SoftBank Group Corp. and Alibaba.

Mr. Sengupta said Tez could be rolled out in other parts of South Asia, markets in Southeast Asia and parts of sub-Saharan Africa.

He also sought to dispel the misconception that Google isn't active in China.

"We have more than 700 employees in China, we have three large offices," Mr. Sengupta said.

Uber Deal Has Been 'Transformational,' Grab President Says

The March deal that saw Uber Technologies Inc. quit its battle for Southeast Asia in exchange for a 27.5% stake in Singapore-based rival Grab Inc. has been "transformational" for the company and the region, Grab President Ming Maa said.

Mr. Maa said the acquisition "demonstrates the ability for us to compete against global companies world-wide."

It marked "the first time that a local Southeast Asian company has demonstrated an ability to develop a world class, a real enduring technology business," Mr. Maa said.

Asked what role SoftBank Group Corp. which backs both Grab and Uber played in the deal, Mr. Maa said SoftBank's Masayoshi Son "was very, very supportive." Mr. Maa in 2016 joined Grab from SoftBank, where he was an executive.

Asked about the possibility that Uber could strike a similar deal in India, where it is competing against local champion Ola, which is also backed by SoftBank, Mr. Maa said simply "that's a question for Dara," referring to Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi.

Hong Kong's Stock Exchange Will Land Big New Listings, CEO Says

The chief executive of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. is confident that the city will land some of the biggest listings in the future, including Saudi Arabian Oil Co., known as Aramco, tech giant Xiaomi Corp. and, in time, a dual listing for e-commerce titan Alibaba.

Charles Li said the exchange will open its doors to technology companies with a new dual shareholding structure in May, as the Asian financial hub competes with other global competitors for a bigger share of the new listing market.

The proposed changes include permitting IPOs that restrict shareholders' voting rights, secondary listings by Chinese and international companies already listed elsewhere and primary listings by unprofitable biotech firms.

The reforms are set to become effective April 30. The exchange will begin taking listing applications in early May, Mr. Li said.

"This probably is the largest reform we've ever had in the last 25 years," he said, adding that it's "only a matter of time" before the likes of Alibaba and Xiaomi list in Hong Kong.

How to Manage Content Under a News Clampdown

At the kickoff panel Thursday night, Beijing Bytedance Technology Co. Senior Vice President Zhen Liu said the government's recent clampdown on the company's news and entertainment app forced it to re-evaluate how it managed content.

"Social platform companies need to step up for more strict regulatory scrutinies," she said.

Chinese authorities claimed the company's humor site, Neihan Duanzi, had vuglar content. Authorities also ordered four news apps including Bytedance's personalized news app, Jinri Toutiao, to be temporarily removed from online stores. Toutiao is a personalized app that claims to have 120 million daily active users.

To make sure the content on its apps is trustworthy, Bytedance relies on both machine learning technology and human censors, Ms. Liu said

Appearing on the same panel, Fan Bao, chairman and chief executive of investment bank China Renaissance Partners, spoke about growing privacy concerns. In China, data is concentrated in the hands of internet giants, he said, yet antitrust rules aren't sufficient to address their clout, he said.

"If we can take another look at our antitrust regulations and redefine the ownership of data, and use that as metrics to address these issues, maybe there is way to go about it," he said.

Cryptocurrencies Have a Problem With Valuation

Much of the recent volatility for cryptocurrencies reflects the challenge that investors face in trying to value the asset, said Stefan Thomas, chief technology officer at Ripple, developer of the third-largest cryptocurrency of the same name.

"People are trying to figure out how to value these things so the volatility is the result of people dealing with a completely new asset category," he said. "The whole space is moving together. A lot of people aren't differentiating between the different assets and the different companies that they have."

Elizabeth Rossiello, founder and CEO of Bitpesa, said the volatility in cryptocurrencies can be a positive: "It means more liquidity comes into the space."

Ms. Rossiello said that operating in Africa, where financial markets are less regulated, presents a different type of opportunity. Transaction costs in African markets are higher, making the appeal of cryptocurrencies greater.

"When I tell a VC in Palo Alto that we're working in frontier markets, the eyebrows come off [his] head," she said.

Mr. Thomas ducked a question that has been dogging Ripple for some time: When will the currency be listed on Coinbase?

"We don't control that decision," he said. "The conversation's been going on for many years pretty much since Coinbase has existed."

Both panelists expressed cautious skepticism about the prospect of regulating cryptocurriences.

What Shopping in the Future Will Look Like; Stores will more deeply integrate artificial intelligence  into the shopping experience, says Andreessen Horowitz's Connie Chan

HONG KONG The online world is interacting with brick-and-mortar stores in radically new ways, fueling a revolution in how people shop, said Connie Chan, a partner at the Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.

Ms. Chan said retailers are scooping up more data about shoppers and their habits than ever before, in both online and real-world settings, helping them fine-tune the ways they match buyers with products.

"The offline world is being optimized by the online world," Ms. Chan said at The Wall Street Journal's D.Live conference in Hong Kong on Friday.

Ms. Chan pointed to Amazon.com Inc.'s new "Go" convenience store in Seattle as an example. Shoppers at the store are tracked by an array of sensors, and the store uses computer vision and machine-learning algorithms to charge shoppers, follow them through the store and learn about their buying habits.

Ms. Chan expects stores to more deeply integrate artificial intelligence into the shopping experience. For example, she said, stores in the future will allow shoppers to scan food for nutrition and other information, then suggest other items to round out a meal and guide shoppers through the store all while gathering and storing information about shoppers' buying habits.

The goal for retailers, she said, is "the massive, perfect profile of customers."

While retailers for years have been nudging consumers into physical stores with online ads, coupons and other enticements a business tactic called "online-to-offline," or O2O Ms. Chan said China is leading the next stage of this revolution, which she called "O2O 2.0."

For example, Walmart Inc. stores in China allow shoppers to pay for goods with WeChat, the social-media platform owned by Tencent Holdings Ltd. WeChat then uses the data on consumers' shopping habits to suggest shopping lists, coupons and other items.

"For a lot of merchants, that's data that they've never had before," she said.

She also cited efforts by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to join with small businesses to help them better monitor their inventory via its Alipay online payment platform.

To be sure, many consumers are growing more mindful of the ways in which their data is being gathered and used in the wake of the Facebook Inc. data breach. But in many cases, Ms. Chan said, "This is the world as it already is today."

Why Paying for Fast Shipping Could Get You Flagged as a Fraudster; Retailers use data-mining firms to track behavior of online shoppers and deny purchases that suggest fraud;  No solution is perfect'

When people shop online at retailers like Macy's Inc. and Finish Line Inc., their visits are tracked and shared with an outside firm that scores their behavior and decides whether to approve or deny purchases.

Shoppers who exhibit behavior that such scoring firms often associate with fraud, such as buying without checking the return policy or paying for the fastest shipping option, have a higher chance of getting declined. Sometimes they never find out why their transactions are canceled or who made the call.

Behind these decisions is a group of firms hired by retailers to weed out fraudulent online customers. They determine which indicators correlate with fraud and then evaluate shoppers based on hundreds of data points. A Tel Aviv-based company called Riskified works with Macy's and Finish Line. Its rivals include fellow startups like Signifyd and Forter, as well as players like CyberSource, which was acquired by Visa Inc. in 2010, and Accertify, which American Express Inc. bought the same year.

Online shopping has created new challenges for retailers trying to combat fraud, such as people using a stolen card or falsely reporting a transaction as fraudulent. Credit-card companies typically cover the cost of unauthorized purchases in stores. But with online transactions, retailers are usually on the hook when a customer reports a fraudulent charge.

As card issuers can't verify online purchases through chip-card technology and other measures, they take the money back from the retailer to reimburse the shopper, which means the store loses both the product and the cost of shipping.

Retailers are increasingly turning to third-party firms for help, but many don't publicize which firms they use, why customer purchases are declined or the criteria for the decision.

Michael Green, 50 years old, found out about one of the firms by accident. He ordered headphones online for his son's 18th birthday. Days later, when he hadn't heard anything about the order, he contacted the headphone brand, Audeze, which told him the purchase had been canceled because a third-party firm had determined he was a fraud risk.

Mr. Green noticed that the status of his order said "Riskified Rejected." When he emailed Riskified to ask why he had come up as a fraud risk, a customer service agent told him the company had no further information.

"There was no explanation, no appeal," said Mr. Green, a financial professional in Austin, Texas. "Big data affects a lot of things, but you never hear of it affecting your ability to return something or buy something in the first place."

Audeze CEO Sankar Thiagasamudram said it uses Riskified because, as a very small company, it can't afford to police fraud on its own. "Unfortunately, we do not have any visibility into Riskified's decision-making process," he said.

After The Wall Street Journal contacted Riskified, CEO Eido Gal said Mr. Green's order was incorrectly declined. "Riskified tends to be far more accurate and efficient than traditional fraud-prevention methods, but no solution is perfect, and we're still improving," he said.

Riskified evaluates shoppers based on online browsing behavior, along with other details like transaction data and geolocation information, and then issues approvals or denials at the time of purchase. A retailer can override a denial, but the retailer assumes responsibility if the purchase turns out to be fraudulent.

The threshold for issuing a decline varies by retailer and tends to be set lower when the products are more attractive to fraudsters. For example, Audeze's headphones are more prone to fraud because they are compact and cost up to $3,995, making them easy to transport and lucrative for resellers.

Riskified said it works with more than 1,000 merchants. Some retailers use its services only to assess international online orders. The company said it provides its clients with tools to understand the reason for declines, but leaves it up to the retailer to decide what it wants to tell shoppers.

A spokeswoman for Finish Line, a Riskified client, said that when the shoe retailer is contacted by customers whose purchases have been declined, it directs them to contact their banks because their information has often been compromised by some other means.

A spokeswoman for Macy's said the company uses such services "for the limited purpose of fraud detection."

"Like any company with a large online presence, Macy's has a robust fraud detection system that combines our proprietary internal detection resources with multiple vendor solutions," she said.

Chip-card technology has reduced fraud in stores, but many retailers say they are now seeing the behavior shift online. A third of the 50 largest retailers in the U.S. say online fraud has risen more than 30% since they transitioned to the new chip-related technology in 2015, according to a survey of members by the Retail Industry Leaders Association, a retail trade group.

Many retailers still use rule-based or manual systems, which decline purchases based on fixed criteria. Riskified said its use of machine learning and big data has reduced the number of erroneous declines.

"Our whole reason for being is to approve more transactions for the retailers," said Riskified's Mr. Gal. "Because we have so many resources and we have network effects across our merchants, we tend to have better performance than retailers managing this process internally."

Retailers have been scoring shoppers to combat other types of fraud. The Journal "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-your-returns-are-used-against-you-at-best-buy-other-retailers-1520933400" that Retail Equation, an Irvine, Calif. service, has been generating risk scores on people to limit the amount of merchandise they can return.

Red Flags

Examples of indicators firms use to score shoppers as potential fraudsters, according to people familiar with scoring firms

* Not bothering to compare prices

* Choosing the fastest shipping option

* Not checking the store's return policy

* Sorting by price and picking the most expensive items

* Using a proxy server--used to hide your location--when accessing the site

* Using an email address that doesn't match the name on your Facebook profile

Y Combinator's Altman Playing the Longevity Game; More newcomers are circling the antiaging sector, making it into one of Silicon Valley's most talked-about areas of health

Investors still have much to learn about how reliable a new class of so-called antiaging drugs will be to extend human life, but longevity-focused startups have never had a more receptive audience in Silicon Valley.

In an indication of its far-reaching interest, the field has attracted high-profile venture backers from outside the health and biotech sectors. One such signal came when Y Combinator President Sam Altman announced antiaging therapies would be the inaugural focus of the accelerator's upcoming "https://www.wsj.com/articles/y-combinator-launches-biotech-program-1515715170".

Mr. Altman has company among newcomers flocking to the longevity business. Adam Neumann, co-founder and chief executive of WeWork Cos. Inc., recently teamed up with longevity scientist David Sinclair "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-co-founders-next-gig-anti-aging-evangelist-1522904792", which aims to form a new generation of startups around the world that are working on therapies for age-related diseases and ways to extend healthy human life.

For his part, Mr. Altman said the decision to focus on longevity stems from the excitement taking hold in the investment world as well as the advancement of technology that has drastically reduced some of the risks associated with life sciences.

"Whenever we see a new area where critical ingredient costs have come down and there is a lot of talent in the field, then we start paying more attention," said Mr. Altman.

In another shift for Y Combinator, the accelerator has decided to pay more money and take a larger stake in the longevity track than it has done for previous cohorts. While the program typically invests $120,000 for a 7% stake in startups, YC Bio will invest $500,000 to $1 million for a 10% to 20% stake.

It will be a few more months before the world knows what kind of youth-preserving or healthy life extension projects the latest Y Combinator batch is working on, but current activity in the field spans genetic and molecular biology along with software-powered research methods.

Mr. Altman's investments through Y Combinator and as an individual skew hard tech, but longevity and health research has been on his radar for some time. Nectome Inc., a futuristic brain-preservation startup, was a notable member of Y Combinator's "https://www.wsj.com/articles/y-combinator-backer-of-dropbox-vaults-from-experiment-to-kingmaker-1521718200", of which 17% were biotech and health-care startups.

Mr. Altman has shown interest in Nectome beyond merely investing. He said he's on a waiting list of individuals who would let Nectome preserve their brain tissue at death and digitize information on the brain's neural activity.

Among other investments, Mr. Altman has backed as an individual Spring Discovery Inc., a newly launched startup employing machine learning to speed up longevity research. Last year, Y Combinator accepted cell-banking startup Forever Labs Inc., which collects and stores young adult stem cells for possible future therapeutic or rejuvenating uses.

BenevolentAI Ltd. has raised a fresh round of capital at a $2 billion pre-money valuation to develop an AI-powered drug discovery platform.

Its $115 million financing, which brings its total raised to more than $200 million, will help the company focus on a treatment Parkinson's product now in clinical trials and move additional drugs into human studies.

Investors in the round included Woodford Investment Management and undisclosed U.S. backers.

Biotech startups are turning to artificial intelligence to gain more insight from biological data and to speed drug discovery. Several AI-powered biotechs have attracted venture funding, including "https://www.wsj.com/articles/atomwise-steps-on-gas-to-accelerate-chemistry-1520425800?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1", which recently secured $45 million, and Recursion Pharmaceuticals, which raised $60 million late last year.

London-based BenevolentAI says its "bioscience machine brain" uses algorithms to analyze scientific data sources and generate insights into the causes of diseases. The system deciphers molecular processes of disorders and links disease signatures to patients, according to the company. The goal is to deliver the right drug to the right patient, founder and Chairman Ken Mulvany said.

BenevolentAI said it has initiated more than 20 drug programs. Its platform is being used to develop treatments for conditions such as Parkinson's disease, glioblastoma, motor neuron disease and sarcopenia, or muscle loss that accompanies aging.

Mr. Mulvany formed BenevolentAI in 2013 after the sale of another biotech company he founded, Proximagen Group, to Upsher-Smith Laboratories Inc. in 2012.

Goldman Earnings Get Boost On Trading

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reported sharply higher profit, looking more like the balanced business Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein has been working to build in the wake of the financial crisis.

The Wall Street firm's profit rose 26% from a year ago, one of the strongest showings among the five big U.S. banks to have reported quarterly earnings so far. Morgan Stanley reports Wednesday.

Shares fell, however, after Goldman said it wouldn't buy back stock in the second quarter.

Goldman's traders broke out of their funk, riding renewed volatility in the markets to a three-year revenue high. A lower firmwide tax rate helped results, too.

Gains came from nearly every one of the firm's businesses, including lending and asset management, two steadier, higher-return businesses that are far from Goldman's roots as a Wall Street powerhouse. Debt underwriting, an area Mr. Blankfein has specifically targeted for growth, had its second-best quarter on record.

Overall, the firm's return on equity, a closely watched measure of profitability, stood at 15.4% in the quarter, its highest since late 2012.

"All this positivity is driving me crazy," Mr. Blankfein joked in a Tuesday morning call with managing directors, according to attendees. "We've seen false dawns before."

Shares rose initially but closed down 1.7% after Chief Financial Officer Martin Chavez said on the firm's earnings call that Goldman wouldn't buy back any stock in the second quarter. Instead, it would plow its capital back into its business. The firm in September outlined a plan to add $5 billion in annual revenue by 2020. Supporting new initiatives, many of which won't be profitable for years, requires funding.

Goldman has spent more than $500 million on its new retail bank, hiring coders and making Silicon Valley acquisitions. It is exploring building a suite of commercial-banking and cash-management products, The Wall Street Journal reported this month.

It is also offering more capital to its trading clients. One common measure of risk-taking, known as value-at-risk, rose sharply in the quarter.

The lack of buybacks went over poorly among investors who would rather have their returns in the form of cash than wait to see if Goldman's executives can succeed on new initiatives, many of them in unfamiliar terrain.

"We've been transparent about our growth plans," Mr. Chavez said. "There is a clear demand from clients for our balance sheet, which provides an opportunity to deliver attractive returns."

Trading revenue rose 31% to its highest level in three years.

Goldman's fixed-income division, which stumbled badly in 2017, reversed course in the first quarter as markets came alive, up 23%. Stock-trading revenue rose 38% as fears of a trade war and the tumult in technology stocks sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average swinging wildly in March.

Investment banking, the business of arranging mergers and helping companies raise money, reported a 5% increase in revenue. A rise in underwriting compensated for a decline in merger fees.

The firm also slipped from its No. 1 perch in announced M&A, potentially worrisome given the importance of the business to Goldman's revenue and reputation. Executives said its pipeline of unannounced deals had increased from year-end.

Goldman is hiring rainmakers and chasing after deals it once deemed small-time in an effort to expand its already dominant M&A franchise. Mr. Chavez said Tuesday that Goldman has added 500 new investment-banking clients, halfway to its goal of 1,000.

A surprise bump came from the firm's portfolio of principal investments, which includes stakes in richly valued startups including ride-sharing app Uber Technologies Inc. and music-streaming service Spotify Technology SA.

Revenue rose 34% as Goldman sold or marked up the carrying value of investments, including credit-bureau TransUnion, artificial-intelligence firm Kensho Technologies Inc. and Spotify.

Tech Giants' Health-Care Moves Attract PE Attention; Bain study says technology giants may create opportunities in health-care space

Technology giants are preparing to invade the health-care sector, creating new challenges and opportunities for traditional health-care investors.

According to consulting firm Bain & Co.'s Global Healthcare Private Equity and Corporate M&A Report 2018, technology giants from outside of the health-care sector such as Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. are attracting more attention from sponsors.

Private-equity firms, in particular, have kept a close eye on moves by Amazon into the health-care space, said Nirad Jain, a partner at Bain. Although such players will inevitably compete for deal flow, these new entrants may also open up opportunities for sponsors.

"It is certainly the hot topic. I would say the biggest impact of Amazon is it has everyone thinking about the blurring of the lines within health care," said Mr. Jain.

Amazon plans to grow its medical supplies business to act as a vendor to U.S. health-care providers, according to the Bain report. The e-commerce company has also expressed a desire "https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazons-latest-ambition-to-be-a-major-hospital-supplier-1518517802?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=10", according to a recent report in The Wall Street Journal.

Amazon is not alone in its quest to change the health-care market. The report notes that in China, both Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. are investing in tools that utilize artificial intelligence to aid in diagnostics.

In addition, Apple announced earlier this year that electronic health records would be integrated into their Health app, while Samsung BioLogics has developed contract manufacturing capabilities for biopharmaceuticals.

Mr. Jain also cited the announcement earlier this year that Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. were forming a company to look at reducing heath-care costs for their U.S. employees, as one that prompted questions from private-equity sponsors.

Although these nontraditional investors are more involved in developing products for the health-care market, according to Mr. Jain, for private-equity funds willing to be flexible, this disruption could lead to opportunity. He sees these announcements as a way for private-equity firms in the health-care space to reposition themselves for growth.

The report adds that firms looking to invest in the health-care space should consider the ability of these new players to use their scale to challenge entrenched health-care areas such as pharmaceutical distribution, retail clinics and insurance.

Private-equity firms should also consider that the rising influence of technology players in the health-care sector may provide more opportunities for firms to sell their portfolio companies to these nontraditional investors.

Banking & Finance: Cohen Targets Fast Traders

Billionaire Steven A. Cohen is backing a startup that aims to prevent high-frequency traders from eating away at the profits of stock pickers like himself.

The venture-capital arm of Mr. Cohen's firm, Point72 Asset Management LP, was the first investor in Imperative Execution Inc., representatives of the two firms said. They didn't specify the investment size. The startup is set to launch a new "dark pool" trading platform designed to counter the impact of certain high-speed trading strategies.

High-frequency trading, or HFT, firms use computers to buy and sell stocks in the blink of an eye. They seek to profit from fleeting price moves or inefficiencies in the machinery of financial markets, rather than analysis of companies' financials or economic trends.

Many big investors say HFT erodes their profits because prices often drop when a large player is selling, or rise when the large player is buying -- a phenomenon called "slippage" that is often blamed on speedy traders.

Slippage is "a multibillion-dollar-a-year problem" for the hedge-fund industry, said Matthew Granade, managing partner of Point72 Ventures.

Advocates of HFT say criticism of electronic trading is overblown. They say it has actually reduced costs for investors by reducing the so-called bid-ask spread, or the difference between the buying and selling price of stocks.

Imperative founder and Chief Executive Roman Ginis previously worked as a quantitative trader for Mr. Cohen's firm, applying statistical models to trade stocks. He said he waged a daily battle to prevent slippage from hurting his profits.

Imperative's trading venue, called IntelligentCross, will be a dark pool -- a type of trading platform subject to lighter regulation than exchanges.

Dark pools, unlike exchanges, generally don't broadcast the prices at which traders are willing to buy or sell stocks. That makes them attractive for big investors looking to execute large trades without signaling their intentions to the market. For startups like Imperative, it is also much easier to launch a new dark pool than a new exchange, due to the simpler approval process.

The Imperative platform won approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission this year. The Stamford, Conn.-based firm, which has 10 employees, aims to launch the platform in May.

The launch comes as Mr. Cohen has been working to clean up his image. His prior company, SAC Capital Advisors LP, pleaded guilty to insider trading in 2013. Mr. Cohen was never criminally charged. He later reached a deal with regulators that barred him from managing outside money for two years.

After that ban expired this year, Point72 opened to outside investors. But Mr. Cohen's return was roiled by a February lawsuit by a female employee accusing Point72 of discrimination. The firm has said it "emphatically denies" the allegations. The lawsuit is pending.

The venture arm of Point72 has invested in other financial-technology companies such as Quantopian, a do-it-yourself online platform for quants, and SAY, which aims to help smaller shareholders use their proxy voting rights.

IntelligentCross could undermine IEX Group Inc., an exchange that has also battled HFT on behalf of traditional investors. Founded in 2012, IEX has struggled to be more than a niche player, handling 2.3% of U.S. stock volume in March, data show.

"IEX has not fulfilled its vision of solving the slippage problem for stocks," said Ian Sigalow, a partner at Greycroft LLC, a venture-capital firm that also has invested in Imperative.

An IEX spokesman responded: "Public data and industry reports continue to verify IEX's success in combating predatory HFT, and we welcome others to join us in the fight to protect investors." He pointed to an October report from Jefferies that showed IEX beats other exchanges on measures of slippage.

Imperative is entering a crowded market with about a dozen exchanges and more than 30 other dark pools. To win business, it must convince brokers to route their customers' orders to IntelligentCross. Imperative says it has already convinced some big investment banks to connect. It didn't name them, but said it would list them on its website once it gets their permission.

The new venue will use a variety of tricks to foil fast traders. A key feature is that it executes trades only at discrete points in time, rather than continuously, the way exchanges work. The length of the intervals varies randomly, which Imperative says will keep the speedy traders from figuring out a pattern and gaming the platform's design.

The idea of "noncontinuous" trading venues isn't new. But Imperative says it has added a new element by using artificial intelligence, or AI. Its systems will monitor for whether trades on IntelligentCross are causing stock prices to move, and adjust the length of its intervals to minimize such slippage, using AI-powered software.

Like for many traders, slippage was a day-to-day headache for him.

"No one's found the silver bullet to solve this problem," Mr. Ginis said. "We've found a new approach that we believe will work better over time."

South Korean Investors Pile Into U.S. Commercial Property Debt; Some 21% of foreign investment in U.S. real-estate debt as of mid-April came from the Asian nation

U.S. commercial real-estate owners are raking in debt capital from South Korean investors hunting for higher returns and better asset diversification.

In New York City, KTB Asset Management recently agreed to provide a five-year, fixed-rate loan to RFR Holdings for the refinancing of 285 Madison Ave., while IGIS Asset Management provided $220 million in debt for 787 7th Ave., according to a report by JLL Global Capital Markets.

In all, investors based in South Korea accounted for 21% of foreign investment in U.S. real-estate debt as of mid-April, the largest proportion among foreign investors, according to data firm Preqin. Canada and Australia are second and third place, at 12% and 11%, respectively. Global fundraising for U.S.-focused real-estate debt reached $17.8 billion in 2017, up from $10.8 billion in 2016, Preqin said.

Many institutional investors in the U.S. already have been "https://www.wsj.com/articles/private-equity-funds-focused-on-property-raising-less-capital-1514909299", despite widespread expectations the current real-estate cycle is near a peak and property prices might get wobbly. Debt is seen as a safer bet and provides some cushion for lenders depending on the loan-to-value ratio. Generally, if a property has an 80% loan-to-value, it implies that property prices have to fall more than 20% before the lenders take a loss.

In particular, brokers said investors from South Korea, including insurers and asset managers, have been stepping up their search for commercial mortgage-backed securities and debt funds in the U.S. to partner with. South Korean investors are more interested in real-estate debt than equity, said Stella Hsu, a director dealing with alternative investment overseas for Seoul-based KTB Asset Management Co.

Part of the attraction is expectation of higher yields in the U.S. compared with back home. The 10-year government bond yield in South Korea is 2.6%, while the 10-year U.S. Treasury, up sharply in the past few months, now yields about 2.8%.

"With U.S. interest rates still rising and property prices having gone pretty high, real-estate purchases for now may risk incurring a loss. We're interested in stable [interest payments]," said Ms. Hsu. She declined to elaborate on deals KTB is currently working on. IGIS Asset Management didn't respond to requests for comment.

Investing in real-estate development could deliver higher returns, but South Koreans tend to view the risk as being too high, analysts said.

"Despite all the troubles in the U.S., it's still seen as a safe harbor for their money," said Jim Costello, senior vice president at Real Capital Analytics. "They are not speculators. They're not coming here thinking they'd beat the market. This is cautious money."

Apart from directly extending loans to owners of big buildings, other investors are looking to invest in debt funds that invest in a pool of mortgages backing smaller properties.

M360 Advisors, a commercial real-estate debt fund based in Ladera Ranch, Calif., said it has raised $150 million from an institutional investor in South Korea over the past year since it registered with the South Korea Financial Supervisory Service, the country's financial regulator.

Evan Gentry, chief executive of M360 Advisors, said the South Korean institutional investor flew in with its own team of auditors before making its first investment in the fund.

M360 Advisors said it raised $400 million to $500 million since it was launched 2 years ago and invests in debt backing income-producing office, apartment, industrial, retail and hotel properties nationwide. M360 Advisors said it only makes first lien loans, which are the highest priority debt in the event of default.

"They think favorably about the U.S., and they're entrepreneurial and willing to act quickly," said Mr. Gentry.

Housing Starts Edge Higher as Apartment Construction Surges; Starts for buildings with five units or more jumped 16.1% from a month earlier

WASHINGTON U.S. housing starts increased in March but single-family home construction pulled back, which could spell continued inventory shortages and rapid price increases for buyers in the coming months.

Total "http://www.census.gov/construction/nrc/pdf/newresconst.pdf" from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.319 million, the Commerce Department said Tuesday.

The increase was driven by a ramp up in construction of multifamily housing. Starts for buildings with five units or more jumped 16.1% from a month earlier, even as starts for single-family homes declined 3.7%.

"It is a step back for single family and a surge forward for multifamily," said Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com. "For single family, it's the opposite of what we need to see."

Housing-starts data are volatile from month to month and can be subject to large revisions. Multifamily activity is subject to especially large swings. March's 1.9% rise in starts came with a margin of error of 12.4 percentage points.

Residential building permits, which signal how much construction is in the pipeline and tend to be more reliable month-to-month, increased 2.5% to an annual pace of 1.354 million last month. Single-family permits were down 5.5% compared with February.

After a five-year boom in apartment construction, builders have been pulling back on new projects in the past year due to an excess of supply in many major urban markets. Economists expect new multifamily starts to be essentially flat this year compared with last year, while they are expecting a near three-decade high in the number of units completed as projects work their way through the pipeline.

"If there is one surprise, it's just the length of this multifamily cycle," said Jay Parsons, a vice president at real estate software and analytics firm RealPage. "While supply is outpacing demand, there's still an awful lot of demand."

If the acceleration in multifamily starts continues it could signal that developers are shifting back to building rental properties as single-family demand faces headwinds. Rising interest rates and a tax code that is less favorable to homeownership have emerged in recent months as possible challenges.

Single-family starts are down nearly 5% so far this year in the northeast, the region of the country likely to be the most impacted by tax changes that kicked in this year.

"The change toward multifamily could be the initial signs that affordability is starting to impact the mix of construction," said Tendayi Kapfidze, chief economist at LendingTree. "Notably, single-family starts are particularly weak in the high-cost northeast, which is also the most exposed region to the negative impacts of the tax plan." Among other things, the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-tax-law-will-help-some-housing-markets-1514116801" limits deductions for property taxes, which tend to be higher in the northeast.

Still, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/american-housing-shortage-slams-the-door-on-buyers-1521395460". Single-family construction is about half of what it was at the peak of the last housing market in 2006 and 30% below normal levels, which is helping to drive up prices and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/just-how-widespread-is-the-housing-shortage-1523876401" in many markets, according to Ms. Hale of Realtor.com. Economists expect single-family starts to increase 5% to 10% this year, not enough to meet demand.

Builder confidence slipped in April, according to the National Association of Home Builders' monthly survey. Builders indicated that the unusually long winter in many parts of the country dampened demand and held back construction.

Builders also cite soaring lumber prices and labor shortages as major obstacles to ramping up construction. That could especially affect builders targeting young buyers.

"If you think about an entry-level home builder who is now entering that space, that's going to be a big factor," said Rob Dietz, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders.

Longer-term, housing construction is still strengthening. Overall starts increased by 8% in the first three months of 2018 compared with the same period a year earlier.

Wessel's Take: The Three Ts; When central bankers and finance ministers from around the world convene in Washington this week for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, there'll be three big themes in the air: Trade, technology and trust.

When central bankers and finance ministers from around the world convene in Washington this week for the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, there'll be three big themes in the air: Trade, technology and trust.

Trade, of course, is on everyone's mind for obvious reasons. For central bankers, the question is whether President Donald Trump's tough talk on trade will lead to actions here and abroad that'll disrupt an otherwise promising global economic outlook   and, if so, whether that should influence monetary policy. A "strong majority" of Federal Reserve officials viewed "the prospect of retaliatory trade actions by other countries, as well as other issues and uncertainties associated with trade policies, as downside risks for the U.S. economy," according to the minutes of the Fed's March "https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20180321.pdf". Meanwhile, the president's "https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/985858100149309441" suggest that he may suddenly have realized that higher U.S. interest rates may lead to an appreciation of the U.S. dollar.

Technology poses two big questions for central bankers. First, how should they regard fintech and cryptocurrencies? Do they threaten financial stability? Are current regulatory regimes suited for these new technologies? And do the changes in the technology of finance change the way monetary policy is "https://www.brookings.edu/events/digital-currencies-implications-for-central-banks/"? The second question is even bigger: How will artificial intelligence and related technologies change the economy? Will they increase productivity? Will they produce a golden age of growth or a dysfunctional era of displaced workers? How does AI influence projections of the long-term natural equilibrium interest rate?

And then there is trust. The "https://twitter.com/OECD/status/985496738558627840" from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development documents the decline in public trust in government around the world.

International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde"http://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2018/04/09/spring-meetings-curtain-raiser-speech" that the multilateral "system of rules and shared responsibility is now in danger of being torn apart." Respect for technocrats who make policy based on facts and analysis is eroding, a challenge to central bankers whose independence from the political process depends on public confidence that they are both competent and are acting in the interests of the whole economy.

The economic weather right now is sunny   and that is surely welcome. But there are some dark clouds on the horizon.

David Wessel is a contributing correspondent for The Wall Street Journal and director of the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution. "http://www.brookings.edu/hutchinscenter"

JAKARTA Bank Indonesia will likely keep borrowing costs unchanged Thursday, a policy that may continue through the first half of the year as inflation remains in check.

All 10 economists polled by The Wall Street Journal predicted the central bank will keep its benchmark 7-day reverse repo rate at 4.25% as tightening at this time may clip growth in the Southeast Asia's largest economy. In September it cut the rate by a quarter of a percentage point.

"Tightening policy too soon would risk hurting already-subdued consumption," said Moody's Analytics.

Still, cutting interest rates further isn't an option as policy normalization in advanced economies along with the U.S.'s trade policies, have shaved 1.6% off the rupiah's value against the dollar.

The central bank has said it is closely watching the potential for a trade war between the U.S. and its trading partners, which it said was a downside risk to the global economic outlook and already-jittery financial markets.

"Using interest rates as an instrument to help economic growth is not an option at this time" as the yield differential between rupiah and dollar assets have become less attractive, said Bank Indonesia's director Nanang Hendarsyah.

Moody's Investors Service Friday upgraded Indonesia's creditworthiness by one notch to Baa2, among other reasons it said Bank Indonesia has established a record of prioritizing macroeconomic stability over promoting short-term growth.

It also met inflation targets for the past three consecutive years and inflation expectations have proved to be anchored at moderate levels, the ratings company said

China s move to use data from the country s tech giants to establish its first consumer credit ratings is raising thorny questions about informationsharing among rivals like Alibaba and Tencent.

Consumer lending scarcely existed in China a few years back, but has sinceblossomedto a Rmb7tn ($1.1tn) marketplace. Peer-to-peer lenders like Ping An Insurance's Lufaxandother online lenders like the Alibaba-backed Qudian have leadthe charge.

But experts warn that the growth of consumer lending has far outstripped the availability ofborrowers' data, since China lacks the credit bureau infrastructure that's common in manydeveloped markets. Borrowers' data are the lifeblood of underwriting decisions, andurgent demand for datain Chinahas led to athrivingblack marketin stolen information.

Recognising this problem, China s central bank in 2015selectedeight companies including units of Tencent and Ant Financial, the finance affiliate of Alibaba, to establish consumer credit-rating groups.

But regulatorslaterbaulkedat the potential conflicts of interest inherent in letting tech groups issue ratings for their own customers.If, for example, the act of frequentlyusing a particular platform would increase a user s credit score, a consumer might feel pressure to use that platformfor that reason, even if theywould otherwise prefer a rival service.

None of the eight companies selected in 2015 havereceived licences to begin publishing credit scores, and it now appears they never will. The People s Bank of Chinahalteda beta test of Tencent s system earlier this year only one day after its nationwide launch.

Instead, in late January thePBoCgrantedthe country s first consumer credit-rating licence to a newly created company, Baihang Credit Scoring. Baihang is a joint venture in which the original eight companies selected in 2015 each own an 8 per cent stake. The remaining 36 per cent share is held by the National Internet Finance Association, a state-controlled industry group. Baihang will aggregate data from its shareholders to produce credit ratings.

But this model raises difficult questions about what kind of proprietary data members will be willing to share with a joint venture that includes theirdirect competitors.

Local media have reported that data sharing is likely to be limited to basic information such as an individual s borrowing history and his or her currently outstanding liabilities. Limiting the scope of data sharing will ease Baihang shareholders'concerns about the sharing of valuable proprietary data, but it will also narrow the possibilities for credit scores based on innovative use of "big data" such as, thehuge troveof purchase records available to Alipay and Tencent s rival payments service, WeChat pay.

The result could be a more atomised landscape in which Ant Financial and Tencent use proprietary data internally to assess an individual s qualification to access those companies  own loan services but do not publish scores that are accessible to third-party consumer lenders.

This outcome would resolve the explicit conflict of interest problembecause groups like Tencent and Ant Financial will not be publishing their own credit ratings. But the arrangement creates its own challenges.

The PBoC's goal isto prevent Alibaba and Tencent from accumulating monopoly-like market power. Yet the way the credit research market is shaping upcould end up entrenchingAlibaba and Tencent s dominance by allowing them to conduct sophisticated credit assessments not available to smaller rivals, which must rely primarily on more primitive scores from Baihang.

Banks

Barclays has set up a new venture capital-style unit with the aim of adding billions of pounds to its annual revenues by 2025, in an effort to find new areas of growth after years of restructuring.

Barclays UK Ventures will be led by Ben Davey, formerly the bank's head of strategy. Mr Davey said he wanted the unit to develop at least one "truly transformational new business line" that would add a "material contribution" to the bank's revenues over the next five to seven years.

He pointed to areas such as artificial intelligence, distributed ledgers and smart contracts as examples of the technology areas BUKV is likely to explore, but added that the business had a "relatively unfettered mandate" to consider different opportunities.

Established companies have taken an increasingly important role in technology investment in recent years, with corporate-led investments continuing to grow even as volumes in the wider venture capital sector fall.

Corporate investors accounted for 18 per cent of global venture capital deals in 2017, up from 8 per cent in 2011, according to data from PitchBook and Global Corporate Venturing, which monitor the sector.

Santander, Credit Suisse and UBS are currently the most active European banks in terms of the number of investments in fintechs, according to a report published by research company CB Insights last week.

Barclays has previously taken stakes in companies such as messaging platform Symphony and payments processing group Form3. However, in addition to traditional equity investments, BUKV will also consider commercial partnerships with different companies and work to develop new business ideas internally.

"We're going to be very open minded on operating models with the best of these ideas," Mr Davey added.

Barclays did not give details of the amount of money it was prepared to dedicate to the new unit, but Mr Davey said he was "very comfortable" with the amount of capital that had been earmarked for projects.

Mr Davey said Barclays had reached a point in time where it could focus on returning to growth after largely completing tasks such as building its capital base and dealing with legacy litigation issues.

DCVC in Talks to Launch Major Growth Fund; Firm focused on deep-tech startups is said to be exploring a fund in the high hundreds of millions of dollars in size

Matthew Ocko and Zachary Bogue are contemplating a jump into the big leagues with a new growth fund at their venture firm DCVC, also known as Data Collective.

DCVC, based in Palo Alto, Calif., focuses on deeply technical startups in areas like robotics, space, biotechnology and nuclear power.

The firm's principals have begun talks with some limited partners about a new fund that would be in the high hundreds of millions of dollars in size, according to people familiar with the situation.

"I've done plenty of LP reference calls for them, talking to the guys who can get you to that size fund," said Paul Martino, general partner at Bullpen Capital. Mr. Martino said Mr. Ocko is a close friend and the two have co-invested on deals.

Mr. Ocko declined to discuss any specific fundraising plans but said that, theoretically, a growth fund would make sense.

DCVC is one of a few venture firms along with Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures and Lux Capital that have been making a serious push into technically challenging startups.

"You have some investors that are tourists and some that are here to stay &.[DCVC] is here to stay," said Josh Wolfe, whose firm Lux Capital shares several portfolio companies with DCVC, including satellite imaging startup Planet Labs Inc.

Speaking of Mr. Ocko, Mr. Martino said: "He's investing in core science and in areas that no one else has the smarts or desire or lack of fear to go in."

DCVC looks for startups that have unique algorithms, large and proprietary data sets, and technical teams, according to Mr. Ocko.

Mr. Ocko and Mr. Bogue raised their first institutional fund at about $90 million in 2012. The firm currently manages assets of $1 billion across seven funds.

DCVC started out by doing seed deals, but quickly added growth deals. The firm participated in growth deals totaling about $415 million last year, according to PitchBook Data Inc. Those included, for example, leading a $75 million "https://www.wsj.com/articles/rocket-lab-raises-capital-at-billion-dollar-valuation-for-space-launches-1490101245", which launches satellites into orbit.

The firm has also been willing to lead large early-stage rounds, such as a $102 million "https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2017/11/02/element-ai-taps-former-ibm-innovation-leader-to-help-steer-growth-path-2"Inc., which helps corporations deploy artificial intelligence, or a $45 million Series A for drug-discovery platform Atomwise Inc.

DCVC looks for startups that have unique algorithms, large and proprietary data sets, and technical teams, according to Mr. Ocko.

To help with technical due diligence, deal flow and advice to companies, DCVC relies on dozens of "equity partners." They are technical experts from academia and large corporations, who get between one-third and one-half of DCVC's carried-interest fee, according to Mr. Ocko.

Now that it is pursuing a larger fund and an even bigger growth strategy, Data Collective is joining many other early-stage investors that have moved into growth. Mr. Ocko, who earned a bachelor's degree in physics from Yale, said that growth funds are warranted especially for firms that invest in science-based technology companies.

In technically complicated sectors, "outsiders have a hard time getting it, and deep-tech companies don't have metrics that are suited to outsiders," Mr. Ocko said. The idea is to invest "a half-step" before standard growth funds would become interested, with confidence based on many years of working with a startup, he said.

Some LPs, however, have expressed concerns when early-stage investors start growth funds. This can lead to lower returns, conflicts of interest that arise from reinvesting in existing portfolio companies, as well as missing out on a chance to sell a company in favor of holding on for uncertain long-term returns.

"You want to support your best companies. It's tempting to try to do that," said Jason Andris, managing director at fund-of-funds manager Venture Investment Associates, who said he wasn't referring to a specific firm.

"But not all companies are suited for going long," Mr. Andris added. "Oftentimes, an early bird in the hand with a nice exit return multiple may prove to be ultimately the better option, (rather) than doubling down and taking on unknown macro risks."

Goldman Sachs Earnings: What to Watch; Goldman Sachs is set to report its first-quarter results before the market opens on Tuesday

Goldman Sachs Inc. is set to report its first-quarter results before the market opens on Tuesday. Here's what you need to know.

Revenue to outstrip profits: Analysts are predicting revenue growth of 8.8% from a year ago, to $8.7 billion. But profit is expected to grow just 2.4% to $2.2 billion.

A Trading Bump: The market jitters early this year should bode well for Goldman's trading desk. But not all volatility is created equal. The mostly directional moves in asset prices early in the quarter a steady drop in the dollar's value, upwardly moving interest rates devolved into chaos in its final weeks, which can be just as bad for banks' trading desks as utter calm. JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., "https://www.wsj.com/graphics/bank-earnings/", did better in equities but disappointed in fixed-income.

A Lower Bar: Don't be overly impressed by headline increases in trading revenue. Goldman underperformed its peers in the first quarter of 2017, meaning that even results that are on par with peers will produce a bigger headline jump.

League-Table Laggards: Goldman slipped from its number one perch in the closely watched M&A league tables in the first quarter, trailing both Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan. The year is still young, but given the importance of that business to Goldman's results and reputation, analysts may want extra reassurances that the pipeline is strong.

Investment Gains: The X-Factor in Goldman's earnings is often its opaque "Investing and Lending" segment, which comprises everything from plain-vanilla mortgages to highly illiquid investments in private startups. There were bright spots in the first quarter: Goldman sold its last shares of credit bureau TransUnion at a profit; Kensho, an artificial-intelligence firm that Goldman invested in, was sold to S&P Global; and the value of streaming-service Spotify AB, another Goldman investment, rose ahead of its April 3 market debut.

Marcus Numbers: Goldman hasn't given much detail about how Marcus, the consumer-loan business it launched in 2016, is doing. That was understandable in its early days; borrowers typically stay current in their first few months. But as the portfolio ages, investors will expect more detail about how it is performing, especially as consumer-loan delinquencies have been rising elsewhere. Citigroup said last week that the percentage of its North American consumer loans going bad had risen to 2.77% from 2.63% a year ago.

Private Equity Revisits Strategies to Avoid Failed Bids

Corrections & Amplifications

An earlier version of this article incorrectly attributed a quote on the renegotiation of deal terms to Adam Weinstein. The quote now is accurately attributed to Jay M. Sakalo.

Despite a thriving buyout market last year, some U.K. and European firms are revisiting their acquisition strategies to help prevent deals from falling apart.

Private-equity buyouts boomed in 2017, rising to $127.7 billion of investment in the region, up from $109.8 billion in 2016, the highest amount in at least five years, according to data provider Dealogic Ltd.

But the total value of deals that failed or were revised in the U.K. and Europe also hit a five-year high, rising to $14.9 billion, the data provider said, as political headwinds impacted some deals while others were revised against a backdrop of sky-high asset prices.

Failed or withdrawn bids comprised 11.6% of the overall value of deals that completed or were pending last year, up from 7.6% in 2016, according to the Dealogic data. The numbers included an unsuccessful bid by Bain Capital and Cinven to acquire listed German pharmaceutical company Stada Arzneimittel AG that failed to get sufficient shareholder approval. The two private-equity firms eventually struck a deal to buy the company in September 2017 after increasing their offer to minority shareholders including activist investor Elliott Management, which had built a 15.2% stake in the company as of August.

Drivers of canceled Deals

A report released by ratings agency Standard & Poor's in March identified five main drivers of canceled deals, including "perceived price discount," where shareholders believe their positions are worth more than the offer price. Larger deals are also more prone to failure as it is harder for bidders to arrange financing, according to the report, which also cited the buyer's market capitalization, chief executive's age and antitrust concerns as other risk factors.

The number of withdrawn and failed deals stayed relatively flat in Europe in 2017, with seven deals falling through compared with six the previous year, but the total value of the deals was larger overall. The rate of failure was also much higher than in the U.S. market, where only two deals collapsed or were withdrawn last year, comprising just 1% of total deals in the country that year, according to Dealogic.

"The biggest cause for deals to fall over is when the target company underperforms in the ensuing weeks and months after they've received an offer from a buyer based on the financial forecasts they provided," said Rob Donaldson, a London-based corporate finance head at consulting firm RSK UK. "What we're seeing in Europe is that the prices of target European companies have been very high."

By comparison, a fall in borrowing costs due to a swell of specialized lenders has counteracted price hikes in the U.S. by giving buyers easier access to acquisition financing on attractive terms, according to Jay M. Sakalo, law firm Bilzin Sumberg Baena Price and Axelrod LLP's restructuring and corporate practice group leader.

Jeff Holzmann, managing director of a New York-based real-estate-focused investment platform, iintoo USA, said Brexit was a potential "obvious suspect" for deals that fail in Europe. He said his firm plans to eschew the U.K. and Europe until there is "more clarity" on "where their currencies are going."

"I'm a prime example of buyers who backed out of Europe and are party to more deals in the U.S. consummating," he said. "Even if the actual deal metrics are the same, a lot of investors are scared because of uncertainty and currency speculations."

Mr. Donaldson added that making financial forecasts to private-equity buyers has been much harder following the U.K.'s decision to leave the European Union.

Private-equity firms are doing more preparatory work in advance of deals amid the uncertainties caused by Brexit, added Antoon Schneider, a senior partner and managing director at Boston Consulting Group in London. He said firms are starting to assess pressure points even before they make a bid. "Private-equity firms are also building their capabilities in analytics and are willing to underwrite growth into more digitally focused businesses," he said. "So, the upside from that digital growth is something that private-equity shops are increasingly buying into."

Digging Deep

Adam Weinstein, a partner in the New York office of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld LLP, said sophisticated private-equity buyers are "digging very deep."

"They analyze the risks associated with target companies and ask lots of questions while also tapping the right advisers for all aspects of their M&A due diligence," he said.

"I'm still seeing transactions where we're renegotiating the terms after the initial agreement is signed. But, on these deals, we're seeing a more conscientious analysis," added Mr. Sakalo.

Buyers are also increasing the dialogue they have with companies they want to buy in advance of purchases, hiring operating partners to support their acquisitions and focusing on cheaper assets with more potential rather than competing for the best and highest-priced assets, according to advisers.

Others are taking care to limit the amount of leverage they use in deals, as well as using insurance products to protect against specific risks.

London-listed investment firm JZ Capital Partners Ltd., which invests in U.S. and European microcap companies, added $35.1 million to its net asset value when it sold Bolder Healthcare Solutions to a trade buyer in March 2018. The deal was funded through 50% of equity and 50% of senior bank debt provided at about three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to David Zalaznick, Chairman and Chief Executive of JZ Capital Partners. That is roughly half the five to six times Ebitda at which buyers could get loans to fund their acquisitions in 2017, according to Mr. Donaldson, who labeled the average level of debt being used by private-equity firms as "pretty aggressive."

"As long as the deals make sense and are not being done at inflated valuations, based on stock market values, they should work out well," Mr. Zalaznick said.

Commonwealth meeting

The leaders of 52 Commonwealth countries are to meet in London and Windsor. The Commonwealth represents 2.4bn people and includes some of the world s fastest-growing and richest economies, including India, South Africa, Australia and Canada. The UK s decision to leave the EU has helped the meeting take greater importance and trade is expected to dominate the summit. Improving education for girls, the legacy of human rights abuses in Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe s possible readmission to the Commonwealth are likely to be discussed.

World Bank-IMF spring meetings

Fears that the world s two biggest economies   the US and China   are heading toward a trade war are set to dominate discussions at this week s spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.

After a decade of ho-hum growth the global economy is buzzing again.

Christine Lagarde, the IMF s managing director, says the fund remains optimistic about the state of the global economy. It predicted 3.9 per cent growth for the world in January and is likely to reinforce that forecast, or tinker only modestly with it, when it releases its new estimates on Tuesday.

But the IMF is also increasingly concerned about the rising threats of protectionism and the tit-for-tat tariff wars that the US and China have begun to engage in. The World Trade Organization warned last week that any escalation by the US or China could put a damper on what is otherwise expected to be a strong year for global trade, one of the main drivers of broader growth in recent years.

US banks

Investors will focus on two big questions this week, as three of the biggest US banks   Bank of America (Monday), Goldman Sachs (Tuesday) and Morgan Stanley (Wednesday)   continue the first-quarter earnings season.

First, to what extent did the banks revel in brighter trading conditions, boosted by a return of volatility to financial markets? Results so far, from JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, suggest a definite upturn in volumes. And how well did Goldman do? It was the real laggard on Wall Street last year. But according to Royal Bank of Canada estimates, it is set for the biggest year-on-year rise in trading revenues this quarter, up about 8 per cent, and will be the only one of the big six to record a double-digit gain for the full year, up 13 per cent.

A second big question is over the health of retail banking. Are there signs of strain in BofA s consumer businesses such as car loans and credit cards, after years of steadily improving conditions? And as interest rates continue to rise, is the bank   finally   beginning to pay more for deposits?

Macron s EU speech

France s president Emmanuel Macron is due to become the latest European leader to address the European Parliament as part of its  Future of Europe  plenary sessions. Mr Macron s keynote address comes on the heels of France joining with the US and Britain for missile attacks on Syria and crippling industrial action by French rail unions opposed to his contentious plans to overhaul the state railway operator. Mr Macron s ambitions of deepening EU integration are likely to be welcomed by many in the assembly but there are some signs of resistance from Germany now its new  grand coalition  government has been finalised.

China GDP

China reports first-quarter gross domestic product. Activity data over the first two months suggest that the manufacturing recovery continues, but at a marginally slower pace than in the second half of 2017. Industrial activity and retail sales growth are expected to remain resilient, on a stable rather than accelerating path, according to HSBC Global Research.

* The Chinese economy is rebalancing, at last

Abe visits Trump

Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe and Donald Trump are set to hold talks at the US president s Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida ahead of a summit between Mr Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in late May or early June. Mr Abe will be making his second visit to Mar-a-Lago   North Korea launched a ballistic missile test the first time he visited Mr Trump in February 2017. The pair are also likely to discuss US tariffs on imports of aluminium and steel, the Indo-Pacific region and Chinese activity in the South China Sea, which has raised tension in the region.

* Trade wars are easy to win

IBM

IBM is expected to maintain rising revenues, but suffer a dip in profits, when it reports first-quarter results. Spending on modernising the group s cloud, mobile and data analytics businesses are likely to boost revenues, along with strong uptake of IBM s new mainframe product. Demand for cyber security and work related to data compliance in Europe is also on the up. Last quarter the group reported revenues of $22.5bn, its first revenue growth in nearly six years.

Wednesday

Johnson & Johnson

Healthcare company Johnson & Johnson is forecast to report higher first-quarter profit, thanks to cost cuts and cancer drug sales. The impact of US tax reforms is less likely to affect J&J as some US pharma companies, which means earnings per share growth is unlikely to be quite so dramatic as that of sales. The prospect of generic rivals emerging and the company s acquisition strategy will remain of interest to investors.

* J&J s Remicade sales skid amid cheaper competition

Alcoa

Alcoa is expected to report higher revenues, led by improving alumina and aluminium prices. Investors will watch to see how steel and aluminium companies benefit from US tariffs on metal imports.

* US businesses seek clarity on Trump tariff plans

UK inflation

The Office for National Statistics consumer price index is forecast to come in at 2.7 per cent for March, in line with February s reading, which fell surprisingly sharply, and holding below the 3 per cent recorded in January. Food prices are thought to have been slightly weaker after surging on the back of the weaker pound and fuel prices are forecast to have suffered a bigger month-on-month drop than last year. Air fares, which rode during the Easter bank holiday after falling earlier in the year, are likely to have helped offset the drop.

* Grocery price inflation slows sharply for second month in row

Thursday

Cuba

Ral Castro is set to step down as president of Cuba and is likely to be replaced by Miguel Daz-Canel, 57, the vice-president. While the presidency is largely a symbolic role, and Mr Castro is expected to remain head of the party and army, it will be the first time since 1976 that a Castro brother has not held the post.

* Cuba after the Castros: escaping a long shadow

Unilever

The Anglo-Dutch consumer goods group that set off a political storm over Brexit last month after favouring the Netherlands over the UK for its single legal base, reports first-quarter revenues. Investors will want to know whether the company has lobbied the index providers to allow it to stay in the FTSE 100 index or whether it will be booted out once it goes Dutch.

The producer of Dove soap is a good bellwether for emerging markets performance since it makes almost 60 per cent of its sales in these countries. The question is whether this momentum can be sustained in the first three months of this year with an uptick in mature markets.

* Unilever faces potential shareholder unrest over pay policy

Friday

Procter & Gamble

Procter & Gamble, the world s biggest household products maker, is expected to report a higher profit in the third quarter, driven by higher sales of innovative products and a strong beauty products business. Profit margins, which were weighed down last quarter by higher commodity costs and investments, will be closely watched.

* P&G brand chief vows to  take back control  from agencies

General Electric

First-quarter revenue and profit are expected to fall when General Electric reports first-quarter earnings. Its power business, a unit that produced 60 per cent of its profits as recently as 2016, continues to underperform. The results follow a sharp decline in 2017 profit, which have just been revised to take account of a new tax charge.

Barclays has set up a new venture capital-style unit with the aim of adding billions of pounds to its annual revenues by 2025, in an effort to find new areas of growth after years of restructuring.

Barclays UK Ventures will be led by Ben Davey, formerly the bank s head of strategy. Mr Davey said he wants the unit to develop at least one  truly transformational new business line  that will add a  material contribution  to the bank s revenues over the next five to seven years.

He pointed to areas such as artificial intelligence, distributed ledgers and smart contracts as examples of the technology areas BUKV is likely to explore, but added that the business has a  relatively unfettered mandate  to consider different opportunities.

Established companies have taken an increasingly important role in technology investment in recent years, with corporate-led investments continuing to grow even as volumes in the wider venture capital sector fall. Corporate investors accounted for 18 per cent of global venture capital deals in 2017, up from 8 per cent in 2011, according to data from PitchBook and Global Corporate Venturing, which monitor the sector.

Santander, Credit Suisse and UBS are the most active European banks in terms of the number of investments in fintechs, according to a report published last week by research company CB Insights.

Barclays has previously taken stakes in companies such as messaging platform Symphony and payments processing group Form3. However, in addition to traditional equity investments, BUKV will also consider commercial partnerships with different companies and work to develop new business ideas internally.

 We re going to be very open minded on operating models with the best of these ideas , Mr Davey added.

Barclays did not give details of the amount of money it was prepared to dedicate to the new unit, but Mr Davey said he was  very comfortable  with the amount of capital that has been earmarked for projects.

Mr Davey said Barclays has reached a point in time where it can focus on returning to growth after largely completing tasks such as building its capital base and dealing with legacy litigation issues.

Monday s announcement also comes less than a month after Barclays completed the separation of its investment banking and UK consumer-focused arms, with BUKV funded by the newly-ringfenced UK business.

Ashok Vaswani, Barclays UK chief executive, said:  We are a growth business and Ben s appointment will put real weight behind this new unit to provide new lines of revenue growth in addition to the organic growth of our core business. 

Pressure on Barclays to demonstrate growth is likely to become particularly intense since it attracted the attention of activist investor Edward Bramson last month. Mr Bramson s Sherborne investment vehicle acquired voting rights over 5 per cent of the bank, leading to speculation that he could push for a shake-up.

Mr Davey said:  I feel personally very good about the direction of travel for Barclays. I think Jes [Staley, group chief executive] and the team have done a huge amount of work in positioning the strategy of the firm over the last couple of years and I think we see now a very clear path against which our senior management are executing.

Goldman Sachs Comes to the App Store; Goldman acquires Clarity Money, Adam Dell's personal-finance and budgeting app

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. bought personal-finance app Clarity Money, acquiring a mobile storefront for its growing consumer bank.

The deal closed on Friday for Clarity Money, whose backers include Soros Capital and Citigroup Inc.'s venture-capital arm. Adam Dell brother of Michael Dell, the personal-computer pioneer founded Clarity Money and will join Goldman as a partner, a title rarely given to outsiders.

The Wall Street firm has been intensifying its push into retail banking, a decade after its conversion from a broker-dealer into a bank that can take consumer deposits. Under the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldmans-new-name-to-beckon-consumers-marcus-1471571867", Goldman began making personal loans online in 2016 and has originated more than $2.5 billion so far. It also offers high-interest savings accounts and has about 350,000 customers across both products.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachs-adviser-to-the-elite-wants-to-be-your-main-street-banker-1519745369", Goldman is paying a high eight-figure sum for Clarity Money -- a rich valuation for a two-year-old startup that has yet to turn a profit.

But Clarity Money's roughly one million users will quadruple Goldman's customer base. In addition to Mr. Dell, about two dozen other Clarity Money employees will join the bank.

Lacking a branch network, Goldman has partnered with tax-preparation software firm Intuit Inc. and Fidelity and has sent hundreds of millions of pieces of direct mail in an effort to draw customers.

Clarity Money's app is expected to serve as the smartphone storefront for Goldman's growing suite of retail products, which the Journal has reported could include wealth-management tools, home mortgages, point-of-sale loans and insurance policies. Marcus doesn't yet have a mobile app.

Clarity Money uses algorithms and artificial intelligence to help consumers cancel or lower their bills, find a better credit card, and set savings goals. It aggregates information about their bank accounts and spending habits, and collects fees for referring them to credit-card and other financial companies.

"Consumers are too often overwhelmed by or don't have a good handle on their finances," Omer Ismail, chief operating officer of Goldman's Marcus said in an interview. "We think we can simplify that."

Still, Goldman will have to strike a balance between keeping Clarity Money as a neutral platform -- recommending the products best-suited for its users, even if they come from a Goldman competitor -- and using it to push its own offerings.

That challenge will only grow as Marcus does. Mr. Ismail said last week Goldman might look to launch its own credit card, which could prove awkward as Clarity Money currently recommends rival cards from JPMorgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc. and American Express Inc.

Other personal-finance apps have failed to catch on, especially when housed inside lenders. Capital One Financial Corp. bought budgeting app Level Money Inc. in 2015 but shut it down 18 months later. Online lender Prosper Marketlace Inc. killed off Billguard Inc. in 2017 after buying it for $30 million two years earlier.

What's more, personal-finance apps can be a tough sell because their prompts nag or stress out users, said Schwark Satyavolu, who founded personal-finance tracker Yodlee Inc. "You don't want that thing pinging you every time you go into a Starbucks saying,  Hey, don't drink a coffee today because you can't afford it," said Mr. Satyavolu, now a general partner at venture-capital firm Trinity Ventures.

Goldman's deal for Clarity Money began with a sales call from Mr. Dell, who is the beau of supermodel and "Top Chef" host Padma Lakshmi. Mr. Dell last spring pitched Goldman executives on offering Marcus loans and savings accounts through the app. Mr. Ismail had a different idea: "Would you be willing to sell?" he asked.

Goldman had been working on a personal-finance and budgeting app of its own, internally dubbed FiDi, after Financial District, the lower Manhattan neighborhood. Buying Clarity Money would be faster, and Goldman liked the app's jargon-free style and user prompts, Mr. Ismail said.

"Anything you'd like to cancel?" it asks, showing recurring payments like Netflix Inc. subscriptions and gym memberships. Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein joked during a demonstration that it could help him cancel his cable bill, Mr. Ismail said.

Some senior executives have predicted that artificial intelligence will soon revolutionise banking. But an FT survey of leading banks shows a cautious industry without a clear view of how to use the technology. By Laura Noonan

D eutsche Bank chief executive John Cryan once mooted replacing as many as half his 98,000 staff with robots. His dramatic ousting last weekend means he will not be held to that promise, but investors need not look far for other bankers talking up the potential of artificial intelligence to revolutionise an industry that has struggled with profitability in the decade since the financial crisis.

Former Citigroup chief Vikram Pandit   reborn as a fintech evangelist   predicted 30 per cent of banking jobs could be wiped out by AI in five years. Mizuho Financial Group in Japan says it will use AI to replace 19,000 people by 2027   about a third of its workforce.

Almost every big name consultancy has published research on how AI will transform banking. KPMG went one step further with its vision of an "invisible bank" where "enlightened virtual assistants" replace people at all points of customer interaction.

Santander introduced red robots to show guests around their Spanish visitor centre in 2010. UBS has Amazon's digital assistant Alexa on customer service duty, JPMorgan is using robots (the invisible kind) to execute trades and Morgan Stanley has an AI fraud detection team. Just this week, HSBC said it would follow suit by using AI to detect money laundering, fraud and terrorist funding.

"Long term I think this [harnessing AI and technology] will determine the split between winners and losers," says Jeroen van Oerle, an investor who runs one of Europe's first fintech focused funds for Robeco based in the Netherlands.

"In order to keep relevant for the future, you need efficient back office operations ... on top of that, you need to be able to tailor make products ... If you cannot provide those kind of services in the future, a competitor will and you will lose."

That is the hype. The reality is much more complicated. A Financial Times survey of 30 leading banks' use of AI revealed an industry excited about the prospects of a technology that can help cut costs and boost returns. One bank even predicted that 50-70 per cent of jobs could be replaced.

Yet not only is there little consensus on how AI should be used in banking, many of the current efforts to apply machine learning are modest. Rather than racing towards an AI-enabled future, the industry is feeling its way forward.

"There are too many people making these statements [about big cost and job impacts]," says Foteini Agrafioti, head of Royal Bank of Canada's AI research arm Borealis.

"The problems we have solved are very narrow," she adds. "The misconception is that humans and machines can perform at the same level. There's still a long way to go and many challenges we need to solve before a machine can operate [at a level] even near the human mind."

Professor Patrick Henry Winston, who headed MIT's AI lab between 1972 and 1997, and is now a Ford professor at the institute, shares Ms Agrafioti's concerns about AI's limitations.

"So much of what you need to replace thinking people [with] is not within the reach of today's so-called AI systems, which are really more perceptual than cognitive," he says. "When will the cognitive happen? Eventually, but my crystal ball is cloudy on the timing. Few AI people today actually work on the cognitive side."

Different approaches As a group, banks all agree that AI is important, but their strategies for using it vary wildly. One European bank that took part in the survey told the FT it had 500-800 people working on AI; Nordea, of Sweden, generally believed to be one of the world's most technologically advanced banks, says it has just 25. AI budgets vary from below $3m to $15m among the few of the 30 big banks approached by the FT who were willing to disclose the data. One bank says it is ramping up spending from less than $3m a year to $50m-plus.

Overall, while banks are experimenting with AI across their businesses, they are not as bullish as public proclamations would suggest. Of the seven big banks willing to estimate the long-term cost savings of AI, six said it would cut costs by less than 20 per cent, others were even more optimistic.

"There is so much [unrealistic] AI hype in the banking industry and the banking execs are understandably confused," says Zor Gorelov, chief executive and co-founder of Kasisto, a company that sells an AI platform KAI to banks including Singapore's DBS, Standard Chartered and 10 others.

"We're trying to be very realistic and set banks' expectations around the capabilities of the system. One of the things we do right away is we say, 'our work system must have contextual connectivity to a person' ... because nobody can hand over, and probably for the foreseeable future they will not be able to hand over, 100 per cent of their process to AI." Unrealistic expectations are not the only hurdle banks face as they delve deeper into the AI world that promised so much.

Several experts say there is a danger that too much investment flows into "sexy" areas such as chatbots at the expense of investment in behind-thescenes processes where banks could make more significant gains.

So, against all this noise, where are banks focusing their AI attentions? The answer depends in part on what banks consider AI to be. Those that participated in the FT's research gave definitions as narrow as only programs that perform more basic functions that involve logical reason, learning and self correction without being explicitly programmed (RBC), to a vision of AI that includes all automation (Nomura). One of the definitions was 130 words long. One involved diagrams.

Shameek Kundu, Standard Chartered's chief data officer, says only about 20 per cent of the 14 AI projects and pilots the bank looked at in 2017 were focused on "pure cost or productivity".

"Most of them are about improving our risk appetite, reducing the risk but also increasing our ability to take risk," he adds. Standard Chartered's AI definition is "a vision and set of technologies and approaches to allow machines to do things that require intelligence when done by humans".

Solving routine tasks Risk management is a consistent theme that comes up among the banks. Here the science is on their side, as it is for other rote tasks where human intervention can hinder rather than help.

"For repetitive tasks without variability [in middle office, in back end] for clearing or settlement or operational processes that are not particularly in need of smarts, then AI approaches are great," says Pascal Bouvier, a partner at Santander InnoVentures, a fintech venture capital fund of the Spanish bank that invests in early stage fintechs including those focused on AI.

"They are deterministic, and there is really no need for extravagant black box algos, nor is there much of a need for meeting a certain regulatory [or] legal threshold," Mr Bouvier adds. "These fall into the category of optimisation, automation, smart automation, robot process automation. Great for banks to cut costs."

As well as risk management applications, JPMorgan's use of AI to execute trades more efficiently could fall into this category, as could Citi's development of machine learning to handle pricing requests sent to traders.

Marika Lulay, chief executive of German fintech advisory company GFT Technologies, says there is a "clear difference" between "banks who focus on the understanding that new technology can give them new business models and new ways to generate money where other banks have cost reduction as their first goal."

Banks are sensitive about alarming staff and unions about job cuts and are instead talking about freeing up workers to do more interesting jobs.

As the AI debate has evolved, banks have changed their messaging so that the revenue growth potential of AI features at least as prominently as its cost cutting.

"We would like to use AI to bring smarter solutions to our customers, and be more effective in our decision making processes," says Dutch banking group ING. "As such, rather than 'AI replacing workforce' we believe in the power of 'AI empowered workforce'."

At Royal Bank of Canada's Borealis, Ms Agrafioti says her team "prioritise the kind of things that we have evidence we can solve". This includes "analysing news and determining how world events can affect American markets".

The outcome will be "potentially revenue creating but also cost saving, these are the kind of tools that our researchers, our advisers, our financial advisers and people that do research will leverage to understand," she adds.

Evaluating AI For some, selecting the right areas to use AI is the most difficult issue.

"It is easy to fall into the 'let's use artificial intelligence for the sake of it' trap," says Lindsey Argalas, chief digital and innovation officer at Santander. "Some AI-driven ideas may seem very 'shiny' but in reality only create marginal improvements on existing data processing capabilities."

At ABN Amro, the Dutch bank defends its decision to cast the AI net really wide to include a digital assistant for clients and tools to detect fraud and run risk analysis.

"To discover where the most value lies, we are actively experimenting," ABN Amro says. "That applies not just for existing services, but also for new opportunities. We are investigating how we can make the work easier for our staff, and how clients can benefit from artificial intelligence."

As AI projects pull banks in many different directions, evaluating success and leadership is a daunting prospect for outsiders. "It's very important to separate the marketing story from what the implementation story is, often there's quite a big difference between the two," says Robeco's Mr Van Oerle. "If you look deeper at the core you can make quite a good judgment on whether its marketing is real."

Mr Van Oerle looks for evidence of improved cost/income ratios and cross selling. "If you don't see them and the banks say that they are doing all these things in AI you have to ask yourself whether or not it's not really fundamental," he says.

He says it will take banks longer to see results on AI programmes for their back office operations, while some were already seeing the impact on the front office side.

"We have spoken to several banks that can clearly show that after implementing these technologies they have been able to cross sell much more of their products, and that they are better at communicating with their customers."

Standard Chartered's Mr Kundu says it was "too early" for outsiders to see tangible results that would allow them to decide whether his bank's investment in AI is bearing fruit, especially because most of its AI adventures have been pilots. "Early results have been promising," he adds. "They will be able to see the impact."

For outsiders, the superficial signs do not suggest AI is about to take over the industry. It was eight years ago that those robots began showing guests around Santander City, but there is still not a single robot to be found in any of Santander's 13,697 bank branches.

Looking for a boost Many banks see AI as a revolutionary tool to cut costs and improve returns Cautious approach So far the efforts to apply AI to banking have been modest, according to an FT survey Repetitive tasks Experts believe the early benefits will be in areas such as risk management and settlement The cost Job cuts, spending and AI: the banks in numbers The FT surveyed 30 of the world's biggest banks about their approach to AI. Eighteen provided detailed answers to at least five of the 14 questions, another five gave descriptive responses on their AI efforts, the rest declined to participate. The results show: Front office is king Seventeen of the 18 banks are already using AI in front office for everything from Citi's Facebook messenger chatbot to UBS's use of Amazon's virtual assistant Alexa for customer service. Front office is also where banks see the biggest potential for AI-related savings.

Broad is best Eight banks are using AI in front office, middle office, back office and data analytics. The other 10 are using it in three of the four areas.

Resources vary widely Nine banks provided details on staffing their AI efforts. One European bank, which asked to remain anonymous, employs between 500 and 800 people.

Nordea said it had 25. Six banks gave details of AI spending; the sums ranged from  ¬5m to  ¬15m, with one institution planning to increase spending from below $3m to $50m a year.

Conservative on job cuts Seven banks gave estimates of possible AI-related job losses. Six said it would be below 20 per cent, although one predicted cuts of between 50 and 70 per cent.

Seniors accountable Of the 18 banks, five have board members directly responsible for AI.

Partnerships in vogue Eight of these banks are involved in joint ventures, four have made investments in AI-related companies.

Based on detailed survey answers from: ABN Amro, Barclays, BBVA, Citi, Commerzbank, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, ING, JPMorgan, Nomura, Nordea, Royal Bank of Canada, Royal Bank of Scotland, Santander, SEB, UBS, Wells Fargo, Standard Chartered. Descriptive answers from: Goldman Sachs, Lloyds Banking Group, BNP Paribas, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America. No response from: ANZ, HSBC, Intesa, UniCredit, Socit Gnrale, Swedbank Four ways the banks want to use artificial intelligence 1. Chatbots and virtual personal assistants What does this mean? Banks are using chatbots and voicebots to interact with customers and solve problems before any human staff get involved.

The technology behind it Natural language processing and generation will make it increasingly difficult for customers to tell whether they are talking to a human or an AI interface. Voice and facial recognition could be used instead of passwords to ensure security.

2. Profiling customers What does this mean? Banks want to offer personalised communications and decisions based on detailed profiles of each customer. They could also use customer profiling and algorithmic sorting to assess risks and precision-target offers.

The technology behind it AI could use the vast mass of unstructured data to profile customers. Machine learning   computers that can learn from data   could then be used to analyse behaviour patterns. Algorithms would then be employed to automate increasing numbers of decisions.

3. Making processes more streamlined What does this mean? The banks want 'low-value processes' to be handled by AI. This would mean that documents would be scanned and parsed by computers. Some decision-making could be made by AIs operating with complete knowledge of the regulations and laws in each territory.

The technology behind it Image recognition and machine learning could be combined to scan masses of documents, and take actions based on the laws and regulations which apply. Algorithms could then be used to decide which cases are passed to a human to take the necessary decision.

4. Spotting patterns What does this mean? AI could be used to spot anomalies or patterns in transactions that could indicate fraud or money laundering. Data could then be sifted to find trading patterns that indicate risks or investment opportunities. Face and voice recognition could also flag up fraudsters already in the system.

The technology behind it Machine learning enables AI to parse the masses of unstructured data to separate the signal from the noise in markets, and it can self-correct. Complex image recognition can be used to identify people and objects.

'Long-term, I think this harnessing of AI and technology will determine the split between winners and losers'

'The problems we have solved are very narrow. There is a long way to go before a machine can operate near the human mind'

Chip Makers Are Better off Without Crypto Miners; Losing cryptocurrency mining sales allows Nvidia, AMD to focus on more solid opportunities

Miners of cryptocurrencies may soon stop buying chips from Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc.. But some businesses are more trouble than they are worth.

The graphics processors that both companies make are designed primarily for rendering videogames, as well as providing "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-nvidia-invaded-intels-turf-1494927600"to data centers and automobiles. But they've also proven popular for processing cryptocurrency transactions an activity otherwise known as mining. The rocketing value of those currencies over the past year has turned such mining into a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-rise-of-bitcoin-factories-mining-for-the-masses-1519209000?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1". That in turn has sparked a rush on GPU chip cards that boosted sales for Nvidia and AMD both last year as well as the recently ended quarter.

But that looks likely end soon. A Chinese venture-backed company called Bitmain announced a new chip last week specifically designed for mining ethereum, which is the most popular cryptocurrency mined with GPUs. Several analysts believe that system, which ships in July, is likely to pick up the bulk of demand from cryptocurrency miners due to superior technical performance for that task.

Concerns about the impact of cryptocurrency mining are one of the factors that caused sharp declines in shares of both Nvidia and AMD in the past month. The latter in particular has a smaller revenue base that was likely inflated more by crypto demand. Christopher Rolland of Susquehanna estimates that ethereum-related chip sales accounted for about one-quarter of AMD's revenue in the first quarter. The expected loss of that business led him to downgrade the chip maker to the equivalent of a sell rating last month.

Most analysts believe the impact of crypto to be much smaller for Nvidia, amounting to single-digit percent of revenue for the company's fiscal first quarter ending later this month. The company also has a much more robust data center business that is highly prized by investors. And its core gaming business could also be helped by new products expected later this year, as well as pent-up demand from gamers "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-computer-part-people-are-hoarding-i-felt-like-i-was-buying-drugs-1518195876?mod=searchresults&page=2&pos=6". Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore cited both in upgrading Nvidia to a buy rating earlier this week, adding that he expects crypto demand to "fall towards zero" by the end of July.

Both companies, it should be noted, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chip-makers-arent-stacking-bets-on-cryptocurrencies-1514210400" about banking on crypto demand. The volatile nature of those currencies as well as potential technical changes in how those currencies are mined have long made crypto a dicey prospect for long-term bets. Nvidia and AMD have much less cryptic opportunities to chase.

Asia Funds Challenge Silicon Valley --- America's wide lead in venture capital fades, threatening to shift power over innovation

Silicon Valley, long the undisputed king of venture capital, is now sharing its throne with Asia.

A decade ago, nearly three-quarters of the world's financing of innovative, tech-heavy startups and young companies took place in the U.S., with American investors plowing money into mostly U.S.-based venture firms.

Now, a surge of new money -- mostly from China -- has helped drive funding totals into the stratosphere and has transformed the venture landscape, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal analysis of venture funding data.

Asian investors directed nearly as much money into startups last year as American investors did -- 40% of the record $154 billion in global venture financing versus 44%, the Journal's analysis of data from private markets data tracker Dow Jones VentureSource found. Asia's share is up from less than 5% just 10 years ago.

That tidal wave of cash into promising young firms could herald a shift in who controls the world's technological innovation and its economic fruits, from artificial intelligence to self-driving cars.

Silicon Valley previously was far and away the leader for tech entrepreneurs in both money and know-how, says Kai-Fu Lee, a veteran tech executive who headed China units of Microsoft and Google before founding his own Beijing-based venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures, in 2009. The rise of China's venture market "signifies a shift from a single-epicenter view of the world to a duopoly," he says.

U.S. investors remain the biggest single source of global venture capital, and they do more deals than anyone else -- nearly half of all venture rounds in 2017, according to VentureSource data. The U.S. is still an important driver of innovation, with many of China's bigger investments merely copying American technologies. For startups, the big increase in Asian funds also makes more cash available to finance new technology.

The surge also positions Asia's investors to win stakes in markets that Western companies covet, or that have national security implications. The U.S. government has grown increasingly uneasy about Chinese advances in key technologies such as artificial intelligence.

The expanding pool of venture capital from the East "is powerful rocket fuel for innovative activity," says Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor and expert on venture financing. "If you think that being the locus of invention gives you a boost to your GDP and so forth, that's a deterioration of the U.S. competitive advantage."

Although one of the biggest Asian investors is Japan's SoftBank Group Corp., which has tapped Middle Eastern money to create the world's largest tech-investment fund, it is Chinese activity that is having the greatest impact.

The prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp venture finance along with overall investments if the countries go through with threats to levy billions of dollars in tariffs on each others' products. But since the tariffs are so far largely focused on industrial or agricultural exports like cars, chemicals and corn, they are unlikely to have much direct impact on most startups.

China is creating unicorns -- startups valued at a billion dollars or more -- at much the same pace as the U.S., drawing on funding from internet giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. as well as more than a thousand domestic venture-capital firms that have raised billions of dollars a year for the past few years, according to VentureSource.

Chinese-led venture funding is about 15 times its size in 2013, outpacing growth in U.S.-led financing, which roughly doubled in that time period, the Journal's analysis shows.

Most Chinese-led investment so far has gone to the country's own firms, the Journal analysis found. Many of them, like the Yelp equivalent Meituan-Dianping, are household names with millions of customers in China, yet virtually unknown elsewhere.

Slowing growth and fierce competition in China is prompting the country's tech champions to look for markets overseas. Last year, the amount of China-led venture investment outside the country more than doubled, the Journal's analysis found.

Of the five biggest venture investments led by Chinese investors in 2017, three were rounds led by Tencent or Alibaba in e-commerce and ride-hailing startups in India and Indonesia.

Many Chinese tech companies are "at this critical size that the China market alone is not enough to support their business and valuation," says Brian Gu, who recently left a position as J.P. Morgan's Asia Pacific investment banking chairman to become vice chairman and president of Alibaba's electric-car startup, Xiaopeng Motors. "The money will first go to adjacent markets where Chinese technology, Chinese business models, Chinese capital will have more impact."

Madhur Deora, chief financial officer for Paytm, one of India's biggest e-payments firms, says the company approached Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial instead of U.S. backers for funding in 2015 because Chinese mobile-internet innovations are "way far ahead of anything that's happened in the U.S." Ant is preparing to raise $9 billion in a private funding round, according to people familiar with the matter, valuing it at close to $150 billion.

Ant and Alibaba eventually invested a total of around $800 million in Paytm parent One97 Communications, while SoftBank later poured in around $1.4 billion. That made the trio the biggest investors in the company, says a person familiar with the transactions, and gave them board seats. The company hasn't had "meaningful" U.S. investors, Mr. Deora says. SoftBank led another investment of $445 million in Paytm's online mall in recent weeks.

One reason China's push into new technologies worries many in the U.S. is that, unlike the hunt for good returns that underpins most Western venture finance, a lot of Chinese investment is driven by strategic interests, some carrying the specter of state influence.

China is pushing hard into semiconductors, for which the government has provided billions of dollars in public funding, and artificial intelligence, where Beijing in July set a goal of global leadership by 2030. China's state and local governments have also put money into private venture funds, and Beijing's interest has spurred a rush of startup VC activity, experts say.

Chinese venture investments include stakes in companies like Megvii Technology Inc., a Chinese facial-recognition firm that has worked with financial firms on systems that match facial scans with databases for loan approvals. It has also helped Chinese police with surveillance systems.

U.S. investors are still pumping more money into AI startups than Chinese, leading $4 billion in funding rounds last year, double the previous year's amount, according to the Journal's analysis of VentureSource data. Chinese investors led around $2.5 billion in AI venture financing last year -- up from less than $100 million a few years before.

China's tech giants have their own agendas for investment, separate from government policy. Yet they have faced intense pressure to serve state interests, creating worries that even funds from private sources could come with government strings attached.

Tencent says it is focused on investments in companies with leading technologies or research as well as top players in high-growth markets "where we can share our experience and contribute to building the internet ecosystems."

Alibaba has taken stakes in companies abroad to expand its services and hopes to create "chemistry" with others in the Alibaba group to "build long-term value," Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told investors last June.

Mr. Lee, the venture investor, predicts that in the next five to 10 years Chinese tech companies will become pacesetters for tech-related development, vying with the likes of Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook for dominance in markets outside the English-speaking world and Western Europe.

"All the rest of the world will basically be a land grab between the U.S. and China," he says.

"The U.S. approach is: We'll build a better product and just win over all the countries," says Mr. Lee. The Chinese approach is "we'll fund the local partner to beat off the American companies."

Last year, deals led by U.S. venture-capital and tech-investment firms, such as Sequoia Capital or Andreessen Horowitz, accounted for about $67 billion in venture financing, slightly more than the $61 billion led by Asian investors, including Tencent and SoftBank, according to the Journal's analysis of VentureSource data.

A decade earlier, U.S. investors led 73% of the $41 billion in venture finance logged; in 1992, the figure was 97% of $2 billion, when VentureSource's records begin.

The Journal's analysis looked at the source of venture finance based on the headquarters of the company or companies leading or making up the majority of each round's investors.

Asia's rise as a startup financier is even starker in the biggest venture investments -- those of $100 million or more. These megadeals have become an increasingly important part of venture finance as valuations have ballooned, with their proportion of deal volume growing from around 8% in 2007 to around half of the total last year.

In 2017, deals led by Chinese investors made up a bigger portion of that megafinance than those led by U.S. investors. Japanese-led funding -- largely by SoftBank -- came in third.

In Southeast Asia, a flood of Chinese money into local startups -- such as the $1.1 billion Alibaba-led investment into Indonesian online marketplace PT Tokopedia last year -- is drawing the region closer to China, says Santitarn Sathirathai, Credit Suisse's lead economist for emerging Asian markets.

Chinese money is also playing a big role in India, which, with a population of 1.2 billion, has been described as the next big internet market. Chinese and Japanese investors each led nearly $3 billion in venture finance in India last year, ahead of the nearly $2 billion in deals led by U.S. investors, which have been the top source of India's VC money in recent years.

Last year, Tencent led a $1.1 billion round in Indian ride-hailing company Ola, which is piling up cash to battle U.S. rival Uber Technologies Inc. Tencent and SoftBank, another big investor, got seats on the board of Ola's parent.

The money has helped Ola continue a tight race with Uber for market share in India, as well as challenge Uber in Australia, where Ola recently launched operations with introductory free rides.

Tencent and SoftBank also each led billion-plus rounds into Flipkart, India's biggest local e-commerce company, earning them board seats as well. Flipkart has also recently discussed selling a stake in itself to Walmart Inc., people familiar with the discussions say, and is facing a challenge from Amazon.com Inc., which has announced plans to pour $5 billion into its India operations and is gaining market share. Walmart and Flipkart declined to comment.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of Paytm, the Indian e-payment firm, visited Alibaba's home base of Hangzhou several years ago, and was amazed at the online retail and payments market it pioneered with its affiliate Ant, says Mr. Deora, the CFO.

Paytm executives adapted practices they saw in China, including distributing stickers with QR codes to Indian merchants that let them accept payments via mobile phones, and rolling out shops that pop up for a limited time in Indian malls, where buyers can check out goods before they buy them online. Paytm is going up against Google and Facebook, which have also launched or tested services in India that let users pay through their phones.

"Think of strategic investments and M&A as playing a game of go," said Mr. Tsai, the Alibaba executive vice chairman, at the investor conference last year. "In a game of go the strategic objective is to put your pieces on the chessboard and surround your opponent."

LONDON President Donald Trump could eventually benefit if the Democrats win control of the House in this year's midterm elections, a former adviser said at the WSJ CEO Council meeting in London on Thursday, where a raft of hot topics such as artificial intelligence, geopolitical tensions and fake news were hashed out.

Policy makers and senior executives gathered at the event, the council's first in Europe, to hear speakers including Credit Suisse AG Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam and Santander Executive Chairman Ana Botn.

Among the main takeaways were a bout of optimism from an economic adviser to Mr. Trump that "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-adviser-hopes-to-avoid-u-s-china-trade-war-1523542712", a prediction of a divergent web from Sequoia Capital 's Mike Moritz , and a history lesson on fake news from Priceline founder Jay Walker .

And to end the day, a Facebook Inc . executive played down the impact of the recent furor over its users' data privacy on the tech giant's sales.

Here's a roundup of the meeting:

Could Midterm Losses Bode Well for Trump?

Two former top advisers to U.S. President Donald Trump said at the CEO Council meeting Thursday that Democrat gains in this year's midterm elections could actually help the president win a second term in office.

Corey Lewandowski and Jason Miller said Mr. Trump is at his campaigning best when he has "a foil" to goad and criticize.

Mr. Miller is a former senior communications adviser to Mr. Trump, while Mr. Lewandowski managed his presidential campaign.

Democrats taking control of Congress in November would provide that counterbalance before the party selects candidates for the presidential election in 2020, they said.

"Democrats winning back the house could be what helps the president," said Mr. Miller.

As rumors swirl that Mr. Trump might fire Robert Mueller , the investigator "https://www.wsj.com/articles/senate-judiciary-committee-to-take-up-bill-protecting-mueller-1523475253", the two former advisers said Mr. Mueller should stay in post. They agreed that the president shouldn't fire Attorney General Jeff Sessions.

Instead, they said, the president should fire Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein , who they criticized for his role in authorizing a recent raid on the office, home and Manhattan hotel room of Michael Cohen , the president's lawyer.

Despite Facebook Furor, No 'Wild Changes' in User Behavior

The most tumultuous period in Facebook 's history is having a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-doesnt-expect-revenue-impact-over-privacy-concerns-1523555498", according to an executive at the tech giant.

"We have not seen wild changes in behavior with people saying I'm not going to share any data with Facebook anymore," said the company's vice president of global marketing solutions, Carolyn Everson , adding that users largely haven't changed their privacy settings in the past four weeks.

Facebook has been dealing with digital-privacy worries that prompted Congress this week to question Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg , who "https://www.wsj.com/articles/congressional-hearing-on-facebook-turns-up-heat-on-mark-zuckerberg-1523464332" and disclose what data was improperly shared.

Asked about the potential impact of new regulation, Ms. Everson added: "We are not anticipating major changes to our overall revenue and business model."

Ms. Everson reiterated that the company is "deeply concerned" about "any time there is a breach of trust."

She said that the company has invested heavily in complying with a strict new European privacy law that goes into effect in May and has stricter requirements for seeking consumers' consent to use their personal information.

When AI and Hacking Collide

Add another worry that you can chalk up to artificial intelligence: robot hackers.

Nicole Eagan, chief executive of cybersecurity firm Darktrace, told the WSJ CEO Council that hackers both from governments and criminal enterprises are starting to artificial intelligence techniques to speed up the pace and inventiveness of their attacks. Traditional security personnel can't keep up: "This is going to become a full on arms race: algorithms against algorithms," Ms. Eagan said.

Sitting on the panel alongside her, Robert Hannigan , former director of GCHQ, the British communications-intelligence agency, added that criminal hacker groups have become more sophisticated in recent years. "When you get inside them it's actually really impressive," Mr. Hannigan said. "They understand data and how to monetize it better than the businesses they target."

Hackers also benefit from having more devices to hack, from video cameras to connected lightbulbs. Ms. Eagan said she had been involved in a case where a thermostat in a Las Vegas casino fish tank was used to steal information about high rollers.

Banks Cheer Volatile Markets for Now

Volatility is back. And so far it isn't causing problems.

Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam and Santander Executive Chairman Ana Botn were bullish on the global economy but warned of bumps in the road as the interest-rate cycle normalizes and central banks dial down quantitative easing.

Mr. Thiam warned a "lack of exit strategy" from central-bank stimulus could cause "trauma." A decrease in liquidity is already making markets bumpier, he said.

Ms. Botn added that while the European economy was growing, tougher times may lay ahead as the bloc shapes up to deal with a series of political challenges. But she added that so far the volatility hasn't been problematic: "Volatility that doesn't do anything bad is a good thing."

"I think this year is going to be good the question is how we prepare for the change in cycle," she added.

Both executives separately called for the tech sector to be more closely regulated over issues of taxation and privacy. Mr. Thiam said he was still bullish on tech companies, saying added oversight is "long-term positive for the survival of the sector."

Trade War Not Imminent?

One of President Donald Trump 's top economic advisers held out "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-adviser-hopes-to-avoid-u-s-china-trade-war-1523542712".

Deputy Director of the National Economic Council Everett Eissenstat said Washington hopes that an escalating spat with China over trade can be resolved without resorting to tariffs.

Mr. Trump has threatened to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-to-consider-another-100-billion-in-new-china-tariffs-1522970476" if China doesn't address U.S. concerns on issues such as intellectual property transfer and market access. Beijing has pledged to retaliate.

"We hope that at the end of the day we don't have that necessity," Mr. Eissenstat said, referring to tariffs, adding the goal of the Trump administration's policy is to "help address imbalances in the international trading system."

Mr. Eissenstat said Washington is open to dialogue with Beijing to try to find an agreement. But he said the U.S. won't be satisfied with reiteration of past commitments that went unfulfilled.

Jason Douglas

The Future of Data

The head of one of Google 's leading artificial-intelligence labs said it's time for a widespread system in which individuals can easily verify and audit how their digital data is being used, even if Chinese companies aren't subject to the same expectations.

"This is a moment for us to be clear about the values we stand for," said Mustafa Suleyman , head of DeepMind, a London-based unit of Alphabet Inc .'s Google .

Mr. Suleyman said he doesn't see a two-sided artificial-intelligence arms race between China and Western countries, but rather competition that will produce many winners.

While DeepMind has gained fame for developing programs that can "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-program-vanquishes-human-players-of-go-in-china-1483601561", considered one of world's most complex board games, artificial intelligence is still unproven in more dynamic environments. AI-powered computers still have problems interacting with humans, for example. But Mr. Suleyman says he believes health care is the next industry that artificial intelligence can improve, because computers are now efficient enough to detect patterns that humans miss.

Fake News Isn't New

Executives who want to understand the importance of fake news should take a look at the distant history of written communications, according to Priceline founder Jay Walker .

"It's going to go quickly because we're going to cover a few thousand years of history," said Mr. Walker ahead of a quick-fire historical tour of written communications and how they have been used for misdirection.

Deliberate falsehoods aren't a new media phenomenon, Mr. Walker pointed out, displaying a fake journal of Christopher Columbus forged in the era of early industrial printing.

Fake news has always been used not just to mislead, but for illicit profit, where the business world and the world of media miscommunication collide.

"It's about manipulating the externalities, not just the population itself," added Mr. Walker. "This interrelationship between what happens in markets and what happens in news."

The most recent developments in fake news, like digitally manipulated videos, are a particular threat that businesses need to be aware of, according to Mr. Walker.

"We now have propaganda that's computational. You can manufacture it in real time, create entire fake videos," he added. "An advertising message and one that could destroy your company look much the same in ones and zeros."

Brexit Chief Holds Back on Syria

Following a bout of "https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-warns-russia-u-s-plans-missile-strike-on-syria-1523445684" over an alleged chemical weapons attack in Syria, U.K. Brexit secretary David Davis said the U.K. hadn't yet taken a decision on whether to take military action in the war-torn nation.

"No decision as yet," he said at the CEO Council, adding that the U.K. cabinet would meet later Thursday to discuss Britain's response. "The situation in Syria is horrific, the use of chemical weapons is something the world has to prevent. But also it's a very, very delicate circumstance and we've got to make this judgment on a very careful, very deliberate, very well thought-through basis."

The U.S. is eager to have France and the U.K. join in military action in Syria to show international unity in response to the attack. Prime Minister Theresa May has showed some caution, but has said those responsible for the attack should be held responsible.

Jenny Gross

A Divided Web

The world is headed in the direction of two internets: a Western-backed web and a Chinese one, said Mike Moritz , chairman of storied Silicon Valley venture-capital firm Sequoia Capital . Mr. Moritz said U.S. and European tech companies aren't so different, despite different approaches to an individual's privacy. But Chinese tech giants that run afoul of Beijing see governmental consequences that are "sudden and dramatic," compared with more "meandering" regulatory environments in the U.S. and Europe.

"The pace of change in tech in China is hard to overestimate," Mr. Moritz said. Still, because of protectionism in Western countries, Chinese tech companies won't grow as fast as they want to. Now Chinese investors are focused on investing in tech companies in developing countries, such as those in Latin America.

In the U.S., Mr. Moritz said today's tech giants might fare better than the dot-com busts of the 1990s and 2000s. Never before has the tech industry had so many young leaders of giant tech companies, he said.

Is the Future Bright for Older Workers?

Hold on to your 55-year-old employees. That was one of the key tips for employers from Lynda Gratton, professor of management practice at London Business School .

In a wide-ranging discussion on the future of work, Prof. Gratton offered up the cheery prospect of everyone working until they're 80. But that shouldn't be seen as a bad thing: Older workers have essential skills and valuable networks that employers need, she said, and executives should offer them bespoke deals to get them to stick around.

"Stop looking at them in a weird way when they get to 55," she said.

Prof. Gratton made a second bold prediction: That child care will soon be more equally shared between men and women. As women earn more, "every family is going to have a rational conversation about how we are going to make this work economically," she said.

"My prediction by the way is that work will become ungendered."

In a later session, Samasource founder Leila Janah said employers need to think about not just gender and ethnic diversity in the workforce but also economic diversity.

Ms. Janah said tech firms in particular need to hire more people from low-income backgrounds. The technology sector tends to be dominated by rich, white men, leaving a lot of people feeling excluded, she said.

Ms. Janah, whose organization has helped find work for more than 9,000 people in places including Kenya and Haiti, said feelings of economic and social marginalization are behind the vitriol directed at political classes and the establishment more broadly.

"There's a whole class of people that is losing hope," she said.

'No Theoretical Limits' to Blockchain

Bitcoin's price may have declined sharply from "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-tops-15-000-as-manic-rally-gains-even-more-momentum-1512647315", but experts in the industry were still optimistic about the underlying blockchain technology.

The technology acts as a decentralized ledger, in which participants can record transactions securely, with a permanent record for multiple parties.

The blockchain removes much of the need for intermediation between two parties, said Blythe Masters , CEO of financial technology company Digital Asset. "You can validate with mathematical certainty that the data you're seeing is the same as your counterparty."

A show of hands in the room suggested the executives present were overwhelmingly interested in blockchain technology from a business perspective, but that only a handful had bought any cryptocurrency themselves.

The panelists also acknowledged some teething issues with the technology.

"The reality is that you have to find a away to power this so it's not so egregiously costly on energy consumption," said Nicolas Cary, co-founder and vice chairman of cryptocurrency software firm Blockchain.

But the opportunities for the use of blockchain move far beyond financial services.

"In any instance where you have multiple parties that have an interest in validating the same piece of information, the use cases are many and variable. There are no real theoretical limits," added Ms. Masters.

Mike Bird

The Russian Rationale

Russia views its relations with the West as a zero-sum game: the weaker the West is, the better off Russia is.

That's according former U.K. intelligence official John Sawers, who said it's why Moscow likely carried out the poisoning of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal in such a transparent manner at a time of uncertainty for Britain.

"Britain looks weak at the moment, because of Brexit, because of the strains in trans-Atlantic relations and so on," said Mr. Sawers, who worked as the head of MI6 from 2009 to 2014. "If a country is down, when you're Russia, you kick it."

He said the Salisbury poisoning was a state-on-state attack, not a spy-on-spy issue, and that it's too soon to say if Prime Minister Theresa May 's response would be sufficient in deterring future attacks from Moscow.

William Burns , a career foreign service officer who served as both ambassador to Russia and deputy secretary of state, said Russian President Vladimir Putin intended to send a message to other former Russian agents that he has a long memory.

He said Mr. Putin, whose country has consistently denied involvement in the attack, likely underestimated the breadth of the global response, including the U.S. sanctions against oligarchs.

"He saw Britain adrift in Brexit and thought that, as a bully, he could get away with this," Mr. Burns said.

Jenny Gross

Imagination Is the Key

Another whirlwind tour of intellectual history from Priceline founder Jay Walker , examining why imagination is a critical tool for business leaders.

The invention of the magnifying glass changed the way in which the world viewed itself, according to Mr. Walker, dissecting how ideas develop through the 1665 book Micrographia. That shift has lessons for executives in how open-minded they need to be.

"If you're not looking for a worldview change, you're never going to see it," said Mr. Walker. "The more outrageous the suggestion, the less likely you are to ever believe that it's true."

"Einstein said it best. If you look at the world through the eyes of a child, you keep that sense of novelty and openness to new experience."

The revelation that the earth revolves around the sun was a similarly sharp change in perspective, allowing for an entirely new perspective of the natural world.

"It's why travel has such an amazing effect on imagination. It forces you to look at the world in a new way."

Silicon Valley Powered American Tech Dominance Now It Has a Challenger; An exclusive WSJ analysis shows how venture-capital investment from Asia is skyrocketing, threatening to shift power over innovation

Silicon Valley, long the undisputed king of venture capital, is now sharing its throne with Asia.

A decade ago, nearly three-quarters of the world's financing of innovative, tech-heavy startups and young companies took place in the U.S., with American investors plowing money into mostly U.S.-based venture firms.

Now, a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-tech-startup-funding-the-wild-west-in-the-far-east-1513248609" has helped drive funding totals into the stratosphere and has transformed the venture landscape, according to an exclusive Wall Street Journal analysis of venture funding data.

Asian investors directed nearly as much money into startups last year as American investors did 40% of the record $154 billion in global venture financing versus 44%, the Journal's analysis of data from private markets data tracker Dow Jones VentureSource found. Asia's share is up from less than 5% just 10 years ago.

That tidal wave of cash into promising young firms could herald a shift in who controls the world's technological innovation and its economic fruits, from "https://www.wsj.com/articles/artificial-intelligence-rules-more-of-your-life-who-rules-ai-1520933401" to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-auto-exec-on-self-driving-cars-you-cant-just-put-some-sensors-on-top-1522327226".

Silicon Valley previously was far and away the leader for tech entrepreneurs in both money and know-how, says Kai-Fu Lee, a veteran tech executive who headed China units of Microsoft and Google before founding his own Beijing-based venture-capital firm, Sinovation Ventures, in 2009. The rise of China's venture market "signifies a shift from a single-epicenter view of the world to a duopoly," he says.

U.S. investors remain the biggest single source of global venture capital, and they do more deals than anyone else nearly half of all venture rounds in 2017, according to VentureSource data. The U.S. is still an important driver of innovation, with many of China's bigger investments merely copying American technologies. For startups, the big increase in Asian funds also makes more cash available to finance new technology.

The surge also positions Asia's investors to win stakes in markets that Western companies covet, or that have national security implications. The U.S. government has grown increasingly uneasy about "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-arms-race-in-ai-1520009261".

The expanding pool of venture capital from the East "is powerful rocket fuel for innovative activity," says Josh Lerner, a Harvard Business School professor and expert on venture financing. "If you think that being the locus of invention gives you a boost to your GDP and so forth, that's a deterioration of the U.S. competitive advantage."

Although one of the biggest Asian investors is Japan's SoftBank Group Corp., which has tapped Middle Eastern money to create the world's largest tech-investment fund, it is Chinese activity that is having the greatest impact.

The prospect of a trade war between the U.S. and China could crimp venture finance along with overall investments if the countries go through with threats to levy billions of dollars in tariffs on each others' products. But since the tariffs are so far largely focused on industrial or agricultural exports like cars, chemicals and corn, they are unlikely to have much direct impact on most startups.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/venture-capital-quandary-too-much-money-chasing-too-few-ideas-1493291432" startups valued at a billion dollars or more at much the same pace as the U.S., drawing on funding from internet giants like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. as well as more than a thousand domestic venture-capital firms that have raised billions of dollars a year for the past few years, according to VentureSource.

Chinese-led venture funding is about 15 times its size in 2013, outpacing growth in U.S.-led financing, which roughly doubled in that time period, the Journal's analysis shows.

Most Chinese-led investment so far has gone to the country's own firms, the Journal analysis found. Many of them, like the Yelp equivalent Meituan-Dianping, are household names with millions of customers in China, yet virtually unknown elsewhere.

Slowing growth and fierce competition in China is prompting the country's tech champions to look for markets overseas. Last year, the amount of China-led venture investment outside the country more than doubled, the Journal's analysis found.

Of the five biggest venture investments led by Chinese investors in 2017, three were rounds led by Tencent or Alibaba in e-commerce and ride-hailing startups in India and Indonesia.

Many Chinese tech companies are "at this critical size that the China market alone is not enough to support their business and valuation," says Brian Gu, who recently left a position as J.P. Morgan's Asia Pacific investment banking chairman to become vice chairman and president of Alibaba's electric-car startup, Xiaopeng Motors. "The money will first go to adjacent markets where Chinese technology, Chinese business models, Chinese capital will have more impact."

Madhur Deora, chief financial officer for "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mobile-wallet-paytm-hits-pay-dirt-amid-indias-cash-crackdown-1496232035", says the company approached Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial instead of U.S. backers for funding in 2015 because Chinese mobile-internet innovations are "way far ahead of anything that's happened in the U.S." "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jack-mas-ant-financial-to-raise-9-billion-become-worlds-biggest-unicorn-1523353351" in a private funding round, according to people familiar with the matter, valuing it at close to $150 billion.

Ant and Alibaba eventually invested a total of around $800 million in Paytm parent One97 Communications, while SoftBank later poured in around $1.4 billion. That made the trio the biggest investors in the company, says a person familiar with the transactions, and gave them board seats. The company hasn't had "meaningful" U.S. investors, Mr. Deora says. SoftBank led another investment of $445 million in Paytm's online mall in recent weeks.

One reason China's push into new technologies worries many in the U.S. is that, unlike the hunt for good returns that underpins most Western venture finance, a lot of Chinese investment is driven by strategic interests, some carrying the specter of state influence.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-next-target-u-s-microchip-hegemony-1501168303", for which the government has provided billions of dollars in public funding, and artificial intelligence, where Beijing in July set a goal of global leadership by 2030. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/beijing-pushes-for-a-direct-hand-in-chinas-big-tech-firms-1507758314", and Beijing's interest has spurred a rush of startup VC activity, experts say.

Chinese venture investments include stakes in companies like Megvii Technology Inc., a Chinese facial-recognition firm that has worked with financial firms on systems that match facial scans with databases for loan approvals. It has also helped "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-all-seeing-surveillance-state-feared-in-the-west-is-a-reality-in-china-1498493020".

U.S. investors are still pumping more money into AI startups than Chinese, leading $4 billion in funding rounds last year, double the previous year's amount, according to the Journal's analysis of VentureSource data. Chinese investors led around $2.5 billion in AI venture financing last year up from less than $100 million a few years before.

China's tech giants have their own agendas for investment, separate from government policy. Yet they have faced intense pressure to serve state interests, creating worries that even funds from private sources could come with government strings attached.

Tencent says it is focused on investments in companies with leading technologies or research as well as top players in high-growth markets "where we can share our experience and contribute to building the internet ecosystems."

Alibaba has taken stakes in companies abroad to expand its services and hopes to create "chemistry" with others in the Alibaba group to "build long-term value," Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai told investors last June.

Mr. Lee, the venture investor, predicts that in the next five to 10 years Chinese tech companies will become pacesetters for tech-related development, vying with the likes of Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook for dominance in markets outside the English-speaking world and Western Europe.

"All the rest of the world will basically be a land grab between the U.S. and China," he says.

"The U.S. approach is: We'll build a better product and just win over all the countries," says Mr. Lee. The Chinese approach is "we'll fund the local partner to beat off the American companies."

Last year, deals led by U.S. venture-capital and tech-investment firms, such as Sequoia Capital or Andreessen Horowitz, accounted for about $67 billion in venture financing, slightly more than the $61 billion led by Asian investors, including Tencent and SoftBank, according to the Journal's analysis of VentureSource data.

A decade earlier, U.S. investors led 73% of the $41 billion in venture finance logged; in 1992, the figure was 97% of $2 billion, when VentureSource's records begin.

The Journal's analysis looked at the source of venture finance based on the headquarters of the company or companies leading or making up the majority of each round's investors.

Asia's rise as a startup financier is even starker in the biggest venture investments those of $100 million or more. These megadeals have become an increasingly important part of venture finance as valuations have ballooned, with their proportion of deal volume growing from around 8% in 2007 to around half of the total last year.

In 2017, deals led by Chinese investors made up a bigger portion of that megafinance than those led by U.S. investors. Japanese-led funding largely by SoftBank came in third.

In Southeast Asia, a flood of Chinese money into local startups such as the $1.1 billion Alibaba-led investment into Indonesian online marketplace PT Tokopedia last year is drawing the region closer to China, says Santitarn Sathirathai, Credit Suisse's lead economist for emerging Asian markets.

Chinese money is also playing a big role in India, which, with a population of 1.2 billion, has been described as the next big internet market. Chinese and Japanese investors each led nearly $3 billion in venture finance in India last year, ahead of the nearly $2 billion in deals led by U.S. investors, which have been the top source of India's VC money in recent years.

Last year, Tencent led a $1.1 billion round in Indian ride-hailing company Ola, which is piling up cash to battle U.S. rival Uber Technologies Inc. Tencent and SoftBank, another big investor, got seats on the board of Ola's parent.

The money has helped "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ubers-latest-retreat-leaves-brazil-india-as-the-key-battlegrounds-1522067884" for market share in India, as well as challenge Uber in Australia, where Ola recently launched operations with introductory free rides.

Tencent and SoftBank also each led "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-vision-fund-invests-in-flipkart-1502373109" company, earning them board seats as well. Flipkart has also recently discussed selling a stake in itself to Walmart Inc., people familiar with the discussions say, and is facing a challenge from Amazon.com Inc., which has announced plans to pour $5 billion into its India operations and is gaining market share. Walmart and Flipkart declined to comment.

Vijay Shekhar Sharma, the founder of Paytm, the Indian e-payment firm, visited Alibaba's home base of Hangzhou several years ago, and was amazed at the online retail and payments market it pioneered with its affiliate Ant, says Mr. Deora, the CFO.

Paytm executives adapted practices they saw in China, including distributing stickers with QR codes to Indian merchants that let them accept payments via mobile phones, and rolling out shops that pop up for a limited time in Indian malls, where buyers can check out goods before they buy them online. Paytm is going up against Google and Facebook, which have also launched or tested services in India that let users pay through their phones.

"Think of strategic investments and M&A as playing a game of go," said Mr. Tsai, the Alibaba executive vice chairman, at the investor conference last year. "In a game of go the strategic objective is to put your pieces on the chessboard and surround your opponent."

Methodology

The Journal analyzed all 117,338 equity-finance rounds into venture companies in Dow Jones VentureSource's database, between 1992 and 2017, for which values were given. Venture companies are defined as those that have had at least one investment round that VentureSource classifies as venture finance.

To determine where the investment came from, the Journal looked at the headquarters of the company or companies that led each round. When no lead investor was flagged, the Journal assigned the lead to the country whose investors made up the majority of those participating in the round. If there was no clear majority of investors from one country, the round was categorized as "mixed."

AI in banking: the reality behind the hype

Deutsche Bank chief executive John Cryan once mooted replacing as many as half his 98,000 staff with robots. His dramatic ousting last weekend means he will not be held to that promise, but investors need not look far for other bankers talking up the potential of artificial intelligence to revolutionise an industry that has struggled with profitability in the decade since the financial crisis.

Former Citigroup chief Vikram Pandit   reborn as a fintech evangelist   predicted 30 per cent of banking jobs could be wiped out by AI in five years. Mizuho Financial Group in Japan says it will use AI to replace 19,000 people by 2027   about a third of its workforce.

Almost every big name consultancy has published research on how AI will transform banking. KPMG went one step further with its vision of an  invisible bank  where  enlightened virtual assistants  replace people at all points of customer interaction.

Santander introduced red robots to show guests around their Spanish visitor centre in 2010. UBS has Amazon s digital assistant Alexa on customer service duty, JPMorgan is using robots (the invisible kind) to execute trades and Morgan Stanley has an AI fraud detection team. Just this week, HSBC said it would follow suit by using AI to detect money laundering, fraud and terrorist funding.

 Long term I think this [harnessing AI and technology] will determine the split between winners and losers,  says Jeroen van Oerle, an investor who runs one of Europe s first fintech focused funds for Robeco based in the Netherlands.

How the banks want to use AI

1. Chatbots and virtual personal assistants

What does this mean?

Banks are using chatbots and voice bots to interact with customers and solve problems before any human staff get involved.

The technology behind it

Natural language processing and generation will make it increasingly difficult for customers to tell whether they are talking to a human or an AI interface. Voice recognition and facial recognition could be used instead of passwords to ensure security.

 In order to keep relevant for the future, you need efficient back office operations 	. 	. 	. 	on top of that, you need to be able to tailor make products 	. 	. 	. 	If you cannot provide those kind of services in the future, a competitor will and you will lose. 

That is the hype. The reality is much more complicated. A Financial Times survey of 30 leading banks  use of AI revealed an industry excited about the prospects of a technology that can help cut costs and boost returns. One bank even predicted that 50-70 per cent of jobs could be replaced.

Yet not only is there little consensus on how AI should be used in banking, many of the current efforts to apply machine learning are modest. Rather than racing towards an AI-enabled future, the industry is feeling its way forward.

2. Profiling customers

What does this mean?

Banks want to offer personalised communications and decisions based on detailed profiles of each customer. They could also use customer profiling and algorithmic sorting to assess risks and precision-target offers.

The technology behind it

AI could use the vast mass of unstructured data on each person to profile customers. Machine learning   computers which can learn from data   could then be used to analyse behaviour patterns. Algorithms could also automate increasing numbers of decisions. Language analysis will also be applied to word choice and syntax to predict decisions. This technology is already being used by some fund managers to assess the word choices of chief executives and work out what that means for future company performance.

 There are too many people making these statements [about big cost and job impacts],  says Foteini Agrafioti, head of Royal Bank of Canada s AI research arm Borealis.

 The problems we have solved are very narrow,  she adds.  The misconception is that humans and machines can perform at the same level. There s still a long way to go and many challenges we need to solve before a machine can operate [at a level] even near the human mind. 

Professor Patrick Henry Winston, who headed MIT s AI lab between 1972 and 1997 and is now a Ford professor at the institute, shares Ms Agrafioti s concerns about its limitations.

3. Streamlining processes

What does this mean?

The banks want  low-value processes  to be handled by AI. This would mean documents being scanned and parsed by computers. Some decision-making could be made by AIs operating with complete knowledge of the regulations and laws in each territory.

The technology behind it

Image recognition and machine learning could be combined to scan masses of documents, and take actions based on the laws and regulations which apply. Algorithms could then be used to decide which cases should be passed to a human decision maker.

 So much of what you need to replace thinking people [with] is not within the reach of today s so-called AI systems, which are really more perceptual than cognitive,  he says.  When will the cognitive happen? Eventually, but my crystal ball is cloudy on the timing. Few AI people today actually work on the cognitive side. 

As a group, banks all agree that AI is important, but their strategies for using it vary wildly. One European bank that took part in the survey told the FT it had 500-800 people working on AI; Nordea, of Sweden, generally believed to be one of the world s most technologically advanced banks, says it has just 25. AI budgets vary from below $3m to $15m among the few of the 30 big banks approached by the FT who were willing to disclose the data. One bank says it is ramping up spending from less than $3m a year to $50m-plus.

Overall, while banks are experimenting with AI across their businesses, they are not as bullish as public proclamations would suggest. Of the seven big banks willing to estimate the long-term cost savings of AI, six said it would cut costs by less than 20 per cent, others were more optimistic.

4. Spotting patterns

What does this mean?

AI could spot the anomalies or patterns in transactions which might indicate fraud and money-laundering. Face and voice recognition could also flag up fraudsters who are already in the system. Data could be sifted to find trading patterns that indicate risks or investment opportunities.

The technology behind it

Machine learning enables AI to parse the masses of unstructured data to separate the signal from the noise in markets, and it can self-correct. Complex image recognition can be used to identify people and objects.

 There is so much [unrealistic] AI hype in the banking industry and the banking execs are understandably confused,  says Zor Gorelov, chief executive and co-founder of Kasisto, a company that sells an AI platform KAI to banks including Singapore s DBS, Standard Chartered and 10 others.

 We re trying to be very realistic and set banks  expectations around the capabilities of the system. One of the things we do right away is we say,  our work system must have contextual connectivity to a person  	. 	. 	. 	because nobody can hand over, and probably for the foreseeable future they will not be able to hand over, 100 per cent of their process to AI. 

Unrealistic expectations are not the only hurdle banks face as they delve deeper into the AI world that promised so much. Several experts say there is a danger that too much investment flows into  sexy  areas such as chatbots at the expense of investment in behind-the-scenes processes where banks could make more significant gains.

So, against all this noise, where are banks focusing their AI attentions? The answer depends in part on what banks consider AI to be. Those that participated in the FT s research gave definitions as narrow as only programs that perform more basic functions that involve logical reason, learning and self correction without being explicitly programmed (RBC), to a vision of AI that includes all automation (Nomura). One of the definitions was 130 words long. One involved diagrams.

Shameek Kundu, Standard Chartered s chief data officer, says only about 20 per cent of the 14 AI projects and pilots the bank looked at in 2017 were focused on  pure cost or productivity .

 Most of them are about improving our risk appetite, reducing the risk but also increasing our ability to take risk,  he adds. Standard Chartered s AI definition is  a vision and set of technologies and approaches to allow machines to do things that require intelligence when done by humans .

Risk management is a consistent theme that comes up among the banks. Here the science is on their side, as it is for other rote tasks where human intervention can hinder rather than help.  For repetitive tasks without variability (in middle office, in back end) for clearing/settlement/operational processes that are not particularly in need of smarts, then AI approaches are great,  says Pascal Bouvier, a venture partner at Santander InnoVentures, a fintech venture capital fund of the Spanish bank that invests in early stage fintechs including those focused on AI.

 They are deterministic, and there is really no need for extravagant black box algos, nor is there much of a need for meeting a certain regulatory/legal threshold,  Mr Bouvier adds.  These fall into the category of optimisation, automation, smart automation, robot process automation. Great for banks to cut costs. 

As well as risk management applications, JPMorgan s use of AI to execute trades more efficiently could fall into this category, as could Citi s development of machine learning to handle pricing requests sent to traders.

Marika Lulay, chief executive of German fintech advisory company GFT Technologies, says there is a  clear difference  between  banks who focus on the understanding that new technology can give them new business models and new ways to generate money [while] other banks have cost reduction as their first goal. 

Banks are sensitive about alarming staff and unions about job cuts and are instead talking about freeing up workers to do more interesting jobs. As the AI debate has evolved, banks have changed their messaging so that the revenue growth potential of AI features at least as prominently as its cost cutting.

 We would like to use AI to bring smarter solutions to our customers, and be more effective in our decision making processes,  says Dutch banking group ING.  As such, rather than  AI replacing workforce  we believe in the power of  AI empowered workforce . 

At Royal Bank of Canada s Borealis, Ms Agrafioti says her team  prioritise the kind of things that we have evidence we can solve . This includes  analysing news and determining how world events can affect American markets .

The outcome will be  potentially revenue creating but also cost saving, these are the kind of tools that our researchers, our advisers, our financial advisers and people that do research will leverage to understand,  she adds.

For some, selecting the right areas to use AI is the most difficult issue.  It is easy to fall into the  let s use artificial intelligence for the sake of it  trap,  says Lindsey Argalas, chief digital and innovation officer at Santander.  Some AI-driven ideas may seem very  shiny  but in reality only create marginal improvements on existing data processing capabilities. 

At ABN Amro, the Dutch bank defends its decision to cast the AI net really wide to include a digital assistant for clients and tools to detect fraud and run risk analysis.

 To discover where the most value lies, we are actively experimenting,  ABN Amro says.  That applies not just for existing services, but also for new opportunities. We are investigating how we can make the work easier for our staff, and how clients can benefit from artificial intelligence. 

As AI projects pull banks in many different directions, evaluating success and leadership is a daunting prospect for outsiders.  It s very important to separate the marketing story from what the implementation story is, often there s quite a big difference between the two,  says Robeco s Mr Van Oerle.  If you look deeper at the core you can make quite a good judgment on whether its marketing is real. 

Mr Van Oerle looks for evidence of improved cost/income ratios and cross selling.  If you don t see them and the banks say that they are doing all these things in AI you have to ask yourself whether or not it s not really fundamental,  he says.

He said it would take banks longer to see results on AI programmes for their back office operations, while some were already seeing the impact on the front office side.  We have spoken to several banks that can clearly show that after implementing these technologies they have been able to cross sell much more of their products, and that they are better at communicating with their customers. 

Standard Chartered s Mr Kundu says it was  too early  for outsiders to see tangible results that would allow them to decide whether his bank s investment in AI is bearing fruit, especially because most of its AI adventures have been pilots.  Early results have been promising,  he adds.  They will be able to see the impact. 

For outsiders, the superficial signs do not suggest AI is about to take over the industry. It was eight years ago that those robots began showing guests around Santander City, but there is still not a single robot to be found in any of Santander s 13,697 bank branches.

The cost: Job cuts, spending and deploying AI

The FT surveyed 30 of the world s biggest banks about their approach to AI. Eighteen provided detailed answers to at least five of the 14 questions, another five gave descriptive responses on their AI efforts, the rest declined to participate. The results show:

Front office is king:

17 of the 18 banks are already using AI in front office for everything from Citi s Facebook messenger chatbot to UBS s use of Amazon s virtual assistant Alexa for customer service. Front office is also where banks see the biggest potential for AI-related savings.

Broad is best:

Eight of the 18 banks are using AI in front office, middle office, back office and data analytics. The other 10 are using it in three of the four areas.

Resources vary widely:

Nine banks provided details on staffing their AI efforts. One European bank, which asked to remain anonymous, employs between 500 and 800 people. Nordea said it had 25. Six banks gave details of AI spending; the sums ranged from  ¬5m to  ¬15m, with one institution planning to increase spending from below $3m to $50m a year.

Conservative on job cuts:

Seven banks gave estimates of possible AI-related job losses. Six said it would be below 20 per cent.

Seniors accountable:

Five of the 18 banks have management board members directly responsible for AI.

Partnerships in vogue:

Eight of the 18 banks are involved in joint ventures, four have made investments in AI-related companies.

JPMorgan addresses 'exceptions' to trades

Banks

JPMorgan is expecting big advantages in the way it prevents and resolves faulty trades after taking a significant minority stake in a start-up developing an industry-wide platform to deal with the trading problem of "exceptions".

"Exceptions" are trades that are entered into a bank's system but do not get processed because of errors. They can leave the bank with unhedged risk and can take up significant manpower to resolve.

JPMorgan, the world's biggest investment bank by revenue, has taken an undisclosed stake in AccessFintech, the developer of an analytics platform that pools banks' post-trade data. By offering a broad industry overview, the system allows banks to identify exceptions faster and resolve them with less difficulty.

AccessFintech is also joining JPMorgan's In-Residence programme, which supports fintech companies that are developing industry-wide products.

"We have been tracking AccessFintech's product evolution for some time and we think its ability to bring together different parts of the post-trade process into one aggregated view is technology that is long overdue in the industry," said Lawrence Waller, global head of markets and investor services operations at JPMorgan.

Fabrice Carrier, a managing director in JPMorgan's operations team, said that over time the AccessFintech system could cut the volume of exceptions across the industry in half, and could also "accelerate and simplify" the resolution of exceptions that did still occur. He estimates that exceptions make up less than 10 per cent of JPMorgan's daily trade volume but says those that still occur create a lot of "headaches and efforts and costs" to resolve. "There's a huge need for their product in the market, so yes we are excited," he added. AccessFintech is running a "proof of concept" across four dealers, including JPMorgan. "Three or four [banks] will generate a fair amount of activity for a better solution to problems," Mr Carrier said. As well as cutting costs, the platform would "improve the client experience", he added.

AccessFintech hopes that the backing from JPMorgan, which follows a privately funded seed capital round, will lead the way for other market participants to join the project.

S&P raises a red flag on leveraged lending

One thing to start,FirstGroup, the British owner of America s Greyhound bus service and one of the biggest train operators in the UK, has rejected an all-cash offer from private equity group Apollo. More here.

A warning from the largest US rating agency may interest many of our DD readers. S&P Global raised a red flag for investors on Monday, cautioning that the looming peak in the credit cycle could prove detrimental should a surge in private-equity backed M&A come to fruition.

The note from S&P analyst Paul Draffin landed on another volatile day on Wall Street, which saw the major equity indices slide. Investors have put much of the latest ructions down to the trade dispute between the US and China, with some raising the prospect that the global growth engine could be sputtering (although not contracting by any means).

Should equity prices come under further pressure, at least two investors   and many advisers   tell DD that it s likely to mean a pick-up in PE-backed M&A. That s good news for Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, JPMorgan and BofA Merrill Lynch, who have tussled to top the leveraged loan underwriting league tables this and last year. For private equity firms like KKR that have also built up their capital markets desks, it s also an important fee generator.

But for the investors buying these loans and bonds, it may prove problematic. Straight from S&P s Draffin:

Central bank liquidity and the pursuit of higher yields have led to an erosion of debtholder returns at a time of escalating risks. As a result, the risk/return profile of many leveraged loans issued so far in 2018 is at the weakest since late 2008.

S&P highlighted a few key points:

*

Covenant-lite loans (ie obligations that don t have the typical financial covenants that can protect investors) now account for more than three-quarters of global deals completed this year.

*

M&A deal multiples keep climbing as PE firms compete with companies on buyouts.

*

Leverage is approaching or exceeding 2007 levels, particularly for first lien loans that sit at the top of the capital structure.

And a reminder that these loans can cause losses at the banks underwriting them. Reuters highlighted a deal from American Greetings, the greeting card maker, last week. Investors baulked at the bond and loan financing, in part because of falling earnings at the company. The nine-bank syndicate leading the financing suffered a collective loss of $11m.

A busy week forHNA Group

In the span of a few days, HNA, the sprawling Chinese conglomerate, called off another IPO, announced the sale of a $6bn chunk of Hilton and hired a former Trump administration adviser.

It s been obvious for months that HNA, which started as a regional airline in the 1990s but has since gone on a $40bn global buying spree, has been facing a long list of problems.

For one, the Chinese government has clearly pushed HNA to divest from many of its overseas assets. It s also under intense scrutiny from overseas regulators, with Switzerland and New Zealand calling into question the veracity of information the company has provided in regulatory filings. Then there are leverage problems. Banks have expressed concerns over HNA s ability to pay back its massive pile of debt.

With that in mind, it s still hard to figure out what the group has been up to this week.

On Tuesday, HNA said it hadcanned the listing of Swissport on Switzerland s SIX exchange, plans it had announced less than three months earlier.Just two weeks before this it scrapped another Swiss IPO, that of Gategroup. On the same day, it sought to liquidate its stake in Hilton with the aim of raising $6bn.

But perhaps the most striking move by HNA this week was to hire Israel Hernandez, who as recently as December was serving the Trump administration. Here s the FT story.

Hernandez was as senior adviser to US Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, as well as acting undersecretary of international trade for nine months until December 2017, and now he will head HNA s international corporate affairs.

It s unclear why the company has sought to hire high-profile political figures; it s the second such appointment in recent months. In December, it hired former German vice-chancellor Philipp Rsler to head the New York-based Hainan Cihang Charity Foundation, which is now HNA s largest shareholder.

Mallrats

There was more tussling between UK mall owner Hammerson and its would-be French suitor Klpierre when the latter s chairman, Jean-Marc Jestin, flew to London in a bid to woo his counterpart this week.

Having had its 5bn takeover approach for Hammerson swiftly rebuffed last month,Klpierre came back to the table with a slightly increased proposal of 635p per Hammerson share, to be paid half in new Klpierre shares and half in cash. Its previous offer had been 615p, writes the FT s property correspondent Aime Williams.

Hammerson s board swiftly crushed the improved offer too, with chairman David Tyler adamant that it  continues to very significantly undervalue the company" and pointing to independent valuations of its properties. The UK group believes its portfolio of shopping centres, which includes London s Brent Cross and Birmingham s Bullring, is worth about 10.5bn   but its shares trade well below this.

Klpierre s advances, meanwhile, are delaying Hammerson s planned 3.4bn union with Intu. Interestingly, the price offered by Hammerson for that business reflects a discount of around a third off the value of its properties.

This won t be the last we hear from Klpierre. If Hammerson is to be believed, the French group was challenged to put its fresh proposal in writing, but declined   it still has until April 16 to make a firm offer under the UK takeover code.

Job moves

*

Lawyers Rory Moriarty and Teresa Dyson, and banker John O Sullivan have been appointed to Australia s takeover board. Moriarty is an M&A and capital markets lawyer at Clayton, and Dyson is a consultant at McCullough Robertson. O Sullivan was an investment banker at Credit Suisse in Asia.

*

KKR, the New York-based buyout fund, has said it intends to hire David Haines as executive chairman of the Global Spreads Business, a unit it agreed toacquirefrom Unilever. The appointment is subject to the deal being completed successfully. Haines was previously chairman and chief executive of Grohe Group, and subsequently chief executive of Lixil Water Technology. He began his career at Lever Sunlicht.

*

Wayne Tsou, a managing director at Carlyle, is retiring from the firm, Bloomberg reported citing unnamed sources familiar with the matter. Tsou, who is based in Hong Kong, joined the US buyout fund in 2004. He will continueto be involved with the firm as an adviser.

Deutsche Bank chief executive John Cryan once mooted replacing as many as half his 98,000 staff with robots. His dramatic ousting last weekend means he will not be held to that promise, but investors need not look far for other bankers talking up the potential of artificial intelligence to revolutionise an industry that has struggled with profitability in the decade since the financial crisis.

Former Citigroup chief Vikram Pandit   reborn as a fintech evangelist   predicted 30 per cent of banking jobs could be wiped out by AI in five years. Mizuho Financial Group in Japan says it will use AI to replace 19,000 people by 2027   about a third of its workforce.

Almost every big name consultancy has published research on how AI will transform banking. KPMG went one step further with its vision of an  invisible bank  where  enlightened virtual assistants  replace people at all points of customer interaction.

Santander introduced red robots to show guests around their Spanish visitor centre in 2010. UBS has Amazon s digital assistant Alexa on customer service duty, JPMorgan is using robots (the invisible kind) to execute trades and Morgan Stanley has an AI fraud detection team. Just this week, HSBC said it would follow suit by using AI to detect money laundering, fraud and terrorist funding.

 Long term I think this [harnessing AI and technology] will determine the split between winners and losers,  says Jeroen van Oerle, an investor who runs one of Europe s first fintech focused funds for Robeco based in the Netherlands.

How the banks want to use AI

1. Chatbots and virtual personal assistants

What does this mean?

Banks are using chatbots and voice bots to interact with customers and solve problems before any human staff get involved.

The technology behind it

Natural language processing and generation will make it increasingly difficult for customers to tell whether they are talking to a human or an AI interface. Voice recognition and facial recognition could be used instead of passwords to ensure security.

 In order to keep relevant for the future, you need efficient back office operations 	. 	. 	. 	on top of that, you need to be able to tailor make products 	. 	. 	. 	If you cannot provide those kind of services in the future, a competitor will and you will lose. 

That is the hype. The reality is much more complicated. A Financial Times survey of 30 leading banks  use of AI revealed an industry excited about the prospects of a technology that can help cut costs and boost returns. One bank even predicted that 50-70 per cent of jobs could be replaced.

Yet not only is there little consensus on how AI should be used in banking, many of the current efforts to apply machine learning are modest. Rather than racing towards an AI-enabled future, the industry is feeling its way forward.

2. Profiling customers

What does this mean?

Banks want to offer personalised communications and decisions based on detailed profiles of each customer. They could also use customer profiling and algorithmic sorting to assess risks and precision-target offers.

The technology behind it

AI could use the vast mass of unstructured data on each person to profile customers. Machine learning   computers which can learn from data   could then be used to analyse behaviour patterns. Algorithms could also automate increasing numbers of decisions. Language analysis will also be applied to word choice and syntax to predict decisions. This technology is already being used by some fund managers to assess the word choices of chief executives and work out what that means for future company performance.

 There are too many people making these statements [about big cost and job impacts],  says Foteini Agrafioti, head of Royal Bank of Canada s AI research arm Borealis.

 The problems we have solved are very narrow,  she adds.  The misconception is that humans and machines can perform at the same level. There s still a long way to go and many challenges we need to solve before a machine can operate [at a level] even near the human mind. 

Professor Patrick Henry Winston, who headed MIT s AI lab between 1972 and 1997 and is now a Ford professor at the institute, shares Ms Agrafioti s concerns about its limitations.

3. Streamlining processes

What does this mean?

The banks want  low-value processes  to be handled by AI. This would mean documents being scanned and parsed by computers. Some decision-making could be made by AIs operating with complete knowledge of the regulations and laws in each territory.

The technology behind it

Image recognition and machine learning could be combined to scan masses of documents, and take actions based on the laws and regulations which apply. Algorithms could then be used to decide which cases should be passed to a human decision maker.

 So much of what you need to replace thinking people [with] is not within the reach of today s so-called AI systems, which are really more perceptual than cognitive,  he says.  When will the cognitive happen? Eventually, but my crystal ball is cloudy on the timing. Few AI people today actually work on the cognitive side. 

As a group, banks all agree that AI is important, but their strategies for using it vary wildly. One European bank that took part in the survey told the FT it had 500-800 people working on AI; Nordea, of Sweden, generally believed to be one of the world s most technologically advanced banks, says it has just 25. AI budgets vary from below $3m to $15m among the few of the 30 big banks approached by the FT who were willing to disclose the data. One bank says it is ramping up spending from less than $3m a year to $50m-plus.

Overall, while banks are experimenting with AI across their businesses, they are not as bullish as public proclamations would suggest. Of the seven big banks willing to estimate the long-term cost savings of AI, six said it would cut costs by less than 20 per cent, others were more optimistic.

4. Spotting patterns

What does this mean?

AI could spot the anomalies or patterns in transactions which might indicate fraud and money-laundering. Face and voice recognition could also flag up fraudsters who are already in the system. Data could be sifted to find trading patterns that indicate risks or investment opportunities.

The technology behind it

Machine learning enables AI to parse the masses of unstructured data to separate the signal from the noise in markets, and it can self-correct. Complex image recognition can be used to identify people and objects.

 There is so much [unrealistic] AI hype in the banking industry and the banking execs are understandably confused,  says Zor Gorelov, chief executive and co-founder of Kasisto, a company that sells an AI platform KAI to banks including Singapore s DBS, Standard Chartered and 10 others.

 We re trying to be very realistic and set banks  expectations around the capabilities of the system. One of the things we do right away is we say,  our work system must have contextual connectivity to a person  	. 	. 	. 	because nobody can hand over, and probably for the foreseeable future they will not be able to hand over, 100 per cent of their process to AI. 

Unrealistic expectations are not the only hurdle banks face as they delve deeper into the AI world that promised so much. Several experts say there is a danger that too much investment flows into  sexy  areas such as chatbots at the expense of investment in behind-the-scenes processes where banks could make more significant gains.

So, against all this noise, where are banks focusing their AI attentions? The answer depends in part on what banks consider AI to be. Those that participated in the FT s research gave definitions as narrow as only programs that perform more basic functions that involve logical reason, learning and self correction without being explicitly programmed (RBC), to a vision of AI that includes all automation (Nomura). One of the definitions was 130 words long. One involved diagrams.

Shameek Kundu, Standard Chartered s chief data officer, says only about 20 per cent of the 14 AI projects and pilots the bank looked at in 2017 were focused on  pure cost or productivity .

 Most of them are about improving our risk appetite, reducing the risk but also increasing our ability to take risk,  he adds. Standard Chartered s AI definition is  a vision and set of technologies and approaches to allow machines to do things that require intelligence when done by humans .

Risk management is a consistent theme that comes up among the banks. Here the science is on their side, as it is for other rote tasks where human intervention can hinder rather than help.  For repetitive tasks without variability (in middle office, in back end) for clearing/settlement/operational processes that are not particularly in need of smarts, then AI approaches are great,  says Pascal Bouvier, a venture partner at Santander InnoVentures, a fintech venture capital fund of the Spanish bank that invests in early stage fintechs including those focused on AI.

 They are deterministic, and there is really no need for extravagant black box algos, nor is there much of a need for meeting a certain regulatory/legal threshold,  Mr Bouvier adds.  These fall into the category of optimisation, automation, smart automation, robot process automation. Great for banks to cut costs. 

As well as risk management applications, JPMorgan s use of AI to execute trades more efficiently could fall into this category, as could Citi s development of machine learning to handle pricing requests sent to traders.

Marika Lulay, chief executive of German fintech advisory company GFT Technologies, says there is a  clear difference  between  banks who focus on the understanding that new technology can give them new business models and new ways to generate money [while] other banks have cost reduction as their first goal. 

Banks are sensitive about alarming staff and unions about job cuts and are instead talking about freeing up workers to do more interesting jobs. As the AI debate has evolved, banks have changed their messaging so that the revenue growth potential of AI features at least as prominently as its cost cutting.

 We would like to use AI to bring smarter solutions to our customers, and be more effective in our decision making processes,  says Dutch banking group ING.  As such, rather than  AI replacing workforce  we believe in the power of  AI empowered workforce . 

At Royal Bank of Canada s Borealis, Ms Agrafioti says her team  prioritise the kind of things that we have evidence we can solve . This includes  analysing news and determining how world events can affect American markets .

The outcome will be  potentially revenue creating but also cost saving, these are the kind of tools that our researchers, our advisers, our financial advisers and people that do research will leverage to understand,  she adds.

For some, selecting the right areas to use AI is the most difficult issue.  It is easy to fall into the  let s use artificial intelligence for the sake of it  trap,  says Lindsey Argalas, chief digital and innovation officer at Santander.  Some AI-driven ideas may seem very  shiny  but in reality only create marginal improvements on existing data processing capabilities. 

At ABN Amro, the Dutch bank defends its decision to cast the AI net really wide to include a digital assistant for clients and tools to detect fraud and run risk analysis.

 To discover where the most value lies, we are actively experimenting,  ABN Amro says.  That applies not just for existing services, but also for new opportunities. We are investigating how we can make the work easier for our staff, and how clients can benefit from artificial intelligence. 

As AI projects pull banks in many different directions, evaluating success and leadership is a daunting prospect for outsiders.  It s very important to separate the marketing story from what the implementation story is, often there s quite a big difference between the two,  says Robeco s Mr Van Oerle.  If you look deeper at the core you can make quite a good judgment on whether its marketing is real. 

Mr Van Oerle looks for evidence of improved cost/income ratios and cross selling.  If you don t see them and the banks say that they are doing all these things in AI you have to ask yourself whether or not it s not really fundamental,  he says.

He said it would take banks longer to see results on AI programmes for their back office operations, while some were already seeing the impact on the front office side.  We have spoken to several banks that can clearly show that after implementing these technologies they have been able to cross sell much more of their products, and that they are better at communicating with their customers. 

Standard Chartered s Mr Kundu says it was  too early  for outsiders to see tangible results that would allow them to decide whether his bank s investment in AI is bearing fruit, especially because most of its AI adventures have been pilots.  Early results have been promising,  he adds.  They will be able to see the impact. 

For outsiders, the superficial signs do not suggest AI is about to take over the industry. It was eight years ago that those robots began showing guests around Santander City, but there is still not a single robot to be found in any of Santander s 13,697 bank branches.

The cost: Job cuts, spending and deploying AI

The FT surveyed 30 of the world s biggest banks about their approach to AI. Eighteen provided detailed answers to at least five of the 14 questions, another five gave descriptive responses on their AI efforts, the rest declined to participate. The results show:

Front office is king:

17 of the 18 banks are already using AI in front office for everything from Citi s Facebook messenger chatbot to UBS s use of Amazon s virtual assistant Alexa for customer service. Front office is also where banks see the biggest potential for AI-related savings.

Broad is best:

Eight of the 18 banks are using AI in front office, middle office, back office and data analytics. The other 10 are using it in three of the four areas.

Resources vary widely:

Nine banks provided details on staffing their AI efforts. One European bank, which asked to remain anonymous, employs between 500 and 800 people. Nordea said it had 25. Six banks gave details of AI spending; the sums ranged from  ¬5m to  ¬15m, with one institution planning to increase spending from below $3m to $50m a year.

Conservative on job cuts:

Seven banks gave estimates of possible AI-related job losses. Six said it would be below 20 per cent.

Seniors accountable:

Five of the 18 banks have management board members directly responsible for AI.

Partnerships in vogue:

Eight of the 18 banks are involved in joint ventures, four have made investments in AI-related companies.

Security Chiefs Reckon With Blockchain, Privacy and AI

NEW YORK -- Anticipating the cybersecurity repercussions of artificial intelligence and blockchain is no easy matter, said specialists at the SecureCISO conference here Thursday.

They expect the next 12 months to bring challenges in understanding and staying ahead of developments in the corporate use of blockchain distributed ledgers, as well as how AI will or won't protect sensitive data. Here are the highlights of the discussion:

Blockchain secures the technology supply chain. International Flavors & Fragrances Inc. is planning to use blockchain, the digital ledger technology, to provide customers and regulators more visibility in its supply chain, according to Thomas Maldonado, the firm's chief information security officer. The technology might also help detect counterfeit ingredients, he said. Other companies, such as Walmart Inc., have started using blockchain to manage data about food to streamline product recalls. Blockchain could also help CISOs protect their technology supply chain, said Mr. Maldonado. For example, blockchain might help guarantee that server components are coming from where the manufacturer claims. "It can give you a greater level of comfort because you know you're getting that exact transparency," Mr. Maldonado said.

Increased focus on privacy. Consumers and regulators are increasingly demanding that companies better protect the privacy of their users and customers, said Matt Nappi, chief information security officer at Stony Brook University. "We're seeing that with Facebook right now, we're seeing that with the results of Equifax and regulators sinking their teeth into that breach," he said, referring to how Facebook Inc. improperly shared user data with an analytics firm and a breach at Equifax Inc. that compromised the personal information of up to 147.9 million U.S. consumers. As a result, companies need to bolster their privacy controls and embrace technologies that can identify and remove cyberthreats without compromising users' personal information. "As security professionals, our challenge is going to be maintaining a level of privacy while accomplishing our goal of detecting and responding to cybersecurity threats," he said.

Artificial intelligence takes two paths. Jim Ambrosini, technology risk officer for consumer banking at Wells Fargo & Co., said artificial intelligence has largely been the provenance of technology vendors and startups. But large financial firms have hired data scientists and statisticians to develop their own in-house AI tools. "We are developing capabilities that are as good or greater than some vendors," he said. Banks are using machine learning and AI to predict risks such as loan defaults and application failures as a result of natural disasters, he said. "We want to detect threats, understand anomalies and make a decision faster than a human" using AI, he added. As large companies continue to pour money into their own proprietary technology, AI startups will increasingly focus on small and mid-sized businesses or play a supportive role. "The large companies that develop their own solutions are going to force consolidation that will compete, work with, or enhance the in-house AI cybersecurity solutions," he said.

BlackRock Attracts Nearly $57 Billion of New Investor Cash; iShares ETFs pulls in the majority of the firm's first-quarter haul

BlackRock Inc. pulled in nearly $57 billion in new investor cash in the first three months of the year, with its massive exchange-traded fund business attracting the bulk of that money.

The world's largest asset manager has sucked up investor cash flowing into market-mimicking funds in recent years and boasts the biggest ETF business in the world by assets.

The company's iShares ETFs attracted $34.65 billion in net inflows in the first quarter. Earnings and revenues rose 27% and 16% from the same year-ago period.

Shares of the company rose nearly 3% in early morning trading.

BlackRock also showed progress in an area where it has long struggled: the performance of its actively managed stock funds that try to beat, rather than match the market. Its actively managed stock funds pulled in net new money for the first time since the end of 2015. Most of that $1 billion came from retail investors.

The turnaround comes a year after BlackRock unveiled plans to revamp its lineup of active equity funds. It put a heavier emphasis on robots to pick stocks than humans, cut fees on some funds and streamlined its research.

"Our performance is improving to strong," Chief Executive Laurence Fink said of the stockpicking business in an interview. "We're in a better position than we have been in a long time," in active equities, he added.

Those funds are also faring better when compared with rivals. The firm said 34% of assets in its fundamental active equity products underperformed their benchmarks or peers over one year and 23% underperformed over three years. That is an improvement from the same time last year when 36% of those assets underperformed over one year and 35% underperformed over three years.

If markets remain volatile, Mr. Fink said, "it should then allow active investors to perform better."

Actively managed strategies represent a smaller amount of assets than iShares but provide more revenue to the firm.

BlackRock also made progress in another priority area: generating more revenue from its Aladdin risk and portfolio management technology. Customers in Europe and Asia helped drive a 19.5% year-over-year increase to $184 million in technology and risk management revenue at BlackRock.

When markets are more volatile, as they were in February and March, demand for BlackRock's risk management analytics is higher than "when things are nice and cozy and easy," Mr. Fink said.

For BlackRock Aladdin serves as in-house technology, a source of revenue from other firms across Wall Street, a calling card and an opportunity for cross-selling other products.

"Size, a robust commitment to technological innovation and a diverse product lineup are critical for asset managers," to contend with changing fees and sales strategies in the industry, analysts at Edward Jones wrote in a note Thursday. "In our view, BlackRock is one of the few asset managers that fit this profile."

In the first quarter BlackRock made $1.09 billion, or $6.68 a share, compared with $859 million, or $5.21 a share, for the same period the year before. On an adjusted basis, it earned $6.70 a share, compared with $5.23 per share a year ago. That beat expectations from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters of adjusted earnings of $6.39 per share.

Revenue at BlackRock rose 16% to $3.58 billion compared with $3.09 billion in the same period a year ago. As of the end of the quarter, BlackRock had $6.32 trillion under management, roughly flat from the end of 2017.

Altitude Investment Management has raised $18.7 million for its debut fund focused on cannabis deals, aiming at a target of $50 million.

The New York-based firm said the funding came from more than 50 investors.

Its portfolio includes several cannabis-ecosystem companies, including marijuana market data platform BDS Analytics and the Green Organic Dutchman, an organic cannabis specialist.

Many investors consider cannabis an emerging market opportunity, but at the same time are wary of regulatory risks. Though recreational cannabis use has been legalized in several states in recent years, it remains an illicit drug at the federal level.

An Altitude Investment Management spokeswoman said the fund's limited partners are a mix of family offices and high net-worth individuals.

Brevan Howard to launch Asia-focused macro fund in effort to reverse outflows

Equities

Brevan Howard is raising money for a new fund that will make bets on Asian markets, as the former hedge fund behemoth seeks to reverse outflows.

The London-based firm, which was cofounded in 2002 by billionaire Alan Howard and four former colleagues from Credit Suisse, is planning to launch the MB Macro fund by the end of the second quarter, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Brevan Howard declined to comment.

So-called macro funds, which make wagers on currencies and rates based on global macroeconomic trends, have endured a testing few years as central bank stimulus helped subdue market volatility.

Brevan's flagship Master fund, run by Mr Howard and other managers, fell more than 5 per cent in 2017.

The launch of the fund, which will be run by Singapore-based trader Minal Bathwal, comes as the backdrop for macro funds becomes more benign. Strategists say that rising interest rates and a return of volatility to the stock market should help improve last year's performance.

An easing in fears over China's corporate debt pile contributed to the benign backdrop for stocks last year, and the Asian economy will continue to help set major global trends.

At the same time, speculation is increasing that the Bank of Japan will this year signal an eventual end to its stimulus programme.

In 2017, hedge funds that invested in stocks fared better than most other types of funds, including those making major bets based on broad economic trends, according to data from LCH Investments, a research and investing company.

Mr Bathwal has delivered an annualised return of 17.5 per cent since 2008 when he joined Brevan Howard, according to one person close to the firm.

Brevan Howard, like other macro hedge fund managers, has been hit by redemptions over the past few years.

Its assets have fallen from a peak of around $40bn in early 2014 to about $8.5bn. The firm was forced to close its emerging market fund in 2014 following a sharp sell-off across some of the developing economies the previous year.

However, macro strategies have rebounded in popularity in 2018. According to figures from eVestment, an analytics group, investors put $11.5bn into macro funds in the first two months of the year, just over half the $21.8bn invested in hedge funds overall.

The reversal of fortunes for macro strategies has seen other well-known managers and financiers prepare to launch their own macro funds, including former GLG and Moore Capital star trader Greg Coffey, Hassim Dhoda in London, and Jon Corzine, the former Goldman Sachs executive who then ran MF Global.

Tech
New Target for China's Censors: Content Driven by Artificial Intelligence ; While Facebook's Zuckerberg is grilled in Washington, Beijing has been shutting down apps it says are problematic

BEIJING A new battle over censorship is playing out in China, one that underscores the differences in how the world's two largest economies are dealing with advances in technology that are upending the news business and social media.

In the U.S., disclosures over Facebook Inc.'s privacy lapses led to Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg testifying on Capitol Hill. In China, concerns over a smartphone app trafficking in off-color jokes led to authorities shutting it down and an abject apology from the site's operator.

"This entire time we've been overemphasizing the value of technology without realizing that technology must be guided by socialist core values," Zhang Yiming, founder of Beijing Bytedance Technology Co., said in a statement.

Bytedance Technology produces wildly popular news and entertainment apps driven by artificial intelligence. Authorities shut down its humor app, Neihan Duanzi, earlier this week on grounds that its content wasn't in keeping with "a clean online audiovisual environment," triggering thousands of comments on social media mourning its demise.

Also this week, four news apps were ordered temporarily removed from online stores including Bytedance's flagship product Jinri Toutiao, or "Today's Headlines," which claims 120 million daily active users.

The Bytedance apps are distinctive in China for relying almost entirely on algorithms to feed users content based on their personal preferences. That AI-driven approach helped the startup achieve a soaring $30 billion valuation, but has also sparked criticisms that it is flooding users with clickbait of questionable taste.

Moreover, Bytedance's model presents a challenge to the Communist Party, which under President Xi Jinping has pushed hard to carve out more space in the public discourse for political messages from official propaganda outlets.

The Neihan Duanzi shutdown is the latest in a series of recent "https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-removes-apps-that-allowed-china-users-to-get-around-filters-1501341653". Where in the past "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jailed-for-a-text-chinas-censors-are-spying-on-mobile-chat-groups-1512665007" on sensitive political content, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-apples-services-grow-in-china-so-does-its-censorship-risk-1501752605" that traffic in material they consider prurient, including scantily clad women and celebrity gossip.

Chinese officials have portrayed the increased censorship as an effective way of dealing with a problem that confronts all governments in the social-media age: How to keep fake news, filter bubbles, exploitation, abuse and dark phenomena of the internet from growing to the point where they threaten society.

In his testimony in Washington on Tuesday, Mr. Zuckerberg mirrored Mr. Zhang in apologizing for his platform's failures to protect user privacy and fight misinformation, and promising to make sure his company's tools are "used for good."

He also warned that too much government regulation could stifle innovation, saying that artificial intelligence might help solve some of Facebook's problems.

China's government is keen on promoting commercial innovation, especially in advanced fields such as artificial intelligence, but not at the expense of compromising social values, said Zhu Wei, an expert in internet law and regulation at China University of Politics and Law.

"Facebook, Bytedance and the like are commercial enterprises. They need to make money and drive traffic," Mr. Zhu said. "In China, the companies don't have enough self-discipline, so the government is stepping in."

In his apology, Mr. Zhang said the company would improve its algorithms and automatic filtering to be more socially responsible. He also acknowledged the limits of artificial intelligence in managing content, saying he planned to expand the company's in-house team of human censors to 10,000 from 6,000 currently.

The two agencies leading the clampdown, the Cyberspace Administration of China and the State Administration of Radio and Television, didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

The week before the crackdown on news apps, authorities banned two live-streaming video apps, including one owned by Bytedance, from registering new users. The action followed accusations by the state broadcaster that the apps promoted teen pregnancy by allowing underage mothers to stream videos of themselves.

On Wednesday, another video platform owned by Bytedance, Douyin, turned off its live-streaming and commenting functions.

The company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

Loneliness of the commodity hedge fund manager as firm after firm bolts

Wider spread of data sparks retreat   but survivors still see opportunity to reap gains

Being a commodities hedge fund manager is an increasingly lonely pursuit. Specialists in fuels, crops and metals have been exiting, and few arrivals are taking their place.

This class of traders once threw its weight around in futures markets. In the past 12 months, firms such as Jamison Capital Partners, Madava Asset Management and Astenbeck Capital Management have shut down funds, the latest in a prolonged retreat.

Extracting profit from commodities trading has become more difficult as ample supplies calm prices, marketmoving information becomes broadly available, and automated traders leap ahead of participants taking a more considered view.

Casement Capital's David Mooney said commodities hedge funds were undergoing "an extinction event. Just about everyone has gone out of business".

Surviving managers see opportunities   just not where commodities hedge funds scored big in years past.

Even as marquee names shut down, Jonathan Goldberg, who leads BBL Commodities, has launched a second fund in addition to the energy-focused one he established in 2013. It will use commodity signals to trade equity indices and currencies.

Mr Goldberg, speaking at the FT Commodities Global Summit last month, agreed that trading had become tougher compared to when fundamental information was harder to find.

"Has it become impossible? No," he said. BBL returned 2 per cent in 2017.

A former trader at Goldman Sachs and Glencore, the commodities trading house, Mr Goldberg said the "speed at which the market interprets new data has definitely changed. So I think the funds that have done well and have succeeded are adapting to that new dynamic."

He said that adaptation included trading less in the most active futures contracts and more in those with later delivery dates, or focusing more on "relative value" trades that tracked price differences between one contract and another, such as crude oil and diesel.

Sebastian Barrack is head of commodities at Citadel, the $28bn Chicago-based hedge fund. As a multistrategy group, Citadel is involved in a variety of markets.

But the unit Mr Barrack ran would rank as one of the largest commodities hedge funds if it was independent, he told the summit.

Mr Barrack said many commodities funds maintained a bullish bias during the raw materials rally of the previous decade, flattering their results until markets turned lower. The decline in volatility across markets also hurt many fund managers.

But he argued that the broader availability of commodities information had empowered the hedge funds that were able to process it, giving them a window into flows once reserved for owners of commodities infrastructure and physical merchants.

Citadel had "as good an opportunity today as ever before", he said.

David Lilley, co-founder of Red Kite, a London-based metals hedge fund, suggested that the winnowing of commodities funds was improving the outlook for survivors.

"The lack of discretionary money that's trading those opportunities means those opportunities are available to be picked up," he said.

Assets managed by commodities hedge funds totalled $21.9bn at the end of 2017, down from a peak of $28.3bn in 2012, said Hedge Fund Research.

"Commodity trading is tough, with no coupons, dividends, or real price appreciation over time to soften the blows. It's becoming even tougher," Jamison Capital's Stephen Jamison said in a letter reported by Reuters.

Mr Jamison, who did not respond to a request for comment, added in the letter that technologies such as artificial intelligence had removed short-term trading opportunities.

The falling population of commodities hedge funds is in contrast to booming activity in futures markets, partly fuelled by money managers.

CME, the biggest exchange operator, reported record volumes of energy and metals contracts in the first quarter, while agricultural volume was up 26 per cent from a year before.

But an increasing share of the volumes is coming from computerised trading firms and investors using commodities as a proxy for broader economic trends, not commodities specialists counting barrels or bushels.

In oil, "the lesson learnt is that the herd mentality is strong, and tourist traders cycling in and out of positions can make for violent price swings," Michael Tran, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note.

Yet Marwan Younes, chief investment officer of commodities fund Massar, said growth of computerised or exotic trading was less a bane than a blessing. The more these strategies pushed prices out of line, the better for the hedge funds that understood fair value.

"Are fundamentals more challenging to trade? In fact, it's quite the opposite. The algorithmic community  & actually creates opportunity for discretionary managers such as myself," he said.
