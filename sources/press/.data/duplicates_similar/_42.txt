Fed looks beyond banks' financial targets; News analysis

Some of the banks were punished for failing 'qualitative' measures, write Gina Chon and Camilla Hall

Banks on both sides of the Atlantic are learning the hard way that hitting the financial targets in the Federal Reserve's annual stress tests may not be enough.

Four of the five banks that had their capital plans rejected yesterday, affecting their ability to deploy their cash on dividends and share buybacks, met the headline number of a 5 per cent minimum tier one common capital ratio.

Yet the central bank still punished Citigroup and the US units of HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and Santander on "qualitative" measures such as their ability to project how another financial crisis would affect their revenues, and what losses they would suffer.

The Fed's calculation took in whether banks were appropriately addressing potential risks, the strength of their capital planning and risk management practices, and corporate governance issues. Only one bank, Utah's Zions Bancorp, was rejected because it failed to meet the 5 per cent minimum.

Karen Shaw Petrou, a managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics, said: "Past stress tests were largely pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey exercises - that is, a big bank hit the capital number and it won the [Fed's] blessing to pay dividends.

"Now, looking more broadly at qualitative factors, the [Fed] is making the tests far more rigorous and demanding - a good thing since capital models are complex and don't always stand up under real stress."

Analysts describe the qualitative measures as something of a "black box", leaving investors uncertain over the specific shortfalls that might leave a bank on the wrong side of the line.

The Fed gave banks time to assess its analysis before publishing it, providing them with preliminary results of its capital analysis to give them a few days to make cuts to their capital plans before it released the results.

Goldman Sachs and Bank of America received approval from the Fed only after lowering their planned payout to investors in a resubmission of its capital proposals. Their original capital plans would have brought them under the minimum regulatory criteria, which include a 4 per cent leverage ratio.

Under the revised plans, BofA's leverage ratio rose to 4.1 per cent, compared with the initial 3.9 per cent. Goldman's leverage ratio improved to 4.2 per cent, from 3.9 per cent.

The Fed's announcement was the trigger for many banks that were given the all-clear to reveal their 2014 capital plans. JPMorgan said it would increase its dividend from 38 cents to 40 cents per share from the second quarter of this year and implement a $6.5bn share buyback in the 12 months from April 1.

Morgan Stanley said its plans included share repurchases of up to $1bn beginning in the second quarter, in addition to doubling its dividend to 10 cents per share.

BofA said it would increase its dividend from 1 cent to 5 cents per share - its first dividend increase since 2007 - and initiate a new $4bn stock repurchase programme, replacing a buyback plan from last year that expires on Monday.

Goldman did not disclose details of its capital plans but Lloyd Blankfein, chief executive, said its proposal "provides flexibility to manage our capital resources dynamically and return excess capital to our shareholders". Wells Fargo said it planned to raise its dividend by 17 per cent to 35 cents per share for the second quarter. Its board also approved adding 350m shares to its stock repurchase plans.

Even as the banks' recovery from the financial crisis allows them to pay out increasing sums to shareholders, publication of the stress tests, on the same day as BofA announced its latest multibillion dollar settlement, are a reminder of the legacy of regulatory scrutiny that stemmed from that crisis.

"Big brother banking is bigger than ever," Mike Mayo, analyst at CLSA, said of the regulators' role.

Many investors are buying bank stocks again to gain longer-term exposure to the US economy and a recovering housing market, rather than focusing on dividends. But a 5 per cent fall in Citi's stock after hours was a reminder of the short-term reputational damage that can stem from falling foul of regulators' raised expectations.

WSJ.D Technology: A Deal Maker Loses Out on Riches From King Digital

LONDON -- King Digital Entertainment PLC's coming stock-market debut will shower its employees and investors with riches.

But a private-equity executive who made a crucial, early investment in the mobile-games maker will get hardly a thing.

Mike Chalfen was a young deal maker at London-based Apax Partners LLP in 2005 when he led the firm's 29 million euro ($40 million) investment in the maker of "Candy Crush Saga." In a feat of exquisitely unfortunate timing, he left the next year -- just months before he would have received a share of the firm's profit from the deal, known as carried interest.

It turned out to be a monster investment. Apax owns about half of King Digital, a stake valued in securities filings at $3.5 billion.

"I'm not going to make a penny," says Mr. Chalfen, 42 years old. Private-equity partners typically don't receive their shares of carried interest in deals unless they remain with a fund for a sufficient length of time. It couldn't be determined what Mr. Chalfen might have made had he stayed on.

Mr. Chalfen says he left Apax in 2006 after a decade because the firm decided to focus exclusively on leveraged buyouts instead of startups. Apax declines to comment.

Private-equity firms raise money from investors in funds that last about 10 years. The firms typically charge an annual fee, usually 2%, and keep 20% of the profit from the sales of assets.

Mr. Chalfen will get something from the King offering. He has exposure to the digital-games maker through an investment Apax employees made in their firm's 4.3 billion euro fund. But that investment, he says, is "very small" compared with the carried interest he would have received.

"It sounds very harsh but that's the way carried interest works," says Guy Fraser-Sampson, who lectures on private equity at Cass Business School in London. "A partner doesn't become entitled for carried interest for a number of years. And if they leave before the minimum vesting period expires, they get between none of it and some of it."

Mr. Chalfen joined London-based venture-capital firm Advent Venture Partners LLP in 2008 and says he doesn't regret leaving Apax, despite missing out on the King sale. "It was becoming focused totally on buyouts, and I wanted to do something else," he says. "Apax is a fantastic firm and was a great place for me to learn the business."

Mr. Chalfen says King's founders impressed him when he met them in 2004. Chief Executive Riccardo Zacconi and Chief Creative Officer Sebastian Knutsson were developing a company with a "philosophy of making games enjoyable" by providing positive feedback to users, Mr. Chalfen says. "The team had a clear thesis on how to grow the online-games market."

Users were "sticky," he says, meaning they kept returning to play King games.

Roy Mackenzie and Andrew Sillitoe of Apax Partners sit on King's board. The games company has paid Apax $266 million in dividends since October, according to a recent Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

There are plenty of investment opportunities in European startups creating new online markets, providing new financial services and performing data analytics, Mr. Chalfen says. "Very large industries are being created or disrupted by the Internet."

Bank sees opportunities in assessing supply chain risk; Management

Knowing where the hazards lie is important, says Jessica Twentyman

As the world watches the unfolding political situation in Ukraine with unease, some company executives will be concerned about the impact the turbulence in the region may have on their own businesses and supply chains.

According to the European Commission, the EU accounts for about a third of Ukraine's external trade, with the country's primary exports to the bloc listed as iron, steel, mining and agricultural products, and machinery.

Exposure to risk in areas where political tensions are likely to ebb and flow can seem hard to judge. But what if concerned bosses could rely on information and analysis to help them gain a deeper understanding of their exposure to supply-chain risk?

That is the puzzle that Royal Bank of Scotland is aiming to solve for corporate customers and a hefty dose of big data analytics is part of the picture.

Alan Grogan, chief analytics officer in the bank's Customer Solutions Group, reckons that RBS is well placed to advise corporate customers in this way.

He says: "We're putting analytics at the heart of all decision making - and our analytic capability, I believe, is market-leading in global terms." Whether the bank's corporate customers will be prepared to put their trust in the bank is debatable. In late February, RBS reported a 8.2bn loss for the 2013 financial year , marking a sixth successive year of losses.

That prompted Ross McEwan, RBS chief executive, to describe RBS as, "the least trusted bank in the least trusted sector in the marketplace".

At the same time, however, Mr McEwan stressed that he was keen to refocus RBS on UK retail and business customers, so new corporate banking services, based on big data, could play a role in rebuilding its relationship with clients.

The bank has invested in its infrastructure in order to assess risk across its business customers' supply chains. A new data warehouse contains a vast wealth of information about its corporate customers, says Mr Grogan.

About 45 per cent of the UK's large corporates bank with RBS, he says, and it is the biggest lender to small and medium-sized enterprises in the country.

RBS branches process some 400 transactions a minute on behalf of corporate customers and more than 7bn worth of electronic payments each business day.

Much of the data generated by these activities end up in the data warehouse, first trialled last year and based on technology from Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard. RBS mixes the internal data with a wide variety of external information.

Mr Grogan prefers not to name its partners, but says that they are data providers such as Experian, Dun & Bradstreet, Bureau van Dijk, Standard & Poor's and Fitch. There are also open government data from sources including the Office of National Statistics and the Bank of England.

By using various analytic techniques, Mr Grogan and his team can explore the likely impact on business customers of price rises and currency exchange rates, for example.

And by linking transactions between companies, they are building a huge map of the interdependencies that exist between companies of all sizes.

"We're using predictive analytics to give corporate customers insight into supply chain risk that they've never had or even considered," Mr Grogan says.

For example, the core currencies used by UK manufacturers in their supply chains can be monitored. How cross-currency interdependencies increase or decrease supply-chain risk can also be examined.

The insights Mr Grogan and his team are able to gain from this kind of analysis, he says, is then passed to the relationship managers who work with corporate customers on a day-to-day basis.

As world economies become increasingly interdependent, supply chain risk really matters to companies, Mr Grogan says, pointing to the impact on businesses all over the world of the 2011 tsunami in Japan, when many large automotive companies experienced a drop in production because they were not able to source the microchips they needed for satellite navigation and other in-car electronic systems.

But it is not all downside, he says. "There are risks to businesses, but there are opportunities, too. With the right level of visibility into the end-to-end supply chain and enough warning of potential problems, companies facing an issue can make arrangements to source from elsewhere.

"For RBS, this is about putting to good use our insight into emerging economic trends in order to make UK businesses more competitive."

Bank of China Profit up 12%

BEIJING Bank of China Ltd. said Wednesday its 2013 net profit rose 12%, marginally higher than market expectations, on the back of higher interest and fee-and-commission income.

Despite slower economic growth and significant production overcapacity in a number of major industries, China's banks have managed to maintain robust albeit slowing profit growth and financial health. Still, bank executives are wary that their earnings could in the future be dragged down as their customers face tougher business conditions.

"The overall risks are controllable," said Bank of China President Chen Siqing, but he added that his bank will keep a close watch on risks from the property sector, local government financing vehicles and industries with overcapacity problems.

"In 2014 we will launch a campaign to protect the quality of our assets," said Mr. Chen without giving details.

The bank's 2013 profits were led by an expansion in net interest margin broadly, the difference between what it charges on loans and what it pays on deposits to 2.24% from 2.15% in 2012.

Still, Vice President Yue Yi warned that moves by the central bank to further liberalize interest rates would put pressure on what the bank can earn from interest.

The bank's net profit for the 12 months ended Dec. 31 was 156.91 billion yuan ($25.7 billion), up from 139.43 billion yuan a year earlier.

The result was higher than the average 151.26 billion yuan net-profit forecast from a poll of 25 analysts by Thomson One Analytics.

Bank of China, the fourth-largest lender in the country by assets, said net interest income rose 10.4% to 283.59 billion yuan and noninterest income from credit cards, wealth-management product sales and international trade-related settlement and clearing rose 13.5% to 123.92 billion yuan.

Nonperforming loans of the bank stood at 73.27 billion yuan as of the end of 2013, up from 65.45 billion yuan a year earlier. The bank's bad loan ratio was 0.96% as of end-2013, up from 0.95% at end-2012.

However, the bank doubled the amount of bad loans that it wrote off to 9.096 billion yuan from 4.209 billion yuan in 2012.

Southern Europe: From Death's Door to Real-Estate Haven; Region Is Benefiting From Belief That Worst of the Crisis Is Over

Investors are venturing to Spain, Italy and even Greece in search of bargains on commercial property, reasoning that the lure of higher returns trumps the risk that Southern Europe will remain mired in sluggish growth.

For much of the extended slowdown that plagued the European Union, many investors focused on offices and high-end residences in cities such as London and Paris, where real-estate markets came through the euro crisis in relatively good shape.

While rents and occupancy levels in Southern Europe remain anemic, the region is benefiting from the widespread belief that the worst of the financial crisis has passed.

"People are just waking up to the fact that Spain didn't fall into the Mediterranean," says Eric Adler, chief executive of Prudential Real Estate Investors, which invested about $1.5 billion in European real estate in 2013 and is hoping to do more this year.

Last year, investors purchased  ¬177.8 billion ($245.3 billion) of commercial property in Europe, up 17% from the prior year and the highest since 2007, according to Real Capital Analytics.

In Southern Europe comprising Spain, Portugal, Italy and Greece transactions picked up speed in the fourth quarter, with deals doubling from a year earlier to  ¬3 billion, according to broker JLL, formerly Jones Lang LaSalle.

Among this year's transactions in the region was the  ¬61 million purchase by a UBS real-estate fund of a shopping center in San Sebastian, Spain with 62 stores and 11 restaurants.

International investors are even looking at Greece, the longest-suffering country in the euro zone, where the economy has shrunk more than a quarter since 2008.

Houston-based Hines is considering investing in the Greek hotel and retail sectors because tourists are "pouring in" while many property owners and their lenders remain financially distressed, says Michael J.G. Topham, chief executive of Europe for Hines, which controls assets valued at approximately $25.2 billion.

"They need us," Mr. Topham says.

The surge in real-estate deal volume in Europe is part of a broader trend resulting from the low interest-rate environment in much of the world. Pension funds and other institutions are increasing allocations to real estate in the hunt for higher returns, something Spain and Italy both offer.

For example, the largest public U.S. pension funds last year increased their allocations to global real estate to 7.4%, according to Wilshire Consulting. Before that, the high-mark for this group was 6.4% in 2008, says the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, which tracks public pension-fund investments.

Opportunistic investors also are scooping up portfolios of distressed property loans that European banks are trying to get off their balance sheets. Commerzbank AG has seen high demand for Project Octopus, its portfolio of Spanish property loans with a face value of  ¬4.4 billion that will be one of the biggest such deals in Europe this year.

Some of the big investors in Europe continue to be U.S. private-equity funds that showed up early, including Blackstone Group LP, Lone Star Funds, Apollo Global Management LLC, Cerberus Capital Management and Kennedy Wilson Holdings. Pacific Investment Management Co., the giant Newport Beach, Calif., asset manager, also has been looking at deals.

Blackstone Group last week closed a  ¬5 billion Europe-only property fund, the largest ever of its kind, which it raised in just six months. Recent Blackstone deals include a purchase of a portfolio of Italian offices and retail centers from AXA Immoselect, an open-ended German investment fund, for about  ¬180 million, according to a person familiar with the deal.

New players also are showing up on the Continent from countries such as South Korea, Malaysia and China. Chinese property developer Dalian Wanda Group, for example, purchased an iconic Madrid skyscraper for  ¬280 million from Spanish lender Santander, according to data from Real Capital Analytics. At the end of last year, sovereign-wealth fund China Investment Corp. acquired Chiswick Park, one of London's largest office developments, from Blackstone for 780 million British pounds.

Other sovereign-wealth funds are turning to European real estate, too. Such funds invested  ¬13.6 billion in European real estate last year, a 31% increase in activity from 2012, Real Capital data show. Globally, allocation to real estate from sovereign-wealth funds increased only 9%.

Until recently, investors in European real estate had little appetite for risk. Most of the deals involved trophy, fully-leased office buildings, shopping centers and other properties in cities like London and Paris.

But demand for those so-called core properties drove up prices to the point that some are now at record values, reducing yields for buyers. For example, an investor buying a core property in London today would wind up with less than a 5% annual yield from the building's income.

By contrast, in markets such as Spain, yields are over 6%. That has set off a rush for property in that country, putting upward pressure on prices, according to real-estate executives in Spain. "It wasn't like the sun slowly going up," said Rupert Lea, head of retail for real-estate broker Cushman & Wakefield Inc. in Spain, describing the increasing interest. "It was like a ricochet."

Some owners are taking advantage of the interest by putting property on the block. The Spanish region of Catalonia, for example, plans to meet with international investors in New York this week to drum up interest in a portfolio of 13 buildings in Barcelona.

The roadshow was in London last week. Even the investor presentation in Barcelona was conducted in English.

"Many investors we are meeting have mandates to invest in Spain," said Isabel Tornabell, a director in Catalonia's real-estate office. "That's something new &they are looking for what to buy, not if."

But as demand increases for property in riskier markets, some experts are warning that investors are moving too quickly given the tepid pace of the economic recovery.

"When the pendulum swings back, it almost always overshoots," said Ric Lewis, chief executive at Tristan Capital Partners, a private-equity firm that recently raised  ¬950 million for an opportunistic fund aimed at buying distressed European assets. Demand for the vehicle was  ¬500 million oversubscribed, he said.

Mr. Lewis said competition has got hotter in the past three months, and he often gets outbid for individual assets by as much as 30%. "I think we've making a pretty good bid on the fundamentals. And we're wrong by 30%? These aren't complicated assets," he says.

Corrections & Amplifications A fund raised by Tristan Capital Partners was  ¬500 million oversubscribed. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said the fund was  ¬5 million oversubscribed.

Europe Turns to Crowdfunding, But Still Obstacles to Surmount

By Christopher Lawton and Tom Fairless

When Javier Latorre wanted to invest outside Spain, he turned to a crowdfunding platform based in Sweden. A month later, Mr. Latorre had invested 4,000 Swedish krona ($625) in four shares of Eggs Inc., a new chain of health-oriented fast-food restaurants.

"I am looking for investments in other countries to split my risk, and these guys know what they are doing," the 36-year old Spanish entrepreneur said of his first investment in a startup outside his home country.

Mr. Latorre's relatively modest outlay represents a new avenue of financing for small and midsize European companies that bypasses the region's banking sector and offers a tantalizing glimpse of a single European market for investment that would integrate the economies of the European Union.

For crowdfunding platforms to grow further and become pan-European, though, they will need to overcome numerous obstacles, including a patchwork of national rules, differing payment systems and the risk of fraud, according to a report on the sector to be published on Thursday by the European Commission, the EU's executive arm.

The report, seen by The Wall Street Journal, stops short of proposing common EU rules. Instead, the commission says it will work with national regulators to overcome legal inconsistencies and help develop an EU "quality label" to build trust with users.

Crowdfunding allows companies and entrepreneurs to pitch their capital needs online in the hopes of attracting investors collectively. Depending on the platform, the capital can come as a donation or loan, have a reward tied to it, or be exchanged for equity in the company.

The commission estimates that crowdfunding platforms raised 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) across Europe last year, up from 735 million euros in 2012 and 445 million euros in 2011. That compares with 7 billion euros provided by venture capitalists in 2012 and 660 million euros provided by business angels in 2010.

Europe accounts for less than a quarter of the global market for crowdfunding platforms that provide financial returns for their backers, compared with 51% for the U.S. and 28% for China, according to the International Organization of Securities Commissions, an association of securities regulators.

Now, though, a host of European equity-based crowdfunding companies are starting a new phase of expansion -- going beyond national borders and connecting companies in need of financing with eager investors in other European states.

The platform that facilitated Mr. Latorre's investment, FundedByMe Crowdfunding Sweden AB, has gradually expanded into Germany, Spain and Italy over the past year.

Tame, a Berlin startup that acts as a search engine and performs analytics for Twitter, sold 25% worth of equity in the business, in the form of profit-participating loans, for 250,000 euros in one 22-day round on Companisto, a Berlin-based equity crowdfunding platform. The offering drew investors from Austria, Switzerland, Denmark and the U.K.

That success encouraged Companisto to launch an English-language version of its platform earlier this month, open to submissions from entrepreneurs anywhere in Europe.

"In the digital age, when it comes to investing, we see national boundaries as artificial. There is absolutely no reason why an Estonian investor shouldn't be able to invest in a Spanish business," says Jeff Lynn, chief executive and co-founder of Seedrs, a U.K.-based equity crowdfunding platform.

In November, Seedrs opened its platform to both entrepreneurs and investors from Europe. For now, it operates only in British pounds, but it plans to introduce euros and Swiss francs soon, Mr. Lynn says.

Crowdcube, another U.K.-based platform, plans to expand into Poland, Spain and Italy this year through joint ventures, after facilitating nearly GBP 20 million ($33 million) since it was formed in 2011.

These developments are significant in light of the challenges facing Europe's banks. More than the U.S., the euro zone relies heavily on bank lending to finance new spending, investment and hiring. But banks have sharply pulled back on lending, and particularly across borders, after the financial crisis and an 18-month recession in the euro zone saddled their balance sheets with bad loans. That has left small to medium-size businesses, especially in stressed southern European countries, without financing.

"It's easier to win the lottery than to get investment from a bank right now," says Angel Maria Herrera, co-founder of Samastah, a Madrid-based startup focused on the health market.

In a three-month campaign on FundedByMe that closed earlier this month, Samastah sold 6.3% of its equity for 76,800 euros, of which around 10% came from countries outside Spain, including Italy and Switzerland. But expanding across Europe's borders poses challenges.

"It's more difficult for a Finnish company to attract British investors because it has less recognition in Britain," said David Blair, head of financial regulation with law firm Osborne Clarke in London.

Europe's hodgepodge of national regulations and standards is also an obstacle to cross-border expansion.

In Britain, the region's biggest crowdfunding market, companies are required to publish a prospectus only if they want to raise over 5 million euros on a crowdfunding platform over a 12-month period. In Germany, that threshold is just 100,000 euros.

France, Germany and Italy regulate peer-to-peer lending platforms as banks, while Britain will only start regulating them at all beginning next month.

In a report last month, the International Organization of Securities Commissions warned that the absence of harmonized rules raised uncertainty around whose law would apply if a cross-border platform became insolvent. It argued that "basic minimum standards" were needed for crowdfunding to develop successfully across borders.

Corporate News: Hortonworks Funding Raises $100 Million

Hortonworks, whose Hadoop software has been a big driver of the current interest in Big Data, raised $100 million at a valuation of more than $1 billion as it prepares to go public in 2015.

The funding round, which was co-led by investment giant BlackRock Inc. and hedge fund Passport Capital, is yet another demonstration of investors' intense interest in pre-IPO companies and their belief that Big Data is going to produce some big returns. Hortonworks competes directly with Cloudera Inc., which raised $160 million in new funding this month for its own flavor of Hadoop -- an open source project developed at Yahoo Inc. from a paper published by Google. that can store and process enormous amounts of data. Both companies now have similar amounts of funding -- about $225 million for Hortonworks and $300 million for Cloudera -- and similar valuations, although neither would say how much more than $1 billion their valuations are.

Hortonworks Chief Executive Rob Bearden said he expects both companies to become public. Hortonworks expects to finish 2014 with about $100 million in revenue. The company has several members of the original Hadoop team from Yahoo.

"Our job is to make Apache Hadoop a truly enterprise-viable data platform, and . . . without those people, you can't pull this off," he said. Choosing public market investors for a pre-IPO round -- a strategy that Cloudera also pursued since its round was led by T. Rowe Price Group Inc. -- is part of becoming a big public company, Mr. Bearden said.

"[BlackRock and Passport] help us think through so accurately what and how to drive our strategy forward as a public market company. . . . They are also extraordinarily focused on where IT infrastructure is evolving and how that evolution will unpack," he said.

CFTC and Treasury share swaps resources

The main US derivatives regulator is set to share resources with the US Treasury as it struggles to get a firmer oversight on the mushrooming volumes of swaps data, and spot market participants' risk exposures in global derivatives markets.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission has been working on taking staff expertise from the Treasury's Office of Financial Research, Commissioner Scott O'Malia confirmed on Tuesday. The two bodies have been working on a memorandum of understanding, he said.

The OFR was set up in the wake of the financial crisis by Congress to use Big Data and other cutting-edge computing techniques to monitor financial flows.

"OFR has long recognised that granular swap data are essential to assess exposures, interconnectedness and concentration in the market. Their assistance and work in this area will be a tremendous help," he told a conference on data standards in London.

"Together, by leveraging our resources, we will be able to start doing some of the heavy lifting of our big data problem," he said.

The joint effort by the regulator and the Treasury highlights how regulators are becoming concerned that efforts to make global markets more transparent are being undermined by the scale and complexity of the task.

Regulators have struggled to implement a political mandate to have swaps trades in the vast, opaque $700tn over-the-counter derivatives market reported to data repositories. They are being operated by private market infrastructure companies such as IntercontinentalExchange, CME Group, the London Stock Exchange Group and the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation.

Efforts to use the new data warehouses as the window for analysing potential systemic risk have been undermined by local privacy laws and differing and highly complex local data standards. That has resulted in millions of trades being reported daily.

Alongside the regulatory push, technological advances allow traders to make and cancel thousands of orders per second on futures markets, throwing up further clouds of data.

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.

The difficulty was underlined by the CFTC's inability to find the JPMorgan "London Whale" trade. In response, the US regulator last week commenced a review of how swaps data are reported by market participants.

Mr O'Malia, also head of the CFTC's Technology Advisory Committee, said he had called on counterparts in Brussels to focus on recognising each other's swaps data warehouses and develop a means to share trade information. He has asked that Europe and the US should harmonise the form and format of data being reported.

Sharing information between the two economic blocs - which account for the vast majority of the global swap market - has been undermined by EU unease over Washington intruding on to its patch to collect highly sensitive banking and markets data. The issue has taken on new significance in the wake of US spying revelations.

"I urge international regulators to quickly and - dare I say - swiftly come together to sign an agreement that will rely on substituted compliance and allow for the standardisation and sharing of swaps data," Mr O'Malia said.

He also called for the CFTC to automate market surveillance, rather than rely on "stale" transaction data.

"In a world where data are king and traders increasingly rely on cutting-edge technologies and automated strategies, regulators must also become early adopters. The technology of yesterday will not be able to keep up with the market realities of today. Call it Data Darwinism," he said.

Unleashing Innovation: Big Data  (A Special Report) --- Real-Time Marketing in a Real-Time World: How advertisers are using social media to promote their brands at a moment's notice

The usual formula goes something like this: Marketers and advertisers spend huge budgets to craft their campaigns, then refine them over weeks or months until they find just the message that will reach their target audience.

Now some companies are trying to squeeze all of that work into mere minutes.

These advertisers are watching Twitter and other social networks to see what topics are getting the most attention, and putting together short blog posts, tweets and videos that match those themes -- in hopes that the online audience will become more aware of the brand and see it as relevant to their interests and needs. Then, if one topic isn't getting attention anymore, the companies can drop it without much fuss, and switch gears quickly to follow the next hot discussion.

Consider what Bank of America Corp. did during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

Experts from the bank's legal, social-media, marketing, advertising and other departments scanned 60-inch screens at brand agency Digitas Inc. late into the night to see what was trending on Twitter.

Their mission: to promote the bank's brand among people interested in economic issues by publishing real-time content related to the conference. During a session on women, for example, with GBP davoswomen trending on Twitter, the bank's team tweeted a link to a Merrill Lynch paper about the growing economic influence of women.

"The data comes into the room from many sources, and you have to use that data like a modern-day orchestra leader, blending the inputs in real time in a combination that is as much an art as a science," says Louis Paskalis, Bank of America senior vice president.

The bank's attempt to use the conference to promote its brand seems to have paid off -- 97% of people who clicked on BofA's content on social media during the economic conference were engaging with the bank for the first time, Mr. Paskalis says.

To figure out the best ways to manage real-time campaigns -- and what pitfalls to avoid along the way -- The Wall Street Journal recently spoke with a number of marketing and advertising experts. Here's some of their best advice.

-- Experiment with new types of media.

General Electric Co. started sharing content on Vine -- a service that allows users to post short looping videos -- the day Twitter introduced it, even though it was an unproven strategy, says GE's head of global brand marketing, Linda Boff.

Ms. Boff's team constantly monitored how the videos were being received on Twitter. If the videos didn't perform well, the group was prepared to pull the plug. "That's the beauty of this type of media -- it's fairly easy to produce, and fairly easy to monitor," Ms. Boff says. And if you do shut down the project, "you've wasted a very small amount of time."

An early video -- a clip that showed how color moves through liquid, using a saucer of milk, food coloring, dish soap and a Q-Tip -- paid off. It has been liked by more than 227,000 viewers and GE turned it into a weeklong campaign promoting experiments tagged with the hashtag GBP 6SecondScience.

The payoff, say Ms. Boff, was spreading awareness of the brand. "Being accessible, humanizing our social channels and joining these conversations is a way for people on Twitter to become more familiar and more excited about the company," she says.

-- Follow conversations, then join them. Companies should look for people who are tweeting about the company's core strengths and see what's on their minds.

Ms. Boff's team, for instance, searches on Twitter for hashtags and conversations about science. When the companies have a sense of the kind of content that these communities care about, they can craft similar content and tweet it, perhaps using the same hashtags these communities are using.

"We try to behave the way you would if you were meeting somebody in a social gathering -- you don't accost them, instead you try to find a commonality of interest," Ms. Boff says.

-- Practice restraint. Saying no is a discipline -- maybe the most important thing in real-time marketing, says BofA's Mr. Paskalis.

Rather than publish content on a huge range of topics, focus on where your brand has built expertise and can add the most value to a conversation. GE, for example, sticks to messages about science and technology on social media -- rather than try to sell its products or take shots at competitors.

-- Get legal permission to use material. There are often situations when it's helpful to post content owned by other people or organizations. Marketers should have a structure in place to get permission quickly, so that they can post their messages before they get stale.

During the World Economic Forum in Davos, for example, Bank of America created advertising spots for news sites that updated in real time. Among other things, the ads showed tweets that the bank didn't create but were related to the conference. So, Mr. Paskalis's team hired content-marketing startup Chute Corp. to reach out to the Twitter users and quickly get their approval.

-- Be ready to turn off scheduled posts. Social-media managers tend to release automated messages at specific times throughout the day, which usually is an efficient way to ensure the brand is never silent on social media.

This can backfire, however, during disasters like hurricanes or floods, when readers are searching for information on the extent of damage or number of casualties. "Customers want brands to be relevant, not opportunistic," says Paul Berry, CEO of RebelMouse, a platform that helps users combine their social-media posts, articles, videos and other online content into one home page.

-- Watch for sudden flurries of activity on social media. "When 12 people you respect suddenly all follow one Twitter account, don't ignore it," Mr. Berry says. Typically, it's a good sign that this Twitter account represents a big player -- someone you should at least be aware of.

To know when this is happening, Mr. Berry recommends following the Twitter account @MagicRecs, which sends direct-message alerts recommending Twitter accounts based on the activity of those the user is already following.

-- Move on when content gets stale. When content performs well, it's a good strategy to double down and publish more on the topic. But sooner or later, it's time to move on. For instance, when a tweet that was getting 20 retweets a minute drops down to 10, it's time to find a new topic. "Don't try to score another touchdown when the play is over," Mr. Berry says.

-- Never ignore negative feedback. If you're losing followers on Twitter, try to figure out why, Mr. Berry says. Every day, his social-media team publishes a report on how the company is doing on all its social-media networks, with a focus on unfollows, new follows and engagement like retweets and favorites. They discuss via email which metrics are up or down from the previous day and why. "Through these threads, we fine-tune the strategy we were working on," he says.

M*Modal Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection; Medical-Services Company's Filling Follows a Decline in Sales and Mounting Debt

M*Modal Inc., a medical-services company owned by J.P. Morgan Chase Co.'s private-equity arm, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Thursday, following a decline in sales and mounting debt.

The filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York comes at the end of a grace period after the company skipped a February interest payment to bondholders.

Just hours after the filing, Judge Robert E. Gerber approved M*Modal's so-called first-day motions, which ease the company's transition into bankruptcy protection, allowing it to pay employees and use its remaining assets to continue existing operations. A final hearing on the motions was scheduled for April 16.

"We intend to use the court process to significantly strengthen M*Modal's balance sheet and improve the company's financial flexibility by reducing our debt burden and establishing a capital structure that supports our investment in the future," said Duncan James, the company's chief executive officer, in a statement.

M*Modal's 14 separate entities, which collectively listed liabilities of $852 million and assets of about $626 million, according to court papers, expect to continue normal operations throughout the Chapter 11 process.

The company said revenue from its continued operations in addition to its cash on hand should be enough to finance its bankruptcy proceedings.

One Equity Partners, which J.P. Morgan has said it is spinning off as an independent firm, acquired M*Modal about 18 months ago in a $1.1 billion leveraged buyout. One Equity contributed approximately $447 million in addition to $20 million to pay down part of M*Modal's debt.

M*Modal owes about $500 million to a group of lenders led by Royal Bank of Canada, stemming from a $445 million term loan and $75 million revolving facility made in 2012, David Woodworth, M*Modal's chief financial officer, said in court papers. The company also owes more than $250 million in unsecured notes, for which US Bank is the trustee.

Some creditors, including Brigade Capital Management, Blackstone Group's GSO Capital Partners and Fidelity Investments, are negotiating with the company to swap their debt for equity in the reorganized company.

"We intend to emerge with a strong financial footing so we can continue growing our market share and delivering innovative solutions to our customers," said Mr. James.

M*Modal's main business is speech recognition technology and data analytics that enable physicians and clinicians to include the context of their conversations with patients in electronic health records. But that business has come under pressure from now widely available technologies that turn speech into text on the spot and adoption of electronic health records, according to court papers.

In 2013, 80% of the company's revenue came from transcription services using speech recognition technology. M*Modal generated approximately $411 million in revenue and $85.6 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2013, a decrease from about $453 million in revenue and $96.9 in earnings in 2012.

At the time of its bankruptcy filing, M*Modal, based in Franklin, Tenn., employed more than 9,900 workers in six countries. The company's customer base includes more than 3,800 hospitals, clinics, and physician practices, according to Mr. Woodworth.

Dechert LLP is serving as M*Modal's legal counsel, Lazard Frres Co. as its investment banker, and Alvarez & Marsal as its financial adviser.

Corrections & Amplifications A previous version incorrectly stated that US Bank is owed $265 million. US Bank is named as the trustee on a bond indenture issued by M*Modal Inc. and is not a creditor in the case.

J.P. Morgan Trades In This Cycle

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

J.P. Morgan Chase is dismounting the commodities cycle. The bank said Wednesday it would sell most of its commodities business for $3.5 billion to Swiss trader Mercuria Energy Group.

For investors, it is tough to gauge the short-term impact, given J.P. Morgan discloses little about the business being sold. In its latest annual filing, J.P. Morgan did say market-making and other activities involving physical commodities generated just over $2 billion in revenue last year. That, though, includes derivatives and precious-metal storage businesses it isn't selling and may not reflect the entirety of its commodities activities.

In the longer term, there may be benefits. The commodities revenue didn't come cheap -- and it was set to get more expensive. In January, finance chief Marianne Lake described the business as "highly capital intensive." So, between rising bank-capital requirements and "Volcker rule" trading restrictions, commodities trading is increasingly costly for a big bank while offering fewer profit opportunities.

And the regulatory environment isn't getting any friendlier. The Federal Reserve has said it is considering new rules that might limit banks' exposure to commodities trading.

Meanwhile, the bull market in commodities that began in 1998, known as the "supercycle" has stalled -- and perhaps died. New supply coupled with slowing demand growth likely means the golden era is past. Commodities revenue for the 10 largest investment banks was just $4.5 billion last year, estimates analytics company Coalition. That is far off the 2008 peak of $14.1 billion.

So even if postcrisis regulations really did push J.P. Morgan to sell its commodities business, they actually may have done the bank a favor.

Most serious number crunchers - except hardcore Bloomberg machine devotees - will be familiar with FactSet Research Systems' financial analytics tools. But what of FactSet's own numbers? FactSet has grown handsomely over the long term. Total shareholder return tops 300 per cent over the past decade. But in recent years, the stock has lagged behind its index as the company and its rivals (Bloomberg, as well as Thomson Reuters and S&P Capital IQ) have faced cost-cutting by their clients (buyside investors and sellside brokers). Is this era of austerity ending?

In yesterday's earnings report for the three months ended February 28, there were positive signs. FactSet's shares jumped 10 per cent. Net client growth, which should be a leading indicator, was the highest it has been since 2006 and buyside users grew at a level not seen since 2004. That created some hope that growth in assets under management at buyside firms is translating into new users, a transition that has been slow since the financial crisis. Annual subscription value, a widely watched indicator of revenue for the next 12 months, was up 6 per cent organically versus the prior year. That is still below the double-digit growth of, say, two years ago, but better than the growth rate last quarter. Buyside clients represent 83 per cent of ASV.

At $115, FactSet shares trade at 22 times forward earnings. Earnings per share are expected to grow in the high single digits this year and low double digits next year, according to consensus estimates. Even if the buyside is getting more confident and, even more optimistically, the shrinking ranks of sellside analysts could be close to bottoming out, competition remains a perennial threat for FactSet. The company has to deliver stronger growth than Wall Street expects to justify the high multiple.

The Property Report
Developer Makes a Bet On Prairie-Home Boom

Related Cos., the developer best known for luxury condominiums and big commercial projects, is turning its sights to low-slung apartments on the North Dakota and Texas prairie, where a shortage of housing tied to the energy boom is allowing landlords to command some of the highest rents in the country.

The company, run by Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross, last week paid around $300 million for 20 apartment complexes with 3,000 units in Midland and Odessa, Texas, according to people familiar with the transaction. It also is in advanced talks for a deal on an existing project in North Dakota's Bakken region, and plans to raise up to $300 million for a fund focused on shale-rich communities from desert areas near the Mexican border to the Appalachian basin in the East, the people said.

Mr. Ross is following a small band of investors, including private-equity giant KKR & Co. and real-estate firm Westport Capital Partners, into the residential and commercial markets of new and resurgent energy towns a world away from the cities and suburbs where they usually build or buy. They are drawn by rents that would seem more reasonable in Midtown Manhattan and Silicon Valley, the result of almost nonexistent unemployment and low supply.

A two-bedroom apartment in Williston, N.D., for example, can go for $3,000 a month, or more. In nearby Watford City, North Dakota Housing LLC rents a two-bedroom trailer for $2,350 a month. The same rent could fetch a spacious luxury apartment in cities like Las Vegas or Phoenix, or a studio in new towers in New York.

"We think it's a unique opportunity," says Justin Metz, managing principal of Related's fund-management group.

The boomtowns in Texas have been around since oil-drilling rushes of previous decades, but those in North Dakota began sprouting about five years ago as energy companies started to pull oil and natural gas from shale-rock formations through a process known as fracking. Their populations have skyrocketed, overwhelming the existing housing stock. Many workers continue to be housed in barrack-like "man-camps."

While riding a boom is risky, investors point out that they are getting compensated with high yields. For example, Related is expecting the initial annual income from the apartment portfolio it purchased last week will be more than 10% of the purchase price, according to people familiar with the matter.

By comparison, investors on average are getting a yield of about 6% on rental-apartment acquisitions and that figure can dip below 4% in major cities like New York, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics. "Typically, pricing gets ahead of real-estate fundamentals," says Mr. Metz of Related, referring to high employment and rapid economic growth in the oil and gas-rich regions. "Here you have strong real estate fundamentals and pricing hasn't caught up with it yet."

Still, some analysts are warning that job growth eventually will level off and begin to fall after the initial labor-intensive effort of drilling wells is complete.

Employment in the rapidly growing petroleum sector of the North Dakota Williston Basin, for instance, is projected to rise from 14,153 in 2009 to more than 53,000 in 2020, before falling to 40,000 by 2030, according to North Dakota State University's Department of Agribusiness and Applied Economics.

Meanwhile, developers already are adding to supply, causing Moody's Investors Service last month to issue a report warning that rents in North Dakota boomtowns are "well above sustainable" levels. "It really intrinsically doesn't make sense for a town with no physical barriers to entry to command the same rents as New York or San Francisco," says Tad Philipp, director of commercial real-estate research at Moody's Investors Service.

Not all bets have been winners. For example, Flathead Glacier Group LLC, a Bozeman, Mont., real-estate company, defaulted on a $24 million loan backed by 134 rental apartments in Williston and Watford City just four months after it was sold into a mortgage bond, according to Trepp LLC. Last week, Trepp reported the loan went to 90 days delinquent from 60 days.

Inquiries to Flathead were directed to a firm run by loan sponsor John Dunlap, who didn't respond. But a spokeswoman for Halliburton Co. confirmed that it terminated its lease for 40 units owned by Flathead in August when Halliburton completed construction of housing for its workers in Williston.

Still, many investors and planners believe it could be years more before supply catches up with demand, pushing rents down.

For some of the early real-estate investors in the latest boom, cash is pouring in as rents rise. Average rents in Williston have risen from about $1,000 a month in 2009 to nearly $2,500 at the end of 2012, the latest available data, according to the Williston Regional Economic Development Corp.

KKR was one of the first big-name investors to show up, announcing a 164-acre master-planned community in Williston in 2012. The private-equity firm expects to complete this summer eight rental apartment buildings on the site. The apartments have been coming to market gradually and KKR officials say they are leasing 20 to 25 a week.

KKR and its partners are spending about $150 million to build the apartments, and to prepare vacant lots that they are selling separately to home builders.

For example, Related is expecting the initial annual income from the apartment portfolio it purchased last week will be more than 10% of the purchase price, according to people familiar with the matter.

By comparison, investors on average are getting a yield of about 6% on rental-apartment acquisitions and that figure can dip below 4% in major cities like New York, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics. "Typically, pricing gets ahead of real-estate fundamentals," says Mr. Metz of Related, referring to high employment and rapid economic growth in the oil and gas-rich regions. "Here you have strong real estate fundamentals and pricing hasn't caught up with it yet."

Still, some analysts are warning that job growth eventually will level off and begin to fall after the initial labor-intensive effort of drilling wells is complete.

Employment in the rapidly growing petroleum sector of the North Dakota Williston Basin, for instance, is projected to rise from 14,153 in 2009 to more than 53,000 in 2020, before falling to 40,000 by 2030, according to North Dakota State University's Department of Agribusiness and Applied Economics.

Meanwhile, developers already are adding to supply, causing Moody's Investors Service last month to issue a report warning that rents in North Dakota boomtowns are "well above sustainable" levels. "It really intrinsically doesn't make sense for a town with no physical barriers to entry to command the same rents as New York or San Francisco," says Tad Philipp, director of commercial real-estate research at Moody's Investors Service.

Not all bets have been winners. For example, Flathead Glacier Group LLC, a Bozeman, Mont., real-estate company, defaulted on a $24 million loan backed by 134 rental apartments in Williston and Watford City just four months after it was sold into a mortgage bond, according to Trepp LLC. Last week, Trepp reported the loan went to 90 days delinquent from 60 days.

Inquiries to Flathead were directed to a firm run by loan sponsor John Dunlap, who didn't respond. But a spokeswoman for Halliburton Co. confirmed that it terminated its lease for 40 units owned by Flathead in August when Halliburton completed construction of housing for its workers in Williston.

Still, many investors and planners believe it could be years more before supply catches up with demand, pushing rents down.

For some of the early real-estate investors in the latest boom, cash is pouring in as rents rise. Average rents in Williston have risen from about $1,000 a month in 2009 to nearly $2,500 at the end of 2012, the latest available data, according to the Williston Regional Economic Development Corp.

KKR was one of the first big-name investors to show up, announcing a 164-acre master-planned community in Williston in 2012. The private-equity firm expects to complete this summer eight rental apartment buildings on the site. The apartments have been coming to market gradually and KKR officials say they are leasing 20 to 25 a week.

KKR and its partners are spending about $150 million to build the apartments, and to prepare vacant lots that they are selling separately to home builders.

McGraw Hill Says Legal Risk of S&P Litigation Manageable; General Counsel Makes Claim Based on Company's Ability to Fend Off Similar Cases

Standard & Poor's Ratings Services' parent company said its legal risk, which includes a $5 billion fraud lawsuit filed by the federal government, is "clearly manageable," based on how the company has been able to fend off similar cases.

McGraw Hill Financial Inc., which owns S&P, said a California federal court is still deciding whether the federal government will have to hand over documents detailing investigations of financial institutions and other credit-rating companies, said McGraw's general counsel Ken Vittor on Tuesday. He was speaking at the company's investor day in New York.

The Justice Department filed a $5 billion fraud lawsuit against S&P last year, with the government alleging the credit-rating firm ignored its own standards when rating mortgage bonds that tumbled during the financial crisis, costing investors billions of dollars.

A trial date hasn't been set, but the judge has signaled it could be by September of 2015, Mr. Vittor said. S&P has long maintained the government's lawsuit was politically motivated due to S&P's downgrade of U.S. debt in 2011.

Mr. Vittor said previous court decisions provide McGraw a strong legal position in pending cases, including the U.S. lawsuit.

Since 2007, 36 cases have been dismissed and all 13 appeals were turned down by the courts. "The courts are very clear that ratings are not a fact," but rather opinions about the future, Mr. Vittor said.

McGraw Hill also said earlier in the day it will sell its construction-data unit that is concentrated in the U.S. market. The company said it could also find a business partner for the operation if it isn't sold.

The construction division, which sells commercial real-estate information to developers and manufacturers, generates about $170 million in annual revenue and employs about 650 people.

McGraw Hill, which is trying to reposition itself as a global analytics firm, has stepped away from some of its traditional lines of business. Since 2011, McGraw Hill has sold Aviation Week, a trade publication, its education division and a broadcasting unit.

Artemis ultra bear reverses EM view; Fund focus

William Littlewood has been buying equities and will soon add debt, says Matthew Jeynes

Artemis's William Littlewood has reversed his ultra-bearish view of emerging markets for the first time since he launched his flagship 998m Strategic Assets fund in 2009.

Mr Littlewood believes emerging markets are now in a better position than their developed counterparts. This contrasts starkly with the view of Jupiter's investment chief, John Chatfeild-Roberts, who earlier this month said 2014 would be a year in which focusing on developed-market equities would win out as emerging markets suffer from the US Federal Reserve reducing its monetary support.

Mr Chatfeild-Roberts spent much of 2013 revising his range of Merlin fund-of-funds portfolios to reduce focus on emerging markets, which corrected sharply amid the US Fed move.

But Mr Littlewood has been adding to emerging market equities and is about to start buying emerging market bonds , according to his latest investor update.

Emerging equities now make up 5 per cent of the portfolio, which the manager says is the highest level since the fund's launch and is up from zero a year ago.

The position is split mainly between Russian oil and gas companies and Samsung Electronics, the South Korean group, although Mr Littlewood is also investing in two emerging market investment trusts that are trading on wide discounts.

He says: "The structural issues faced by the developed world are far more challenging than those in the developing world.

"So, where we can, we are gently shifting the portfolio towards emerging markets."

He said emerging market companies were trading at significant discounts to developed market companies, the biggest discount in either five years or 10 years, depending on the valuation metric used.

He acknowledges the potential risks facing the countries, saying some of them could be "on the verge of a nasty recession", but that it would be a cyclical slowdown from which they would rebound quickly.

Mr Littlewood says he is close to investing in emerging market debt within the Strategic Assets fund as well.

He notes that a long-dated government bond from Brazil is currently yielding roughly 13 per cent. He describes this as good value, based on its real yield - the yield of the bond minus the economy's 5.9 per cent inflation rate - of 7 per cent.

Mr Littlewood contrasts Brazil with Japan , where he says the current standard bond yields of closer to 0.6 per cent "look ludicrously low, given that inflation is 1.6 per cent and there are serious question marks over the country's long-term solvency".

The manager has a long-held short position on Japanese bonds. The major position is equivalent to 64.5 per cent of the net asset value of the portfolio.

As well as the short bond position, Mr Littlewood has a 21.2 per cent short position against the Japanese yen - to benefit if the currency weakens.

These positions have proved to be a drag on his performance in recent years. The fund ranks in the third quartile of the IMA's Flexible Investment sector in terms of its performance since launch, as well as its performance in the past one and three years, according to FE Analytics, the data provider.

Looking Past a Credit Score; Betting a better deal on a loan can require additional legwork.

Finding out your credit score is getting easier. Getting a better deal on a loan still requires some legwork.

Credit scores are the three-digit figures that lenders consult to help determine whether to approve consumers for credit cards, mortgages and other products, as well as what interest rate to charge. The higher the score, the more favorable the terms are likely to be for the borrower.

Consumers who know their credit scores can use the information to their advantage. If the score is low, for example, they can hold off on applying for a loan until the score has improved. If the score is high, they can try to negotiate a better interest rate by pitting one lender's offer against another's.

Consumers and regulators have pushed for greater transparency surrounding credit scores, which lenders have in many cases treated as secret. Last month, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau called on credit-card companies to provide consumers with the scores, a move the federal agency said could encourage borrowers to improve their credit.

Recently, more credit-card issuers have begun sharing information about credit scores. This month, Capital One Financial will begin making credit scores available to most of its credit-card customers when they access account information online.

In February, Discover Financial Services started making credit scores available to all its credit-card customers both on monthly statements and online. Another credit-card issuer, Barclaycard US, a division of London-based Barclays, has been making credit scores available to most of its customers online and plans to expand the service to all its cardholders by year-end.

Lenders are also providing information online for their customers about factors that can affect those credit scores, such as high outstanding loan balances or late payments.

But the benefits for consumers may be limited. The scores the lenders are sharing are often only one of many factors they use in making lending and interest-rate decisions. Moreover, there are many different credit scores available, and lenders use various scores depending in part on what type of loan the applicant is seeking.

Capital One, for example, is providing consumers a score created by TransUnion, a major credit bureau. But the bank says it doesn't use this score when approving new applicants or making changes to the interest rates customers pay or other card terms.

Discover and Barclays are sharing a score from FICO, an analytics software company based in San Jose, Calif. Cardholders can consult the score to determine whether their request to increase their line of credit, for example, could be approved.

But while Discover and Barclays use FICO scores to make lending decisions, they and most other card-issuers either weigh additional factors or use a FICO score as one data point in creating their own private score.

Furthermore, there are more than 50 different types of FICO scores available to lenders, says John Ulzheimer, a consumer-credit expert at CreditSesame.com, a credit-management site, and a former manager at FICO. Different lenders may consult different scores, depending on the circumstances.

Not knowing the exact score a lender uses can lead to confusion for borrowers who may be expecting a better interest rate. Even a one-point difference between two credit scores can result in a lower or higher interest rate, says Odysseas Papadimitriou, chief executive at WalletHub.com, a credit-card comparison site.

Consumers should instead pay attention to their credit reports, which are used to create credit scores. Most consumers have a credit report at each of the three main credit bureaus, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.

The reports include their loans, balances and payment history, including missed payments. A clean credit history often suggests a high credit score and a high likelihood of getting approved, Mr. Ulzheimer says.

Consumers should check their credit reports to look for errors that could negatively affect their score. The credit reports of one in four consumers contained an error that could change a credit score, according to findings released last year by the Federal Trade Commission.

Credit bureaus typically charge consumers to see their scores and reports. But there are more ways to get this information at no cost.

Based on federal law, consumers can check their credit report at each of the three major credit bureaus free once every 12 months, through a website called AnnualCreditReport.com.

At least seven states, including Colorado, Georgia and New Jersey, allow consumers additional opportunities to check their reports without charge.

Several websites, including CreditKarma.com, CreditSesame.com and Quizzle.com, offer free credit scores and free credit reports from one of the three main bureaus. The firms often make money from lenders, which pay referral fees if consumers apply for loans through the websites.

This past week, CreditKarma.com announced an $85 million investment from Google Capital, an investment fund backed by Google, and three other firms.

The website is the first consumer-credit company the Google fund has invested in.

Hellman & Friedman to Acquire Renaissance Learning for $1.1 Billion; The Deal Comes Less Than A Month After Google Capital Invested $40 Million In Renaissance

Hellman & Friedman has purchased educational analytics company Renaissance Learning Inc. from European private-equity firm Permira for $1.1 billion.

The deal comes less than a month after a $40 million infusion by Google Inc.'s latest investment vehicle valued Renaissance at $1 billion, or more than double the amount Permira paid three years ago.

The investment vehicle, Google Capital, is expected to remain as an investor in Renaissance Learning, according to a press release Thursday.

Renaissance Capital Chief Executive Jack Lynch indicated that Google Capital invested last month for largely strategic reasons, and he expects that relationship to continue despite the majority ownership change.

"The purpose of the investment was for us to be able to collaborate with Google and Google Play in the K-12 space," Mr. Lynch said. "We wanted advocacy within Google for us, and they wanted an investment in K-12 that was an assessment and cloud-based analytics company."

Since launching in 1986, Wisconsin-based Renaissance has grown into a digital assessment platform offering quizzes and other services for K-12 students in one-third of U.S. schools and 60 countries around the world. The cloud-based testing software delivers analytics to educators so they can identify and fill knowledge gaps.

The deal is expected to close in the second quarter.

Hellman & Friedman doesn't list any other educational content companies on its website. The firm owns shares of Ellucian Company LP, which offers human resources, payroll, student enrollments analytics and other business services to colleges and universities.

London-based Permira bought Renaissance for $455 million in 2011. A source familiar with that deal said the firm would be making a fourfold return on the sale to Hellman & Friedman, after having put $190 million down in its original purchase.

Google Capital, formed last year, last week announced a $50 million investment in online real estate marketplace Auction.com, and on Wednesday it said it had led an $85 million funding round for consumer-finance and tech company Credit Karma Inc. It also has backed Lending Club Corp. and SurveyMonkey.com LLC.

A separate Google investment arm, Google Ventures, typically makes earlier-stage deals.

Charterhouse Wins Auction for Skillsoft; Deal Marks Another Private-Equity Investment in the Education-Related Sector

Charterhouse Capital Partners LLP has beat out rival private-equity firms in an auction for education-software provider Skillsoft with a bid valued at more than $2 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.

London-based Charterhouse will fund the acquisition using leverage of around 7.5 times Skillsoft's annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, which is about $180 million, according to one of the people.

Advent International Corp., Bain Capital LLC and Berkshire Partners LLC took Skillsoft private in 2010 in a $1.1 billion deal that underscored the reduced ambitions of private-equity firms still hurting from the financial crisis.

In 2012, Skillsoft bought a smaller rival, MindLeaders, in a deal that lifted its debt-to-Ebitda ratio to above six times, according to Moody's Investors Service.

According to Skillsoft's website, the company has provided digital educational content such as videos and e-books to more than 19 million people through its more than 6,000 customers. Its customers include PGA of America and the University of North Carolina Wilmington.

Private-equity firms long have enjoyed investing in education-related businesses. Textbook publisher Cengage Learning Inc. earlier Thursday received court approval for its bankruptcy-exit plan, which will see lenders including Apax Partners LLP, Oaktree Capital Management and KKR & Co. take a majority stake in the restructured company.

Also Thursday, Hellman & Friedman LLC purchased educational-analytics company Renaissance Learning Inc. from European private-equity firm Permira for $1.1 billion.

Rush to fund smart solutions

A new generation of start-ups is promising smart solutions to the growing threat of cyber crime, and venture capitalists are eager to fund them. Just last month three start-ups - Ionic Security, Shape Security and Cylance - were among companies raising money from VCs, writes Hannah Kuchler .

 " Ionic Security raised a $25.5m fundraising round led by Google Ventures and Jafco Ventures last month, including money from Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers. Ionic is rethinking data protection by encrypting each piece of data, putting an envelope around it that follows it wherever it goes. As cyber criminals target the suppliers or contractors of major companies as a way into their computer systems, Ionic aims to give the control over the data back to the original owner, wherever the data are.

 " Shape Security is also backed by Google's venture capital arm and Mr Schlein's firm, as well as executives from Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Dropbox who have contributed as individuals. It raised another $40m round led by Norwest Venture Partners and Sierra Ventures in February. The company claims to be the first to create technology that allows the code behind web pages to constantly change, evading hackers by never looking the same twice. This "real-time polymorphism" aims to break botnets by making cyber criminals unable to automate attacks.

 " Cylance closed a $20m round with funding from Blackstone, Khosla Ventures and Fairhaven Capital last month. The company claims to be the first maths-based threat detection and prevention group that uses artificial intelligence to discover threats, deploying its "infinity platform" to protect devices even if it has never seen the attack before. Blackstone's chief information security officer said it was "like having an expert security professional in your computer at every decision making point".

'Candy' studio eyes valuation of $7.6bn

London-based King plans New York listing

Games developer to be valued at $7.6bn

King, the London-based games developer behind the app Candy Crush Saga , plans to float in New York with a market valuation of almost $7.6bn - four times the size of the company behind the hit game Grand Theft Auto and within reach of Electronic Arts' $9.2bn.

The pricing is at the top of the range that King announced for its initial public offering , in which the company plans to raise as much as $530m, and points to its confidence in being able to replicate Candy Crush 's success.

King, founded in 2003, said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it planned to sell 22.2m shares for between $21 and $24 a share in its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange .

Slightly less than a third of the shares being sold come from existing shareholders, which include Apax Partners and Index Ventures.

Chief executive and co-founder Riccardo Zacconi's stake could be worth as much as $720m. King has had much growth in recent years and boasts about 324m monthly users.

Most users play its games on their mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets. More than three-quarters of King's gross revenues are from a single game: Candy Crush Saga . It invites players to form rows of three jellied sweets. People can play free but have an option to pay to speed up progress and to pass difficult levels.

Ed Barton, gaming expert at Strategy Analytics, said that the sector was scattered with companies that experienced great success with a single game but were unable to repeat the success, the most notable example being Zynga, whose share price tumbled after its Nasdaq IPO in 2011.

"There's no doubt that King has some serious management smarts," he said. "But how many more Candy Crushes can they make?"

There are already signs that growth is slowing. Candy Crush saw its daily active users rise from 93m to 97m between December and February, but the average number of times the games were played a day inched down from 1.085bn to 1.065bn. The banks underwriting the IPO, which include JPMorgan, Credit Suisse and Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch, have an overallotment option to purchase an additional 3,330,000 ordinary shares - about 1 per cent of the enlarged equity - from King's existing investors.

Next Games Raises $6 Million from Investors; Finnish Mobile-Game Developer to Launch Title Based on TV Series 'The Walking Dead'

HELSINKI Next Games, a Finnish mobile-game developer with ties to Hollywood, has collected a round of funding to launch a pair of new titles, including a game based on AMC Networks Inc.'s hit television series "The Walking Dead."

Next Games said Tuesday it raised $6 million from a group of investors from three continents.

Jari Ovaskainen, a Switzerland-based Finnish investor and early backer of games developer Supercell Oy, was part of a group of investors that included China's IDG Capital Partners.

The funding round marks the first time a Chinese investor has put money into a Finnish mobile-game developer.

AMC, a U.S. television company that aired the show "Breaking Bad," is also funding the venture.

Next Games, which was founded 10 months ago, is looking to replicate the success of Supercell, which created the free-to-download "Hay Day" and "Clash of Clans" games that are packed with upgrades that have to be purchased. Japanese telecommunications company SoftBank Corp. paid $1.5 billion for a 51% stake in Supercell last year.

Next Games's fortunes got a boost last week when it announced a licensing deal with AMC intended for a game related to "The Walking Dead," a post-apocalyptic drama based on a comic book.

The company has spent much of its initial capital developing technical specifications for "free to play" mobile games that can be readily improved and expanded over time so that users are compelled to keep playing and given the incentive to buy upgrades. "For example, when a new location appears in a 'Walking Dead' episode, we could quickly feature it in our game," Next Games Chief Executive Teemu Huuhtanen said in an interview.

The financial backing from AMC "signals that [the network] views our collaboration as a long-term strategic partnership," said Mr. Huuhtanen, who led mergers and acquisitions for Rovio Entertainment Ltd., maker of the Angry Birds franchise, before founding Next Games. Joakim Achrn, one of Next Games's founders, is a games-industry veteran who previously worked as analytics director at Supercell.

Mr. Huuhtanen said "The Walking Dead" game is likely to be launched by the spring of next year.

In addition to "The Walking Dead," Next Games is working on a game code-named "West." Mr. Achrn said it would be an action and strategy game, but declined to disclose further details.

The success of Supercell, Rovio and a number of smaller studios has boosted the Finnish videogame industry, which generated an estimated $1.2 billion in combined revenue in 2013 and is attracting money from marquee international venture-capital firms.

Other investors in Next Games include U.S. venture-capital firms Lowercase Capital LLC and York Ventures LLC, a newcomer that is backed by brothers Alec, Tom and Sam Gores.

International interest could be a positive sign for Finland's startup scene. "Typically, Finnish app vendors have in the past received early funding from Finland, Sweden and the U.K.," said Tero Kuittinen, a mobile-application analyst with Alekstra who is based in New York.

Mr. Kuittinen, a Next Games adviser, said Asian investors' growing interest in Finnish game developers has been stirred in part by the developers' recent strong performance in Japan, which has a reputation as being a tough market to crack for foreign companies.

King Digital IPO Plans Boosting Hope for London Tech Scene; "Candy Crush" Developer Seeks Valuation up to $7.6 Billion

LONDON With King Digital Entertainment PLC's plans to go public, this financial center can now lay claim to a major player in today's global tech frenzy.

The Anglo-Swedish developer of "Candy Crush Saga" gave a price range for its planned initial public offering Wednesday seeking to raise just over $500 million and a valuation of as much as $7.6 billion on the New York Stock Exchange.

King's provenance isn't a clear-cut matter. It was founded in Sweden, where much of its games-development work still takes place. But its Italian chief executive and much of its administration is based in London.

That presence is boosting hope among entrepreneurs and investors here that London's nascent tech scene is starting to garner some global street cred. Meanwhile, a wave of local tech companies are planning their own listings at home. Just-Eat.co.uk, an online takeaway food service, and online retailer the Hut Group are both planning near-term IPOs on the London Stock Exchange, according to people familiar with the matter.

Seventeen U.K. tech companies floated on the LSE last year, raising $735 million, up from just three companies the year before, according to Dealogic.

Equity financing for tech venture-backed companies in London hit $755 million last year, beating out Berlin, another European capital that is actively recruiting tech talent, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. But that still lags behind the $9.7 billion invested in Silicon Valley and the $2.4 billion invested in New York-based companies.

Despite London's place at the center of the financial world, tech companies have struggled to get attention from established investors here. Entrepreneurs and tech executives blame a cultural gap between the City, as London's financial district is known, and its startup scene.

"The City is generally risk averse and doesn't understand tech and tech startups," says Steve Karmeinsky, a veteran tech entrepreneur and programmer here. But the global splash King has made with its IPO is now emboldening many in the tech sector here.

"The more stories like [King], the better impact and influence it has on the institutional investor market," said Ami Shpiro, founder of Innovation Warehouse, a local accelerator, nestled within a poultry wholesale market at the edge of "Tech City," a once-grungy stretch of East London that has recently lured dozens of startups and tech-centric companies.

Two years ago, Google Inc. opened Campus London, a seven-storey development in which Google provides free workspace for tech entrepreneurs, along with a basement cafeteria and ping-pong tables.

The tech frenzy has seeped into London's booming property market helping jack up rents in some tech-popular districts, and luring some of the city's real estate players. Canary Wharf Group PLC, one of London's biggest commercial-property developers started up and manages Level 39, the 39th floor of a tower overlooking the River Thames at Canary Wharf, one of London's banking districts. Level 39 rents out workspace to finance- and retail-focused tech companies, among other tenants.

With the King IPO, London has established itself as a new European center of excellence for gaming-technology companies, alongside longtime Nordic powers like Sweden and Finland. Mind Candy Ltd., a character and online gaming company best known for "Moshi Monster," is another London-based giant in the field. Founder Michael Acton Smith is a stalwart of the London tech scene.

London is already a center for financial technology, or fintech technology geared toward the back offices of financial services companies. And London's position as a global advertising capital has also fostered an "adtech" scene. Adbrain, for instance, uses artificial intelligence and probability calculations to match people across devices, helping advertisers figure out what type of consumer is using a certain device, and bid on relevant ad space, said Chief Executive Gareth Davies.

"It's a mathematical challenge of tying a lot of data points together in a privacy-compliant way to help marketers understand who their consumers are," he said. The company Tuesday announced $7.5 million funding from Octopus Investments and Notion Capital.

Home Loans Find New Hands --- Mortgage Servicing Shifts to Nonbank Firms, Fueling Concern Among Regulators [CORRECTED]

Corrections & Amplifications In talking last year about the troubles facing some corners of the mortgage-servicing industry, James Dimon, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s chief executive, said, "If I had a choice, I would never be into default servicing again." A March 10, 2014, Money & Investing article about the mortgage-servicing business incorrectly quoted Mr. Dimon as saying "bulk servicing."

Washington's effort to push banks out of the mortgage-servicing business is propelling the handling of customers' loans into companies such as hedge funds and nonbank financial firms.

The shift is fueling concern among federal and state regulators about the level of oversight and capital requirements in the industries now servicing a growing share of these loans.

Banks such as Morgan Stanley, Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Ally Financial Inc., have been selling mortgage-servicing rights to nonbank companies, including Ocwen Financial Corp., and Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc., which have doubled their servicing portfolios in the past year.

About $1.03 trillion of mortgage-servicing rights were sold in 2013, with the vast majority going to nonbank firms, said Guy Cecala, publisher and chief executive officer of industry newsletter Inside Mortgage Finance. Among the 30 largest mortgage servicers, nonbank firms held a 17% market share at the end of 2013, up from 9% at the end of 2012 and 6% at the end of 2011.

The business can be lucrative. Servicers typically make money by collecting a fee from the mortgage's owner -- usually a bank or investor -- for handling billing and payment collection. Ten of the largest U.S. mortgage lenders took in $8.23 billion in servicing income in 2013, according to an analysis by Inside Mortgage Finance.

But it has become a liability for lenders, which face new restrictions as Washington tries to siphon risk out of the banking system. Regulators, concerned about banks' exposure to mortgage-related assets and their alleged ham-handedness in handling crisis-era loans of troubled borrowers, have introduced new rules dictating how mortgage servicers interact with borrowers and raising capital costs for servicing loans.

"If I had a choice, I would never be into bulk servicing again," J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive James Dimon said at the company's investor day last month. The bank is working to reduce the size of its servicing business for defaulted mortgages, officials said at the event.

As banks scale back, other firms are stepping in: Structured Portfolio Management, LLC, a hedge fund, recently told investors it plans to get into the mortgage-servicing business by running its own company, said people familiar with the decision. Another hedge fund, Premium Point Investments LP, has started a separate arm to buy whole loans, bundle and sell them and retain the servicing rights even after they are sold.

But regulators have pointed out that new entrants aren't subject to the same oversight and capital rules aimed at helping them weather market stress.

The Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of top regulators including the Treasury secretary and Federal Reserve chairman, noted the shift in its 2013 annual report, saying "many large depository institutions are reducing their mortgage servicing activity and removing potential risk from their balance sheets by selling servicing rights to non-bank servicers, which are not subject to the same capital requirements as banks."

In an interview, Benjamin Lawsky, superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services, called the rapid growth of nonbank mortgage servicers "eyebrow raising" given the role the companies play in interacting with homeowners.

Mr. Lawsky attributed the growth of nonbank servicers partly to Washington's implementation of international banking standards that have made it more expensive for banks to hold certain mortgage assets.

"The Basel rules are certainly welcome, but they appear to be having this unintended consequence on some of the banks desiring to shed these" assets, Mr. Lawsky said. "I don't think that's such a bad thing. We're not saying that nonbank servicers can't do this. Our concern as a regulator is capacity."

Some firms already have run into trouble over their handling of customers' mortgages. In December, Ocwen reached a $2.1 billion settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and state regulators over allegations the company charged unauthorized fees, failed to properly credit borrowers' accounts and other issues. Ocwen didn't admit or deny the allegations.

The New York Department of Financial Services last month halted Ocwen's deal to acquire the rights to service $39 billion of mortgages from Wells Fargo & Co., the nation's largest home-loan servicer, citing concerns about Ocwen's ability to handle more loans given complaints the agency has received from consumers.

The Fed and other bank regulators intended for new capital and other rules to push some servicing business out of banks, which they worried weren't able to adequately assess their exposure to mortgage assets.

The CFPB, a consumer regulator, has established rules for all servicers -- including those owned by nonbank companies -- that prevent servicers from initiating foreclosure in the first 120 days a borrower is delinquent. But nonbank firms generally aren't subject to the types of federal capital requirements and other restrictions that regulators place on banks.

"This is the first clear case of rules restructuring a banking business into a shadow one," said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics Inc.

Structured Portfolio Management recently told investors it was close to announcing plans to run its own mortgage-banking operating business. In a letter to investors, founder Don Brownstein alluded to "limitations on bank activities, both regulatory and otherwise, [which] are providing a set of opportunities for us."

"This whole business was obliterated by the government, and there's a lot of money in it," said Rael Gorelick, partner at Gorelick Brothers Capital LLC, Charlotte, N.C., which invests in hedge funds and other assets with exposure to U.S. housing markets. Mr. Gorelick said the hedge funds investing in and operating mortgage servicers are incentivized to keep owners in their homes, as the business is most profitable when borrowers continue to make payments and avoid default.

"I can't imagine the government would be excited to have a hedge fund backer, but that said, the banks are being forced out. Someone has to do this," he said.

Ocwen and Nationstar have touted their track records of helping troubled homeowners over the years. Ocwen said it has completed more modifications under the Home Affordable Modification Program, or HAMP, than any other servicer. Executive Chairman William Erbey said last month during a conference call with investors that the company holds more capital against its servicing rights than banks.

Nationstar, majority owned by private-equity firm Fortress Investment Group LLC, has helped 371,000 customers since 2010 through refinancing and other assistance, CEO Jay Bray said in a conference call last month. A spokesman said the company is "highly regulated," noting it is subject to the CFPB, state regulators and other agencies.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
A hedge against irrational humans; COMMENT

I am writing this column at my dining room table. It is early in the morning and still dark. The birds have started to sing and the cat has been fed. I am ready to write. This is the ideal environment for me to write my column. So it should be good. Or that is the theory.

Like me, more active fund managers are analysing the environment that helps them produce their best work. In their case, their best trades. Last week a new company launched software to help fund managers assess the perfect circumstances for the perfect trade. Man Group , the world's biggest listed hedge fund, and Artemis, the UK-based asset management group, have started using the software, developed by Clare Flynn Levy, a fund manager herself for Morgan Grenfell in the 1990s.

The software enables a fund manager to key in to their computer a variety of information, from the time a trade was made to the mood they were in when they made it. This allows them to track the process surrounding every trade, helping them find a pattern underpinning the best decisions on stock selection.

Simon Savage, a portfolio manager at GLG Partners, a division of Man, who is using the software, says factors such as how many cups of coffee you have drunk and whether you have had a good night's sleep can influence decisions, but these are small effects. The technology should be used mainly to help take instinctive human judgments, which are often biased by recent observation, out of the decision-making process.

A fund manager who has just lost a lot of money is more likely to be risk averse and cautious in making their next trades. In contrast, one who has just made a lot of money is more likely to be gung-ho and take more chances. Mr Savage refers to Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman's 2011 book Thinking, Fast and Slow. The fast system is intuitive and effort free, while the slow system is based on conscious, deductive reasoning and hard work.

Decisions on asset management, Mr Savage says, should be based on the slow system, but the reality is that investment professionals often take decisions that feel instinctively right . The first step, therefore, for a fund manager is to eliminate this fast-thinking mentality to distinguish luck from skill.

A person needs to look objectively at decisions and not attribute all successful trades to skill and all unsuccessful ones to misfortune. Martin Wheatley, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, the UK regulator, says: "One of the most significant challenges . . . is to recognise that we operate within a very human environment; a fallible world."

Using tools such as the software developed by Essentia Analytics, Ms Flynn Levy's company, fund managers can try to take the human out of their behaviour to operate more rationally. In other words, by using systemic analysis, they can hedge against irrational human behaviour.

Of course, human beings cannot entirely wipe out their fallible, human natures, but technology might enable fund managers to stick to patterns that produce their best trades, whether this is how quickly they like to build up a position in a stock or how rigorous they analyse a company's balance sheet.

The success of passive alternatives, which replicate the market, has put active managers under greater pressure to deliver bigger returns. Every active manager, therefore, should consider using technology to improve performance, even if it only gives them a slight extra edge.

As for my performance, the cat has started to distract me by bashing his head against the open lid of my laptop. I have to let him out or I will lose my focus. Fund managers may have to eradicate the human element for the perfect trades. It seems I need to eradicate the cat for the perfect column. My apologies, if I have fallen short.

Corporate Economists Are Hot Again; The Shift Comes as Firms Cope With a Glut of Data; Recession 'Laid Bare' Forecasting Mistakes

CLEVELAND Flooded with data, Parker Hannifin Corp. hired a young economist in 2008 to figure out what the information meant to the industrial conglomerate's far-flung operations.

What Ryan Reed told executives in one of his first presentations didn't go over well. Looking at capacity utilization rates the percentage of available production capacity that is actually in use Mr. Reed told executives that sales in the company's automation business would be substantially lower in October. "The guys said: 'That can't be right. October is normally a really good month for us.' "

But Mr. Reed's forecast was indeed correct. October wasn't a good month for automation, or for any of the Cleveland company's business units. The U.S. economy was on the verge of what would become the worst economic convulsion since the Great Depression. "We've lurched from crisis to crisis since then," said Mr. Reed, now 32 years old.

With more data available than ever before and markets increasingly unpredictable, U.S. companies from manufacturers to banks and pharmaceutical companies are expanding their corporate economist staffs. The number of private-sector economists surged 57% to 8,680 in 2012 from 5,510 in 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 2012, Wells Fargo & Co. had one economist in its corporate economics department. Now, it has six.

"A lot of companies have programmers who are able to process big data," said Tom Beers, executive director of the National Association for Business Economics in Washington, a professional organization with about 2,400 members. "But to find a causality between two things and draw a conclusion really takes somebody with an economics background."

Many companies had corporate economists on staff in the volatile 1970s and '80s, but dropped them when the U.S. economy was steady and strong. Information from government agencies, such as industrial output from the Federal Reserve, was plentiful, along with research from private consultants, including Macroeconomic Advisers LLC in St. Louis and IHS Global Insight of Englewood, Colo.

"The reaction in the corporate world was: 'I can get my average GDP forecasts from anybody. Why do I need an economist in my shop?' " said Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, chief economist for Ford Motor Co.

The key to the revival of in-house economists, companies and economists say, is the need to digest huge amounts of data from production volumes in overseas markets to laptop usage in urban areas to determine opportunities and risks for companies' business units, not just in the U.S. but around the world.

Paul Thomas, chief economist for chip maker Intel Corp., said he and his staff look at how and where consumers are using personal computers, laptops and hand-held devices to pinpoint what geographic markets are underserved and which ones are saturated. "It's something we're learning to do that's going to be useful," he said.

The glut of available data is forcing economists to serve as gatekeepers to ensure that disparate units within companies are using the same data sets and information inputs in their forecasting.

Richard DeKaser, a vice president and corporate economist at Wells Fargo, leads a team of eight people, including six economists, who standardize the models and data used to measure risk in different business units, such as mortgage lending and credit cards.

Previously, one unit might base unemployment figures on payroll data, while another would use household surveys. Doing so undermined the accuracy of tests to measure risks for losses and contributed to mistakes in business planning.

"The great recession laid bare a lot of fundamental mistakes that an economist can be useful in preventing," said Mr. DeKaser, who was previously chief economist for National City Bank.

Some corporate economists are also taking higher public profiles to communicate their companies' messages and forecasts. Mark Finley, general manager of global energy markets and U.S. economics for energy company BP PLC, spends about 30% of his time on the road talking with customers, business groups, trade associations and reporters to build consensus for its outlooks on energy demand and pricing. "The economists are supposed to be out there presenting their views," he said.

James Meil, chief economist at diversified manufacturer Eaton Corp., and his staff of four, made 78 formal presentations last year, including one to the Association for Hose and Accessories Distribution. Distributors and suppliers, especially smaller ones, often rely on economists from their bigger customers to help decide whether they should add production capacity.

"There's not readily available market data or trends data available for the hose markets," said Joseph Thompson, executive vice president of the association, which represents manufacturers and distributors of industrial hoses, fittings and fluid-transferring equipment.

Veteran economists like Mr. Meil, who has been with Eaton for 29 years, are consulted on big acquisitions. When Eaton bought Cooper Industries PLC in 2012 for about $11.8 billion, he provided market research for key business segments and forecasts for the combined company's end markets.

Air Products and Chemicals Inc. uses its economist to devise hedges in a more volatile global economic climate. The Pennsylvania-based supplier of industrial gases enters into 10- to 20-year contracts with drug companies, steelmakers and refineries and needs price-escalator clauses to reflect higher production costs, such as energy.

"We set up formulas to where we're just trying to capture the inflationary pressure on the underlying contract," said economist Joseph Cardinale, who recently left Air Products for an economist's job at Illinois-based pharmaceutical maker Abbott Laboratories.

Like all forecasters, corporate economists can miss the mark. In 2012 many company economists expected about 6.5% growth in manufacturing output in Asia. But it ended up being 3.5% due to a sluggish economy in China. "Forecasts by definition are going to be wrong," said Mr. Cardinale.

Retired economist Frank Schott, 87 years old, said new veins of data don't guarantee accuracy in forecasts. "The data are just as recalcitrant as ever to give you answers and the multiplicity of it invites further confusion," he said. "Everybody, including corporate bosses, thinks they're their own best economist."

Before Parker hired Mr. Reed, group presidents provided forecasts. "They weren't very accurate," said Jeff Cullman, president of Parker's hydraulic business. He said Mr. Reed has been able to forecast when hydraulic demand was about to fall, allowing the company to get a head start on scaling back production. "The market turns relatively quickly, but it takes us about three months to get on the brakes,' he said.

Forecasting can be tougher in developing countries where market demand can be difficult to quantify and data is spotty. Mr. Reed recently constructed a model for Parker's new president of Latin America to indicate where the company should focus sales efforts. "His gut was telling him we're doing pretty well in Brazil; maybe we should look more at Argentina," he said.

By parceling out Parker's sales in specific industrial markets in Argentina and Brazil and comparing them with the two countries' total output in those markets, Mr. Reed demonstrated that Parker's sales potential in Brazil was far greater than in Argentina and to remain focused there. "Hopefully we avoided putting a lot of resources into Argentina where there's just not much to capture," he said.

Law Journal: Class Action: Help to Investor?

By Julie Steinberg

(Copyright (c) 2014, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

The Supreme Court this week will consider whether a hotly contested legal theory underpinning most class-action securities suits makes sense.

Meanwhile, the debate over whether such suits benefit investors is equally fraught.

Many investors see class-action suits as important checks on corporate misbehavior. But companies' legal budgets can easily overwhelm individual plaintiffs, and over-stretched regulators can't pursue every allegation of misinformation. When it comes down to dollars and cents, some studies show the suits aren't very good at compensating shareholder losses.

Generally, aggrieved investors get only pennies on the dollar. The average settlement amounts to 1% to 5% of shareholder losses, according to the Stanford Securities Litigation Analytics database, which tracks securities litigation.

The Supreme Court will hear oral argument Wednesday on whether to preserve a legal doctrine known as fraud-on-the-market, which relieves investors from having to prove they relied upon company misinformation. The number of securities class actions has grown considerably in the 25 years the theory has been accepted. The case could give the court a platform for cutting back drastically on such lawsuits, sparking renewed discussions about whether the suits are actually useful.

Critics say that when plaintiffs win or settle cases accusing firms of inflating share prices through false optimism or fraud, those investors are paid off at the expense of others, and lawyers collect much of the bounty.

Typically, the company -- and sometimes its insurance company -- is tasked with paying out the settlement to the aggrieved investors, effectively forcing current shareholders to make other shareholders whole.

Such lawsuits cost investors about $39 billion a year and recover just $5 billion, according to a recent report from Navigant Consulting Inc. on behalf of the U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, an affiliate of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce that advocates for business interests.

The consulting firm looked at the stock price of various companies during the lawsuit period, lawyers' fees and how the settlement funds were parceled out to investors, among other things.

Some investors aren't happy about the money that lawyers reap from the settlements. "We need to find a way to have the lawyers' fees capped in such a way that the system can't be milked," said Leonard Masiowski, an investor in Hudson, Ohio.

Mr. Masiowski is waiting to receive his part of the more than $2.4 billion Bank of America Corp. agreed to pay out over allegations the Charlotte, N.C., bank misled investors about the health of Merrill Lynch, which it acquired during the financial crisis. Investors "get pennies on the dollar," said Mr. Masiowski, 78 years old. The lawyers "end up with dollars on the dollar."

Between 2011 and 2013, median plaintiff attorneys' fees accounted for 30% of settlements below $5 million, according to a report from NERA Economic Consulting. For settlements over $1 billion, fees were nearly 10%.

In the Bank of America litigation, plaintiff lawyers' fees and expenses came to $177 million as of Dec. 31, 2013, NERA said.

The Securities and Exchange Commission was able to extract only $150 million from the bank in its own lawsuit over similar issues. Max Berger, one of the lawyers who led the $2.4 billion recovery in the shareholder suit, said he sees his lawsuits as a necessary complement to the work the SEC does.

At the time, Bank of America agreed not to deny the SEC's allegations. It acknowledged the agency's statement of facts in the case but said that was not "an admission as to the truth of any such statements," according to a court document. The SEC and a spokesman for the bank declined to comment.

Supporters of the current system say it enables them to challenge companies' misstatements.

The city of Providence, R.I., recently settled with Aropostale Inc. over claims the retailer made positive statements about its performance that masked deeper problems.

"We're happy we recovered funds for the city," said Jeffrey Padwa, the solicitor who brings claims on behalf of the city's pension fund. "Investors aren't going to get a dollar for dollar, but we got something back."

"We have consistently maintained that this lawsuit was meritless and there was no wrongdoing," an Aeropostale spokes- woman said. "A settlement, funded entirely by the company's insurance, ended the distraction of ongoing litigation."

Mr. Padwa said that without class-action certification, it would have been "unaffordable" to bring a claim.

Investors said the lawsuits foster corporate-governance changes at the affected companies and deter others.

Catherine LaMarr, general counsel for the Office of the Connecticut State Treasurer, said the state often participates in such suits. Her office manages the state's pension and trust funds and wants to enforce a level playing field for investors. Between 2001 and June 2013, her office recovered over $43 million in securities lawsuits, she said.

"I like asset recovery wherever we can get it," she added. "If we're going to collect more than the postage, we're going to file the claim form."

Region's recovery fails to convince equity manager, writes Philip Scott

Premier Asset Management's global equity manager Jake Robbins has pared back his European exposure and remains unconvinced by the continent's recovery .

The manager of the Premier Global Alpha Growth fund has reduced his European holdings from around 20 per cent to 15 per cent of the portfolio.

"I worry that Europe will disappoint. I feel there is too much weight being placed on its recovery," Mr Robbins says.

While the eurozone economy expanded by 0.3 per cent in the final three months of 2013, up from 0.1 per cent growth the previous quarter, Mr Robbins highlighted December's weak industrial production figures that fell back 0.7 per cent, lower than the consensus estimate of a 0.3 per cent drop.

He inherited the fund in November 2011 when thematic investing guru Mike Jennings, formerly chief investment officer at Premier, quit the company.

At the time the fund was focused on macroeconomic factors in making stockpicking decisions, but Mr Robbins instituted a stronger focus on company fundamental factors. He prefers to use macro factors only to identify areas of potential opportunity.

Under the new combined process, the manager currently considers emerging markets, especially China , to be very attractive in spite of recent turmoil.

He says: "The Chinese market is the cheapest it has ever been and while growth may be slowing, there is still a wealth of great companies housed there."

He highlights China Lesso, the largest water-pipe manufacturer in the country and one of his top-10 plays.

"The theme of growing urbanisation in China means the government needs to bring more water to its cities. If you persevere with that kind of business, you can make money in the long term," the manager says.

Mr Robbins is also backing Truly International, which manufactures and sells liquid crystal display products to China's domestic smartphone market, where it derives 80 per cent of its revenues.

Elsewhere the manager has backed Indian conglomerate Tata, which is the country's largest carmaker. The parent company of Jaguar Land Rover - which it snapped up from Ford in 2008 - is showing " phenomenal growth ", he says.

While he has no holdings in Latin America, almost a third of Mr Robbins' assets are spread across emerging markets and Asia, although his largest weighting is still to the US.

He says: "We will always have a decent weighting to the US as there are a lot of great cash-generative companies out there."

Mr Robbins will mark his third anniversary as manager of the fund this November and has just seen his assets under management surge considerably from 18m to 75m. This follows the fund's merger with the Premier Global Strategic Growth fund, which he used to co-manage with Mr Jennings before his departure.

In the past 12 months to February 14 the Global Alpha Growth fund has returned 5 per cent, underperforming the IMA Global sector average of 8 per cent for the period, according to FE Analytics. In three years it has matched its peer group's 17 per cent gain.

US revelations put heat on business

Privacy The NSA leaks and new EU rules will push data protection up the agenda, says Stephen Pritchard

Keeping personal data private is an issue that continues to vex corporations and governments alike.

In the past month alone, retailers Target in the US and UK-based Tesco have suffered data breaches, while Barclays, the UK-based bank, revealed that details of thousands of its investor customers were stolen and sold on .

Meanwhile Edward Snowden's revelations about data collection by the US National Security Agency and other security bodies continue to cast a shadow over the whole question of privacy online.

But then privacy - at least when it comes to the sharing of personal data online - is not a static concept. Attitudes to personal privacy and to data sharing vary widely around the world.

In the US and the UK, citizens are considered to be relatively relaxed about data sharing, although they are perhaps less so post-Snowden.

Germans tend to take a much stricter view on what government and businesses can do with personal data, a fact reflected both in Germany's strict data protection and its employment law.

France, for its part, has a strong legal defence of personal privacy. But there, as elsewhere, the legal framework is coming under pressure from the much more rapid evolution of privacy online.

"Attitudes have changed," says Ronald Koorn, a partner and data privacy expert at KPMG, based in the Netherlands.

"Initially, the NSA incident was primarily a media event, but that discussion is now reaching multinational companies. They realise that privacy requires increased attention.

"It was not previously among their top 10 concerns. In the US, there has been more strict compliance, but in Europe it has been more relaxed - or more lax. That has changed because of the NSA, but also what is happening in Brussels."

As Mr Koorn points out, the EU planned to update its data protection framework well before Mr Snowden's revelations put the matter on the front pages. The existing EU data protection directive - a set of legal principles that are used as the basis of national laws - is due to be replaced by a more binding regulation that will apply across the EU.

The timescale for implementing the new laws has slipped several times; late 2014, or even early 2015, now seems the earliest for a final draft of the new law. When it comes, the regulation will bring far greater consistency across Europe on data privacy and data protection.

But it will impose some strict new standards, in areas such as the disclosure of data breaches, as well as far greater penalties for organisations that transgress. One particularly controversial proposal will give data protection authorities the ability to fine companies up to 5 per cent of their worldwide turnover if they suffer a breach.

Although business leaders might not welcome such moves, experts say it is a necessary response to today's very different climate around personal data.

"We are dealing with a world that has changed so much since the early 1990s, before we even get on to issues such as the cloud or social media," says Vinod Bange, a partner at law firm Taylor Wessing.

"All [those changes] have taken place since the current regime came into force. The current laws, around data processors and data controllers, have not worked. They may have been relevant to the computer bureaux of the 1990s, but no longer."

And, Mr Bange adds, it is right for lawmakers and businesses alike to debate whether the current legal and regulatory framework is effective. "Do we have the balance right? That depends on changing attitudes," he says. "There are rights and obligations around data, but also only to collect data if there are lawful grounds."

But what constitute those lawful grounds is by no means fixed. Individuals have become much more open to sharing some personal information, through social media, but by no means all information.

There are questions, too, of legitimacy and proportion when it comes to collecting data. The Snowden revelations aside, most citizens will accept a greater level of data gathering and even covert data surveillance by law enforcement or security agencies than by local government and health providers. These in turn will have more latitude than private companies.

Some protection specialists see that awareness as a positive development, even if it may bring short-term inconvenience to companies.

"The political climate has resulted in a situation where people have become more aware that data are collected, not just by government but also by business," suggests Harvey Lewis, analytics research director at professional services firm Deloitte. "The concerns are around increasing transparency, and making sure customers are aware of the data that are held on them."

But if opinions about data sharing and data collection are far from static, so is the way those data are being used by governments and companies, and how they should be protected.

The trend for organisations to use more and more sophisticated analysis of huge amounts of data - so called "big data" - is also changing the way they look at information.

From a privacy point of view, being able to combine vast data sets from different sources in close to real time raises some serious issues. Anonymous or innocuous data sets can be combined to become both sensitive and identifiable.

Javvad Malik, a security researcher at analysts The 451 Group, says: "A challenge for legislation is that it is very, very difficult to quantify and contain, or [to judge] when legitimate use of data becomes malicious. It is like chemistry: some elements are stable, but put together they become explosive." Regulators, he says, have to balance ensuring privacy with the need to avoid controls that prevent the legitimate use of data by governments or companies.

Then there is a further challenge: whether the current generation of data protection tools are adequate to protect growing stores of valuable data, against an increasingly hostile cyberspace environment.

"Mobile and the cloud have turned the idea of a perimeter around data on its head," says John Mancini, president and chief executive of AIIM, the information management trade body. "A sound perimeter is no longer enough . . . You have to look at information governance in a holistic way. You cannot just take a 'Maginot Line' approach, as information is scattered across the organisation."

Instead, Mr Mancini says organisations need to be looking at the "big picture risk": reputational and financial damage, as well as the regulatory consequences of a data breach.

This could cause companies to be more cautious about the data they collect, and more open about the consent they seek for collecting it, he says. There could be a shift from legalistic terms and conditions to plain language, but also more consideration about data disposal. Data degrade over time, and the more data an organisation holds, the greater the risk of damage if there is a breach.

Organisations, though, may not be doing enough to protect their data, despite a succession of privacy-related headlines.

"Companies are not doing enough to prevent breaches. Security only gets attention after a breach," says Seth Berman, managing director at risk consultants Stroz Friedberg. "Companies should start by looking at where their data are and how they are protecting them. Do they need so much information, and is there a policy regarding data destruction?"

This point is echoed by John Skipper, a privacy expert at PA Consulting. "We have seen a marked increase in interest in privacy recently, partially triggered by the large amounts of publicity, but also because the EU regulations are on the drawing board," he says. And this will mean a change in management attitudes to data privacy.

"It was rarely a board level responsibility, but more often the responsibility of the chief information officer or the head of IT security," he says. "But it [data privacy] is now recognised as an important part of the relationship with customers. So it is more likely to lie with the chief operating officer, or a business director."

 Big data  bring risks and benefits to insurance customers

Who benefits from big data? As a rising number of companies employ "data mining" to excavate the vast trails of shopping habits and Google searches we leave behind us online, how is that likely to affect the consumer?

The advantages for the company are manifest and widely known: a recent McKinsey Institute report noted that "a retailer using big data to the full could increase its operating margin by more than 60 per cent".

But a rather more controversial example of its proposed use is that of insurance companies desire to create profiles of their prospective policy holders.

This would be particularly welcome in the life insurance sector, where manual methods of underwriting and risk calculation can cost hundreds of pounds to undertake and can drag on for weeks. This is, says a spokesperson for Liverpool Victoria, a British insurer, because they involve "researching medical and family history, whether any of their relatives had suffered with particular illnesses", as well as conducting urine and blood tests.

But could it mean that premiums for individuals may rise on the basis of their browsing history?

On one level, big data could enable insurers to incorporate public information such as social media profiles or work with government data to get to know their customers better, says Mark van Rijmenam, founder of BigData-Startups, an advisory website. "Instead of creating six [generic customer profiles] that cater for millions of customers, they can make one [for each individual] through 360-degree customer profiling," he says.

There can be gains for both parties, adds Richard Sadler, head of retail protection proposition development at Zurich UK Life. Individuals with a healthy lifestyle can be given premium discounts on the basis of data on whether they take part in sports or go to the gym.

This knowledge, adds Colin Forrest, an insurance analyst partner at Deloitte, would enable insurers to eliminate the sometimes "unnecessary and time-consuming" screening processes for low-risk applicants, as well as offering them "significant gains in the pricing of risk".

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.

<>Mr Forrest believes such practices are just beginning. "The US is further ahead in this respect, because of years more experience in data gathering but there is a growing appetite in the UK and Europe," he says.

In 2013, the average Dutch person's information was available on 1,500 databases, according to Maarten Louman, a partner at the Qiy Foundation, a data storage company in the Netherlands.

The benefits of big data are not limited to those working in the underwriting business. Customers may also benefit from a more streamlined application process and user-friendly websites.

Mr Sadler at Zurich notes that "web analytics software can track how customers navigate through websites, and which pages, or even questions within pages, cause customers to delay or drop out of a process. Insurers are making use of these data to design their websites better, and to make it quicker and simpler for their customers to buy insurance."

Concerns are growing, however, as to whom exactly has access to this information. The increased use of big data has led people to believe - rightly or wrongly - that their privacy is being invaded. Insurers too are aware of the need to balance efficiency gains against the risk of alienating their customers.

"At the moment, the data behind this are still quite basic," says Mr Sadler, "but over time, some insurers may look for permission to get more detailed data on people's habits - for example, by tracking their behaviour from their mobile phones, or using their Google search history to find out their interests - and use this to refine premiums further."

He adds: "This leads to one of the concerns with big data, which is customer data protection. Would consumers be happy for insurers to look through their Facebook photos as part of the underwriting process? Or tracking their every move via a smartphone's location services to confirm whether their behaviour is in line with what they disclosed on the application form?

"As an industry, we need to tread carefully here and demonstrate responsibility."

I am on the train from Geneva to Zurich, bound for the annual forecasting dinner of the Swiss Chartered Financial Analyst society, where I've been invited to speak about the virtual cryptocurrency Bitcoin. All I know is that the gathering is at the Dolder Grand hotel, that most people will be CFA society members and that I've had about an hour's sleep the night before.

All in all, I have a love-hate relationship with public speaking. On one hand, I love to do it because it's a great honour and a wonderful opportunity to articulate one's views without fear of interruption. On the other hand, I suffer from stage fright.

How monumental the stage fright is depends on a number of variables: how much sleep I've had the night before - itself dependent on how intimidated I am by the event; how familiar I am with the topic I'm discussing; the composition and hostility of the crowd; and, finally, the nature of the appearance.

I make myself do these things, nevertheless, because (a) I'm a glutton for punishment and (b) I've been told that it's only with practice and conditioning that I can suppress my public-speaking demons. And true, sometimes it can turn out absolutely fine. Other times it can be . . . well, awkward.

To the annoyance of most of the train's dining carriage I find myself muttering and gesticulating furiously as I rerun the key points in my head in a vain attempt to memorise some emergency phrases.

The Dolder Grand turns out to be Zurich's most prestigious hotel, which is another way of saying that it's more intimidating than I ever imagined. An impressive "movies are made of this" driveway leads to the gargantuan modernised castle, which sits prominently on a hill overlooking the city. I arrive by taxi. But all around me there are supercars.

The evening air is crisp and my breath lingers as I thank the randomly Russian-speaking taxi driver, and wonder to myself whether I should ask him to pick me up later? After all, how do you get an affordable taxi around here?

As I walk through the corridors on my way to the drinks reception I note that the place is filled to the brim with creepy modern art, illuminated by extremely moody and artistic lighting. Everyone is serious. Everything is sparkly and shiny. Stanley Kubrick's film Eyes Wide Shut rushes to the forefront of my mind.

I'm slightly late, because of a train timetabling error on my part, and the drinks reception is already in full swing by the time I enter what seems to be the gold room. The lack of sleep is beginning to make everything feel very dreamlike and blurry. Like Jack Torrance in The Shining , I would do anything for a drink to relieve my mental block. But I decide it's better to ask for coffee. A bow-tied waiter appears out of nowhere to take my order.

A Swiss-German man tries to explain his Bitcoin valuation model to me. We're being constantly interrupted but I think he's insisting that the currency's value lies in the inflexible supply. I think I hear a reference to Austrian School economics. I can't really make him out because it's noisy and he has an accent. All I know is, if he's any indication of what the audience will be like, I could be entering hostile territory. I seem to fervently disagree with almost all his points.

We proceed to the dining room, where I finally get a good look at the crowd. Men outnumber women at least five to one, if not more. Most are wearing business suits and some even have little CFA society pins on their lapels. Needless to say, I feel like a total outsider.

It's time. I take my position on the podium, gulp down the water provided, and begin.

In hindsight, it is not the best performance of my life. Eventually I see someone making a "cut off'" gesture at me from the audience. The primeval part of my brain interprets this as a final judgement of the society members. I prepare to be ejected from the gathering and never asked back. Thankfully, it turns out that it's just the end of my allocated speaking time and we will now be having questions.

The inquisition phase of the evening goes much better and I realise that I am generally much more confident when responding to direct points. But the next day I'm back in Geneva preparing to do the whole thing again for the CFA society members who live in the French part of Switzerland. The venue this time around is the equally imposing President Wilson hotel on the lake. But this time it's a smaller crowd, and a much more informal setting. I am much more confident. There are also more women in the audience.

A lively question and answer session plus positive feedback after my appearance reassures me that I have probably performed more competently. I put this down to the adage that practice makes perfect, and conclude that I can indeed be cured of my affliction with the correct conditioning.

I have just arrived in Warsaw's Okecie airport on a direct flight from Geneva to visit my Polish family. It's the first day of the Winter Olympics and, as a keen skier, I'm annoyed I've missed the opening ceremony as a result of the flight.

It's pretty late and we are hungry. I'm not optimistic about our chances of finding somewhere to eat that late, but then I remember Warsaw is nothing like Geneva. And true to form, the city is more vibrant and abuzz than it's ever been. We easily find a restaurant open and serving past midnight. And for less than 200 zloty (40) my husband and I eat like kings. To boot there's a rerun of the opening ceremony on the restaurant's TV screens.

My annual Warsaw visit follows a familiar pattern. There are visitations with old friends for reminiscences over coffee and cheese cake. There's a visit to my bridge-playing great aunt, a war hero, who even at the age of 89 is more familiar with current affairs and technology than most thirtysomethings. (This time she informs me I have too many mobile phones and that I should get a handset with two sims so I don't miss her calls. Also that she's suspicious of recent advances in artificial intelligence.)

And finally there's a visit to a now snowy Powazki cemetery, Warsaw's own Pre Lachaise, where hundreds of impressively decorated headstones mark the final resting places of the deceased but are so densely packed you need knowledge of key markers to navigate yourself efficiently or be lost. In my case a giant pyramidal tomb points the way to the granite obelisk that marks my mother's grave and commemorates the date 2011. I think to myself that she would have liked my story about the Dolder Grand.

Moody's Corp. unveiled plans to seek a majority stake in ICRA Ltd., a provider of credit ratings and research in India, through a tender offer.

Moody's, a ratings and analytics company, offered to acquire up to 2.65 million shares of ICRA at a price of 2,000 Indian rupees (about $32.19) a share, a 26% premium over ICRA's closing price on the National Stock Exchange of India Ltd. on Thursday. The offer represents a 22% premium to ICRA's record-high closing price at the end of last year, Moody's said.

Full acceptance of the offer would boost Moody's ownership stake in ICRA to about 55%, from 28.5% currently, Moody's said in a statement. The offer is conditional upon Moody's acquiring at least 2.15 million shares, which would increase its ownership stake to slightly more than 50%.

Moody's, which relies on its debt-rating operation for the vast majority of its income, said it would fund the offer from international cash on hand and the tender period is expected to begin in April, subject to review of the deal by Indian regulatory authorities.

"We look forward to expanding and deepening our collaboration with ICRA as it provides research and ratings for the growing domestic debt market in India as well as other emerging markets in the region," said Moody's President and Chief Executive Raymond McDaniel.

Earlier this month, Moody's reported its fourth-quarter profit jumped as revenue grew in its structured finance segment. The company's shares have risen about 6% in the past three months.

Former Citigroup CEO Plans New Consulting Firm

Less than two years after he was ousted as chief executive of Citigroup Inc., Vikram Pandit is collaborating with the co-author of the popular "Freakonomics" book series to launch a new consulting business aimed at helping companies improve their cultures and use of technology.

Mr. Pandit and his new colleagues have been ringing up bank chief executives and others and offering their services. Among the recent recipients of the pitch: Top executives at Deutsche Bank AG, which is trying to improve its corporate culture amid a number of regulatory and legal problems.

The firm, called TGG, is promoting "a novel approach to address the challenges that large complex organizations face in compliance, fraud, corruption, and culture and reputation," said an email to Deutsche executives from Hamid Biglari, one of Mr. Pandit's former Citigroup lieutenants and a managing partner of the new venture. "We think the results are transformative for companies looking to create a culture of performance and integrity," the email said.

Another plus, according to the email: Messrs. Pandit and Biglari's "domain expertise" from their time running Citigroup.

The email, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, proposes that Messrs. Pandit and Biglari, whose venture is based in Midtown Manhattan, fly to Frankfurt or London for lunch with the Deutsche Bank executives. It isn't clear whether the rendezvous will actually happen. A Deutsche Bank spokesman declined to comment on internal communications. Mr. Pandit wasn't available to comment.

Mr. Biglari's email says TGG's partners include Steven Levitt, co-author of the "Freakonomics" series that combines economics with everyday decision-making, and Daniel Kahneman, a winner of the Nobel Prize in economics.

Messrs. Levitt and Kahneman already helped create a Chicago-based consulting firm called The Greatest Good. A planned partnership between TGG and The Greatest Good isn't yet completed, according to people with knowledge of the entities' structure. Messrs. Levitt and Kahneman didn't respond to emails requesting comment.

The venture is the latest effort by the 57-year-old Mr. Pandit to bounce back after leaving Citigroup. The New York banking giant's board removed him in 2012 due to frustration with, among other things, his management style and his frosty relationship with regulators, people familiar with private discussions said at the time.

These days, Mr. Pandit is experimenting with roles ranging from venture capitalist to deal adviser to consultant, say people familiar with his activities. One of his ventures is funding a peer-to-peer lending business called the Orchard.

Last year, Mr. Pandit called bank senior executives, including Credit Suisse Group AG CEO Brady Dougan, as part of an effort to create a bank consortium to buy stock-exchange data and technology assets, according to people close to the communications.

In that effort, Mr. Pandit worked with a former Morgan Stanley colleague, banker Charles Stonehill. Discussions about a potential consortium didn't progress toward a deal, the people said. Mr. Stonehill is now working with Messrs. Pandit and Biglari on TGG.

TGG's aim is to use insights into human behavior, economics and so-called big data -- the crunching of ever-greater volumes of information more quickly and deeply -- to help large, complex companies analyze employee behavior, management decision-making, business models and strategy. Those are areas where Messrs. Levitt and Kahneman should add value.

TGG doesn't have any clients yet, but Messrs. Pandit and Biglari plan to use their networks of CEO contacts around the world to identify prospective customers in the banking industry and beyond, according to a person with knowledge of their plans.

Risk management: is your supply chain a weak link?

Supply chains are the backbone of today's global economy. Their complexity and vital role have businesses increasingly concerned about managing major disruptions.

In fact, a recent World Economic Forum report (in co-operation with Accenture) entitled "Building Resilience in Supply Chains", indicates that significant supply chain disruptions reduce the share price of affected companies by as much as seven per cent on average.

Security chiefs everywhere are concerned about how open their supply chain is to various risk factors. Indeed, it is important to remember that almost all aspects of business involve some risk, in the sense that some components will always be outside of your control, especially in a global marketplace.

Your supply chain is no different; it is one of the most collaborative environments in your organisation, thus it inherently poses greater risks to the confidentiality, integrity and availability of corporate information. Mapping the flow of information and keeping an eye on key access points in order to continuously manage information security risks is an essential part of building a more resilient business.

Hands-on risk management: do you know where your information is?

Do you know if your suppliers are protecting your company's sensitive information as diligently as you would protect it yourself? This is one duty you can't simply outsource - it's your liability. By considering the nature of your supply chains, determining what information is shared, and assessing the probability and impact of potential breaches, you can balance information risk management efforts across your enterprise.

Organisations of all sizes need to think about the consequences of a supplier providing accidental, but harmful, access to their corporate information. Information shared in the supply chain can include intellectual property, customer or employee data, commercial plans or negotiations, and logistics. Caution should not be confined to manufacturing or distribution partners. It should also embrace your professional services suppliers (eg, lawyers and accountants) all of whom share access, often to your most valuable data assets.

To address information risk in the supply chain, organisations should adopt robust, scalable and repeatable processes - obtaining assurance proportionate to the risk faced. Supply chain information risk management should be embedded within existing procurement and vendor management processes, so supply chain information risk management becomes part of regular business operations.

Secure your supply chain: three vulnerabilities to examine

There are three key reasons organisations may find they are vulnerable due to information sharing across their supply chain:

1. Lack of awareness of the sensitive information being shared in contracts

2. Too many contracts to assess individually

3. Lack of visibility and controls as information is shared in the supply chain

Some organisations focus on the first reason, and assess the information risk for each contract. This approach does not address the second issue, as it is not scalable for organisations with thousands of contracts. The third vulnerability, the most challenging and urgent for many businesses, is even more complex to address. Organizations typically have no relationship with their suppliers' suppliers, so the risk increases as visibility and influence decrease upstream.

Collaborate securely to empower and protect your business

Accelerating trends of supply chain globalisation and outsourced manufacturing and distribution have combined to increase the pace of change, complexity, and risk for brand owners. These trends have created a fundamental shift in the way companies of all sizes plan, source, make, and deliver their goods and services.

Enabling integration with supply chain partners, and then facilitating real-time visibility and collaboration capabilities, should your first objectives. The ability to see, collaborate and resolve disruptions as they occur in your network is what defines a risk-resistant supply chain. When one part of the supply chain is disrupted, the effects can lead to issues throughout your entire supply chain network.

Technologies and systems solutions, such as those from E2open and Kinaxis, use real-time information, integrated business processes and advanced analytics to provide businesses with visibility into, and control over, their supply chains.

Supply Chain Information Risk Assurance Process (SCIRAP)

The Information Security Forum (ISF) has created the Supply Chain Information Risk Assurance Process (Scirap), an approach that helps organisations manage information risk across their supplier base. Scirap focuses on identifying information shared in the supply chain and the contracts that create the highest risk. It also provides a scalable way to manage contracts so that efforts are proportionate to the risk.

Many organisations have contracts with suppliers that number in the hundreds or thousands. It is often impossible to commit enough resources to assess all those contracts and the associated suppliers. Scirap provides a practical method to sort existing contracts into groups in order to prioritise efforts based on information risk.

Scirap focuses on information shared with upstream suppliers. The approach suggests that organisations make use of supply chain maps to follow the information. An upstream information sharing assessment tracks what is being shared with the suppliers' suppliers and beyond. The results will draw attention to significant concentrations of information, triggering the implementation of additional controls on suppliers.

Scirap integrates with existing procurement and vendor management processes, providing a mechanism to make risk management a part of normal business operations. As a result, organisations of all sizes will be able to more effectively identify and prioritise the assurance or actions required.

Be Prepared, Stay Resilient

Even the smallest supplier, or the slightest supply chain hiccup, can have dangerous impacts on your business. Brand management and brand reputation are subject to the successful security of your supply chain and thus both are constantly at stake.

The time to make supply chain security enhancements a priority is now. As the old saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. ISF's Scirap approach provides a great example of a detailed, four step approach to portion an otherwise daunting project into manageable components. This method is information-driven (not supplier-centric) so it is scalable and repeatable across the enterprise.

Don't wait for demand to spike, or the next disaster to strike, before taking action. Businesses of all sizes must focus fixes on the most vulnerable spots in their supply chain now. The unfortunate reality of today's complex global marketplace is that not every security compromise can be prevented beforehand; being proactive now also means you - and your suppliers - will be better able to react quickly and intelligently when something does happen. In extreme but entirely possible scenarios, this readiness and resiliency may dictate competitiveness, financial health, share price, or even survival.

Steve Durbin is global vice-president of the Information Security Forum (ISF).

Global Finance: Fed, European Banks Face Off on New Rules

By Geoffrey Smith, Ryan Tracy and Stephanie Armour

European banks and the Federal Reserve began a chess match over new rules for U.S. units of foreign banks, with overseas firms expected to try and limit the impact and Fed officials vowing to prevent banks from evasion.

The jockeying over the Fed's new rules could further ruffle tensions between the U.S. and Europe over what European officials see as a unilateral abandonment of a globally agreed-to approach for financial regulation.

The Fed's move comes days before finance ministers and central-bank governors from the Group of 20 leading industrialized and emerging markets are due to meet in Sydney, Australia.

The G-20 has found it increasingly hard to keep a common line on regulation as the effect of the 2008 financial crisis has faded.

The Fed Tuesday formally approved new rules requiring the largest international banks operating in the U.S. to set up U.S.-based "intermediate holding companies," which will be subject to the same capital and liquidity requirements as domestic banks.

The move ends an arrangement whereby the U.S. and European Union effectively trusted each other to keep their respective banks sound.

"This is a considerable competitive handicap for European banks, as their U.S. competitors aren't subject to any equivalent requirements in the EU," said Michael Kemmer, head of the Association of German Banks.

Sebastien de Brouwer, head of legal affairs at the European Banking Federation, said the move risks creating a standards gap between the U.S. and Europe, one that would duplicate reporting requirements, fragment liquidity in international markets and again incentivize banks to engage in "regulatory arbitrage" by moving their businesses to locations with the least regulation.

Fed governor Daniel Tarullo argued Tuesday that "the most important contribution we can make to the global financial system is to ensure the stability of the U.S. financial system."

The Fed has vowed to keep a close eye on European banks, which -- troubled by the Fed's growing reach into international banking regulation -- may take steps to curb the Fed's reach by moving some activity into other parts of their operations or otherwise circumscribe the mandate for adding certain types of capital. Buried in the documents released Tuesday are provisions saying the Fed could accelerate compliance deadlines for banks that try to circumvent the rules or impose additional "restrictions the Board deems necessary to carry out the purposes" of the rule, such as even stricter capital and leverage limits.

"We will be monitoring pretty carefully how foreign banks adapt to our proposal," Mark Van Der Weide, deputy director of the Fed's Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation, said at the Fed meeting Tuesday.

Many analysts were more sanguine on the rules' impact. Kian Abouhossein, an analyst with J.P. Morgan in London, said many details of the final Fed rule were less stringent than what had been originally proposed.

He noted that banks could use funding from their global holding companies to bolster capital at their U.S. units.

Deutsche Bank AG, one of the biggest foreign banks in the U.S., could comfortably meet the Fed's requirements without having to take any further measures on capital and leverage beyond what it already has announced, he said.

The Fed, in the rule released Tuesday, said some foreign banks will be able to meet the new capital requirements for their U.S. subsidiaries by retaining more earnings in the U.S. or transferring capital from their parents, rather than raising capital externally or reducing their U.S. activity.

But the Fed also sought to limit banks' flexibility. "They're really trying to send a message [that] 'if you take us on, we will shut you down,'" said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of the policy-analysis firm Federal Financial Analytics Inc.

While the Fed didn't spell out whether specific securities would qualify as capital under the rule, the regulator defined capital for foreign banks in the same way it does for U.S. firms. To be considered Tier 1, a capital instrument would have to meet a series of criteria. For instance, the underlying contract can't require the bank to reimburse the investor on a set date, and it must be subordinate to other creditors if the bank hits rocky times. So long as foreign banks add capital instruments that meet the Fed's definition, they would comply with the rule.

Fed officials have said they would monitor foreign banks and won't shy away from stepping in if changes need to be made to ensure foreign banks comply. That may further ruffle the European Union, which has bristled at U.S. requirements they see as putting foreign banks at a competitive disadvantage.

The UK-based company behind the Candy Crush Saga gaming phenomenon is seeking to float in New York with an equity valuation of about $5bn.

King Digital Entertainment hopes to raise up to $500m, according to regulatory filings made yesterday, and could list on the New York Stock Exchange as soon as March, according to a one person familiar with the matter.

The filings also revealed that King has paid out over $500m in dividends to investors and directors during the past four months. The timing of the payments from such a young tech company could prompt questions from prospective investors being asked to stump up a similar amount just months later.

Apax Partners, the private equity and venture capital group, is King's biggest shareholder with 48.2 per cent of the equity. Index Ventures has an 8.3 per cent stake. The executive team holds about a third of the company. "We believe Candy Crush Saga, our top title to date, is one of the largest interactive entertainment franchises of all time," said King. The company's other titles include Pet Rescue Saga , Farm Heroes Saga and Papa Pear Saga .

The challenge for King will be to take the success of a single title and turn it into a sustainable business.

"With games that penetrate the mass market, it's a case of trying to bottle lightning," said gaming expert Ed Barton of Strategy Analytics.

Candy Crush is deceptively simple, inviting players to form rows of three jellied sweets. It accounts for more than 75 per cent of King's total gross revenues, although it said it expected Candy Crush to represent a smaller percentage in the future as it looks to diversify its game portfolio. The game was launched on Facebook but is now available on smartphones.

King has posted rapid growth. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation grew from $4m in 2011 to $825m in 2013, according to documents filed with the SEC. In 2013, King had revenues of $1.8bn and a pre-tax profit of $714m. The average revenue per employee was $2.7m.

King was founded in 2003 by predominantly Swedish entrepreneurs and is headquartered in the UK. It has about 324m monthly users. In December an average of 128m daily active users played its games, which are free to download. It makes money encouraging players to buy upgrades.

Arctic Winds Put Fire Under Natural Gas; Another Cold Blast Expected to Lead to Higher Demand; Exchange Raises Collateral for Trading Futures

The approach of yet another severe winter chill sent natural-gas prices soaring to a five-year high, as investors bet the brutal weather across the U.S. will put further strain on supplies of the heating fuel.

Prices have climbed 45% this year as homes and businesses across the Midwest and Northeast consume record amounts of the fuel to get through a series of cold snaps. That demand is rapidly depleting U.S. gas inventories, which entered the winter near highs. January had the highest average natural-gas demand on record, according to energy-analytics firm Bentek Energy.

Buyers piling into the market this week are worried that there won't be much gas left in storage by the end of winter. They are willing to pay extra to make sure they secure supplies now, before the cost possibly increases even more. Meanwhile, investors have put on big wagers that prices will rise further.

The increase in futures prices has shocked a market that had become used to low and stable prices. For more than five years, booming domestic production from shale-gas fields filled storage tanks and caverns around the country, ensuring that gas was cheap and plentiful. But this unusually cold winter has overwhelmed even the record output coming from U.S. gas fields. The fear now is that supplies will be so depleted by spring that producers won't be able to fully replenish them, leaving the market vulnerable to more price spikes if next winter also is unusually cold.

On Wednesday, natural gas for March delivery, the front-month contract, climbed 59.8 cents, or 11%, to $6.149 a million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest settlement price since December 2008. Prices have shot up 28% in the past week. CME Group Inc., which owns the exchange, said late Wednesday it would raise the amount of collateral required to trade the benchmark natural-gas contract by 9%. Exchanges often boost so-called margin requirements after periods of volatile trading.

"It's just a huge move," said John Woods, president of JJ Woods Associates, a natural-gas trading firm in New York. "It's essentially awakening a dormant market. &Every time you hear the words 'polar vortex,' it seems we jump 20, 30 cents." A polar vortex is a mass of air usually found around the poles, but this year it has pushed lower into Canada and the U.S.

Revised forecasts on Monday called for a cold front to appear next week and extend across the Eastern U.S. into early March.

For some investors, the coming temperature plunge is an opportunity to bet on prices going up even more.

"We made a lot today," said Emil Van Essen, head of commodity-trading adviser Emil Van Essen LLC, which manages $160 million. He had used options to wager that prices would hit $6 mmBTUs.

Mr. Van Essen said he expects the rally to continue into next week. He said March futures could briefly jump above $10 as traders holding bets on falling prices close those positions before the contract expires on Wednesday.

Consumers are shielded from higher prices because utility rates tend to be set at the state level, rather than by the market. Natural-gas consumers can expect to spend $649 on their heating bills this winter, up from an average of $603 last winter, according to the Energy Information Administration.

However, bills could rise sharply next year if prices don't head lower, analysts said.

The price rise could hit industrial gas users sooner. These companies, ranging from chemical manufacturers to steelmakers, have benefited from low energy costs in recent years.

Fertilizer producer CF Industries Holdings Inc. reduced production at some ammonia plants in Canada when spot natural-gas prices in the region jumped last month, said Chief Executive Tony Will. Still, he said he doesn't see the recent price move having a lasting impact on the fertilizer business.

"Our view is, this is a weather-based anomaly," he said. CF Industries has locked in more than half of its natural-gas needs for the first half of the year at less than $3.70 a MMBtu, limiting its exposure to rising prices.

Many investors hold a similar view. Prices for natural gas to be delivered in April or later are trading below $5 a mmBTUs, still above levels seen in recent years but well below recent highs.

One reason prices are lower a few months out: U.S. gas output is expected to set another record this year and again in 2015, according to the EIA. Higher natural-gas prices also would encourage power generators to switch from natural gas to less-expensive coal, making more gas available to other users.

"The general consensus is that we'll get past this," said Stefan Revielle, vice president for natural-gas research at Credit Suisse Group AG. "Production is still enough."

Analysts and investors are watching an EIA report on gas storage due out Thursday for clues to where prices will head next. The average forecast is for supplies to drop 249 billion cubic feet, to 1.437 trillion cubic feet, according to a Wall Street Journal survey. If supplies fall to that level, it would be the lowest in February since 2004.

Such a large drop plus another few weeks of freezing temperatures would put inventories on track to end the winter below one trillion cubic feet for the first time since 2003, a level many in the market see as too low to comfortably meet a sudden surge in demand.

Peter Sorrentino, senior vice president and portfolio manager for Huntington Funds, which manages $4.5 billion, said he sees natural-gas prices running higher over time. He has invested in an exchange-traded fund designed to track natural-gas prices, and said he isn't worried that futures will fall back until they hit at least $6.75 a MMBtu.

"That would tell us it's moved too far too fast," Mr. Sorrentino said. But "we wouldn't reduce our overall exposure, because we like that longer-term" outlook, he said.

Arabica-Coffee Prices Climb to 16-Month Highs; Dry Weather in Brazil Could Reduce Global Coffee Output

NEW YORK Coffee prices posted their biggest two-day gain in nearly 14 years as traders and investors focused on reduced output from Brazil.

Arabica coffee, prized for its mild flavor and typically used in gourmet blends, traded Wednesday at prices last seen on Oct. 4, 2012, boosted by concerns that unusually dry weather in top-grower and exporter Brazil would crimp supplies.

Prices have climbed 55% this year, and consumers are likely to pay more for their java as roasters and coffee shops compensate for the surge. But arabica producers outside of Brazil are benefiting from the rally, after struggling with near seven-year-low prices as recently as November.

The coffee market "was almost like a spring, or a ball under water, where you hold it down and then it just pops," said Adam Sarhan, chief executive at Sarhan Capital, a New York investment firm. "At this point, the path of least resistance is higher until [new] data emerges."

Futures surged 23% this week, the biggest two-day gain since July 2000. The contract for March delivery ended up 12.5%, or 19.10 cents, at $1.7175 a pound on the ICE Futures U.S. exchange, while the more actively traded contract for May delivery gained 11.5%, or 17.75 cents, to $1.7260 a pound.

Producers in Central America and Colombia are seeing the difference already.

"We're very happy," said Henry Heck, president of Cafetalera los Compadres SA and Ramacafe, two farming groups in Nicaragua. "Right now, you're starting to break even or even make a little money."

But the most important producer by far is Brazil, which is the source of a third of the world's coffee and more than half of its arabica. Reduced output there could lead global demand to exceed production this year.

"People are very, very worried" about the crop in Brazil, said Hernando de la Roche, senior vice president at financial services firm INTL FCStone in Miami. "This is the first time that we've seen a drought [of this magnitude] during January and February."

January and February have been the driest months in Brazil in 30 years, according to Somar Meteorologia, a So Paulo private weather service. Coffee trees need at least 20 inches of rain over the first three months of the year to develop normally, but the regions have received between four and six inches so far, Somar said.

"Plantations in Brazil are enduring dry weather just when rain is needed the most for tree roots to absorb nutrients as the beans begin to grow inside the coffee cherries," said WeatherBell Analytics, a New York meteorological consulting firm. The cherries are fruit that surrounds the seeds that are harvested and roasted for coffee beans.

Growers are likely to begin evaluating how much damage has been done at the end of this month, when the cherries are more developed. The cherries could be smaller than usual, or they could fall from the trees prematurely, due to the lack of moisture, analysts said.

Marco Figueiredo, vice president at Ally Brazilian Coffee Merchants in Plantation, Fla., expects coffee prices to rise to $2 a pound in the near term, a level last seen in March 2012.

Raw-sugar prices also advanced Wednesday as Brazil's dry weather has reduced production forecasts for that crop as well. Brazil is the No. 1 grower and exporter of the sweetener.

Raw sugar for delivery in March on the ICE Futures U.S. exchange ended 1.9% higher at 16.46 cents a pound. The contract for delivery in May closed 2.1% higher at 16.85 cents a pound, the highest settlement since Dec. 2.

In other markets, cotton for delivery in March closed down 1.1% at 86.97 cents a pound, and the May contract ended 1.8% lower at 87.91 cents. March-delivery cocoa settled at $2,909 a ton, down 0.6% on the day, while the May contract settled 0.8% lower at $2,934 a ton. Orange juice for delivery in March ended down 0.2% at $1.4340 a pound, and May closed at $1.4405 a pound, down 0.3%.

'Candy Crush Saga' game creator files for New York IPO

The UK-based company behind the Candy Crush Saga mobile gaming phenomenon is to float in New York at an equity valuation of around $5bn.

King Digital Entertainment hopes to raise up to $500m, according to regulatory filings on Tuesday, and could list on the New York Stock Exchange as soon as March, according to one person familiar with the matter.

The filing also revealed that King had paid out more than $500m in dividends to investors and directors during the past four months. The timing of those payments from such a young tech company could prompt questions from prospective investors being asked to stump up a similar amount months later.

Apax Partners, the private equity group, is King's biggest shareholder with a 48.2 per cent stake, while Index Ventures has 8.3 per cent. The executive team holds about a third of the company.

"We believe Candy Crush Saga, our top title to date, is one of the largest interactive entertainment franchises of all time," said King. Its other titles include Pet Rescue Saga, Farm Heroes Saga and Papa Pear Saga.

The challenge for King and its peers, which include Finnish developers Rovio and Supercell and London-based Mind Candy, is how to take the success of a single title and turn it into a sustainable business.

"With games that penetrate the mass market, it's a case of trying to bottle lightning," says gaming expert Ed Barton of Strategy Analytics. "Super-normal levels of success are not predictable, but these companies do it once and then try and do it again."

Candy Crush is deceptively simple, inviting players to form rows of three jellied sweets. It accounts for more than 75 per cent of King's gross revenues, although the company expects Candy Crush to be a smaller part of its sales as it develops new games.

The game started life on Facebook but has since become available via smartphones. It ranks as the second highest-grossing smartphone app, according to the website App Annie, after Supercell's Clash of Clans.

King has seen huge growth in recent years. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation rose from $4m in 2011 to $825m in 2013, according to its prospectus.

Full-year sales rose to $1.8bn with pre-tax profit of $714m. The average revenue per employee in 2013 was $2.7m.

King, which was founded in 2003 and recently relocated from Sweden to the UK, has about 324m monthly users.

Only 4 per cent of King's players purchased items in December 2013. In the preceding year, the company's user base grew sixfold, but the company says it does not expect to attract new players "at a similar rate in the future as it achieves market penetration".

Regulatory filings show a small decline in the number of monthly active users between the third and fourth quarters of 2013.

Its games are free to download, but the company makes money by encouraging players to buy upgrades in the app so they can advance through the levels more quickly or gain extra lives.

"No individual game session should take more than a few minutes. People play our games on buses, trains, planes, in airports, on coffee breaks and study breaks, while they're watching TV or waiting to meet a friend," King said.

In valuing King, investors are likely to look at the number of active players, how much money those users spend playing the game and how well King manages to retain them.

Banks including JPMorgan Chase, Credit Suisse and Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch will advise on the float.

The company said in its filing that it has paid $504m in dividend payments over the past five months to its shareholders and directors, including $217m this month.

The gaming industry is haunted by the memory of Zynga, the social gaming company whose shares fell sharply after its IPO and which struggled to make the transition from desktop to mobile gaming. However, Zynga shares have rebounded 48 per cent over the past 12 months.

Investor appetite for gaming companies has picked up recently, with Supercell's most recent funding round valuing it at about $3bn. The three-year-old company has also enjoyed strong growth and is currently generating revenues of about $5m a day. While Rovio recently squashed chatter of an impending IPO and Supercell's funding round is likely to delay a float, analysts point to London studio Mind Candy as another IPO candidate in the sector.

King's financial and administrative headquarters are in London, with its main game development studio in Stockholm. It also has offices in Barcelona, Bucharest, Malta, Malmo and San Francisco.

King announced last September that Hope Cochran would be joining the company as chief financial officer. She was most recently CFO for Clearwire, the company that built the first 4G network in the US and merged with Sprint in 2012.

Pinterest raised the most money from venture capitalists last year, as the online scrapbooking site that has fast become a retailers' favourite took in $425m from two funding rounds.

Technology company valuations ballooned in 2013, with Twitter soaring on its initial public offering and the price of deals in the sector rising. The private market also boomed and Pinterest took both the third and fourth largest funding rounds of the year, according to data compiled by research firm PrivCo.

The online pinboard saw its valuation rise by more than 50 per cent to $3.8bn between the two rounds despite being unprofitable and in the very early stages of generating revenue from advertising.

Retailers have fallen for its large, pretty pictures which users - primarily women - compile into online "wish lists". Pinterest users spend more per visit to an ecommerce site than those coming from Facebook in the UK and set take over Facebook users in the US in 2014, according to data from the Adobe Digital Index.

The San Francisco-based company led by Ben Silbermann raised money from Fidelity Ventures, Valiant Capital Partners and Andreessen Horowitz, among other venture capital firms. It has raised $563m in total.

Uber, the fast-expanding taxi-booking service, raised the largest single round in 2013, taking $361.3m from Google Ventures, TPG Capital and Benchmark. Google invested 83 per cent of its stated annual investment budget for 2013 in Uber, according to researchers from PrivCo.

The list of the top ten fundraisings in the world included two from outside the United States. London-based Spotify had the second largest single round at $250m, while Canadian company HootSuite, a social media management tool, made the number eight slot with a $165m round.

Sam Hamadeh, PrivCo's founder, said "geographically this year's list looks a bit more diverse than past years".

Venture capital has been flooding into social sites such as Pinterest and HootSuite as well as "sharing economy" companies like Uber.

Cyber security is also becoming a focus for investment, with Palantir Technologies, a big data company which works for the US intelligence services, valued at $9bn last year. The Silicon Valley-based company, first funded by the CIA, raised two funds last year totalling more than $300m.

But not all of the top 10 have fared well. Fab.com, the online retailer, was valued at $1bn in a $150m fundraising in June, backed by Chinese internet company Tencent and the Washington Post Company as well as more traditional venture capitalists.

However, by November the New York-based company was losing millions of users, according to data from ComScore, as it tried to transform itself from a "flash sales" site to an ecommerce company.

Beth Ferriera, the company's chief operating officer, left and it announced Bradford Shellhammer, co-founder and chief design officer, was stepping away from day-to-day operations.

Jawbone closes in on $250m fundraising

Jawbone, the San Francisco-based maker of fitness wristbands, portable speakers and Bluetooth headsets, is close to raising at least $250m at a valuation above $3bn, positioning it as one of the most richly valued and heavily capitalised companies in the wearable technology market.

The new round comes on top of more than $250m in equity financing and, just five months ago, almost $100m in debt that the 15-year-old company has already raised, underlining the high capital requirements that hardware start-ups face compared with software and internet firms.

According to sources familiar with the funding discussions, the deal is led by Rizvi Traverse Management, which has provided later-stage funding for some of Silicon Valley's best-known companies, including Facebook, Twitter, Square and Flipboard, as well as media groups including Summit Entertainment, talent agency ICM and Playboy.

Jawbone declined to comment on the fundraising, which was first reported by Recode. Its range of products includes the Jambox speaker, UP fitness-tracking wristband and Era Bluetooth headset. Existing equity investors include Andreessen Horowitz, Atomico Ventures, Sequoia Capital and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, while last year's lenders includedSilver Lake and JPMorgan.

The latest UP24 device, which was released late last year for $150, was part of the delegates' gift pack at last month's World Economic Forum in Davos. In 2011, a previous version of UP had to be pulled from sale due to flaws in the device and its software, with all customers offered refunds.

The new financial firepower will help Jawbone compete with a range of new competitors in the much-hyped wearable technology market, from giants such as Google, Samsung and soon Apple, to legions of start-ups such as Fitbit and Misfit Wearables.

Apple is expected to launch an "iWatch" with extensive health-tracking capabilities later this year, while Google plans to release Glass, its futuristic headband, to the general public in the coming months.

After Google's recent acquisition spree - which has included a series of robotics companies, UK artificial-intelligence start-up DeepMind and $3.2bn purchase of smart home company Nest Labs - two people in the hardware start-up community have told the FT that the search company has been investigating further deals in the wearables market.

Samsung is expected to unveil the second version of its Galaxy Gear smart watch at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona later this month.

Formerly known as Aliph, Jawbone was founded in 1999 by Stanford University students Alexander Asseily and Hosain Rahman. It also counts as its chief creative officer Yves Bhar, the designer behind the fuseproject agency that helped to create the "XO" laptop for the One Laptop Per Child project and the crowdfunded games console Ouya, as well as Hermann Miller furniture.

The Property Report
Hotel Deal Offers Peek Into a Boom

The Standard Hotel in Manhattan's bustling Meatpacking district became famous a few years ago when some of its more brazen guests disrobed in front of its floor-to-ceiling windows.

Now the downtown hot spot is raising eyebrows for a different reason: a near-record sales price.

Final bidders include a group led by investor Steven Kantor. They and others are in negotiations to pay more than $400 million for the five-year-old property, say people familiar with the matter. The Standard, which is managed by hotelier Andre Balazs's company, sits above the city's elevated pedestrian park known as the HighLine and attracts a young and chic crowd.

The price would represent at least $1.2 million a room, these people said. That would be the highest paid for a U.S. hotel on that basis since the financial crisis, and the fourth highest ever, according to broker Jones Lang LaSalle.

Poised to profit are owners Dune Real Estate Partners and Greenfield Partners, which spent about $240 million on the hotel and its restaurants and nightclub beginning 10 years ago, according to a person with knowledge of the deal.

The hotel market is booming, fueled by rising room rates, more tourism and business travel, and demand from investors who are new to the business. While the volume of sales rose in all commercial real-estate sectors, the lodging industry logged the biggest increase in 2013.

The value of U.S. hotel transactions hit $22 billion last year, up 35% from 2012 and a nearly tenfold increase from the low point in 2009, says Jones Lang LaSalle.

That is still about half the money spent in the peak year of 2007. But a number of recent deals rank among the priciest ever. Manhattan's Park Lane Hotel, Miami's St. Regis Bal Harbour and the London West Hollywood each changed hands for around $1 million a room -- often considered a watershed level that had been reached only about a dozen times in the U.S., according to Jones Lang LaSalle.

Those deals are helping drive the average sales price to new highs. In 2013, the average price per room for hotel sales of $10 million or more was $217,000, topping the $215,000 average in 2007, according to investment bank MLV & Co.

Some wonder how much longer the good times will last. Until now, hotel values have been rising partly because there has been scant new supply.

But for some of the hottest hotel markets, that is about to change. In seven major metro areas -- including New Orleans, Houston, Seattle and Los Angeles -- the number of rooms under construction has at least doubled over the past year, according to Smith Travel Research.

Paul Whetsell, chief executive of Loews Hotels, says his company is looking to buy about half a dozen properties this year, up from last year when Loews bought two hotels and started construction on two others.

But he thinks that prices in some cities are starting to look stretched. "Valuations in major markets are getting a little frothy," he says. "That is particularly so in gateway cities like San Francisco and New York."

Values of hotels typically rebound faster than other property types during an economic recovery because they can raise rates on a daily basis. Office and retail landlords, on the other hand, often have a harder time capitalizing on a recovery because they are locked into long-term leases.

Of course, hotels also are more vulnerable than other property types to a down market for the same reason. But some real-estate investors and analysts say the trends in the hotel market look better now than they did during the previous run-up.

PKF Hospitality Research forecasts that revenue per room, a popular hotel performance metric, will continue to rise at about double the 2.9% long-term average. If PKF's forecast is right, that would mean six consecutive years of so-called revpar growth of at least 5.4% through 2015.

Even with the recent pickup in sales activity, hotels still yield more than other property types. At the end of last year, the average initial yield on sales, known as the capitalization rate, was 8.2%, according to Real Capital Analytics. Such returns -- which fall as prices rise -- look particularly attractive in a low-interest-rate environment. By comparison, retail and office cap rates were around 7%.

Foreign investors, which were bit players in the U.S. hotel market during the previous boom, have become active buyers in major metro areas. Jones Lang LaSalle projects Asian and Middle Eastern buyers alone will spend about $3 billion on U.S. hotels this year, up 36% from 2013 and more than double the 2012 total.

For example, an Abu Dhabi sovereign-wealth fund paid nearly $300 million last year for one of Atlanta's largest hotels, the Marriott Marquis. On Monday, a hotel company led by Singaporean billionaire Kwek Leng Beng agreed to buy the Novotel New York Times Square for $274 million.

Some players are taking advantage of the hot market by making for the exit. Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc., which had been selling on average about $350 million of properties a year since 2009, is looking to step up that pace now and raise about $3 billion from hotel sales by the end of 2016.

The company says it is doing this because of growing buyer demand, a pickup in bank lending to prospective buyers and a strong outlook for global travel. "I'm not sure I could see a better environment to explore an asset sale," says Simon Turner, Starwood president of global development.

UK tech start-ups' time has come; TECHNOLOGY; News analysis

But there are risks the momentum will fizzle and concerns over short-termism, writes Sally Davies

Unlike in Silicon Valley, UK tech start-ups rarely ascend to the heights of multibillion-dollar valuations.

But with Google's acquisition this month of London-based artificial intelligence group DeepMind for 400m , followed by Zynga's swoop on graphics company NaturalMotion for more than $500m, UK techies are talking about the country's next unsung heroes.

"The quality of raw engineering talent you get in Europe, especially in London and Cambridge, is on a par with the best in the Valley," says Debu Purkayastha, an ex-Google M&A executive who has joined venture capital group Octopus Ventures.

The UK's start-ups can have "the DNA of a consumer-savvy Swedish product manager, an Israeli data scientist, a Cambridge or Finnish engineer, a commercially astute London marketer".

The five companies below are examples of early stage companies in areas of strength for the UK.

"Clusters reflect the local economy and the universities," says Joanna Shields, chairman of public body Tech City UK and a non-executive director at the London Stock Exchange. She says financial technology is an area where London is poised to excel.

There are risks that the momentum will fizzle. Hiram Samel, a professor at Oxford university's Sad business school, warns that laisser-faire venture capital markets, and funding which prioritises new technology over market need, can promote short-termism.

"This overstimulates short-term innovation - so we get thousands of app builders - but does less for the long-term, more complex innovation that yields national competitive advantage and local employment and growth."

When you swallow a pill you probably care more about the ingredients that are inside than the casing that holds them in. But such "encapsulation" is a $40bn market, say the founders of Aqdot - a group founded by researchers at Cambridge university.

Aqdot's technology consists of making tiny droplets for carrying chemicals that can then be released in response to specific triggers - including temperature, pressure, water and acidity. The end result is like "many different knots that you can untie one by one," says co-founder and chemist Roger Coulston.

The applications for Aqdot's capsules range from agriculture to pharmaceuticals. Mr Coulston gives the example of "smart pesticides" that can be scattered over a field but only be activated in response to light and temperature conditions that are favourable to particular weeds - which would avoid the problem of overdosing crops .

Aqdot's approach involves "shrink-wrapping" a substance over chemicals at room temperature, which lets the capsule capture a greater range of active ingredients, use far less material and deliver more concentrated doses.

Mr Coulston founded the group in 2012 with his wife and fellow chemist Jing Zhang. They were working in different research labs under two senior academics.

If Sherlock Holmes and a Google web-crawler had a baby, it might look something like Anomaly 42 - a new set of software applications that are all about finding unexpected connections between big bundles of information .

Founded by a group of fraud investigators and technology consultants, Anomaly 42 claims to allow "organisations to understand the archaeology of their data", says chief executive Laurence Shaw. He is also a partner of FusionAI, the private equity group that funded the start-up.

The company recently ran a test of the payday loan market for the Financial Conduct Authority by connecting data in company filings and other internal documents with information in the public domain. "We found some shocking revelations," says Mr Shaw. His team found examples of a major UK high street bank being indirect shareholders of payday loan groups, to the order of owning 5 to 7 per cent of those payday loan companies via shell companies, securitised instruments and complex agency agreements.

Anomaly 42's technology will let a company dump files - from PDFs to spreadsheets to SAP databases - into a big pool. Algorithms sift through and find links within that pool, and match them against 160 external data sources, including the FBI's most-wanted list.

There is a first time for everything - including performing an appendectomy, fixing a cleft palate or reconstructing a breast. It is a discomfiting thought for anyone who has been under the knife.

"There's an old adage in surgery, which is 'see one, do one and teach one'," says 29-year-old Jean Nehme, a London-based plastic surgeon. "But it's not really the best way to train."

Thankfully, as in so many areas of life, there is an app for that. Last year Mr Nehme and his co-founders launched Touch Surgery, a smartphone and tablet app which helps doctors learn the steps for procedures using 3D visualisations of the human body.

While most people think of surgery as being about the deft use of one's hands, Mr Nehme says 75 per cent of the skills required are cognitive, such as visual and pattern recognition. Touch Surgery's app can help new and practised doctors acquire these skills, and the data collected from surgeons using the app will allow Touch Surgery to improve the training. With a few swipes, the user is guided where to make incisions and how to remove organs. They can test themselves at each step against a choice of tools and parts of the body.

Hospital budget cuts and the need for doctors to keep abreast of a rapidly advancing medical technology prompted Mr Nehme and his co-founders to start Touch Surgery, which has been downloaded 160,000 times since it was launched last year.

It was just before 2pm. Laurence Aderemi was standing in the driving rain in "crack alley" - the nickname of a sketchy street in central London - with 1,000.

He was waiting to enter a cybercaf to use a money transfer service to send money back to his mother in Nigeria, who had recently had a stroke.

It was the closest spot that he could find to Google's London headquarters, where he worked. This was the moment, Mr Aderemi says, when he came up with the idea for his business, which he has subsequently left Google to work on.

Immigrants who globally sent back $529bn worth of remittances in 2012 have had to endure similar hardships.

Mr Aderemi's app, called Moni, aims to help them transfer money quickly and cheaply using a mobile phone.

Moni Technologies, which is part of the TechStars accelerator programme and launches in March, has developed relationships with cross-border payment providers to let people transfer money across 100 countries.

Because the company does not have to siphon off funds to players in a retail network, it is able to charge approximately one-third of the amount that is charged by banks and money transfer companies.

"I realised for big companies, they're not incentivised to reduce cost," says Mr Aderemi.

"Even if we had one per cent of the market, we would still be a small fly on a big elephant's back."

It looks like a squishy grey piano, with keys that curve up smoothly like short-bread wafers lying side by side under a sheet. But the ethos of the Seaboard, the first product from east London start-up Roli, is more complex than it first seems, says founder Roland Lamb.

"Both our minds and computers are incredibly fast, but what connects the two is very problematic," says Mr Lamb. He points to the contrast between typing on a keypad, on the one hand, with how a violinist uses their instrument. "We want to apply those principles of muscle memory and subconscious com-putation to speed up how we input info-mation into computers," he says.

From a converted space under two railway arches in Haggerston, Roli's team of engineers, materials scientists and musicians have designed and manufactured soft sensors made from polymers. When integrated as keys on the Seaboard, these devices let musicians control features of sound - such as loudness - using pressure and finger movement.

Before founding the company in 2009, Mr Lamb, an accomplished pianist, studied Chinese and Sanskrit philosophy at Harvard, lived in a Buddhist monastery and completed a design degree at Royal College of Art. He thinks Roli's technology has applications beyond music, in areas such as mobile technology and robotics.

Marex Spectron Launches LME Speculative Positioning Report; Broker's Weekly Report Will Contain Estimates for Each of the Exchange Base Metals

Commodities brokerage Marex Spectron said Tuesday it has launched the first speculative positioning report for London Metal Exchange base metals, providing up-to-date estimates on the status of the exchange positions each week.

The reports will be published every Monday morning, based on estimates of market positions at close of business each preceding Friday, the broker said.

The company said its data is derived from a proprietary algorithm and based solely on publicly available data from the London metals bourse. It added it will offer a full historical record of estimates going back to 1993.

The reports, which are also available in Chinese, will contain estimates for each of the LME base metals, with information such as net speculative positions and historical positions.

The LME metals are copper, aluminum, zinc, nickel, lead and tin. The broker released its first report along with its announcement Tuesday.

"The ability to have an accurate assessment of what speculators are doing on a regular basis is an important part of any risk management process," said Guy Wolf, Global Head of Market Analytics at Marex Spectron.

"Our estimates of speculative positioning are already widely followed in the base metals market but this is the first time we have formalised them in a weekly report. As such, this fills an important information gap on the exchange."

In October, the chief executive of Hong Kong Exchange and Clearing Ltd.--the LME's owner said it is only a "matter of time" before the London Metal Exchange begins working toward publishing data on the speculative wagers made by traders on its platform.

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission has long required U.S. commodity exchanges to release periodic batches of anonymous trader positioning data, offering the market a window into the way banks, hedge funds, producers and manufacturers are betting on prices. The commission publishes its Commitment of Traders report on various commodities markets weekly.

But the LME answers primarily to the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority, which doesn't require the same disclosures as its U.S. counterpart.

The LME said Tuesday it is "currently in dialogue with market participants on the desired format of a Commitment-of-Traders-style report."

"The resultant report will be distributed in due course, once the necessary technical work has been undertaken," a spokeswoman for the exchange said.

CIO Network (A Special Report) --- Information Security? What Security? Ted Schlein on how corporate networks are not nearly as secure as companies think they are

Investors may not always like what they hear from venture capitalist Ted Schlein. For example, the general partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers says companies are fooling themselves if they think they can keep hackers out of their networks. He and Scott Thurm, Wall Street Journal senior deputy technology editor, discussed Web security and other topics. Edited excerpts follow.

MR. THURM: The entrepreneurs you're seeing who are interested in the enterprise space, what are they bringing to you these days?

MR. SCHLEIN: I'd say there are four big areas going on in enterprise software right now.

Everybody loves to talk about big data this, big data that. I don't think big data is all that interesting. I think important data is very interesting. How do you take the fact that 90% of the data created in the world today is completely unstructured, that we can gather gobs and gobs of it, more so than we've ever been able to do before. We've built layers of infrastructure to handle it. But how would we make it pertinent to you, to you, to you, to you, to do your job? And that's going to spawn a whole new set of apps.

Another area being worked on a lot is the re-architecture of pretty much all your work flows. The mundane tasks going on in your organizations today are being redone, and that's going to be done in this brand new SaaS architecture. [Software as a service is industry shorthand for corporate software delivered from shared computers over the Internet, rather than on a company's own computers.]

That, by the way, is being enabled by the third main area, which is the re-architecture of your data centers. And this is my way of saying the cloud, I suppose. It will be the virtualization and re-architecture of your data centers so you can modernize them, i.e., make them more flexible, more cost-efficient, turn them into your own clouds.

Then finally, kind of my pet project, which is to make your organization safe, and new technologies in the world of security. We're seeing innovation for those areas at a very rapid scale, quite honestly, faster than I've seen it in my previous 17 years.

MR. THURM: Can you foresee a time where we think we have secure online enterprises?

MR. SCHLEIN: I don't think it's a battle you necessarily win. It's one you try and just get to a draw on. Your best days are when the bad guys go elsewhere.

MR. THURM: So every big retailer but Target succeeded over Christmas because the hackers got Target?

MR. SCHLEIN: No, no. Look, I'm a firm believer there are only two kinds of companies -- those that have been breached and know it, and those that have been breached and don't know it. Most of what we do in security is around prevention, prevention, prevention. Great. Just know it won't work. Know that they're going to get in. You ought to be thinking, "Hey, I want to find out where they are as fast as humanly possible, contain it and remediate it."

MR. THURM: What do you think of valuations in the Valley now?

MR. SCHLEIN: I guess I have to believe in efficient capital markets at some point or another. And look, there are times where the valuations favor the entrepreneurs, and times where they favor the investor. Private valuations trail public stock markets by usually about six months. So you're not going to see private valuations go down until the public stock market comes way down.

When you see a company that's doing $500,000 in revenue valued at over $200 million, don't ask me to come up with some discounted cash-flow model to prove that one out. There's no proving it. But it's what the market demands today.

MR. THURM: How does this environment feel to you compared to 1999-2000?

MR. SCHLEIN: First of all, we call that a boom. There were lots of great companies created out of those times. But there are some stark differences. The companies that are able to reach the capital markets [today] actually have pretty significant businesses where there's a profit and loss you can look at. If you go back to '98 and '99, there were companies putting way too much risk on the public markets with no real discernible business.

The other thing is, a decade and a half ago, companies were not able to grow anywhere near as fast as they can today.

If you just look at the number of devices that you can now access the Internet from, you're able to grow these companies in a much more rapid fashion, have a much larger addressable marketplace, thus leading to why you're also seeing valuation inflation.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Fidelity remains cautious on European stocks; Fund focus

Fund manager believes the continent is 'ripe for a pullback', says Bradley Gerrard

Sam Morse, Fidelity's cautious European fund manager, describes Europe as "ripe for a pullback", after he missed out on some of the market's rallies last year.

His 2.5bn Fidelity European fund lagged behind rival funds in 2013. The relatively defensive portfolio failed to capitalise on a mounting consensus that the worst of Europe's economic woes were behind it.

A "pullback" in the region's market rises would help to vindicate the manager's stance , but he also stresses that his investors are not unsatisfied with his recent performance.

"It is ironic that I would describe 2013 as a nightmare year for me but our customers have been quite happy with the absolute returns during the year," he says.

European shares rose by just under 23 per cent last year in sterling terms, according to index data from FE Analytics, while Fidelity European gained just 17.4 per cent.

The lacklustre year followed a stellar 2012 in which Mr Morse's focus on income-generating stocks saw him outpace the market.

"Part of the [2013] underperformance is related to the market environment where lots of companies I own have delivered what we would expect in total shareholder returns but they did not enjoy the sort of re-rating other stocks did," he says.

He cites BNP Paribas, the French bank, as an example of a positive performer that was outpaced by others he did not own, such as Crdit Agricole and Commerzbank. Swiss confectioner Nestl also delivered a positive but not spectacular return, he says.

Mr Morse suffered setbacks in small, individual positions last year. Saipem, the Italian oil services company, issued a profit warning in January and cut its dividend, triggering a share price rout.

"I sold the stock but it had done quite a bit of damage to the portfolio," Mr Morse says.

Tobacco product group Swedish Match reported a fall in market share - something Mr Morse says is a "temporary phenomenon". This contributed to a share price fall from $35 in January last year to $30 last month.

Overall, Mr Morse urges investors in European shares to remain cautious.

"My personal view is that the market is ripe for a pullback on the grounds of external shock, but the continent is a bit better placed now than it was 18 months ago as we have made progress on the economic front," he says.

"Exuberance is difficult to measure but markets were very strong in 2013 even though we did not really see earnings or dividend growth.

"We tend to look at those fundamentals and the stock market tends to look forward, which means rising share prices might be an anticipation of growth and dividends, but I am a bit concerned the market may have got ahead of itself."

He points to director share dealing - which companies are obliged to report to the stock market - as a potential sign the top of the market may be present.

"Something else I have picked up on recently, which is a bit disturbing, is that I have looked at director selling and buying, and selling picked up in December and January," he says.

"They are not always right and not necessarily the best predictors of future earnings growth but lots of directors are saying people have become over-optimistic about earnings growth going forward, so the shares look a bit high.

"So it looks like a good time to cash some of that in."

Commercial Property -- The Commish / Inside the Brokerage Biz: Law Firms Woo Bloomberg's Best, Brightest

75%: How much land sales in the New York region rose in 2013 from 2012

The changing of the guard at City Hall from Michael Bloomberg to Bill de Blasio set off a scrum among New York's law firms for the top legal minds of the outgoing administration.

Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson just came up with a big score: David Karnovsky, the general counsel of the Department of City Planning. Mr. Karnovsky, who has been at City Planning for the past 15 years, will start at Fried Frank in early March.

Fried Frank's real estate practice, built largely by Jonathan Mechanic, is the largest in the city with 50 attorneys and big-name clients such as Related Cos., Brookfield Office Properties and Park Tower Realty.

In the crucial area of land use and zoning, though, Fried Frank has had to share the spotlight. Other firms regularly tapped by developers to usher projects through the government labyrinth include Kramer Levin LLP, Bryan Cave LLP, and Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP.

Kramer Levin, which has 47 attorneys in its real estate group, also wooed Mr. Karnovsky.

"We did talk to him and were very disappointed when he didn't come with us," said Jay Neveloff, Kramer Levin's real estate chair .

Huge fees have always been at stake in the competition for top talent. Mr. Neveloff said Kramer Levin's land-use division generated more than 40% of the firm's $50 million in total real estate billings in 2013. The firm's clients include Gary Barnett, one of the city's most active developers.

But recruiting the best and the brightest land-use attorneys is particularly important these days when the development business is expected to pick up. Land sales in the New York region rose 75% in 2013 from 2012, according to Real Capital Analytics.

There's also a generational shift taking place in the real-estate legal world. Kramer Levin's Samuel Lindenbaum, one of the top land-use lawyers in the city, died in 2012 at the age of 77. Other lawyers who have achieved the level of senior statesmen include Leonard Boxer at Stroock, Martin Edelman at Paul Hastings and Benjamin Needell at Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom.

"There's a generation that's reached chronological maturity," said Mr. Edelman. "We're not fading out gracefully. We're heavily engaged but in a quieter way."

City government has traditionally been a breeding ground for top real-estate lawyers. But there are rules making sure that, once in private practice, lawyers don't have undue influence.

Lawyers are barred for one year from doing any work with the agency where they last served. Also, they are barred for life from working on any issue that they were personally involved with during their time in government.

That hasn't dimmed their appeal. Fried Frank also has Melanie Meyers, the planning department's general counsel from 1994 to 1998, and Stephen Lefkowitz, who worked as an adviser to Nelson Rockefeller.

Ross Moskowitz, who heads the land-use practice at Stroock, was a former executive vice president at the city's Economic Development Corp.

Mr. Mechanic, at Fried Frank, said being able to recruit someone such as Mr. Karnovsky is invaluable.

"You're sitting at the table with somebody you know has the best perspective," Mr. Mechanic said.

What is one realistic financial resolution people can make for the coming year?

Start Tracking Every Dollar You Spend

By consistently tracking your spending -- every dollar -- this becomes the starting point for other good financial habits such as setting and adhering to a budget, regular savings and maximizing efficiency in your spending.

-- Greg McBride, senior vice president, chief financial analyst, Bankrate.com

The 1% Secret to Getting Richer

Increase your savings rate by 1% this year, then do the same thing next year. And the year after that. If you start when you get your first job, you'll be saving at a good pace well before you hit the peak earning years of your career.

-- Mike Piper, CPA, author, blogger

Create an Emergency Plan

Create a document instructing your spouse, children or trusted adviser on what to do if you are suddenly unable to manage your finances. Having an emergency plan helps to ensure your finances are managed the way you would like them to be. It creates one less worry for your spouse or children at a time when they will be stressed. It gives you a blueprint when you are worried about what the market is doing and are unsure of what the best long-term decision is.

-- Charles Rotblut, vice president, American Association of Individual Investors

The Savings Plan You Won't Even Notice

When you get a raise, set aside half of it to fund your retirement savings, create a rainy-day fund or contribute to your kid's 529 plan. Because it's money you don't have today, you probably won't even notice.

-- Matt Hougan, president, ETF analytics and global head of editorial for IndexUniverse LLC

Three Ways to Keep Resolutions

Reward yourself when you do something difficult. Dina Pomeranz shows us how to make not-spending fun with a saving buddy you text/email every time you move toward your goal. Set up a low-cost online savings account with a motivating title ("My Reward Fund"), and put any change you have toward it. It'll add up.

Make it easy on yourself. Put every bill you can on autopay, including the bill for your own retirement. Log on to your retirement-savings website and bump up your pension contributions enough to get your full employer match.

Invest in financial literacy. It'll pay you the rest of your life.

-- Olivia S. Mitchell, professor of business economics and public policy, Wharton School

What's your advice for people re-entering the housing market for the first time since the crash?

Can You Actually Afford It?

I urge my clients to look at home purchase from a financial-planning perspective and ask themselves if they can realistically afford the home they want. Meet with your financial adviser to review the numbers. Ask yourself: How will this investment affect my financial plan and the other savings goals I have in place? If I lost my job, how many months of emergency reserves do I have set aside to pay my mortgage?

-- Michelle Perry Higgins financial planner and principal, California Financial Advisors

It's Not an Investment

Think of a house as a home, not an investment. Whatever home-price appreciation you see over time does not equate to profit. If you're lucky, the financial benefits of Homeownership will rebate some of your costs, unlike renting. But paying interest, taxes, insurance, maintenance, dues and assessments make it a very cash-intensive proposition.

-- Greg McBride

Too Many Buy When They Should Rent

Too many hardworking individuals feel pressured to buy when renting may be the best financial option for the stage of life they are in. Wait to buy until you can comfortably put 20% down, plan to live there at least five years, and the purchase price is such that your costs (mortgage, property tax, insurance, upkeep) are no more than a third of your take-home pay.

-- Manisha Thakor, founder, chief executive, MoneyZen Wealth Management LLC

Buy Less Than You Can Afford

Your property taxes and home-insurance premiums are going to rise at an unknown rate. You will also have to budget for future repairs and unexpected nonhousing expenses (e.g., an illness). Your future salary may end up being more or less than you expect. Treat a house as an asset that gives you a roof over your head and a place to call home.

-- Charles Rotblut

Rules for Buying a House

Make sure you expect to live in that area for five to seven years, make sure the monthly payment fits comfortably within your budget, etc. The financial crisis serves to remind us all that there is no guarantee that residential housing always appreciates in value. Be careful about older houses, houses that have marginal locations, etc. Try to buy moderately priced houses in solid neighborhoods with good schools.

-- Larry D. Zimpleman

Aside from fees, what's the best way for individuals to assess a potential financial adviser?

Your Adviser Should See Risk as You Do

The most important thing is whether the adviser's view of risk and reward is identical to yours. If you are risk averse, make sure they share your point of view. If you believe in long-term, asset-allocation strategies, make sure they are in sync with that.

-- Larry D. Zimpleman

An SEC Filing That Is Very Revealing

Read the adviser's Form ADV Part 2. This is a form that advisers must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission or with the state in which they are registered. It tells you all sorts of information about the adviser, in plain English. You can learn everything about the adviser""s compensation. You can learn about the adviser's investment philosophy. You can check whether the adviser offers services that are a good fit for your needs. Often, if you have several advisers you're considering, their ADV Part 2 brochures will be a quick way to rule out some and develop questions to ask the others.

To get an adviser's Form ADV Part 2 brochure, you can contact them and request it or look up the firm's form on the SEC Investment Adviser Search website.

-- Mike Piper

What to Ask

Beyond doing a background check (contact your state regulators, do a search on brokercheck.finra.org and adviserinfo.sec.gov, confirm credentials with the certifying organization, and then do a Google search on the adviser's name to see what comes up), talk to potential advisers about their management style. What type of investments do they personally favor? Do they like to be more aggressive or more conservative? How often can you expect to hear from them? Do they send out regular emails or newsletters? If you call with a question, will you get to speak to them or will you be directed to assistants instead? How quickly can you expect a response under normal circumstances?

A good adviser will be willing to give you the answers you don't want to hear. A bad adviser will smile and tell you what you want to hear even when he or she knows it isn't true.

-- Charles Rotblut

Be Wary If They Dismiss Index Funds

Make sure they have a fiduciary duty to act in your best interests. Then, ask them what they think about index funds. They don't have to be index-fund zealots, but if they think that active management still works in all areas of the markets, they are selling you a pile of goods.

-- Matt Hougan

Wealth Management (A Special Report) --- Investors See Advantage in Diverse Board: Advisers say more clients want to put money in companies that promote women

By Corrie Driebusch

Some investors have found a new cause: promoting a bigger role for women on corporate boards and in corner offices.

"We are seeing more demand for values-based investments that use a gender lens," says Jackie VanderBrug, senior vice president at U.S. Trust's portfolio analytics, consulting and institutional group. "We're seeing a set of folks saying, 'These are my values, this is the world I want to live in.' They are saying, 'Why wouldn't we take this into account?'"

Advisers who say this is a viable investment strategy cite several studies, including research by Credit Suisse Group AG and Catalyst -- a nonprofit dedicated to expanding opportunities for women in business -- that have found a positive link between female board representation and company performance.

But others warn that investors who limit their investment options this way risk missing out on better returns available elsewhere.

Most so-called socially responsible, or socially conscious, investing is aimed at steering money away from the shares of companies that don't meet the investor's environmental or ethical standards. For instance, some people won't invest in tobacco companies, citing health concerns, or in oil companies because of worries about the impact of fossil fuels on the environment.

Jason Katz, a New York-based financial adviser with UBS Wealth Management Americas, says that last year, for the first time in his 20-year career, clients started asking him about diversity on corporate boards, particularly with respect to women.

The interest, he says, stems from the idea that if everyone has the same background, they may also have very similar viewpoints. The theory goes that diversity brings disruption and can lead to better ideas, he says.

As a result, he has become more conscious of the board makeup, as well as female representation in top management positions, at the companies in his clients' portfolios. However, he isn't ready to make the presence or absence of women in powerful positions the deciding factor in selecting investments.

"I'm putting much greater weighting on other criteria," he says. "There's not enough data to sink my teeth into" concerning the effect of gender diversity on companies' performance, he says.

There is some data, though. One commonly cited study was conducted by the Credit Suisse Research Institute. The report, published in 2012, said that in the previous six years, the shares of companies with at least some female board representation outperformed those of companies with no women on the board.

For example, it found that for companies with market capitalization of more than $10 billion, the share prices of those with women board members outperformed the share prices of those without women board members by 26% over the six years. For smaller companies, the shares of those with women on the board outperformed the shares of those without women by 17%.

A study by Catalyst published in 2011 found that Fortune 500 companies with three or more female board members in at least four of five years significantly outperformed those with no female board members in at least four of five years. To measure performance, the study looked at return on sales, return on invested capital and return on equity.

One problem for those who want to focus their investing on gender-diverse companies is that there are very few products set up for that purpose. In the past year or so, though, some advisers have tried to fill that hole.

For instance, U.S. Trust launched the Women and Girls Equality Strategy last year. The firm examines companies in the Standard & Poor's 1500 index -- which includes large-cap, midcap and small-cap companies -- using several criteria, including what percentages of each company's board, management and workforce are female. Other criteria include whether employees have access to on-site child care.

U.S. Trust clients can invest in the strategy through specially managed accounts. Later this year, the strategy will be available to all Merrill Lynch clients. (U.S. Trust and Merrill Lynch & Co. are units of Bank of America Corp.)

The Women and Girls Equality Strategy currently has $5.9 million in client assets and returned 33% in 2013 net of fees, a U.S. Trust spokeswoman says. That matches the 33% gain in the S&P 1500 last year.

Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management created the Parity Portfolio, launched in December 2012, which holds between 20 and 30 companies that have a minimum of three women on their corporate boards. Morgan Stanley declined to provide the total of assets under management or performance for the Parity Portfolio.

"We have two clear objectives," says Eve Ellis, a New York-based Morgan Stanley financial adviser and co-founder of the portfolio. "One is to make money for investors and the other is to make a social impact by getting more women on boards."

Ms. Ellis says she realizes there will be some detractors because of concerns about the limitations on the portfolio's investment options, but the studies that have been done give her confidence in the strategy. "To me the research is there that shows more-diverse boards have stronger financials," she says. "Why are companies having such a hard time embracing something when the evidence is there?"

Fund assets on track to hit $100tn by 2020

Banks are not short of enemies at the moment. Their biggest threat is not the public, the media, politicians or regulators however, but rather investment managers.

The consultancy PwC has predicted a meteoric rise in assets under management in the global fund industry, from $64tn today to well over $100tn in 2020, providing fund groups with better access to the regulatory and political corridors of power than banks and insurance companies.

"The political leverage banks have enjoyed over the past 10 years will no doubt turn to asset managers," says Rob Mellor, an asset management partner at PwC, which has this week published a report examining the future of asset management.

The consultancy predicts that European banks alone will experience a capital shortfall of more than $380bn in the next five years, enabling fund groups to fill this vacuum.

"Asset managers will grow to take centre stage and push into shadow banking activity, and banks will become more like utilities," Mr Mellor adds.

PwC's estimates are based on predictions for global gross domestic product growth, ageing pension populations and the generational shift of wealth, particularly in emerging economies.

Mr Mellor believes asset managers have also learnt from banks' mistakes when it comes to explaining their "social purpose and value" to policy makers, and are therefore more likely to avoid harsh regulatory crackdowns.

"Asset managers want to be on the front foot and engage in discussions around their social purpose and value and what they add to the economy, rather than scrabbling around as [economic and regulatory change] happens," he says.

Mr Mellor acknowledges, however, that the anticipated surge in assets under management will create "mega-managers" that are likely to be considered systemically important and subject to increased levels of scrutiny.

But he believes this additional burden is more than offset by the increased fee income and profitability that global scale will bring to large fund houses.

Jake Moeller, a fund analyst at Lipper, the data provider, agrees that large managers are likely to benefit. He says: "The 25 best-selling funds in 2013 constituted nearly 50 per cent of all net flows in Europe. I don't see this sort of pattern changing."

But he adds that irrespective of size, "groups with a high degree of sophistication in their distribution analytics are likely to prosper".

Much of the asset growth is expected to come from South America, Asia, Africa and the Middle East, which could account for 34 per cent of global assets under management by 2020, up from 10 per cent today, the consultancy predicts.

Fast-growing fund companies from these regions could consequently overtake many global fund groups, according to PwC. Mr Mellor points out that Asian banks now represent 50 per cent of the 10 biggest banks globally. He expects a similar dynamic to emerge in asset management, particularly among Chinese fund companies such as Harvest.

The biggest winners from the exponential growth of assets, meanwhile, are likely to be fund groups with a foothold in the passive fund industry; PwC estimates that allocations from retail and institutional investors to passive funds will triple over the next five years.

The surging popularity of passive funds will be driven by the growing global push for increased fee transparency following the introduction of rules that aim to make fees more transparent for retail investors in the UK, the Netherlands, India and Australia. Germany, Italy, Switzerland and South Africa are planning similar rules.

Mr Mellor says: "We are really starting to see a lot more focus on fee transparency for end investors emerge at a European level and that will become a trend across the globe by 2020.

"As that rolls out, managers will develop more low-cost products that are easy for investors to access, and increasingly pension funds will [be drawn to] the low-cost aspect of them."

Alternative fund providers offering private equity, property or hedge funds are also expected to experience bumper growth, doubling their AUM in the same timeframe. Actively managers, by contrast, will see assets in mutual funds and institutional mandates rise by 25 to 30 per cent.

This leaves diehard active fund houses, such as MFS in the US or the UK's Aberdeen Asset Management, in a quandary. Should they stick to their active guns, where their traditional expertise lies, or venture into the faster-growing passive industry through acquisitions or organic growth?

"Passive is here to stay," Mr Mellor responds. "I predict that passive will become a core part of all of the mega-managers' global product ranges."

The flipside for asset management groups is that the growing focus on transparency and costs comes hand in hand with aggressive pricing, which is putting pressure on fees for active fund managers as well. "Yes it is great that assets will gather [in passive funds], but it puts the asset management model under more pressure," says Mr Mellor.

Fitch, the rating agency, agrees. It says: "The industry may now increasingly be affected on the institutional side by the shift of investors towards passive investments and on the retail side by the concentration of distribution and the growing demand for low-cost solutions like exchange traded funds."

While the biggest fund companies can cope with this challenge and niche and nimble fund companies will continue to attract assets from large institutions, midsize fund groups are likely to be squeezed.

Mr Mellor says: "Mid-sized managers could get swamped if mega-managers start creating the products they sell, and it is hard to go from midsized to mega.

"Middle-size groups should either join a bigger platform and become part of a mega manager, or stay close to their knitting and redefine their purpose to clearly make their case to sovereign wealth funds."

Moody's Corp. said its fourth-quarter profit jumped 29% as its revenue grew, particularly in its structured finance segment.

The ratings and analytics company which relies on its debt-rating operation for the vast majority of its income had previously struck a cautious tone about its structured finance arm, which has been hit by softness in Europe.

Overall, Moody's posted income of $206.7 million, or 94 cents a share, up from $160.1 million, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a legacy tax benefit, earnings were 85 cents a share, from 70 cents a share a year ago.

Revenue improved 3.3% to $779.2 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were looking for earnings of 76 cents a share on $744 million in revenue.

Moody's Investors Service, the company's ratings business and its biggest contributor to the top line, posted 0.7% higher revenue to $522.8 million.

Within that business, corporate finance revenue, edged down 0.9%, reflecting a contraction in U.S. bond issuance against a strong prior-year period, the company said.

Structured finance revenue rose 5.7% on strong growth in the U.S., which offset declines in the segment's international business.

Financial institutions revenue rose 3%.

Moody'sAnalytics revenue rose 9% to $256.4 million.

For 2014, the company forecast earnings of $3.90 to $4 a share, compared with analysts' estimate of $3.92 a share. Moody's expects revenue growth to be in the high single-digit range, versus analysts' estimate of 7% growth.

Aggreko slides as big sell order pre-empts results; LONDON

A big sell order sent Aggreko sliding, with one shareholder dumping about 2 per cent of the generator hire group, writes Bryce Elder .

Aggreko lost 1.6 per cent to 15.48 on word that an institutional investor had sold 5m shares via Citigroup at 15.35 apiece.

The sale came a month ahead of Aggreko's full-year results, where the company is expected to caution that dollar strength has continued to affect orders for its emerging markets division, which provides more than half of group earnings. A tepid wider market left the FTSE up 0.1 per cent or 8.62 points at 6,457.89.

Tullow Oil led the risers, up 7.2 per cent to 849.5p on volume that was more than twice the daily average.

AB Foods rose a further 4.4 per cent to 28.83, a record high.

RSA Insurance gained 4.6 per cent to 103.6p as Tuesday's appointment of former RBS boss Stephen Hester as chief executive bolstered turnround hopes.

Leading the fallers, Hargreaves Lansdown dropped 10.2 per cent to 13.45 after its half-year earnings missed forecasts.

Canaccord "buy" advice led Ashmore , the emerging market debt specialist, to climb 5.3 per cent to 334.4p. Ashmore's bias towards institutional clients means it is likely to have weathered recent volatility better than competitors, while operating cash flow is protected by salary caps, said the broker.

Standard Life edged 0.3 per cent higher at 367.1p as analysts highlighted the continued resilient performance of its 17bn Global Absolute Return Strategies fund, counter to concerns that it was becoming unwieldy .

Retailer French Connection jumped 19.4 per cent to 43p after it raised its 2014 earnings guidance. But much of the gain came ahead of the update, with the lightly traded shares spiking in mid-morning after a 2m block changed hands at 40p apiece.

Ebiquity , the media and marketing analytics group, climbed 0.4 per cent to 122p. After the close, the private equity group Veronis Suhler Stevenson said it had sold its 40 per cent stake at 120p apiece through Numis Securities. The stock was understood to have been split between about 20 institutions, up to half of which were new to the register.

Investing in Funds & ETFs: A Monthly Analysis --- The Experts: Insights From Our Online Panel

The start of a new year is always a good time to re-evaluate one's financial strategies, and the new tax season brings tax concerns to the fore. We asked The Experts for investment ideas that tend to get overlooked and for tax tips for fund investors. The Experts are an exclusive online group of industry and thought leaders who comment on topics raised in the Investing in Funds & ETFs and Wealth Management reports. We also asked them to share some of the best -- and worst -- New Year's financial resolutions they've made. Edited excerpts follow. For more, visit WSJ.com/WealthReport.

What little-known investment should people turn to more often?

Best Long-Term Investment: Your Job

Your most important financial asset is your job, and even a small increase in your earning ability can make a huge difference. Imagine you are 30 and making $70,000 a year. If you get a 3% increase each year, by the time you're 65, you'll have made $4.2 million. Alternatively, what if you invest in some classes? What if you get your C.F.A., M.B.A. or some other degree? What if you can up your increases to 5% a year? Over that same period, you'll earn $6.3 million.

-- Matt Hougan, president of analytics and publications, ETF.com

Benefits of Commercial Real Estate

Consider real-estate investment trusts or possibly some commingled funds that invest in commercial real estate. This asset class is relatively easy to understand, tends to pay a high dividend and can generate additional return through capital appreciation. These types of investments might be especially appropriate for investors near and in retirement.

-- Larry D. Zimpleman, chairman, president and chief executive, Principal Financial Group

Small-Cap, Value-Oriented Stocks

Individuals' biggest advantage in the stock market comes from small, value-oriented stocks. Companies with market capitalizations of $1 billion or less.

First, small-cap value stocks have realized annualized long-term returns of 13.9%, according to the Ibbotson SBBI Classic Yearbook. This is more than 26% better than the long-term returns for large-cap value and more than 50% better than the long-term returns for small-cap growth and large-cap growth stocks.

Second, many institutional investors either cannot invest in companies below a certain size or are limited in how much they can allocate to small-cap stocks. These restrictions cause small-cap stocks to be mispriced more often since there are fewer people analyzing them. Mispricing can lead a stock to being undervalued.

Small-cap stocks aren't without their risks. However, there is still enough upside that it makes sense to consider small-cap, value-oriented stocks.

-- Charles Rotblut, vice president, American Association of Individual Investors

Muni-Bond Mutual Funds

Low-fee municipal-bond mutual funds. Traditionally municipal bonds have been viewed as an investment for people with high incomes. Today, the yield differential between tax-free interest income and taxable interest income benefits people in lower-income tax brackets as well.

-- Rick Ferri, founder, Portfolio Solutions LLC, author and blogger

Two Options for Emergency Savings

You can find federally insured accounts, often with very minimal opening deposits, on Bankrate.com. Another option is what is known as a high-yield, or rewards, checking account. These also carry federal deposit insurance and are completely liquid, but pay higher yields to account holders that are diligent about meeting the monthly requirements -- typically direct deposit, online statements and 10 debit-card transactions a month. The higher payout is typically capped at a balance of $20,000 or $25,000, but for savvy savers who are diligent about having a direct deposit that offsets the amount withdrawn through debit-card transactions, this option can provide a nice lift to the yield you'd otherwise earn on your cash.

What is your most important tax advice for mutual-fund investors?

How Fund Investors Blow It With Taxes

You still own mutual funds? Really? Are you still watching "Ghostbusters" on your Betamax? You shouldn't own mutual funds in taxable accounts. They are fine products for tax-deferred accounts. They play a key role in my retirement portfolio. But in taxable accounts, actively managed mutual funds are a tax disaster because each year they pay out billions of dollars in capital-gains distributions to their shareholders . . . gains on which you have to pay taxes.

-- Matt Hougan

Look at a Fund's Turnover Ratio

Pay attention to turnover ratio. This percentage figure tells you how much a portfolio has changed over the course of a year. While capital losses offset gains, net capital gains are distributed to investors, which is a taxable event.

-- Charles Rotblut

Don't Let Taxes Rule Investments

Avoid taking short-term capital gains on the sale of appreciated shares. If you're going to sell and don't have realized losses to offset a gain, wait for at least one year and one day to qualify for long-term capital-gain status on the sale. This will save you money on income taxes.

-- Rick Ferri

Focus on What Fund Goes Where

Where you park certain investments can enhance your tax efficiency and net returns, by putting higher-taxed collectibles such as precious-metals funds and income-producing bond funds in a tax-advantaged account, and holding those investments prone to long-term capital gains in a taxable account. Using any capital losses to offset short-term capital gains and up to $3,000 of income can also be a prudent strategy.

-- Greg McBride

Two Simple Ways to Keep More Gains

Taxes appear likely to rise in coming years. Tax-efficient mutual funds or the tax-advantaged structure of an exchange-traded fund are two simple ways to keep more investment gains.

-- Christian Magoon, founder, chief executive, YieldShares, an income-focused ETF sponsor

Look at Embedded Gains and Losses

The most important tax issue to be aware of when investing in mutual funds is the potential of an embedded gain. With the market heading into the fifth year of a bull market, many funds find themselves with potentially significant embedded gains; a big distribution can push an investor into a higher capital-gains tax bracket.

It is also worth noting that the pendulum can swing both ways. After a bear market, mutual funds may have embedded losses, reducing the exposure to capital-gains distributions for the foreseeable future and effectively improving the tax efficiency of holding the fund (though ultimately, any gains must still be reckoned with when ultimately sold).

Evaluating the prospective embedded gains (or losses) within a mutual fund is crucial.

-- Michael Kitces, partner and director of research, Pinnacle Advisory Group

Before Buying a Fund, Check This Date

If you are getting ready to make a mutual-fund purchase, check the mutual-fund company's website to learn its year-end distribution dates. You should delay the purchase after this date (called the ex-dividend date) to avoid paying more taxes on an investment you just made.

-- George Papadopoulos, fee-only wealth manager in Novi, Mich.

Your most and least successful New Year's financial resolutions?

Emotions Can Derail Resolutions

New Year's resolutions have often helped me get back to the basics of disciplined investing. One year, I resolved to review my investments once a quarter in order to be less concerned about market fluctuations. The resolution helped me refocus on my long-term investment plan.

One resolution that didn't turn out so well was to rebalance my portfolio after an especially strong year. To my surprise, I found myself emotionally attached to several top performers. That emotion led me to only halfheartedly rebalance my portfolio. The following year, several of the winners performed like losers and vice versa.

-- Christian Magoon

Ways to Change Investment Behavior

Every year, I try to improve the organizational part of my finances. I give thought to what mistakes I've made, where I've spent too much time pondering a decision, what I'm overlooking and what my behavioral tendencies are. Then I think about things I can do to alter my approach.

Some things are simple. I have reminders in my calendar to check my credit reports periodically. Others are systems and steps that evolve over time, such as the notes I keep regarding how I manage my portfolio. I keep a log of investing decisions. I maintain a list of my overall portfolio rules. I periodically update this list to account for anything I find that I haven't adequately clarified to myself.

If safeguards and systems are set up to help steer a person, change becomes easier. Start with one behavior (e.g., an annual reminder in your calendar to increase your retirement contributions 0.5 percentage point) and go from there. You'll be amazed at the long-term benefits.

-- Charles Rotblut

The Brutally Hard Resolution

By far and away the New Year's financial resolution that has had the biggest impact on my personal finances is to rebalance my portfolio to bring it back in line with my target asset allocation. Taking this step is psychologically brutal in that it requires you to sell by definition what has been "doing well" and to buy what has been lagging. Additionally, if you are doing this in your taxable accounts there are actual cash consequences when you realize gains that can create another psychological hurdle to get over.

That said, if you have done a solid job of assessing your current and future spending needs and have crafted an investment policy statement to support those needs -- you owe it to yourself to stick to your plan.

-- Manisha Thakor, founder and chief executive, MoneyZen Wealth Management LLC

'Don't Give Up'

In 2009, I resolved to write a book for women on personal finance, and handed it in to my editor that August. In 2010, I committed to getting a second property I owned ready for rental, and was able to take a nice depreciation deduction against rental income on my tax return the following April. At the top of my 2011 list was my intention to run a marathon. That October I finished the Marine Corps Marathon and raised $20,000 for the National Hospice Foundation.

All of these "successes" were also complete failures as resolutions go. Each of them had been on my New Year's list not just once, but again and again, as I had to carry them forward, unaccomplished in the previous year, to the next.

While I will still continue to put big, audacious goals on my annual resolution list, I have also learned to add these more humble additions: "Don't give up" and "Be patient."

Corporate News -- Microsoft CEO Choice: Opting for Continuity

By Shira Ovide and Spencer E. Ante

Microsoft Corp.'s directors could have anointed a visionary outsider to shake up a technology giant that has fallen behind. Instead, they have opted for a safe choice.

Directors are negotiating with 22-year company veteran Satya Nadella to succeed Chief Executive Steve Ballmer, according to a person familiar with the matter. If the board finalizes the pick in coming days, Mr. Nadella will become the third person to lead Microsoft since Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded the company in 1975.

Mr. Nadella has signaled a desire for continuity, telling directors that, as CEO, he hopes to lean on Mr. Gates, according to several people familiar with the matter. Little in Mr. Nadella's public history at Microsoft suggests he will break from the company's pattern as a fast follower, rather than a trend setter.

"It is clearly a safe pick," says Dan Fletcher, a research analyst at Neuberger Berman LLC's Large Cap Disciplined Growth, a Microsoft investor. Mr. Nadella's selection will disappoint those seeking "an outsider who would drive significant and bold change," he said.

That assessment could be short-lived, however. The job of CEO can embolden executives in unexpected ways. People who have worked with Mr. Nadella credit him with repairing technical glitches at Microsoft's Web-search service, disarming Silicon Valley technologists suspicious of the company and fostering collaboration in a turf-conscious workplace.

If he is named CEO, Mr. Nadella would inherit many advantages. Microsoft generated $27 billion in operating profit in the year ended June 30, and the company holds $84 billion in cash. Microsoft's Windows still runs roughly nine out of every 10 desktop and laptop computers in the world, and its Office and Exchange programs are corporate mainstays.

Most of Mr. Nadella's experience is in serving corporate customers -- the source of two-thirds of Microsoft profits -- which suggests the company may want to double down in that area. He has been a leading internal champion of Microsoft's efforts to rent computing power to other companies, even though that business competes with some of Microsoft's most-profitable products.

Some investors, including an activist firm that soon will have a Microsoft board seat, want Microsoft to focus on corporate software and think the company should shed consumer-oriented operations such as the Xbox videogame business and Bing search engine.

Messrs. Gates and Ballmer and some directors have resisted that course, arguing that lines are blurring between corporate and consumer technology.

Not long ago, Microsoft could afford to fall behind, then spend whatever was necessary to catch up. That's how it unseated Netscape Communications Corp. as the leading Internet browser in the 1990s.

Now, the game has changed. Microsoft is fighting on multiple fronts against well-heeled rivals. It must simultaneously compete with Apple Inc. in smartphones, Google Inc. in Web search, Amazon.com Inc.'s in Web-computing services, Oracle Corp. in databases, Salesforce.com Inc. in Internet-based corporate software and Sony Corp. in videogames, among others.

Mobile phones have been a particular problem. Microsoft's software is on fewer than 4% of smartphones world-wide. Its latest effort to extend its influence is a pending $7.3 billion deal to buy Nokia Corp.'s mobile-phone business, a bet on combining Microsoft's software with Nokia's hardware. That deal, struck just as Mr. Ballmer was cementing plans to step down, saddles Mr. Nadella with a new strategy and 32,000 new employees.

A look at Mr. Nadella's decisions in his current job -- leading the Microsoft division that makes technology to run corporate computer servers and other back-end technology -- reveals an executive who has been willing to buck Microsoft's traditions, to a point.

Mr. Nadella allowed outside developers to use non-Microsoft programming languages, popular with younger coders, on Microsoft's "cloud" service that rents computing power to others. Mr. Nadella's choice was "heretical," Bill Hilf, a former Microsoft manager who then worked in the cloud unit, said in late 2012.

Forrester Research analyst Ted Schadler credits Mr. Nadella with boosting sales and securing capital to build computer server farms that support the company's cloud business. "He's clearly a change agent," Mr. Schadler says.

The impact is measurable, if small by Microsoft standards: In the six months ended Dec. 31, Microsoft's revenue from computer technology and services sold over the Internet more than doubled to $1.1 billion.

In general, though, people who know or have worked with Mr. Nadella say he has followed Microsoft's conservative catch-up playbook, rather than make breakaway bets on new technology.

In 2009, he led Microsoft's effort to revamp Bing to better compete with Google. The new version was technologically adroit, but little different than Google, which remains the dominant search engine. Microsoft executives shy away from discussing market share in search, preferring to refer to Bing as the company's "Big Data engine."

At the cloud unit, Mr. Nadella shifted direction of a product that he called too bold, to make it conform more closely to Amazon's market-leading Web-services offerings. That boosted demand for the floundering Microsoft Web service, but also left an opening for rivals like Salesforce to make their own innovations.

A Microsoft spokesman said the company added additional capabilities to meet market demand.

Jeremy Howard, an entrepreneur now running computer-data firm Strategic Data Science, said Mr. Nadella's shift was sensible, but betrayed a lack of confidence in Microsoft's engineering prowess.

"The old Microsoft would have been, 'We have the best platform here, we'll keep trying,'" he said.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Jupiter's Financial Opportunities fund rallies; Fund focus

Manager 'excited' after refocusing on fundamentals, writes Nick Reeve

Guy de Blonay, the financials stockpicker, says he is excited about the prospects for the once-great Jupiter Financial Opportunities fund after years of lacklustre returns.

The manager says he has "rarely been so pleased" with the 536m portfolio since he became a named manager in 2010, hailing a decision to refocus the fund on his bread-and-butter interest in company fundamentals , rather than macroeconomic factors.

He says he is "excited about the prospects unfolding" for the portfolio, which returned 792 per cent in the 13 years to June 2010 under former manager Philip Gibbs.

The fund was one of the driving forces behind Jupiter's long-term transition from a small, London-based "fund boutique" focusing on wealthy private clients to a European asset management brand.

Swiss-born Mr de Blonay was a protg of macroeconomic guru Mr Gibbs in the early years of his career, before joining the now-defunct New Star Asset Management in 2001 to take on his own financials funds.

After New Star was sold in 2009, Mr de Blonay returned to Jupiter, becoming a named co-manager with Mr Gibbs on Financial Opportunities in June 2010.

But Mr Gibbs's focus on investing based on macro factors dominated the fund and after the credit crunch he remained defensively positioned, missing out on much of the post-2009 market rallies.

During the period the two managers ran the fund, from June 2010 to when Mr Gibbs stepped down in October 2011, it lost 19.1 per cent versus an MSCI AC Financials index loss of just 7.6 per cent in sterling terms, according to FE Analytics, the data provider.

After Mr Gibbs left and Mr de Blonay was joined by current co-manager Robert Mumby, the team refocused on company fundamentals.

"In the early stages after I took over, the fund was influenced by a macro decision that was not favourable - we underestimated the power of central banks to influence markets," says Mr de Blonay.

"In the past two years, we decided to re-emphasise our bottom-up analysis, with less importance placed on the macro. This stockpicking approach has helped in the past 12-18 months."

In the past year, the fund has gained 15.5 per cent compared with an index gain of 8.5 per cent, boosted by a strong past two months, the data show.

"I have rarely been so pleased with the types of companies and themes in the portfolio as in the past year or so," Mr de Blonay says.

The manager does not rule out a return to the fund's previous macro focus, but he says the investment environment is unlikely to return to the difficulties it faced in 2008-09.

He says: "There is always a possibility that we come back to a difficult environment, but I would be very surprised indeed if we have another crisis of this magnitude."

Zynga pounces to snatch UK's Clumsy Ninja app developer; TECHNOLOGY

Zynga is to pay more than $500m to buy NaturalMotion, the UK developer of mobile apps such as Clumsy Ninja and CSR Racing , in the social gaming company's largest acquisition.

The news came at the same time as Zynga announced a fresh round of job cuts and forecast-busting earnings. Zynga swung back to a $0.03 per share loss in its fourth quarter, after adjusting for certain charges such as stock-based expenses and asset writedowns, it said yesterday, compared with $0.01 earnings a year ago. However, the losses were narrower than had been expected and its shares leapt by 22 per cent in after-hours trading.

NaturalMotion, backed by Balderton Capital, is the second British technology company to be acquired by a larger US firm this week, following Google's $660m purchase of DeepMind , an artificial intelligence company that had also been developing games.

Like DeepMind's founders, Torsten Reil, NaturalMotion's co-founder and chief executive, has a background outside the tech industry, having studied biology at Oxford university before going on to research a PhD in complex systems in the university's zoology department.

Zynga will pay $391m in cash and 38.9m Zynga shares to buy NaturalMotion, with offices in Oxford, London, Brighton and San Francisco, to expand its portfolio of games into racing and people simulation.

"Our acquisition of NaturalMotion will allow us to significantly expand our creative pipeline, accelerate our mobile growth and bring next-generation technology and tools to Zynga that we believe will fast-track our ability to deliver more hit games," said Don Mattrick, Zynga chief executive.

Zynga has struggled to translate its once-popular Facebook-based games such as FarmVille to smartphones and tablets, prompting a sequence of acquisitions of mobile app developers including Newtoy, maker of Words With Friends , and OMGPop, creator of Draw Something .

NaturalMotion has found greater success on mobile. CSR Racing , a driving game for the iPhone and iPad, was at one point in 2012 the highest-grossing app on Apple's App Store. Clumsy Ninja , a character with lifelike animation which players must train like a virtual pet, was released last year.

NaturalMotion grew out of its founders' efforts to create software that mimicked animal movements. Like DeepMind, it relies on computer systems modelled on living creatures, which it then uses to make animated characters perform tasks.

"Basically, we start out with a rag doll," Mr Reil said when NaturalMotion first launched as a spinout from Oxford university. "We then add muscles and a brain to the thing."

The company's technology is used by the developers of the popular but violent video game Grand Theft Auto, to create realistic effects.

Mr Reil's 8 per cent stake in NaturalMotion has netted him $42m as part of the acquisition, according to a source close to the deal. Balderton has a 24 per cent stake, with US venture capital firm Benchmark owning 20 per cent and Oxford university under 11 per cent.

The buyout underscores a growing interest in "deep tech" coming out of UK universities. The sale has been in motion since at least December.

The acquisition comes as Zynga continues to lose players from its existing games at a rapid clip. The number of people paying for virtual items and other in-game items fell by more than half to 1.3m in the fourth quarter of 2013, from 2.9m a year earlier.

As a result, revenues fell by 43 per cent to $176m for the fourth quarter, even as net losses narrowed to $25m from $49m a year ago.

As part of a $35m cost reduction plan this year, Zynga said that it would lay off about 314 employees and cut its datacentre investments. It laid off 18 per cent of its workforce, or 520 people, last June.

 "Aim-quoted Top Level Domain Holdings which is competing against Google and Amazon for control of new web suffixes such as ".app" and ".cloud" has raised $33m from investors. The Dublin company will announce today that it has completed a capital raising that brings its cash balance to $48m in the run-up to auctions of some of the most coveted new domains.

Twitter's Super Bowl Goal: More Ad Credibility

By Yoree Koh and Suzanne Vranica

On Super Bowl Sunday, Twitter will again serve as a grand stage for advertisers to promote brands to millions of people captivated by gameplay, half-time shows and slick commercials.

But Sunday's game also will be a litmus test for whether Twitter Inc. can persuade marketers to spend more money to have a presence on the service instead of simply sending out free tweets, hoping their hashtag-stamped witticisms go viral.

In preparation, Twitter has been offering consulting services, grounded in analytics, which it says can lead to smarter tweeting.

On game day, Twitter will feed data to brands like Unilever PLC's Axe deodorant to gauge reaction to ads and to predict the next Internet meme before it happens. It will also suggest targeted keywords for ads based on conversation topics, such as blasting tweets to Bruno Mars's fans when he sings at halftime.

For the past few months, Twitter's staffers have huddled with Unilever and other large advertisers including PepsiCo Inc. and Bank of America Corp. to share more detailed analysis of user data, and to help with Super Bowl ad campaigns earlier than in previous years.

Twitter isn't charging the marketers for its consulting. The hope is these advertisers will feel more comfortable with Twitter as an ad platform and eventually steer more of their marketing budgets that way.

Twitter, which touts itself as the world's "town square," faces pressure from investors to show it can sell more ads and do it for the long haul. Twitter issues its first quarterly report as a public company next Wednesday. In the three month period through September, its ad revenue doubled to $153.4 million. (By comparison, Facebook Inc. on Wednesday said its quarterly ad revenue totaled $2.34 billion.)

Many advertisers still view social media, particularly Twitter, as largely a free vehicle to promote their brands. Marketers have seized on the hyperactive, conversational nature of the 140-character public messaging service as a means to talk directly to consumers.

When the Superdome in New Orleans went dark during last year's Super Bowl, the Oreo cookie brand posted a tweet that said: "Power Out? No Problem." The tweet included a picture of a cookie with the line, "You can still dunk in the dark." The tweet -- shared on Twitter and Facebook more than 20,000 times -- became a marketing sensation. But it didn't translate into much revenue for Twitter.

In that Oreo vein, brands including Dannon and Toyota have tweeted up a storm in the lead up to the game and plan to tweet plenty more on Sunday, while putting most of their ad dollars elsewhere.

Other advertisers show more promise for Twitter.

Unilever says by working more closely with Twitter it is now more confident that Twitter ads work. The consumer product giant is spending more than $500,000 on its Twitter Super Bowl push, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Twitter's alliance with Axe includes buying a wide range of ads that the social-media company offers and represents a significant increase in how much the Axe brand spent on Twitter during last year's Super Bowl, according Gail Tifford, Unilever's senior director of media for North America. Ms. Tifford says it isn't enough to simply send out tweets organically. "When you look at reach of organic tweets, you are not reaching the scale you need," she said.

Adam Bain, Twitter's president of revenue, said some advertisers like to experiment with different kinds of organic content, testing out different voices and messages on Twitter. Then, once "they feel confident that a piece of content is strong" they may start paying for ad products.

Josh Nafman, senior manager of digital brand engagement for PepsiCo, which is sponsoring the Super Bowl halftime show, said Twitter employees provided guidance on what kind of content is more shareable on the platform, and helped come up with one hashtag: GBP halftime.

"I would love to say it seems like a very obvious thing but the coordination of not only hashtag strategy but also when to leverage paid media throughout that" is a difficult trick, Mr. Nafman said.

"A lot of us feel more comfortable with spending money behind" products that are "based in data and science and insights into our consumers and sports and music," said Mr. Nafman.

Twitter has developed or acquired many of its measurement and tracking tools in the past year. "Our goal is to be as strategic as we can to the marketers and their respective agencies and that means even pre-running ad campaigns before they run ad campaigns," said Twitter's Mr. Bain. "Often times, we're now in the room when they are working on the concept for the creative that is going to run on TV or on digital."

Mr. Bain declined to disclose how much revenue Twitter earns from the Super Bowl.

Bank of America, which will run a Super Bowl commercial featuring U2 performing a new single, has increased its ad spend on Twitter in general this year and said the consulting service could compel it to spend more down the road.

Still, it's hard to beat the return on investment for something that is free, namely a regular tweet.

Toyota Motor Corp. is paying for only a "handful" of promoted tweets. It will air a 60-second commercial during Super Bowl XLVIII, and use Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Vine videos to generate buzz.

MANSION --- Jumbo Jungle: In it for the Short Term --- The 30-year mortgage is no longer the only game in town, as wealthy borrowers are drawn to loans with repayment periods of 10, 15 or 20 years

By AnnaMaria Andriotis

Affluent borrowers are falling out of love with long-term loans.

More wealthy borrowers are ditching the 30-year mortgage in favor of shorter repayment periods. The reason: lower rates that can save borrowers thousands of dollars in interest over the life of the loan.

Lenders say much of this demand is for refinancing. Rather than restarting the clock on a new 30-year mortgage, existing borrowers may be able to keep a similar monthly payment with a lower rate on a shorter-term jumbo.

Home buyers are also interested. As mortgage rates rise, affluent borrowers face a dilemma: sign up for a costlier loan or forget financing and pay all cash for the home. The latter option means giving up attractive tax benefits; borrowers can usually deduct interest payments on up to $1 million of mortgage debt.

A quicker repayment period provides a middle-ground solution. Affluent borrowers can tap into tax benefits while paying less in interest on the mortgage. They also have the means to handle the larger monthly payments that often result from squeezing a mortgage into a shorter term.

While still high, demand for 30-year mortgages has been dropping. They accounted for 90.3% of private mortgages -- those that lenders tend to keep on their books and which are comprised mostly of jumbos -- that were originated during the first 11 months of 2013. That's slightly lower than the same period a year prior and the lowest figure in the past seven years, according to CoreLogic, a real-estate analytics firm.

Meanwhile, shorter-term mortgages have been rising: 15-year mortgages accounted for 9.1% of private mortgage originations during the first 11 months of 2013, up from 8.9% during the same period a year earlier. That is the highest level in the past seven years.

To a large extent, the move away from the 30-year loan is a rate play. When rates were at record lows, borrowers could stash the cash they didn't put into the home in other investments and earn a higher return than the interest they were paying out on their 30-year mortgage.

But as mortgage rates rise, it is harder to find those investments -- especially for borrowers who sign up for 30-year mortgages, which typically have the highest rates. Rates on mortgages with a 20-year or shorter period, while rising, can be low enough to make this arbitrage possible.

"It's a recent phenomenon," says Mike McPartland, head of investment finance for Citi Private Bank in North America. "If clients notice distinct discounts for taking a shorter product . . . and if it suits their strategy, they're going to opt into it."

Rates on 30-year fixed-rate jumbo mortgages, which exceed $417,000 in most parts of the country and $625,500 in pricier housing markets like New York, averaged 4.56% during the week ending Jan. 24, while 15-year jumbo fixed rates averaged 3.76%, according to mortgage-info website HSH.com. That spread is larger than the same week one and two years prior.

Other repayment options are popping up as well. Wells Fargo rolled out pricing for 10- and 20-year repayment periods over the past couple of years. PNC Bank says affluent borrowers have expressed interest in these loans over the past few months.

In general, with shorter-term loans, borrowers stand to get rates that are from one-quarter to more than one percentage point lower than the 30-year mortgage. The smaller the repayment period, the larger that difference.

For jumbo borrowers, such a rate break results in significant savings. For instance, at the Princeton, N.J., office of Gateway Funding Diversified Mortgage Services, a mortgage banking firm, the starting rate on a 30-year fixed-rate jumbo is 4.5%, while the starting rate on a 10-year jumbo is about 3.4%. Over the life of a $1.5 million mortgage, borrowers will pay more than $1.2 million in interest with a 30-year period, compared with roughly $271,000 in interest with a 10-year term.

Gateway Funding says roughly 5% to 10% of the jumbo mortgages it originated in its Princeton office last year had 20-year repayment periods, and another 5% to 10% had 10-year terms.

Middlesex Savings Bank, a community bank based in Natick, Mass., says 20-year mortgages accounted for about 30% of their jumbo originations last year.

Lenders say that some of this demand is coming from baby boomers who are turning to shorter repayments to pay off their mortgage before entering their golden years.

Here are a few other issues to consider:

-- Choose your term: Some banks will write almost any repayment period that a qualifying borrower requests.

-- Watch out for rates: Some banks offer the same rate to every borrower who gets a specific repayment period, regardless of their income or credit, which could result in a more creditworthy borrower paying more than he or she would elsewhere.

That's slightly lower than the same period a year prior and the lowest figure in the past seven years, according to CoreLogic, a real-estate analytics firm.

Meanwhile, shorter-term mortgages have been rising: 15-year mortgages accounted for 9.1% of private mortgage originations during the first 11 months of 2013, up from 8.9% during the same period a year earlier. That is the highest level in the past seven years.

To a large extent, the move away from the 30-year loan is a rate play. When rates were at record lows, borrowers could stash the cash they didn't put into the home in other investments and earn a higher return than the interest they were paying out on their 30-year mortgage.

But as mortgage rates rise, it is harder to find those investments especially for borrowers who sign up for 30-year mortgages, which typically have the highest rates. Rates on mortgages with a 20-year or shorter period, while rising, can be low enough to make this arbitrage possible.

"It's a recent phenomenon," says Mike McPartland, head of investment finance for Citi Private Bank in North America. "If clients notice distinct discounts for taking a shorter product & and if it suits their strategy, they're going to opt into it."

Rates on 30-year fixed-rate jumbo mortgages, which exceed $417,000 in most parts of the country and $625,500 in pricier housing markets like New York, averaged 4.56% during the week ending Jan. 24, while 15-year jumbo fixed rates averaged 3.76%, according to mortgage-info website HSH.com. That spread is larger than the same week one and two years prior.

Other repayment options are popping up as well. Wells Fargo rolled out pricing for 10- and 20-year repayment periods over the past couple of years. PNC Bank says affluent borrowers have expressed interest in these loans over the past few months.

In general, with shorter-term loans, borrowers stand to get rates that are from one-quarter to more than one percentage point lower than the 30-year mortgage. The smaller the repayment period, the larger that difference.

For jumbo borrowers, such a rate break results in significant savings. For instance, at the Princeton, N.J., office of Gateway Funding Diversified Mortgage Services, a mortgage banking firm, the starting rate on a 30-year fixed-rate jumbo is 4.5%, while the starting rate on a 10-year jumbo is about 3.4%. Over the life of a $1.5 million mortgage, borrowers will pay more than $1.2 million in interest with a 30-year period, compared with roughly $271,000 in interest with a 10-year term.

Gateway Funding says roughly 5% to 10% of the jumbo mortgages it originated in its Princeton office last year had 20-year repayment periods, and another 5% to 10% had 10-year terms.

Middlesex Savings Bank, a community bank based in Natick, Mass., says 20-year mortgages accounted for about 30% of their jumbo originations last year.

Lenders say that some of this demand is coming from baby boomers who are turning to shorter repayments to pay off their mortgage before entering their golden years.

Here are a few other issues to consider:

 " Choose your term: Some banks will write almost any repayment period that a qualifying borrower requests.

 " Watch out for rates: Some banks offer the same rate to every borrower who gets a specific repayment period, regardless of their income or credit, which could result in a more creditworthy borrower paying more than he or she would elsewhere.

Banks' ageing IT struggles to cope with rise in demand; BANKS

News analysis

Growth in mobile services adds to systems' workload, write Sharlene Goff and Sam Fleming

Barely a month goes by without reports of another serious systems crash at one of the UK's biggest banks.

Last weekend's three-hour outage at Lloyds Banking Group followed a high-profile failure last month at Royal Bank of Scotland on so-called Cyber Monday, one of the busiest online shopping days ahead of Christmas.

On both occasions the banks fixed the problems quickly - and were even more keen to speedily reassure customers they would not lose money.

However consultants are warning that these problems could occur more often as banks' old IT systems struggle to cope with rapidly escalating demands from customers.

"The huge problem is that many of these systems were built 30 years ago," says Daniel Mayo of Ovum, a technology consultancy.

"The number of query-based requests has shot through the roof - banks are dealing with far greater transaction volumes than the systems were designed for."

The fast take-up of mobile banking via smartphone apps and online banking services means banks are now having to process billions of queries per year.

Lloyds, for example, says it processed 1.24bn log-ons in 2013, up 16 per cent on the previous year. It expects that figure to grow to 1.4bn this year. About half of those now come from people using mobiles and tablet computers.

That level of demand has put more pressure on to already antiquated systems , which analysts say have suffered from years of under-investment in both hardware and software.

Consultants responsible for improving banks' systems say that merely accessing some archived data has been a challenge because of the obsolete formats that are used. One says he was forced to hunt down antiquated computer equipment and put it back into service just to access data stored on old-fashioned tapes.

Also, as banks have expanded through acquisitions, they have tended to bolt new systems on to existing ones, rather than undertake the potentially more disruptive and costly process of fully integrating new customers. The result is hugely complex IT networks that may never be able to be untangled.

There were "a lot of fingers crossed as people try to get more life out of something" and a reliance on short-term fixes, says one consultant.

Figures from Celent, the research company, show that European banks have barely increased their IT spend in the past three years, despite suffering a number of serious failures. They are forecast to spend $59.7bn on IT projects this year, compared with $59.1bn in 2011. Over the same period banks in Asia are expected to increase their IT spend by 25 per cent and US banks by 16 per cent.

Jacob Jegher, research director at Celent, says there are signs that European banks are preparing to step up their IT expenditure over the next few years. But he says the growth is focused on new technology and innovation, while budgets for the more pedestrian - but essential - maintenance of existing systems are declining.

UK banks say they are spending billions of pounds on IT each year.

RBS and Lloyds, the two state-backed banks - which seem to be worst hit by IT problems - say they invest about 2bn a year.

After RBS's catastrophic IT outage in the summer of 2012 - which left millions of customers unable to access their accounts for weeks - the bank said it would spend an additional 450m over the next three years.

RBS says it has already improved its ability to recover lost customer data and introduced manual functions to enable it to override IT failures. It is also working on plans to allow small transactions - for say 20 - to go through if its servers fail.

IT specialists say banks are increasingly installing what they call "predictive analytics" - essentially software that will detect early warning signs that a system may be at risk of failing and alert the bank. This is partly in response to a warning from the regulator in 2012 to ensure their systems were not exposed to the kind of outage that caused havoc at RBS.

The Financial Conduct Authority has taken a more proactive stance on IT, warning in its "Risk Outlook" last year about the threat of interruptions to banks' IT services because of their reliance on "ageing and merged technologies and systems."

As soon as Lloyds' servers went down on Sunday night - triggered by a hardware failure - the bank sought to assure the regulator that the problem was not too serious.

But banks still have a way to go to convince regulators and customers that their systems can cope with the avalanche of new demands that are being triggered by the rapid digitalisation of banking.

Computing calamities

2012 & 2013 Unavailable funds

On multiple occasions customers of RBS Group, which includes NatWest, RBS and Ulster Bank, are left without access to their money, in some cases for days. The bank apologised, opened branches on a Sunday and waived some charges.

Aug 2013 Exchange interrupted

Goldman Sachs is potentially exposed to a $100m loss after a computer malfunction inadvertently makes a large number of erroneous options trades, disrupting trading across multiple US exchanges.

Sep 2013 Mortgage mess

Clydesdale bank is dealt a 8.9m fine by regulators after finding a software error caused repayments on variable rate mortgages to be miscalculated. Thousands underpaid their loans, but the bank had demanded that customers make up the shortfall.

Jan 2014 ATMs down

Thousands of customers at Lloyds Banking Group were unable to use debit cards for about three hours on Sunday afternoon, and at about the same time half the bank's 7,000 ATMs stopped working.

Deal of the Week: A Plan's Real Beneficiary

As the Affordable Care Act alters the nation's health-care landscape, business groups are closely watching to see who gets helped or hurt by the new law. In the real-estate world, one group appears to be emerging a clear winner: owners of medical-office space. Earlier this month, Harrison Street Real Estate Capital LLC paid Washington Real Estate Investment Trust more than $500 million for 22 medical-office buildings containing 1.5 million square feet of space in the Washington area. The rich purchase price translates to $320 a square foot, well above the sector's average price of $179 a square foot and close to what it would cost to replace the buildings.

The sale of Washington REIT was part of a flurry of medical-office deals in the past year. In the fourth quarter of 2013, investors spent $2.5 billion to acquire medical-office space, up 18% from a year earlier, according to Real Capital Analytics. The average price per square foot, meanwhile, climbed 13% in the same period. Buyers include REITs, private-equity firms and hedge funds.

Brokerage Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, which says it has several medical-office transactions in the pipeline totaling about half a billion dollars, expects to see its sales volume double this year from 2013. "We're seeing a voracious appetite for the product," said Todd Perman, an executive managing director of NGKF Global Healthcare Services.

Even before the Affordable Care Act became law, investors were betting that medical-office space would be a safe bet due to the large number of aging boomers who will require a high level of medical services. The demographic trends meant that medical-office space "was somewhat seen as a safe haven over the last few years," said Dan Fasulo, a managing director with Real Capital.

But the Affordable Care Act means that millions more Americans are gaining access to health care and will seek out services. These trends come as hospitals have been moving nonemergency services into office space near their campuses to reduce costs.

Supply, meanwhile, has risen modestly. After several years of little supply growth, the market added about 7.5 million square feet of medical office space last year and a similar amount should hit the market his year, according to Marcus & Millichap's Healthcare Real Estate Group. Still, oversupply currently isn't a concern because little of this new space is speculative, or built without a user in place, said Alan Pontius, the group's national director.

"New supply will not damage the supply-demand balance," he said, adding that vacancy rates should fall in 2014.

To be sure, the high prices some buyers currently are paying exposes them to risk. Medical-office space can take longer than other types of real estate to re-lease because the user base is limited and rental growth has been relatively flat in recent years.

Christopher N. Merrill, co-founder of Chicago-based Harrison Street, which has about $6 billion of assets under management, said he isn't worried about the high prices his company paid because the buildings it acquired are 90% occupied and the average lease terms are between five and 10 years. The retention rate, or tenants who re-sign leases, is between 85% and 90%.

"We think it's a very good nonvolatile investment. That's what we look for," he said. "Long term, medical office is a very attractive sector."

Mr. Merrill said his company was attracted to the wealthy patient base in and around Washington, as well as locations within walking distance of respected medical institutions including MedStar Health.

Seller Washington REIT said it decided to exit the medical office business to focus on its other businesses, which include apartments, office space and shopping centers.

The Health-Care Law's Real Beneficiary; Owners of Medical Office Space Are Benefiting

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Gars changes gears in equities; Fund focus

Strategy is switching from dividend income to growth, says Matthew Jeynes

One of Europe's bestselling funds of recent years has made a landmark shift in its strategy for buying equities, in a sign that stock market behaviour could be set for a change.

The vast Standard Life Investments Global Absolute Return Strategies (Gars) fund contains a series of large baskets of equity investments that have long favoured companies with sustainable levels of dividend income.

But, following a change in house view at Standard Life, the equity portfolios have been switched to buying companies that show the potential to grow their earnings.

The Gars strategy, run by the fund arm of the Edinburgh-based insurance group, has rocketed in size in recent years amid bumper global sales.

The group continues to open it up to global markets and in late 2011 it was made available in the US through a partnership with John Hancock Investments, the Boston fund company. Standard Life last year also made Gars available to German retail investors, while stating that five of the six significant Canadian investment dealers had started distributing the fund.

The Gars portfolio is complex, making countless tiny bets in diverse areas, from equities and bonds to currency trading . It aims to deliver small, steady positive returns regardless of the state of underlying markets.

There are signs of sustained success and the 19.4bn UK-based version of the fund, launched in 2008, gained 3.4-17.9 per cent in each of the past five calendar years, according to FE Analytics, the data provider.

The success of the product means the equity investing shift is sure to be scrutinised by global investors eager to glean an insight into the direction of equity markets.

Andy Ford, investment specialist on the Gars team, says the focus on companies with a reliable income stream had been a key feature of the fund for several years. But as the global economic recovery continues to gather pace, and with the US Federal Reserve reducing its giant programme of economy-boosting asset purchases, companies' fundamental merits are "returning to the fore".

"We have seen significant cost-cutting in recent years, so when we do see the top line start to move, there should be significant operational leverage to kick in and gear up earnings growth," he says.

He adds: "As earnings start to improve, the situation becomes self-reinforcing as companies put cash to work in ways they have not done in recent periods."

Along with the new focus on earnings, the fund has been ramping up its European equity bets.

The team boosted its exposure to European equities throughout the second half of 2013. In its latest fact sheet, correct to the end of November, the position occupied a 6.5 per cent weighting in the fund.

"We think there could be quite a turnround for European companies. We also think that there is a bit less policy uncertainty as we move into the new year and it will definitely be beneficial that fiscal tightening has been delayed," Mr Ford says.

The team also has large positions in global equities, global real estate investment trusts (Reits) and the equity of oil majors, all geared towards finding earnings growth.

The Gars fund has retained its three other main investment themes. They focus on global growth rates; trades exploiting central bank policies around the world; and economic change in China.

MBA students turn to entrepreneurship

When Simo Dragicevic got round to studying for an MBA, aged 36, he appeared to be on the corporate fast track. But he quit his job as a director at Barclays Bank, which was sponsoring his studies, to become an entrepreneur, which meant he had to pay his tuition fees himself.

"I have and continue to make some large personal sacrifices," he says. "However, we can pay ourselves and invest in the business, and this is an incredibly satisfying feeling."

Dragicevic founded Bet Buddy, a supplier of user data analytics software for gaming companies, helped by his experience of implementing technology in the fields of risk, marketing and finance during his time at the bank.

He credits his decision to reinvent himself as an entrepreneur to a throwaway comment by a tutor during the first lecture of his MBA course at Cass Business School in London.

"He said, somewhat in jest and somewhat in truth, that MBAs typically don't go on to build $10bn-plus businesses," Dragicevic recalls. "However, he also said MBAs can for sure teach you the tools to build a $10m-plus business."

Although most MBA students are still unlikely to follow Dragicevic's path, he is among a growing number of MBA-educated entrepreneurs.

It is a change being driven more by the rewards of creating something of value than disillusionment with the career-enhancing potential of an MBA, says Noam Wasserman, a professor at Harvard Business School.

"Far more of our students are running to entrepreneurship, rather than running away from the non-entrepreneurial job markets," he says.

"They see entrepreneurship as a way to have much more impact, and impact much sooner, than they could in almost any other post-MBA job. They are excited about heading out into new terrain, developing ideas and businesses that fill needs that aren't yet being addressed. They are heading into that terrain with far more knowledge about what awaits them and how to avoid the recurring pitfalls that have plagued the dreams of past entrepreneurs."

The number of Harvard MBA students becoming entrepreneurs has been about 7 per cent in the past three years, Prof Wasserman says, roughly double the number before that.

Prof Wasserman runs a course for MBA students called "Founders' Dilemmas", which he describes as a "collecting ground for future founders". Twenty-eight per cent of students who have taken this course later founded companies, up from 20 per cent in 2009.

The picture is similar in China according to Shimin Chen, associate dean and MBA programme director at China Europe International Business School in Shanghai (Ceibs). "Most MBA students still look for traditional salary-based jobs with large multinational companies, consulting firms or investment banks, but because of the success of entrepreneurship in China, more and more of our students are taking it up," he says.

Like other business schools, Ceibs offers electives for its MBA students that teach skills relevant to a business founder, such as marketing and finance, and promote them as such.

The school's entrepreneurship club counts more than half of the MBA student intake among its members. Many are drawn by the positive image of entrepreneurship in Chinese society even if they themselves will never become founders, Prof Chen says.

Dragicevic found a great deal of support from his fellow students for his decision to go it alone, even though the pressure to earn back the cost of an MBA meant many did not follow his lead.

"For many the short- to medium- term financial implications and low success rate of business start-ups were not the most attractive option. For the majority who were not sponsored and having paid their MBA tuition fees, there was certainly some pressure to capitalise on the investment as early as possible."

He says his MBA tutors also taught him skills that he has found useful in running his business, which this year is expected to break even on revenues of about 350,000, as Dragicevic is still spending cash to develop operations.

"An MBA certainly provides one with tools to tackle a variety of business problems in the corporate world, and some of these tools are also valuable to the entrepreneur," he says. "I have met a few scientists and engineers who have built products but who have struggled to grasp many of the aspects of commercialising the products."

Despite support from his peers, Dragicevic feels he was discouraged by Cass from taking the path to entrepreneurship, perhaps because his potential salary increase if he had returned to Barclays would have helped the school up the UK's MBA ranking leagues.

"I was one of the top salary earners in my cohort," he says. This is something that the British ranking organisations need to address, Dragicevic believes.

Sarah Juillet, director of postgraduate careers and MBA programme at Cass, says: "While rankings are important to business schools, what is more important today is the focus on individual students and their individual ambitions. One of the ways Cass has improved this focus is the recent merger of the career service and MBA programme to align more closely on content and outcomes."

She adds that the MBA includes entrepreneurship electives, while the Peter Cullum Centre for Entrepreneurship offers incubation space, mentoring, advice and access to funding networks for early-stage start-ups. Cass alumni and students can also apply to the school's 10m venture capital fund.

"More people will take entrepreneurial paths in future, and business schools investing in entrepreneurship may not be getting the credit they deserve," Dragicevic says. "I have built a high-tech product, I am building equity in a new company, I have created jobs, I have brought business to the UK from overseas clients and I have produced original peer-reviewed research published in respected scientific journals working with British academics. But I earn a lot less than when I was at Barclays."

A Student of Stupidity

All you need to know about multibillionaire Carl Icahn is how he describes himself on his Twitter page: "Some people get rich studying artificial intelligence. Me, I make my money studying natural stupidity."

W.C. Fields was more concise: "Never give a sucker an even break."

Mr. Icahn is 77 years old and has an estimated net worth of $20 billion, and he still loves to prey upon the stupid. Last week, Mr. Icahn was studying the natural stupidity at Apple and eBay. Those companies have been nothing but revolutionary over the past decade. They're not really all that stupid. It's just that Mr. Icahn is smarter, you see.

He wants Apple to give more of its $150 billion cash hoard to shareholders like him in the form of stock repurchase plans and higher dividends. He also wants eBay to split off PayPal as a separate company because he thinks this reorganization would result in shareholders like him getting more money.

Mr. Icahn often unveils his moves, or discusses them, on Twitter, which can sometimes drive up stock prices. You've got to admire that he is transparent, if not insulting, about his "natural stupidity" strategy.

He has purchased billions worth of Apple and eBay stock. But he's not making a bet on these companies; he's making a bet he can get these companies to do what he says.

He is smarter than the people who run them, you see, even though he has never produced much more than harassment and misery for most of his life.

In the 1980s, when Apple was bringing the world personal computers, Mr. Icahn was stripping assets away from TWA and loading the now-deceased airline up with debt.

In the 1990s, when Apple was pioneering software and opening the Apple Store, Mr. Icahn was busy with things like trying to break up U.S. Steel and RJR Nabisco.

In the 2000s, when eBay was developing online auctions and payment systems, and Apple was churning out iPods, iPads and iPhones, Mr. Icahn was doing things like feeding off the corpse of Blockbuster video.

Mr. Icahn was more accurately heralded as a corporate raider in the 1980s. Through the miracle of public relations, he is now called a shareholder activist. He says he produces shareholder value. And market pundits often cheer him on.

In the case of Apple, Mr. Icahn is attracted to the amazing cash position of one of history's most successful innovators. Like a housefly to a honey pot. Not everyone thinks giving the money to him and other investors is the greatest idea. Perhaps Apple could use these billions to revolutionize something else.

"I have no respect for Carl Icahn," said stock analyst Ronnie Moas in an interview. "He needs to start using his power in a different way."

Mr. Moas, founder of Miami-based Standpoint Research, says one reason Apple has so much cash is that it underpays its labor in Asia to build its products. He recently made news for "blacklisting" Apple in his research report making the controversial suggestion that more of Apple's cash go to the workers who make its products.

Apple has already announced a three-year plan to return $100 million to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. If Apple coughed up, say, $10 billion to pay workers, who knows, it might even be able to afford to create jobs in the U.S.

Nobody would even notice the money was missing.

Except Mr. Icahn. He thinks he deserves it. He's smarter.

Hedge Fund Winton Capital Plans U.S. Office; Fourth Largest European Hedge Fund by AUM Planning To Open a U.S. Office in the Summer

Winton Capital Management, the fourth largest European hedge fund by assets under management, is planning to open a U.S. office in the summer, according to people familiar with the matter. The move is part of a broader global expansion that could lead to the U.K.-based firm, which has nearly $25 billion in assets under management, opening offices in Japan and Australia.

Winton, in which Goldman Sach's Petershill fund owns a 9.9% stake, is one of the pioneers of managed futures strategies, which employ complex computer models to spot trends in global markets. The hedge fund employs nearly 300 people, many of them employing statistical research and big data techniques to sift enormous amounts of information.

Winton's U.S. office will be based in New York and will initially only house a handful of marketing staff, including some who will relocate from other offices. As well as in London, the firm already has offices in Oxford, Hong Kong (which opened in 2009) and Zurich (which opened in 2012).

Managed futures hedge funds have suffered poor performance in recent times partly because of a lack of clear trends in the market. This phenomenon is often attributed to the high degree of central bank intervention. The Newedge CTA index, which broadly tracks these firms, gained only 0.72% last year having fallen 2.87% in 2012 and 4.45% in 2011. However, Winton Capital's flagship $10 billion Winton Futures Funds gained 9.5% net of fees last year.

In contrast, BlueCrest Capital Management's BlueTrend fund lost 11.4% last year, while Cantab Capital Partners' flagship fund lost 27.7%, according to people with knowledge of the performance of both managed futures funds.

Additionally, the long-only Winton Global Equity Fund climbed 29.8% in 2013, outperforming the MSCI World Index which gained 27.37%. The company is understood to be focusing resources on this product, according to people familiar with the firm's plans. It wants to market it to U.S. institutional investors such as pension plans.

Of the nearly $25 billion that the firm manages, $10 billion is in the Winton Futures Fund, more than $13 billion is in separate managed accounts and $750 million is investment in the long-only equity fund.

In the last two years the firm has launched two onshore U.S. funds, which currently have a combined $300 million in assets under management. Around 40% of the assets across all Winton's products are managed for U.S. clients.

Winton's founder David Harding is understood to be one of the best paid financiers in the U.K. and ranked joint 126th in last year's Sunday Times rich list with a personal fortune estimated to be 700 million.

A clutch of London tech companies is set to lead a revival in the city's capital markets in 2014, with online food ordering service Just Eat preparing to go public as soon as April, writes Sally Davies .

"I've been in this market for 40 years, and it's more buoyant now than I've seen it since 1999," says Richard Holway, chairman of the TechMarketView research group. After several years of digital drought for the main London Stock Exchange, investment bankers say there are likely to be around four technology listings this year. In total, roughly 10 UK groups are thought to be considering a London float.

But some worry that the market is getting carried away. Just Eat is seeking a valuation that equates to 70 to 90 times projected 2013 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.

"There are some frothy ones, but the vast majority of companies in the [UK] tech scene are fairly valued," says Mr Holway.

What has changed is the attitude of institutional investors. Often criticised for conservatism, they are now showing interest in innovations in mobile, social networks, big data and cloud computing. "There is more of an understanding from main market investors that there are some very disruptive businesses that are using technology as their key differentiator," says George O'Connor of Panmure Gordon.

The LSE has been courting tech businesses for its main market. Of the 36 technology groups that made their debut last year, all but one - infrastructure software group Servelec - listed on smaller Aim.

The bourse has appointed Joanna Shields , former chief executive of public sector agency Tech City UK, and Sherry Coutu, an angel investor, to its board. It has tweaked its rules to encourage entrepreneur-led companies to join. But so far not a single group has listed under the new High Growth Segment.

The pipeline is "very strong", says Marcus Stuttard, head of UK primary markets and Aim at the LSE. As well as Just Eat, contenders include payday lender Wonga, games maker Mind Candy and cyber security group Sophos, according to bankers and analysts.

A UK listing can help a company stand out more than in the crowded US market. "Unless you're really large, you can get lost in the noise in America," says David Toms of Numis.

News analysis

Growing demand and balance sheets make the US the top candidate for a pick-up in investment, writes Ed Crooks

US chief executives are running out of excuses for not raising capital spending more quickly. Repeated political confrontations over taxes and government borrowing and spending; nervousness about when the Federal Reserve would start to throttle back on quantitative easing; the deepening crisis in the eurozone: these were all compelling reasons for chief executives to be "sitting on the sidelines", as Andrew Liveris of Dow Chemical put it last month.

Today those issues are fading away. Last month, the Fed announced that it would start buying Treasury bonds at a slower rate. This month, Congress agreed a broad spending deal for the first time since 2009, although a possible clash over the US government's debt limit is still a lingering concern. Indicators of financial stress in the eurozone, including government bond yields for Greece, Ireland and Spain, have eased significantly.

Chief executives' statements and companies' guidance on capital spending plans for the coming year suggest they are still cautious. Business confidence is rising, but the manifestation of that confidence in physical investment is still patchy. However, if investment is going to accelerate in any developed economy, the US is the most plausible candidate.

Demand is rising and balance sheets are strong. With every passing year the scars of the 2007-09 crisis heal a little more, and old equipment is more urgently in need of replacement. Some analysts believe that 2014 will be the year that capital spending finally begins to take off . "We feel very strongly about it," says Nick Nelson, global equity strategist at UBS. "We feel an upturn in capital spending is ripe to happen now."

If it does not, it will look like a sign that the barriers to business investment are more fundamental than had been thought.

Expectations for capital spending this year vary widely both between sectors, and between companies in the same sector. General Electric, the US industrial group, is heavily exposed to capital spending as a manufacturer of equipment from aero engines to power generators, and talked this month about a "generally improving" environment. Revenues at its industrial operations were up 6 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year compared with the equivalent period of 2012, while its orders were up 8 per cent, with a 25 per cent rise in China, an 8 per cent gain in the US and even a 3 per cent uptick in Europe.

However, Jeff Bornstein, GE's chief financial officer, refused to get carried away. "There's a lot of sentiment that the US is about to turn the corner, that potentially the economy will pick up more broadly, including capital goods," he said last week. "But at some level that remains to be seen."

GE expects its own spending on plant, equipment and software to be about the same this year as the $4bn it spent in 2013.

Commercial aerospace, which is booming globally, is one of the industries where strong demand is encouraging growth in capital spending.

Greg Hayes, chief financial officer of United Technologies, which makes aircraft electronics and aero engines, said this week it expected capital spending to be $2bn this year, up from $1.7bn in 2013. While that would put "some pressure" on cash flows, he said, "these are critical investments for our commercial aerospace business as we prepare for an unprecedented ramp-up in production".

Boeing, which has seen a surge of orders for its commercial aircraft, has been stepping up investment already. It said last October it expected to spend $2.3bn in 2013, up from $1.7bn in both 2011 and 2012.

Oil and gas production is another industry where output is booming and capital spending continues to rise. But ExxonMobil and Chevron, the two largest US oil companies by market capitalisation, have been under pressure from investors to curb the rise in their capital spending budgets. Chevron last month said it expected its capital and exploration spending to drop from $42bn last year to $39.8bn in 2014. John Watson, chief executive, said he expected 2013 to have been "a relative peak year for investments".

Smaller companies benefiting from US shale oil are still going great guns, however. Continental Resources, the largest producer in the Bakken shale of North Dakota, is planning a 13 per cent increase this year. Overall, capital budgets in US oil and gas production are set to rise by 8.5 per cent this year, according to James West, an analyst at Barclays: more than double last year's 4 per cent.

Rising supplies of shale oil and gas are also stimulating investment in the refining and chemicals industries that use them as feedstocks. Phillips 66, the refining, chemicals and pipelines group, expects a 24 per cent increase in capital spending this year compared with its plan for last year.

In other industries, however, the case for investment is harder to make. The big four US telecommunications groups - AT&T, Verizon Communications, Sprint and a resurgent T-Mobile US, are among the biggest spenders in the world because of investments in 4G wireless networks and - for AT&T and Verizon in particular - advanced television and internet services.

However, the initial rollout of wireless broadband networks based on LTE technology is largely complete, and while capital spending is unlikely to fall very far because operators need to spend heavily to maintain their services, it is unlikely to rise. AT&T expects to spend about $20bn on capex this year, down from the $21bn it is estimated to have spent in 2013.

The outlook in technology is similarly mixed. Microsoft is expecting to spend $6.5bn in the year to June, about 50 per cent more than last year, as it increases investment in data centres. Intel, however, said earlier this month that it expected capital spending of about $11bn this year, roughly the same as in 2012 and 2013. The optimists believe this caution is excessive, and that as the year progresses we will see more companies prepared to commit to increased investment.

Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody'sAnalytics, believes the US could be on the verge of a significant pick-up in business investment. Borrowing from John Maynard Keynes, he argues that the crucial factor is the "animal spirits" of corporate executives, boards and investors.

"Each year that passes since the recession without things going badly wrong, the more likely it is that those spirits will get unleashed," he says.

However, he does entertain one remaining threat: the risk of " secular stagnation " highlighted by Lawrence Summers, the former US Treasury secretary. The idea that the world is heading for a long period of sluggish growth does not seem likely, Mr Zandi says. The longer we go without an acceleration in capital spending, though, the more plausible it will seem.

The risks and rewards of a newly legal high

The legalisation of cannabis in some US states has been a boon for a venture capital firm that focuses on the marijuana market

Three years ago Brendan Kennedy sat his parents down to tell them of his career change.After spending almost half a million dollars on his education (a degree in architecture at Berkeley, a masters in engineering from Washington University and an MBA from Yale Management School), his mother and father - both in their eighties - were baffled by his decision to quit his well-paid job providing valuations of Silicon Valley technology companies to set up a venture capital firm that invests in the cannabis industry.

Despite living in San Francisco, Mr Kennedy's parents missed out on the hippy era. They were too busy bringing up their seven children and holding down jobs (his father was a science teacher, his mother a relationships counsellor). They could not see the appeal to their son of an industry that was then largely illegal.

Yet Mr Kennedy was convinced. After years in Silicon Valley, researching and analysing the financial value of nascent industries, he felt that the legitimate cannabis business, like electric cars and the social media companies he had seen in their embryonic stages ("it felt like having a crystal ball to see into the future"), would also prove to be profitable and ultimately mainstream.

After discussing his idea with two peers (one from school, another from Yale) who ultimately became his business partners, he decided to start researching the idea of setting up a venture capital firm to invest in legal cannabis businesses, both medical and recreational, while he was still employed at SVB Analytics.

"I had access to every industry database you could imagine and could get no information on the market. There was no research. I started to read dry legal reports." It was "real boots-on-the-ground research", he says. Attendees at academic and cannabis business conferences gave him a wide berth, believing that with his smart suit, athletic build and short hair, he worked for drug enforcement agencies. "I certainly met a cast of characters," he laughs.

Reflecting on the business proposals he has received, he says: "Most propositions are awful." The companies he came across were "immature", the entrepreneurs behind them were "unprofessional". A few asked him to inspect their illegal crops hidden away on farms. Others kept wads of cash. Many people approached him with the same idea, thinking they were the first to have it. "I know more about cannabis-infused chocolate than I ever thought I would," he reflects.

The 41-year-old spent a great deal of time figuring out the legal position, given that federal law says possession, manufacture and sale is illegal but states vary in their approach.

More than three years later, the Seattle resident, whose company Privateer Holdings has raised $7m in investments and hopes to raise up to $50m more this year, believes his convictions have been vindicated. Cannabis went on sale in stores in Colorado at the beginning of this year, while Washington state is expected to allow sales later this year after voting to legalise the use and possession of cannabis for people aged over 21. The two states are among 20 to have approved marijuana for medical use. The legal market in the US is predicted to reach $2.3bn this year, according to ArcView Group, a cannabis investor network. It calculates that the market will be worth $10.2bn by 2018.

Initially, it was difficult getting investment. The founders all had backgrounds in banking, so drew on their networks and found the best way to meet potential investors was through "blind introductions", meaning that the people they met were only told they would find the business opportunity interesting but not what it was. "We surprised a few people, but no one kicked us out," he says. Interested investors generally opted to hold back until they knew if the legalisation initiatives in Washington and Colorado would be passed. "Once those initiatives passed in November 2012, it was much easier - investors started coming to us."

They deliberately kept their ambitions for funds modest because it was so hard to find sound investments. "We couldn't trust them [cannabis entrepreneurs]. They had worked illegally for years. It doesn't make them bad business people."

So far, Privateer has bought three companies: Leafly, an online ratings site for dispensaries and marijuana strains; Lafitte Ventures, a Canadian operation growing medical marijuana; and Arbormain, which will lease warehousing for legal cannabis businesses.

In all the Privateer companies' marketing materials there are no depictions of cannabis leaves, no joints and "definitely no Grateful Dead", he says. "We believe that by investing in smart, professional brands we can hasten change. None of us are hippies, most people who consume cannabis aren't hippies."

Mr Kennedy says a lot of people are in the industry because "they want access to the product and culture". He insists that he is not interested and had not touched cannabis since the age of 19. However, when he started the business he decided he should reacquaint himself with the product. "I tried a few indicas and sativas [two types of cannabis plant] - I felt I needed to see the difference."

It has been hard to find savvy business people willing to take the risk and work in this new and occasionally murky industry. "It's not like we could bring a successful CEO in from a public company." A lot of his effort has gone into building teams and "hand-holding to get things done professionally and legally".

Mr Kennedy recently brought in a former drugs enforcement officer to work on compliance. "It is a maze even for people who know about the legislation," he says. Banks have been cautious about getting involved with companies, fearing they might be charged under drugs racketeering or money laundering rules.

Jeffrey Miron, senior lecturer at Harvard's economics department and author of Drug War Crimes: The Consequences of Prohibition , believes many businesses are wary because the existing laws in these states have restrictions and no one knows "how long federal tolerance will last". He adds: "A new president, only three years away, can reimpose federal intervention. So rational businesses are still wary of legalisation because it's not quite real legalisation."

While Mr Kennedy is concerned with the return on investment, he is also in the business because he strongly believes in the social case for legalisation. "The damage done by the drug laws is worse than the drug itself. The war on drugs leads to high incarceration levels and cannabis prohibition perpetuates race discrimination in the country."

The "social return" as well as the "capital return", he says, is what unites his investors, who range from "left-leaning progressives to right-leaning libertarians who would disagree on every topic except for this". Most prefer to be anonymous. His investors are "motivated" but perhaps, most importantly, patient.

Kris Kane, managing director of 4Front advisers, which advises high-end retailers offering medical marijuana, says the risk attached to the legal status of cannabis means those seeing it as a purely rational business investment are likely to be scared off. Yet like any high-risk business, the rewards could be high if you are able to lay the foundations and become a market leader.

Mr Kennedy says he and his co-founders feel like "agents of change", adding: "We know cannabis prohibition will end in our lifetime."

Auto Lender's Drive Reaps a Fortune

By Andrew R. Johnson and Telis Demos

Thomas Dundon's 13,556-square-foot Dallas home features eight bedrooms, indoor and outdoor tennis courts, three wet bars, a swimming pool and an indoor slide that goes from the second floor to the first.

Those are only some of the spoils Mr. Dundon, 42 years old, has collected during his journey to the top of the subprime auto-lending business, where lenders make loans to borrowers with blemished credit. In 2012 alone he raked in $85.2 million in total compensation.

Now Mr. Dundon is poised to become a subprime billionaire.

Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc., the Dallas-based auto-lending and consumer-finance company run by Mr. Dundon, is slated to debut as a publicly traded company Thursday. Owners of the firm, a unit of Spanish lender Banco Santander SA, raised $1.8 billion by selling about 75 million shares, or 22% of its outstanding common stock, at $24 a share. The deal values the company at about $8.3 billion, not including the exercising of stock options.

Mr. Dundon, the chief executive, stands to see his stake valued at $1.2 billion, based on the 13.6% share of the company that he will hold after the initial public offering, including stock options.

"It would not have crossed anyone's mind that this was possible," Mr. Dundon said about the company's success in an interview Wednesday. "I'm not sure if we did it over again that you could replicate the success."

The windfall is notable in an industry still dogged by the memories of the financial crisis. Subprime mortgages were among the first to go bust when the housing market foundered, erasing billions of dollars in assets for lenders, the Wall Street firms that packaged their loans into securities and the investors who bought them. Subprime mortgage lending activity has shriveled to just a tiny fraction of its peak during the housing boom.

But auto loans are a different breed. Subprime auto loans weren't hit by the huge losses seen in other lending segments. Industry experts say many borrowers continued to make auto-loan payments before they paid down other types of loans, including mortgages and credit cards, because they rely on their vehicles to get to work.

Mr. Dundon keeps a high profile in sports-crazed Dallas. He attended the wedding of Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo in 2011, according to local news reports, and has played in golf tournaments with professional golfer Hunter Mahan.

But Mr. Dundon's friends and acquaintances paint a picture of a self-made entrepreneur who came from humble beginnings. He earned his fortune by remaining intensely focused on achieving the goals he set for himself and his business partners, and by refusing to dwell on setbacks, according to those who know him.

"He's hyper-focused," said Mark Molthan, a Dallas real-estate developer who built Mr. Dundon's home and has known him since high school. "When he knows what he wants . . . he figures out a way to get it."

Mr. Dundon attended high school in Plano, near Dallas, and was the president of the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity at Southern Methodist University.

Former fraternity members recall Mr. Dundon's leadership skills following a fire that destroyed Phi Gamma Delta's house in 1992. Jon Altschuler, a commercial real-estate executive in Dallas who was in Phi Gamma Delta at the time, said Mr. Dundon led the effort to find replacement housing for the fraternity while continuing to recruit new members. He also was instrumental in marshaling support from the local business community to raise funds to support the fraternity's operations.

After graduating in 1993 with a degree in economics, Mr. Dundon started a burger restaurant in Fort Worth, Texas, called Izzy's. The venture lasted less than a year, according to friends. He often joked that Izzy's became "Wasy's," they said.

"He just moved on," said Mr. Altschuler. "He's never been a down-in-the-dumps kind of guy."

After the burger joint failed, Mr. Dundon got his start in the auto business, winning a job in the finance department of a Dallas auto dealer. He and some co-workers in 1995 struck out on their own to form an auto-finance company whose rapid success attracted outside investors. Banco Santander in 2006 agreed to buy a 90% stake in the company for $650 million. In 2011, Santander sold part of its stake to private-equity firms Warburg Pincus LLC, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. and Centerbridge Partners LP, which together owned about 24% of the company before the IPO.

For the first nine months of 2013, the company earned $581.7 million, or $1.69 a share, down from $611.7 million, or $1.72 a share, a year earlier.

The IPO comes amid a boom in auto lending, which has been a rare bright spot for lenders facing tepid customer demand for other types of credit. Loans to borrowers with weak credit have been particularly strong. Auto-loan originations to subprime borrowers -- defined as consumers with scores below 660 on the industry's FICO measure -- totaled $153 billion last year, up from $66 billion in 2009, according to Moody'sAnalytics and Equifax.

Other large consumer-finance companies are considering going public, as well. Ally Financial Inc., the former finance arm of General Motors Co., is looking to launch an IPO after the Federal Reserve releases results of its annual "stress tests" of big banks, people familiar with the matter have said. General Electric Co., meanwhile, wants to spin off its consumer-finance arm, the company has said.

Despite Mr. Dundon's success, friends say he hasn't let his ego swell and remains focused on his family. He and his wife, Veruschka, have four children, and they often allow their kids' sports teams and others to use the athletic facilities on their property, according to Mr. Dundon and his friends.

"It's definitely a kid's wonderland," Mr. Molthan said.

The Property Report
Deal of the Week: Big Bet on a 'Small World'

Corrections & Amplifications

MetLife Inc. purchased a share of the Westin New York at Times Square. The Deal of the Week column in the Property Report on Wednesday incorrectly said that MetLife purchased a share of the Westin New York Grand Central.

(WSJ Jan. 23, 2014)

(END)

A few years ago, hotels and resorts were among the least attractive sectors in commercial real estate. Properties were filing for bankruptcy at a rapid rate, lenders were writing down the value of mortgages and buyers were scarce. These days, hotels and resorts are hot properties.

That is good news for investors that were big buyers during the downturn, including Blackstone Group and Rockpoint Group. The rebound also has worked out well for insurance giant MetLife Inc., which added to its hotel portfolio during the downturn.

Now MetLife is doubling down. In late December, MetLife bought a stake in four brand-name hotels, including a majority stake in two resorts -- the Swan and Dolphin hotels -- at the Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. The company declined to disclose what it paid, but the two adjacent properties recently were appraised at $638 million, according to Morningstar.

MetLife, which has a $12 billion real-estate portfolio, said it expects to do more hotel deals. "Investing in hotels and resort properties fits with our strategy to be in robust, tier-one markets in order to drive income and build appreciation," said Robert Merck, a senior managing director at MetLife who heads the global real-estate investment group.

The deal comes as investors are showing more interest in resort hotels nationwide. Last year, investors spent $4.5 billion to acquire resort hotels, up 140% from 2012. The average price per unit increased 112% to nearly $367,000, according to preliminary year-end research from Real Capital Analytics. Both were the highest levels since 2007.

Resorts suffered a double whammy during the downturn: Vacation spending dried up while businesses scaled back on the conferences that can be lucrative for hotel operators. "It was the perfect storm," said Dan Fasulo, a Real Capital Analytics managing director. As the lending environment deteriorated, many hotels fell into foreclosure and were sold at significant discounts.

When the economy began to recover, acquisitions of apartment buildings and office space were first to rebound. Now resorts are "finally starting to get some traction in this recovery," said Mr. Fasulo.

Resort hotels are benefiting as businesses and consumers spend more. In November, revenue per available room was $78.14, up 8% from the prior year, according STR, a hotel research firm. Occupancy climbed to 57.8%, from 56.4% a year earlier.

What's more, research from MLV & Co., which tracks publicly held hotels, shows that convention-center bookings are up 5% for 2014 after being down 1% at this time in 2013. "You're seeing leisure accelerate across resorts [and] investors can see the group bookings on the books," said MLV analyst Ryan Meliker. "You've got more confidence and willingness to pay up for those assets."

Industry watchers expect resort deals to continue to be hot in 2014. "Resorts in general, and Florida resorts, are viewed as highly attractive," said Dan Peek, who leads brokerage HFF's hotel practice. "The market has come around to the point that most resort markets are worthy investments."

The MetLife deal involved MetLife buying Silverpeak Real Estate Partners' 25% interest in several properties owned by Tishman Realty Corp., including the Westin New York Grand Central and the Sheraton Chicago Hotel & Towers. MetLife already owned a portion of the Swan and Dolphin hotels, so this deal brings its ownership to 59%.

The resort complex, which opened in 1989 and 1990 and has about 2,300 rooms, is located between Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios. Disney doesn't own the buildings, but it owns the underlying land and receives compensation. Westin runs the Swan while Sheraton operates the Dolphin.

The Swan's and Dolphin's occupancy rates were above 80% in 2013, up from the high 60s in 2002, according to Morningstar. "The properties perform much better relative to their peer groups," Morningstar wrote. The firm calculated the revenue per available room at more than $139 and the annual net cash flow at $39 million. It values each room at $211,217.

The resort complex, which opened in 1989 and 1990 and has about 2,300 rooms, is located between Epcot and Disney's Hollywood Studios. Disney doesn't own the buildings, but it owns the underlying land and receives compensation. Westin runs the Swan while Sheraton operates the Dolphin.

The Swan's and Dolphin's occupancy rates were above 80% in 2013, up from the high 60s in 2002, according to Morningstar. "The properties perform much better relative to their peer groups," Morningstar wrote. The firm calculated the revenue per available room at more than $139 and the annual net cash flow at $39 million. It values each room at $211,217.

Corrections & Amplifications MetLife Inc. purchased a share of the Westin New York at Times Square. An earlier version of this article said MetLife purchased a share of the Westin New York Grand Central.

Thailand Likely to Cut Rates as Crisis Persists; Economists Forecast Another Quarter-Percentage-Point Cut to 2.25% Amid Political Unrest

BANGKOK Thailand's central bank is expected to cut interest rates at its meeting Wednesday as political unrest continues to engulf the exporter of automobiles and electronics.

Almost daily antigovernment protests, many of them violent, have destabilized the country since late last year. Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra has called elections for Feb. 2 but the opposition says they will boycott the polls, meaning a likely protracted battle.

At the Bank of Thailand's most recent meeting, as political protests started to gather steam in November, the bank cut rates by 0.25 percentage point to 2.25%.

Policy makers are likely to follow that up Wednesday with another cut of 0.25 percentage point, said Rahul Bajoria, an economist with Barclays in Singapore, one of a number of economists expecting a cut. Consumer prices rose only 1.67% in December from the year-ago period, and global oil prices are falling, which means the bank has room to cut rates without sparking inflation, Mr. Bajoria said.

"It would send out a message the central bank wants to support growth," he said.

Even before the instability, the outlook for Thailand's economy was shaky. Exports, which account for around two-thirds of the economy, have performed poorly, declining 4.1% on the year in November, the latest month for which data are available.

The automobile industry is suffering because of weak demand in other Asian markets. Exports from the nation's electronics industry, which supplies parts for personal computers but not the fast-growing smartphone market also have been disappointing.

The turmoil is taking its toll on the economy. Tourism, which accounts for 7% of national output, has been hard hit as foreign travelers postpone journeys. Plans to build multibillion-dollar infrastructure, including high-speed rail lines, look likely to face delays amid the political gridlock.

The Finance Ministry last week slashed its growth forecast for 2014 to 3.1%, compared with an earlier projection of 3.5% to 4.0%. Failure to push ahead this year with the 2.2 trillion baht ($66.6 billion) infrastructure plan could push growth as low as 2%, the ministry estimated.

Tim Condon, an economist with ING in Singapore, also says the central bank needs to convince the market that rates will stay low until growth picks ups.

"An aggressive rate cut accompanied by a statement saying that growth has fallen well below the BoT's forecast, and rates will remain low to reverse this state of affairs, would lead me to up my GDP growth forecast," Mr. Condon said.

ING is forecasting growth at 3% for 2014, lower than Thailand's trend rate of growth of 4.5%. Mr. Condon expects a 0.25 percentage point cut Wednesday. Others expect further cuts in the near future.

"The recent political impasse poses significant downside risks to growth, which could prompt further rate cuts over the coming months as the central bank looks to support the domestic economy," said Fred Gibson, an economist at Moody'sAnalytics.

Such monetary easing, though, might have little direct effect in the current environment. The previous rate cut failed to filter through into higher bank lending because Thai banks are currently trying to reduce debt exposure.

Thai household debt stands at 80% of gross domestic product, one of the highest ratios in Asia, reflecting years of aggressive lending to finance house purchases and auto loans. A government tax rebate two years ago for first-time car owners also helped boost debt levels.

"Lowering borrowing costs would not be able to provide much boost to either consumption or investment given the damped confidence and household leverage," said Kobsidthi Silpachai, head of capital markets research at Kasikornbank, a Thai bank. He said he is expecting the bank to hold rates steady.

Others say inflation could become an issue down the road if monetary policy is kept easy, pushing investors to pull out of Thai stocks and bonds. That could put further pressure on the Thai baht, which already is trading at a three-year low of 32.86 to the U.S. dollar.

Usara Wilaipich, an economist with Standard Chartered in Thailand, says the currency weakness could become inflationary. She said she expects the central bank to maintain its policy rate Wednesday.

"Given that Thailand is a net oil importer, any further baht weakening due to portfolio outflows or additional rate cuts would add to inflationary pressure," she said. "Policy makers need to balance the potential growth benefits of a rate cut against the potential inflationary impact."

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
US regulators 'funded at a level to fail'; News analysis; Budgets

The SEC and CFTC are falling further behind industry in technology investment, finds Joe Morris

Even with new budget increases, US securities regulators are falling further behind the market when it comes to technology investment, and the investment advisers and swaps dealers they oversee are likely to remain largely uninspected.

The first comprehensive federal spending plan since 2009, hammered out in Congress last week, raises the Securities and Exchange Commission funding by $29m, to $1.35bn, or $324m below the White House's request . The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) budget rises about $10m, to $215m, or $100m less than requested .

The additional funding sought by the administration for the SEC was intended to pay in part for the hiring of 250 examiners dedicated to registered investment advisers, whom the regulator now examines only once every 11 years on average.

"Whatever increase in the examination of advisers they are able to perform will have to be gained through efficiencies, and while I am certain that examiners' productivity can be increased, I don't think we can expect to see a significant change in the overall examination rate," says Neil Simon, vice-president for government relations at the Investment Adviser Association.

The CFTC will be able to reinstate a number of staff positions eliminated during across-the-board budget cuts last year. However, it too was hoping to add examiners for newly registered swaps dealers, execution facilities and clearing houses - one of the commission's new responsibilities under the Dodd-Frank financial reform law.

"To an enormous extent, they are going to be dependent on the industry self-regulatory organisations to provide that oversight," says Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America.

"The SEC situation is bad, but the CFTC situation is criminal."

The spending plan, meanwhile, cuts in half a $50m "reserve fund" the SEC has used for investing in its technology infrastructure. This includes the "consolidated audit trail", a multi-billion-dollar trade-tracking system that became a priority at the commission following the 2010 flash crash.

Financial services companies are, by contrast, maintaining their technology spending at about 1.5 per cent of revenue, according to research from IPC Systems, the developer of trading communications systems.

"The SEC and CFTC have a tremendous challenge ahead of them, both in terms of having the investment dollars needed for technology and for people," says Bart Bartolozzi, senior product marketing manager at IPC.

"Both of them want to build these large data repositories and push all the data that they have pulled from investigations into it and run analytics against it," he says. "Now, they have to react to an issue that has happened; they do not have much of a historical context to say this is something that this firm has historically done that we need to check."

Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, the financial reform advocacy group, contends the technology allocations suggest the SEC and CFTC are "funded at a level to fail".

"What both agencies are trying to do is get a better understanding of high-speed computer trading and how it is affecting markets, and yet they are not getting anywhere near the ability to do that," Mr Kelleher says. "When you cut the reserve fund at the SEC by 50 per cent, and on top of that you underfund them overall, you really are putting them in an impossible position."

Asset management companies tacitly acknowledge their distrust of market oversight through their gradual migration to dark pools and internalisers, or trading arrangements with brokers in which orders are matched within the brokers' own companies, Mr Kelleher says.

Indeed, Rosenblatt Securities estimates that more than 37 per cent of all US stock trades are now executed at off-exchange venues run by brokers.

"Asset managers and investors and traders are fleeing the exchanges to try and find a place where they are not the victims of predatory conduct," Mr Kelleher says.

"They are in internalisers and dark pools so that they can get fair execution."

M&A Firm Knows All, Even What You Drink

RICHMOND, Va. -- All investment banks say they focus on clients, but Harris Williams & Co. takes the practice to a new level.

The merger-and-acquisition specialist finds out all it can about executives at companies willing to buy or sell. Among details it gathers: languages they speak, their favorite cocktail and whether they are more window shoppers than reliable bidders.

Harris Williams, based here, is attempting to usher in data-mining techniques that have worked in other industries to answer a perennial Wall Street question: Will a deal be consummated?

For decades, deal makers have relied on personal relationships and connections to get deals done. But Harris Williams maintains that its focus on "predictive analytics" -- collecting and analyzing hundreds of thousands of data points in one main computer system shared by the firm -- helps it strike deals and minimize time wasted on talks that go nowhere.

Closing deals is every banker's goal because firms receive the bulk of their fees after a sale.

"We know that this knowledge leads to fewer failed deals," said Harris Williams co-founder and managing director Hiter Harris. The bank focuses on deals valued at around $1.5 billion or below involving smaller and midsize companies.

In November, the bank used its data to help guide the sale of automotive-collision-repair company Caliber Collision Centers to Omers Private Equity.

When compiling the initial list of potential buyers, Harris Williams looked at several variables such as whether a company had ever pursued an acquisition in this industry, said co-founder and managing director Chris Williams. When the time came for submitting bids, more than two-thirds of the group Harris invited submitted final offers, all of which were priced at or above where the bank expected them to be, according to Mr. Williams, who said the analytics helped generate that result.

Retailers and tech companies have long embraced predictive analytics, or collecting and crunching reams of data to anticipate future sales preferences.

The effort requires applying algorithms to the data to predict likely future outcomes. It is standard for companies from travel-booking website Orbitz Worldwide Inc. to Amazon.com Inc.

But the techniques are unlikely to gain wide acceptance among deal makers anytime soon. Asked about predictive analytics, some bankers said they don't want to bother inputting information, even if their bank supplies basic call-log software.

"I don't have time for that," said one veteran banker, who added that he would rather spend time meeting with clients than recording what they say.

Plus, sharing isn't exactly part of the sharp-elbowed culture of investment banking, where bonuses can turn on who receives credit for deals within a bank. Some bankers want to keep details of their client relationships private, even from colleagues.

Harris Williams's database was the brainchild of Mr. Harris and Mr. Williams, Harvard Business School classmates.

Mr. Harris, a math major and a self-described nerd, is a compulsive list maker and taskmaster. Across his desk, legal pads carry to-do lists. His Christmas shopping was done in October.

Not long after they started the company in 1991, both men took copious notes on clients, mostly private-equity firms. Back then, rudimentary tracking software sufficed because there weren't that many private-equity firms.

But in the past 30 years, the number of private-equity firms in North America has ballooned, making what Harris Williams bankers do a lot more complicated. In 1984, there were about 67 private-equity firms world-wide, according to data provider Preqin. Today, that number is 5,330.

So, Harris began meticulously chronicling all of its interactions with executives at private-equity firms and corporations. as well as their strategic goals and track record in deals. Its bankers were instructed to write down notes from every phone call, email, dinner and keep tabs on material from quantitative information, like how often a deal maker or firm dropped out of a sales auction before the final round, to personal details, like what years someone ran a marathon.

The thinking was that keeping close to a few dozen clients was relatively easy, but when that group grew into the thousands, they needed a more methodical approach, according to Mr. Harris.

"At the beginning it was pretty primitive," Mr. Harris said. But the important flagpole the bank planted was cultural, he said, especially as the firm itself grew. The bank employs more than 150 bankers across eight offices internationally.

The database has logic built into it, in the form of algorithms, that automatically generate data points bankers can use to predict behavior of potential buyers and sellers. Database training happens as soon as new hires join the firm, he said. The company established early on that if a banker knew something, it had to go in the database.

No one outside the firm has access to the database, including publicly traded PNC Financial Services Group Inc., which bought Harris Williams in 2005.

The data "can make all the difference in the world when you're picking between three companies who all appear to like the business you're selling," said Jay Jester, managing director on the private-equity team from Audax Group. Mr. Jester said he has tapped Harris Williams to help buy and sell a number of companies.

When Harris Williams was trying to help an oil-field-services company sell itself several years ago, executive managing director Ned Valentine persuaded his client's board to meet with a company that submitted a relatively low first bid. Based on the bank's 15 years of data on how this bidder acted in sales processes, Mr. Valentine predicted that the company had a tendency to raise its final bid significantly from its initial offer. So the board agreed to meet with the company, Mr. Valentine recalls. Ultimately, the potential buyer increased its offer by more than 50% and bought the company, he said.

"There is a real, selfish motive to doing this. We want to win," Mr. Williams said.

Time Warner Sells Manhattan Office Space to Related for $1.3 Billion; Related Cos. to Lease Back Space Until 2019

Time Warner Inc. confirmed Thursday it sold its office space at the Time Warner Center in Manhattan for $1.3 billion to developer Related Cos. and will lease back the office space until 2019.

Related and Time Warner were close to a deal but needed financing for the bid, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this week. Two sovereign-wealth funds the Government of Singapore Investment Corp. and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority have aided Related in purchasing the 1.1 million square feet of office space.

As part of the deal, Time Warner will relocate to a building that Related plans to develop in its Hudson Yards project on Manhattan's far West Side. Time Warner said it would acquire more than one million square feet of available commercial space in 30 Hudson Yards located at the southwest corner of 10th Avenue and 33rd Street.

The company expects about 5,000 employees from its corporate operations and its HBO, Turner Broadcasting, and Warner Bros. businesses to occupy the Hudson Yards space by the end of 2018.

Time Warner and Related have agreed to develop Hudson Yards and expect to finish the final building development documents in the first half of the year. Related hasn't completed financing for that building.

Time Warner spent about $520 million to construct its current headquarters about a decade ago. Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes said the move is an important step in the company's two-year long process to start consolidating its New York operations.

Thursday's deal marks one of the biggest in a surge of deals involving foreign investors in U.S. commercial real estate. Increased demand from overseas has helped drive U.S. commercial property values to record levels, particularly in major cities favored by global firms.

Foreign buyers are seeking out the U.S. as a place to spend their growing piles of cash, particularly as other markets such as Europe remain anemic. Non-U.S. buyers purchased more than $46 billion of property in 2013, up from $35 billion in 2012 and the most since 2007, according to real estate data firm RealCapital Analytics Inc.

S&P 500 Nabs Another Record

A two-day rally in stocks carried the S&P 500 to an all-time high, as Bank of America and Apple fueled outsize gains in financial and technology shares.

The S&P 500 index advanced 9.50 points, or 0.5%, to close at 1848.38, topping the previous high of 1848.36 on Dec. 31.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 108.08 points, or 0.7%, to 16481.94. The Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 31.87 points, or 0.8%, to 4214.88, ending at its highest level in more than 13 years.

After the S&P 500's 30% climb in 2013, a sluggish start to 2014 left some investors scratching their heads. A surprisingly weak December jobs report last Friday spread more doubt and on Monday, the S&P 500 suffered its biggest one-day decline in months.

But stocks bounced back Tuesday after a strong round of retail-sales data sparked a rally. Optimism carried into Wednesday as upbeat corporate news mixed with positive global economic reports. The S&P 500 is up 1.6% over the past two sessions, erasing all early-year declines.

"The market wasn't ready to crack," said Michael Antonelli, an equity sales trader at Robert W. Baird & Co. "Clients have remained steadfast in their equities."

Technology shares were among the biggest gainers. Apple advanced $10.97, or 2%, to $557.36 after Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company's recent agreement with China Mobile helped drive record iPhone sales in China in the first quarter.

Bank of America rallied 38 cents, or 2.3%, to 17.15 after the banking giant reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded analyst estimates amid improving credit quality.

"There's a little bit of enthusiasm reversal," said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at brokerage firm BTIG. "We feel earnings are going to be OK."

Kristina Hooper, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors, which has $409 billion in assets under management, said the market is likely to be swayed by each big data point in the weeks ahead. Still, she expects stocks to grind higher over the course of this year. "We're going to continue to be data driven, and as a result the market is likely to get more volatile," she said.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked up to 2.884% from 2.869% late Tuesday.

February crude-oil futures advanced 1.7% to settle at $94.17 a barrel, while January gold futures gave up 0.6% to settle at $1,238.10 a troy ounce. The dollar gained some ground against both the euro and the yen.

The Stoxx Europe 600 climbed 1%, ending with its highest close since January 2008.

The World Bank late Tuesday raised its 2014 global growth forecast by 0.2 percentage point to 3.2%. It also upgraded its growth outlook for the euro zone, helping offset data showing German economic growth slowed to 0.4% in 2013.

Asian shares moved higher early Thursday. Japan's Nikkei was up 0.6% amid a softer yen. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was up 0.4%, while the Shanghai Composite Index was up 0.1% and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was up 0.7%.

Payday lenders club together to create loans database

After repeatedly saying that it was impossible to create a database for payday loans the UK's largest payday lenders are clubbing together to set one up.

Wonga, Quick Quid, Mr Lender and ThinkFinance have all signed up to provide information to a real time credit-reporting system run by Callcredit, one of the country's largest credit reference agencies.

Lenders who participate in the payday loan database will be able to improve affordability checks by seeing whether a potential client has recently taken out a loan with another provider, and whether or not that loan has been repaid.

The U-turn comes as the industry attempts to convince the government and regulator that it is a responsible division of the UK's financial services industry after coming under attack for poor lending practises.

In November, the Treasury announced plans to set a cap on the amount that short-term lenders could charge borrowers. In December, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills declared that this move would not go far enough and recommended that providers should be forced to share information about their clients in a more effective way through a real time database.

In the US, a number of states, including Florida and Oklahoma have already introduced statewide databases for payday lenders. Last year, a group of payday lenders in Alabama filed a lawsuit against the state in an attempt to stop the creation of its database.

Callcredit said that payday lenders would not be the only beneficiaries of the new system and that mainstream lenders had also shown interest. The database will be open for testing in April and operational by mid-May. Callcredit does not plan to charge users more to upload information to the daily database than it does for its existing monthly system.

"The existing systems in which providers upload information monthly were designed for traditional mainstream lending, such as mortgages, which occur on a less frequent basis," said Peter Mansfield, managing director of Callcredit.

"The lending landscape has changed, so introducing daily reporting will give a clearer insight into a borrower's credit history."

Online payday lenders typically provide customers with access to small sums of money for less than 30 days at a high cost. The fees charged can be equivalent to annual interest rates of more than 6,000 per cent.

As the UK's payday loans industry has undergone rapid growth its detractors have grown more voluble, accusing companies of irresponsible lending and pushing vulnerable borrowers into serious financial difficulty.

Wonga, which has more than 1m customers, insists that the company already uses thousands of pieces of information for every loan decision. "Wonga is a business built on the intelligent use of quality data to make accurate and responsible lending decisions," said head of decision analytics, Rael Sarembock.

"The market wasn't ready to crack," said Michael Antonelli, an equity sales trader at Robert W. Baird & Co. "Clients have remained steadfast in their equities."

Technology shares were among the biggest gainers. Apple advanced 2% after Chief Executive Tim Cook said the company's recent agreement with China Mobile helped drive record iPhone sales in China during the first quarter.

Bank of America rallied after the banking giant reported fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded analyst estimates amid improving credit quality.

"There's a little bit of enthusiasm reversal," said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at brokerage firm BTIG. "We feel earnings are going to be OK."

Kristina Hooper, U.S. investment strategist at Allianz Global Investors, which has $409 billion in assets under management, said the market is likely to be swayed by each big data point in the weeks ahead. Still, she expects stocks to grind higher over the course of this year.

"We're going to continue to be data driven, and as a result the market is likely to get more volatile," she said.

On the economic front, the New York Federal Reserve's Empire State index of manufacturing activity for January jumped well above expectations. The producer-price index for December increased 0.4%, in line with expectations. Excluding food and energy, prices rose 0.3%, higher than forecasts of a 0.1% increase.

The Mortgage Bankers Association said mortgage applications rose 12% on a seasonally adjusted basis in the latest week, with sharp increases in both purchase applications and refinancing activity.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury note ticked down to 2.884% from 2.869% late Tuesday.

February crude-oil futures advanced 1.7% to settle at $94.17 a barrel, while January gold futures gave up 0.6% to settle at $1,238.10 a troy ounce. The dollar gained some ground against both the euro and the yen.

In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 climbed 1%, ending with its highest close since January 2008.

The World Bank late Tuesday raised its 2014 global growth forecast by 0.2 percentage point to 3.2%. It also upgraded its growth outlook for the euro zone, helping offset data showing German economic growth slowed to 0.4% in 2013, slightly below expectations of 0.5% growth.

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei Stock Average climbed 2.5% as a strong U.S. gain and a slightly weaker yen helped the market recover most of what it lost on Tuesday. Meanwhile, China's Shanghai Composite slipped 0.2%.

In other corporate news, General Motors declared a 30-cents-a-share quarterly dividend, its first since 2008, but the auto maker said Wednesday it expects 2014 earnings to improve "modestly" over last year.

ExOne skidded after the 3-D printer maker cut its revenue outlook.

Fastenal slipped after the tool-maker said sales and margins trends continued to weaken in most recent quarter.

Markets
Fed Eyes Banks' Commodity Activities; Some Say Companies Use Their Foothold in Market to Influence Supply Flows and Prices; Risk Also an Issue

WASHINGTON The Federal Reserve took a small step toward developing potential new restrictions on banks' activities in physical-commodity markets such as aluminum and oil, but it stopped short of introducing new rules.

The Fed, which has been studying the issue for at least two years, said it wants to examine "all aspects" of bank-owned commodity businesses, including "potential conflicts of interest" at the banks and the risks that commodity subsidiaries might pose to financial stability. The regulator said it will give banks and other parties two months to submit input on how it should proceed before considering "what further action, including a rulemaking, is warranted."

The Fed's review comes amid growing controversy over claims that banks are using holdings such as metals warehouses, power plants and oil barges to influence the flow of commodities, as well as prices. Major industrial consumers of aluminum, such as Miller-Coors LLC, have complained that bank-owned metals warehouses have driven up prices and wait times to obtain supplies. A Miller representative didn't respond to requests for comment.

The Fed said it is considering several measures that could limit banks' ability or desire to own such businesses, including imposing additional capital requirements and capping the amount of and length of time banks can own such assets and the revenue they can derive from those activities.

Some banks are already preparing for new and potentially tougher restrictions. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. announced in July it would sell its physical commodity units and has narrowed its field of bidders for the assets to a final handful of parties. Morgan Stanley announced the sale in December of its division that stores, trades and moves physical oil and refined products, as well as its equity stake in Heidmar Holdings LLC, which manages pools of oil tankers. And Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has entertained offers for certain units, such as its Metro International Trade Services group of metal warehouses.

The Fed noted that the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley law allowed banks who were trading in commodities before October 1997 to continue doing so as long as those businesses accounted for less than 5% of their assets, a provision that grandfathered in commodity businesses at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The regulator asked whether those firms should face additional capital requirements or other restrictions to ensure activities at those firms "do not pose undue risks."

Spokesmen for Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and J.P. Morgan declined to comment on the Fed move.

The Fed said it was reviewing its policy given concerns that many of the firms it previously authorized to trade in such markets could be put at risk by their commodity businesses, such as delivery of physical assets like oil or aluminum. It cited recent disasters like the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear-plant meltdown in Japan and the fatal Pacific Gas & Electric Co. natural-gas pipeline explosion in San Bruno, Calif., in 2010 as examples of risks that could potentially destabilize the financial system if a bank were involved and subject to legal action.

The Fed's move disappointed politicians and consumer advocates who were expecting more forceful action. The central bank said last July it would reconsider policies that led it to grant waivers allowing banks to enter physical commodity markets and own related assets.

Sen. Sherrod Brown (D. Ohio), who plans a hearing on the issue Wednesday, said in a statement the Fed move was "overdue and insufficient." Senior officials from the Fed, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission are to testify at the afternoon hearing. The Fed official, banking-supervision director Michael Gibson, is expected to testify that the Fed could also prohibit banks from holding certain physical commodities that pose undue risks.

Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of the policy-analysis firm Federal Financial Analytics Inc., said the industry had been expecting the Fed to be more specific about a potential capital surcharge related to commodities, but the documents released by the Fed on Tuesday demonstrate an "an extremely cautious approach."

"A tried-and-true D.C. evasion tactic is to, just before being reprimanded on the Hill, call for a study or set up a task force. We see it here in its unchecked glory with a Fed study that should have commenced many months ago," said outgoing CFTC Commissioner Bart Chilton.

People familiar with the Fed's policy-making process said officials struggled with how broad and aggressive any new restrictions should be and what legal authority the central bank should use to pursue changes. Banks have been operating in physical commodity markets under differing exemptions and permissions for decades in some cases.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Scottish Mortgage is UK trust king; Fund focus

The investment trust is banking on biotech, writes Matthew Jeynes

The freshly crowned king of the UK investment trust industry, Scottish Mortgage, is banking on a series of new bets in the biotechnology sector as it tries to retain its leading position in 2014.

Late last year, Baillie Gifford's James Anderson, the manager of the trust, saw it eclipse the Alliance Trust to become the biggest trust listed in London, reaching a market capitalisation of 3bn.

Established in 1909, Scottish Mortgage has been helped by its global investment outlook. It gained 204.1 per cent in the past five years, compared with an 81.8 per cent gain from UK-focused arch rival Alliance Trust, according to FE Analytics, the data provider.

It has also benefited from longstanding bets on innovators such as Amazon and Google, the US internet groups.

Mr Anderson says areas such as healthcare, transport and energy would be the next to profit from technological innovation. Healthcare will be "the most important area" for innovation, he says, thanks to advances in biotechnology including the sequencing of the human genome.

The developments are both "fascinating and exciting" because they have the potential to "destroy so much market capital and tradition", he says.

The manager cites Illumina, the US-based gene sequencing group, now the fifth-largest holding in the trust, as a company at the forefront of these advances.

Illumina manufactures equipment used to analyse gene structures. It has been the subject of bid speculation in recent years, with US pharmaceutical heavyweight Roche making a failed approach in 2012.

Mr Anderson, along with deputy manager Tom Slater, has added a number of other biotechnology companies in recent months.

These include Genomic Health, a cancer research specialist, and Myriad Genetics, a molecular diagnostic company.

Mr Slater says it is impossible to know if the new companies will be the winners of the future but "the opportunity is so large that even partial success could be extremely lucrative".

Scottish Mortgage remains smaller than Alliance Trust in terms of its total assets, but it is bigger than its rival in terms of market capitalisation.

The trust's shares are currently trading at a slight premium to its net asset value, while Alliance Trust's shares are trading at a 12.3 per cent discount, according to data from the Association of Investment Companies.

Scottish Mortgage's shares reached a premium only recently, following a surge in demand in 2013. The managers have indicated they might issue new shares to satisfy the demand and prevent the premium hitting precarious levels.

In running the fund, Mr Anderson continues to focus on long-term investment with two main themes: the rise of China and the potential of new and disruptive technology.

In the past year, the managers also invested in Twitter, the microblogging service, during its initial public offering, as well as Tesla Motors, the electric car company founded by Elon Musk that has grown significantly in the past year.

IBM Creates Unit, Fund to Expand Watson's Reach

International Business Machines Corp. is creating a business unit for its Watson supercomputer and starting a $100 million venture-capital fund to spur more apps built on the technology, a bid to accelerate the promising system's slow transformation into a big business.

The venture fund is part of a more-than-$1 billion investment IBM will make into the new Watson unit, which IBM plans to grow to more than 2,000 people, from several hundred today, the company said. Many of the new hires will be salespeople and consultants to help clients devise ways to use Watson.

"We are now moving into more of a rapid-expansion phase," said Michael Rhodin, an IBM senior vice president who will lead the unit.

The announcement comes as IBM is having difficulty turning Watson into a salable line of software three years after the machine defeated two "Jeopardy" champions on TV. The Wall Street Journal earlier this week reported that Watson's revenue is far from the company's ambitious targets.

IBM Chief Executive Virginia "Ginni" Rometty has said she hopes Watson will generate $10 billion in annual revenue within 10 years, according to the transcript of an October 2013 conference call reviewed by the Journal. She set that target after the executive in charge of Watson projected it would bring in $1 billion of revenue a year by 2018. Watson had recorded total revenue of less than $100 million as of late October, according to the transcript.

The company won't disclose financial information for the Watson unit, which Mr. Rhodin said would remain part of IBM's business analytics software portfolio. IBM last year projected the analytics unit would grow to $20 billion in revenue by 2015, up from a previous $16 billion target.

IBM is looking to revive growth after six straight quarters of revenue declines. Company executives, led by Ms. Rometty, see Watson's smart software as a valuable tool to answer tough problems. The company is building versions of Watson that can comb through studies and patient records to determine the optimal treatment for a particular cancer, or examine a customer's portfolio and recommend an investment strategy.

But the software can take years to develop, and doesn't work with SoftLayer Technologies Inc., the cloud-computing provider IBM recently bought for $2 billion. Moreover, IBM has yet to figure out a business model for Watson. IBM may license the software or charge companies a fee to access a series of digital Watson "advisers." It is also exploring ways to share in a client's results, such as new revenue or cost savings.

"We've made incredible progress," said Mr. Rhodin. "There is lots more to do."

As part of Thursday's announcement, IBM said it is rolling out two new digital Watson advisers: one helps companies draw insights from mountains of digital data, and the other creates graphical visualizations of data. The company said it would also launch a "Digital Life" service online so consumers can experiment with Watson to, for example, build an app that suggests recipes based on a person's dietary restrictions.

Another effort, begun last fall, allows independent software developers to write Watson "apps," much like those for smartphones and tablets. IBM might take a cut of the developers' revenue, much as Apple Inc. does with its app store.

More than 750 people and businesses have contacted IBM about working with Watson, the company said.

IBM is assessing the proposals. The venture fund could attract startups to the Watson ecosystem and help them build their businesses faster, said Mr. Rhodin.

Fluid Inc., a San Francisco e-commerce consultant and software developer, hopes to build an app using Watson that would let consumers ask questions on a retailer's website, as they would with a sales associate in a store.

Fluid CEO Kent Deverell says the app could help people to more easily find the products they need and prompt more sales. But Fluid still needs to finish the app, and find retailers to use it.

"We would not be pursuing it if we did not think it had big commercial potential," he said.

Being a boomerang boss paid off for Dan Glaser.

He rejoined the executive team of Marsh Inc. 15 years after he left, shaking up management and showing improvement for the struggling insurance brokerage within months of taking charge. During his second time around, he says, "I very much understood the culture of the institution."

### picture data found, picture dimensions are 165 by 249, depth 1
pict091.jpg

Early last year, Mr. Glaser was rewarded with a promotion to chief executive of parent company Marsh & McLennan Cos. "His ascension largely reflected his successful turnaround of its biggest unit," recalls David Nadler, the recently retired vice chairman of the professional-services firm.

Many executives are making similar return trips these days, signaling an end to the negative stigma that was once attached to employment U-turns. They bring new skills, a different perspective and appreciation of their old employer without having to learn the ropes. But a comeback can also cause resentment and hurt morale. Smart planning may help you to avoid possible pitfalls and smooth your re-entry.

Among the U.S. business that have recruited former executives since 2012 are Procter and Gamble Co., J.C. Penney Co., PepsiCo Inc., Nike Inc., and Toys "R" Us Inc. Returnees are showing up outside the C-suite, too. A "http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304355104579236003135253082" in The Wall Street Journal noted that many businesses, facing a shortage of skilled workers, are eager to take back proven staffers.

And it isn't just the corporate sector: This month, William Bratton embarked on his second stint as New York Police Department Commissioner, a job he left in 1996.

Successful boomerangs typically depart on good terms and keep ties with key former associates. That was true for Mr. Glaser, who got rehired after he headed the U.K. and Irish operation of American International Group Inc., an insurance and financial-services firm. The first people Mr. Glaser pursued for his Marsh management team were two fellow alumni. "I convinced both of them to boomerang with me," he says.

Likewise for Alex Gorsky. He advanced to CEO of Johnson & Johnson in 2012, four years after he returned from rival health-care giant Novartis SA. He says he stayed in touch with CEO William Weldon and other J&J executives during his four-year absence. "I knew that I had broad support if I returned," he says. "That made the decision even easier."

It also helps to "return with humility," Mr. Gorsky recommends. He recollects calling every leader of his medical-device unit within days of rejoining J&J and telling them "that I was happy to be back." He was supervising prior peers, but "worked hard to not be resented," a person familiar with the matter remembers.

Larry Thompson acted humbly in a different way when he resumed the role of Pepsi's general counsel and corporate secretary in July 2012. He considered himself a newcomer even though he had been gone only 14 months.

"You are starting a new job as a boomerang,'' Mr. Thompson explains. "You need to partner with your colleagues. So, he didn't automatically reject changes that occurred within his Pepsi department while he taught law school. Some boomerang executives arrogantly insist that "the way things were done while I was here were absolutely the best way," he adds.

Neri Bukspan, an Ernst & Young LLP partner who returned last May after 11 years as chief accountant at Standard & Poor's, won acceptance from his current colleagues partly by slowing his usual rapid pace and delving deeper into their activities. He got the go-slow idea from his executive coach at the major accounting firm.

He concedes it can be uncomfortable for a returnee to step back rather than hit the ground running. "You think you know the old environment. But the environment has changed. You're different."

Certain executives flourish upon re-entry because they demonstrate useful expertise gained at other workplaces. Mr. Gorsky, for instance, says he recognized the potential benefits of centralized management during his Novartis stint. Named a J&J vice chairman in December 2010, he took control of a new manufacturing and supply group created to make sure all plants met quality standards. He then began to centralize and standardize supply chain and quality systems.

Matt Spielman returned to Return Path Inc. last April after working for three other businesses since 2002. The chief marketing officer of the marketing analytics firm frequently advises salespeople there about how to pitch senior marketers based on his six years selling advertising for a Viacom Inc. unit.

"I am able to walk in the shoes of our clients," Mr. Spielman observes. "Salespeople have said that my insights helped them see prospective clients in a different way."

Mr. Spielman managed to avoid a common pitfall. "You should not be superior and arrogant about all the things you learned" while you were away, cautions Ben Dattner, a New York executive coach.

Perhaps the most important advice of all? A boomerang executive who achieves results quickly "neuters the ability of others to be critical," says Ruth Porat, a senior investment banker rehired by Morgan Stanley & Co. in 1996 after three years at Smith Barney Inc. She did just that. In 2009, Ms. Porat became Morgan's chief financial officer and the most powerful woman on Wall Street.

U.S. stock benchmarks found little direction Wednesday as investors looked ahead to the afternoon release of the Federal Reserve's latest meeting minutes.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 55 points, or 0.3%, to 16476 in midday trade. The S&P 500-stock index edged up one point, or 0.1%, to 1839, and the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 17 points, or 0.4%, to 4170.

Stocks have retreated from 2013's closing high in the first trading sessions of the year, despite a handful of stronger-than-expected economic reports.

Traders and strategists said that buyers found little reason to step in on Wednesday ahead of the release of the Fed's minutes from its latest meeting, when officials announced a reduction of its easy-money bond-purchase program. The minutes were due at 2 p.m. EST.

"It stands to reason that stocks weren't going to shoot out of the blocks at the same trajectory as we saw equities rise in the fourth quarter of last year," said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. "That pace was unsustainable."

In economic news, Automatic Data Processing and Moody'sAnalytics said December job growth in the private sector increased to 238,000 from 215,000 in November. It was expected to slip to 200,000. The ADP report is seen as a preview of the U.S. government's job report, due Friday.

The report "is absolutely fantastic," said Colin Cieszynski, senior markets analyst with brokerage CMC Markets. "It looks like the U.S. economy is getting a lot of traction."

The news followed data Tuesday showing the trade deficit narrowed more than expected in November.

Earlier, the Mortgage Bankers Association said mortgage applications rose 2.6% on a seasonally adjusted basis in the latest week. A slight decline in purchase applications was offset by gains in refinancing activity.

In corporate news, Micron Technology rose 9.1% after the semiconductor maker reported fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue that were well above analyst estimates, boosted by the recent acquisition of Elpida Memory in the last year. The stock more than tripled in 2013 and was the second-best performer among S&P 500 components.

J.C. Penney shares dropped 8.1% after the company said it was "pleased" with its holiday season results, but didn't offer any sales figures in its statement.

Constellation Brands rallied 8.3% after the wine, beer and spirits company beat Wall Street's estimates for its fiscal third-quarter earnings and raised its projections for its yearly profits.

The Container Store Group slumped 14% after the company reported fiscal third-quarter earnings that topped forecasts, but provided a full-year earnings and revenue outlook below current forecasts. The results were the first since the company went public in November.

Ford Motor Chief Executive Officer Alan Mulally said Tuesday he won't leave the auto maker to take the CEO job at Microsoft when current CEO Steve Ballmer retires. Ford shares gained 1.6%, while Microsoft shares slipped 1.6%.

In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 index rose 0.1% to 329.75, its highest close since May 19, 2008.

Portugal's PSI 20 jumped 1.4% to 7055.27, led by a 2.7% rise for Banco Comercial Portugues.

November retail sales in the euro zone jumped 1.4% on the month, the fastest pace seen in 12 years, and well above expectations of a 0.1% rise. In addition, German manufacturing orders climbed 2.1% in November, topping forecasts for a 1.5% increase. Germany's trade surplus also increased more than expected.

Air France-KLM rose 7.3% after the airline reported a rise in passenger traffic of 2.1% and a load factor rise of 0.9 points.

Asian Stocks

Japan's Nikkei Stock Average rallied 1.9% to 16121.45, the first gain of 2014. The gains came as the dollar topped 105 yen, helping some exporters benefit from a weaker currency. Among them were Suzuki Motor, which gained 3%, while TDK added 2.4%.

There was a sharp move on the ChiNext, China's board for startup companies, which jumped 3.9% to 1405.02 after regulators gave insurers permission to buy shares on the board. The ChiNext was a rare ray of light in mainland China last year, surging 82.7%.

The Shanghai Composite declined 0.2% to 2044.34.

Investing in Funds & ETFs: A Quarterly Analysis --- Exchange-Traded Funds: Key Trends in a Milestone Year for ETFs --- As the oldest ETF turned 20, the industry saw new Fidelity funds and more money run by 'strategists'

It was a heady year for ETFs.

The year began with the 20th anniversary of SPDR S&P 500, the first and still the largest ETF in the U.S., and throughout 2013 investors kept up their voracious appetite for exchange-traded funds. Investors pumped a net $188.5 billion into U.S. ETFs and related exchange-traded products, according to IndexUniverse LLC. That topped 2012's record of $188.4 billion, despite heavy withdrawals from SPDR Gold Shares as the price of gold tumbled.

Here's a look at six key developments and issues in the ETF realm in 2013:

Fidelity Makes a Move

Fidelity Investments introduced 10 low-cost sector funds, a decade after launching what had been its only ETF, the Fidelity Nasdaq Composite Index ETF. The move expands its existing sector-fund business (of actively managed mutual funds) and challenges rival State Street Corp.'s popular line of Select Sector SPDRs. The Fidelity funds are based on MSCI indexes, with day-to-day management by a unit of BlackRock Inc. Yes, the same BlackRock that issues the market-leading iShares ETFs.

"It's a big and interesting partnership," says Matt Hougan, president of ETF analytics for IndexUniverse. "But it's not yet the game-changer that people were expecting." Each of the 10 funds has annual expenses of 0.12%, marginally lower than competing sector funds, but investor interest has been scant. Launched in late October, the funds hold $329 million in assets. That much sometimes moves in (or out) of several Select Sector funds in a day.

Shaking Up Index Funds

Even as the boring old market-capitalization-weighted S&P 500 soared 29.6% in 2013, investors rushed into exchange-traded funds and notes with alternative approaches to stock indexing.

As issuers and index firms debate the proper terminology for these approaches (smart beta, strategic beta, factor indexing, etc.), investors poured a net $42 billion into more than 400 such funds, bringing their assets to $155 billion, according to IndexUniverse. Varieties include products that equally weight their holdings, that pick stocks based on factors such as company earnings and dividend growth, and that focus on lower-volatility stocks.

Proponents say these strategies allow for more precise and calculated risk-taking. Opponents say such calculations themselves belie "pure" indexing. "The debate has more noise than substance," says Larry Petrone, research director for consulting firm kasina LLC, "but there is some evidence that combining factor-based strategies with traditional indexing can build a better risk-return profile."

Rise of the Strategists

An emerging class of asset manager continued to gather steam in 2013. Known collectively as ETF strategists, these investment advisers manage money using one or more strategies in which at least 50% of the holdings are in ETFs. As of September, portfolios tracked by Morningstar Inc. totaled $86 billion, up 37% in a year.

The largest ETF strategist is Windhaven Asset Management, a unit of Charles Schwab Corp., which managed $18.2 billion. "Tactical" and "hybrid" strategies, in which the managers expressly look to trim and trade their portfolios as markets move, account for 87% of the assets tracked by Morningstar.

An ETF strategist may be brought in by a financial adviser who previously called the shots on an investor's portfolio. In that case, clients "will want to know how the adviser's role compares with the role of the new asset manager, and how they'll learn about changes in the portfolio," says Morningstar analyst Andrew Gogerty.

Investors opting for an ETF strategist alongside their own adviser should be mindful of fees charged by each.

Vanguard's Big Gains

While BlackRock's iShares unit and State Street command the most U.S. ETF assets -- $662 billion and $392 billion, respectively -- the greatest beneficiary of the post-financial-crisis rush to low-cost, passive ETF investing has been Vanguard Group. In 2013, investors moved a net $55 billion into Vanguard ETFs, according to IndexUniverse, compared with $40 billion into iShares funds and $14 billion to State Street offerings. Vanguard's share of the ETF market has grown to 19.6% from 18.1% in a year, with $334 billion in ETF assets.

Active Management Lags

While some large bond ETFs are actively managed, active stock picking continues to be rare in ETFs. " 'Next year' has been the year for active equity every year since 2005," says Mr. Hougan of IndexUniverse.

At year's end, only $14.7 billion in assets were spread across 68 actively managed ETFs, with 50% of that split almost evenly between two Pimco fixed-income funds, according to XTF Inc.

The holy grail -- and potential watershed moment for active stock ETFs -- is said to be the regulatory blessing of nontransparent active ETFs. Unlike most other ETFs, these would disclose their holdings only quarterly -- and that means active managers wouldn't face concerns about front running and tipping off others in the marketplace.

Several fund families have applied to the SEC for the ability to offer such nontransparent actively managed ETFs. While chatter and filings picked up in 2013, it'll be "big news if it happens," says Mr. Hougan. Even then, it may take a few years for such funds to get a toehold.

Debating the 'Right' Price

When interest-rate anxiety led bond prices to tumble in May and June, some bond ETFs began trading at consistent discounts to their reported net asset value.

That created grumbling about perceived problems with the products, which are intended to trade at prices very close to the value of their underlying holdings. But it also highlighted a fundamental question to which there isn't a certain answer: When thinly traded securities such as some municipal bonds are packaged in easily traded ETFs, is the more accurate value the one calculated for the bonds (often without them actually trading) or the value reflected in the trading of the ETF shares?

"More and more, ETFs are becoming the true market," Mark Wiedman, global head of iShares, wrote in a letter to iShares investors at the end of June.

Sovereign debt investments are vulnerable, finds Matthew Jeynes

Western Asset Management, Legg Mason's giant bond fund subsidiary, has suffered torrid times in terms of its Global Multi Strategy Bond funds, as emerging market debt investments went into the red.

The Global Multi Strategy Bond funds, one based in Ireland and another in the UK, are designed to offer non-US investors access to California-based Western Asset's vast range of fixed income strategies in a single-fund format.

The Dublin-based version has $1.5bn in assets under management while the UK version has reached $1bn, making them two of the most significant products of their kind.

However, in spite of strong performance during the 2008 credit crisis, the funds' returns have been lacklustre over the past three years. The UK-based fund has had a three-year gain of 7.7 per cent compared with an average return from funds in the IMA's Global Bond sector of 8.8 per cent, according to data from FE Analytics, ranking it in the third quartile.

In the past year it lost 3 per cent, while funds in the wider sector lost 1.2 per cent.

The fund's ultra-aggressive 35 per cent weighting in emerging market debt, as well as volatile high-yield bond holdings, were sold down by the markets when it emerged the US Federal Reserve was calling time on its "easy money" policies of the past few years.

Ian Edmonds, who heads the London-based team that manages the fund, says they have been shifting out of emerging market corporate bonds and into the markets' government bonds instead.

"Recently, corporate bonds have outperformed sovereigns, so I have started to switch back into sovereign issuers in dollar terms," he says.

"I have been investing in countries such as South Africa and Hungary, where you can get 5 or 6 per cent yield on bonds that are 10 to 12 years in maturity."

The team has also closed racier currency positions, Mr Edmonds says, and is selling investment-grade bonds in developed markets as part of the wider switch into emerging market government bonds .

The net effect of the changes is that, while the overall risk levels in the portfolios should be lower, the emerging market debt weighting will remain largely unchanged.

Denise Collins, investment manager at City Asset Management, says the investment house has a "relatively negative" outlook for emerging market debt.

"The asset class looks cheaper, but sovereign debt will probably continue to underperform, assuming US Treasuries continue to reprice," she says.

"Shorter-maturity bonds should mitigate interest-rate volatility, and diversification is key, but the asset class remains vulnerable."

Adrian Lowcock, senior investment manager at Hargreaves Lansdown, the fund broker, says emerging market debt could start to look "interesting" if prices continue to fall.

"The best way to access emerging market debt for most investors is through a global bond fund, where the manager can tactically allocate to emerging markets," he says.

"It is hard to know when will be the right time to buy in. No one knows where the bottom of the market will be."

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Pension funds beat actuarial targets

Rebounding equity markets mean most UK pension funds are likely to have outperformed their actuarial assumptions over the past decade, according to State Street Investment Analytics.

Separately, US pension funds sponsored by S&P 1500 companies saw their funding ratios surge to 95 per cent at the end of December, according to Mercer, the consultancy, up from 74 per cent in December 2012 and the highest year-end figure since 2007.

State Street estimated that the average UK pension fund generated an investment return of 10 per cent in 2013. Charity funds, which typically have a greater exposure to "real" assets such as equities, thanks to their longer time horizons, will have done better still, returning 13 per cent.

As a result, the typical pension fund will have returned around 10 per cent a year over the past five years and 8 per cent per annum during the past decade, "comfortably exceeding most actuaries' assumptions for asset growth", said Jeanette Patrizio, senior vice-president of SSIA.

In 2012, the UK's Financial Services Authority told pension providers to reduce their midpoint projection for long-term returns from 7 per cent to just 5 per cent, in line with the forecasts of most European and Asian funds.

US funds are still factoring in long-term returns of 8 per cent a year. Many commentators believe this has allowed public plans in particular to sidestep painful reforms .

However, Mercer found the collective deficit of US private sector S&P 1500 schemes has fallen to $103bn, from $557bn a year ago.

The improvement was driven by a combination of strong equity returns and a rise in corporate bond yields, which allows schemes to discount their liabilities at a faster rate.

Despite these factors being replicated in the UK, Mercer said the accounting deficits of FTSE 350 schemes actually rose from 72bn to 97bn (a funding ratio of 85 per cent) last year, due to an increase in long-term inflation expectations.

Management
Companies Need to Be More Aware of Risk; Research Shows Real Dangers to Companies Are at Middle-Management Level

The year now ending has already seen its fair share of corporate scandals, sending shudders and shock waves through stock markets. From pharmaceutical bribery to the horse-meat scandal, phone hacking and recent oil spills, it is clear that no industry is safe from disrepute which raises the question, which of your employees will pose the biggest risk to your organization?

The financial sector has undoubtedly faced the greatest scrutiny and reforming the industry continues to be a key priority for governments across Europe. New regulation forcing banks to restructure their operations places increasing pressure on changing the "high stakes" culture of the trading floor.

But while many businesses are focusing on modifying regulatory policies and procedures, many are being blindsided by not assessing the people aspect of risk. People's actions what they do or fail to do can pose a huge risk to a business, which can impact share prices, break laws and catalyze industry reform.

But how do we define behavioral risk and how can we measure for it?

Employees, whether they are at senior, middle or front-line level, all possess certain risky traits that may cause harm to a company. What can be measured to assess behavioral risk is people's individual and collective resilience and appetite for risk by analyzing eight behaviors.

Resilience to risk is about assessing people's decision-making capabilities and how effective their communication skills are. The riskiest leaders and managers will misjudge the impact a certain decision could have on the organization; they'll restrict who they consult before making the decision and are likely to gloss over crucial data. Communication-wise, riskier managers will be poorer at articulating those decisions and setting an appropriate tone for others to follow. At the front line, people will ignore procedures, have an inability to accept individual or shared responsibility, or just focus on "getting things done," without due care and attention.

The responsibility for many recent scandals has often been placed at the feet of senior leaders and CEOs. But it isn't just decision-making at the top that should come under scrutiny; actually it is their failing to address people's actions further down the chain.

By not addressing the root cause, businesses are self-perpetuating risk. Whilst risk cannot be eliminated, it has an upside and a downside and organizations need to be aware of their own appetite for and resilience to risk so it can be managed in a constructive way.

Exclusive data for The Wall Street Journal Europe taken from CEB's SHL Talent Analytics database measures how risky 20,000 employees are across a range of industry sectors in Europe. It paints a distinctly different picture of where the greatest behavioral risk lies across an organization and it isn't at the C-suite level.

The data reveals that behavioral risk is, in fact, lower at more senior levels: showing that one-in-21 executive leaders across Europe are risky, (which is considerably lower than the global average of one in 15 at this level).

This means there is a lower proportion of senior executives who are likely to create risk in the organization. This is what you would hope to see, given the seniority of decision-making at board level.

European senior managers possess slightly higher levels of risk at one in 14. As organizations depend upon senior leaders to account for and mitigate risk, finding managers that exhibit lower levels of behavioral risk is crucial.

There is, however, is still behavioral risk at the top, which means organizations need to examine just how effective their senior leaders are when managing this element. For example, are they failing to listen to good advice from others? And are they keeping the overall company strategy in mind when making important decisions for the business?

Furthermore, behavioral risk increases significantly as you continue down through the corporate hierarchy. We've calculated that one in eight middle managers in European businesses display risky behavioral traits, which usually include poor decision-making and weak communication.

The number of middle managers in corporate hierarchies amplified this risk, further increasing the chances of a corporate scandal. The data also reveals that one in five individual contributors (or front-line staff) possess similar behaviors to their middle-manager counterparts, which is a matter of concern for product assurance and customer service.

From our data we found that there is an execution gap at the middle-manager level. Yet there are the employees with a critical role to play as the interface between strategy set at the top and operational execution. Managing compliance issues and instilling commitment in front-line staff, whilst communicating decisions from leaders in a relevant way so staff feel motivated, is no easy task. So why is the risk at this level so high?

It could be that employers have sought to retain talent by promoting employees with strong technical backgrounds into middle management positions. Lack of investment in training and development has resulted in a generation of managers who aren't equipped with the critical skills necessary to effectively communicate and manage people and therefore pose a significant risk to that particular organization. It is, in fact, vital that these middle managers are equipped with the right skill set and given appropriate support to be successful in their role. If these issues aren't addressed, a subsequent error or ongoing compliance issue could damage a company's reputation or profit margin in some cases irreparably.

While European executives are transforming their business to adapt to new markets, aligning talent to meet these changes is a major challenge. The board needs to ask themselves whether they have the right talent in place at the middle management level and whether they've invested enough in them. Equipping board members with this information is crucial to support rapid change, and will help them to adjust their talent pipelines to support the businesses objectives.

Companies should also look at how they are empowering staff to raise concerns if they are to improve their approach to risk. Enforcing ethical standards and having an effective channel by which frontliners and middle managers feel comfortable communicating issues is essential. This will help to boost compliance and commitment from employees when their views are being noticed. Too often, whistleblowers are ignored, or even demonized, but senior managers need to listen more to viewpoints from across the business to pick up and act on vital clues that will help them manage risk more effectively.

CEB also analyzed risk across 17 industries identifying which ones are the most risky in Europe. It found that there is a one in five chance of attracting and employing someone with a high level of behavioral risk at every level in both the engineering and oil & gas sectors. This is worrying, given the potential environmental damage at stake here.

Industries such as banking and health care also attract a higher than average level of risk among employees, with a one in six chance. This comes as no surprise given the recent stories in the U.K. around mistreatment of patients and the financial product mis-selling epidemic. It is clear that these sectors are less likely to be taking behavioral risk into account when they attract and hire people due to the hard technical skills needed to carry out the job. To be an effective middle manager, however, softer skills such as listening and consulting are vital to managing and motivating a team and CEB's data show that these sectors are really lacking in these.

On the other hand, professional services and retail average only one in eight employees with high behavioral risk. Perhaps because these industries are client- and customer-focused, softer people skills are crucial. Effective performance in a job isn't just about what you know, but also how you manage a team to meet overall business goals.

If we are to learn from the so-called toxic company cultures portrayed in the media, organizations must view risk holistically, considering policies, procedures and people together. To avoid the corporate blind-spot, the C-suite needs to have a better understanding of how their employees behave, something that should be an important part of a human resources departments work. The board needs this insight to take a view on a company's level of resilience and the appetite for risk across the business.

Some level of risk is to be expected; what is important is how the organization manages it. Recent events, particularly in the banking sector, have focused on the negative consequences of not managing risk effectively, and quite rightly so.

But organizations need to know that there can be a positive impact from risk. It is about striking the right balance between creating risk to seize on new markets whilst being resilient.

The technology sector is a good example of this, where the market is so competitive that companies are constantly taking risks and innovating to make the next leap forward. Nevertheless, organizations need to be aware of the boundaries between achieving a competitive advantage without finding themselves in their next corporate crisis.

While many businesses are waking up to the need for broader understanding of the people they employ, most are at an early stage of comprehending how people's behavior impacts reputation and company performance. Risk is complex, global in nature and continues to challenge the most talented of business leaders. Unless risk is viewed in the round and the board has the relevant insight on its people, 2013 and beyond will continue to be mired with corporate scandals.

2013 In Review: Developed Economies Retake Growth-Engine Role

By Brenda Cronin

The global economy's jagged recovery inched forward in 2013, with fast-growing emerging markets losing pace while developed nations gained strength.

The 2013 performance reflected something of a role reversal among the players. After years of notching far slower growth than many emerging-market counterparts, some leading economies are at last showing strength. The global snapshot also reveals the far-flung effects of monetary policy, as decisions by central bankers in developed nations reverberated through emerging markets.

In 2013, central banks in the U.S., Japan and Europe showered money on their economies, held interest rates low and promised to continue to do so in a bid to animate a recovery that remains tepid almost five years after the worst recession since the Great Depression. In emerging markets such as Brazil and India, domestic demand softened and exports sagged as rates were boosted to stem inflation.

Despite the contrasting fortunes, the overall global economy appeared to be on a surer footing as the year ended. The International Monetary Fund forecasts that world output will grow 3.6% in 2014, compared with a 2.9% estimate for 2013.

The combination of fast-growing economies slowing slightly while the developed world picks up the pace sets the stage for "synchronized growth," in 2014, said Tu Packard, senior economist at Moody'sAnalytics. That means, she said, that "demand from developed markets will support developing-market growth, and they will support each other."

As the year unfolded, the euro zone limped out of recession. In Japan and the U.S., consumers repaired their personal balance sheets and resumed spending, although businesses remained wary about committing to new workers or investment.

Japan, several years late to the stimulus party, in April launched a bond-buying campaign that surpassed the scale of the Federal Reserve's $85 billion-a-month program as a share of gross domestic product. The European Central Bank cut its main interest rate to record territory, lowering it to 0.25% in November. The ECB said in December that the currency bloc's economy likely will have shrunk 0.4% this year before growing by 1.1% in 2014.

The U.S. illustrates one half of the shifting dynamic, with strength in the labor and housing markets as well as third-quarter growth at a 4.1% annualized pace. The coming year won't be entirely free of economic hurdles, cautioned Eric Lascelles, chief economist of RBC Global Asset Management, but the headwinds "will be distinctly lighter than last year."

The U.S. economy picked up momentum in 2013 as the drag from changes in government spending and taxation faded. Although cuts in government spending are expected to slightly diminish 2014's growth, they are likely to be a far less powerful brake than the payroll-tax increase, earlier spending cuts and fiscal brinkmanship that affected businesses and consumers in 2013. The two-year budget deal reached by Congress at year's end has defused some economic uncertainty as well.

The U.S. unemployment rate, at 7.0%, is well below its recession peak of 10% in October 2009, but above the 4.7% level before the downturn. More jobs, along with rising stock and housing markets, helped propel household net worth in the third quarter to a record level. However, the gains in wealth tilt heavily toward those invested in stocks, said Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist of RBC Capital Markets.

Against this generally improved backdrop, the Fed judged the U.S. economy healthy enough to receive less support and decided at its December meeting to cut back its bond-buying program.

Showing the fraught relationship between policy in developed markets and performance in emerging markets, the prospect of a Fed cutback in bond buying roiled financial markets in many developing countries earlier in the year. With the Fed keeping interest rates near zero for almost five years, investors have sought higher returns elsewhere, in part driving the boom in developing markets. When Fed monetary policy eventually returns to historically normal conditions, these global capital flows will tend to seek out the higher rates and greater stability offered by developed markets.

So far, the global economic recalibration is playing out in a relatively measured way in emerging markets despite the bumps.

China's economy expanded at the slowest rate in 20 years, crimping growth across the region. But the second half of the year brought reassurance that the world's second-largest economy had avoided a hard landing.

Decelerating growth, a weak currency and rising prices continued to bedevil India, where the central bank in October raised one of its key lending rates in hopes of slowing inflation. Aging infrastructure and a difficult climate for foreign investment weighed on Asia's third-largest economy, where the rupee was hit hard midyear by talk of the coming Fed reduction in bond buying.

In Latin America, many nations fell short of early-2013 growth forecasts. Brazil, the region's powerhouse, is expected to have expanded just over 2%, missing predictions of 4%-plus growth. With industry moribund, forecasts for 2014 -- when Brazil will host the soccer World Cup and hold presidential elections -- aren't optimistic.

Realistic Financial Resolutions for 2014

Making financial resolutions for the new year is easy sticking to them is an entirely different story.

With this in mind, we posed the following question to The Experts: What's one realistic financial resolution people can make?

This discussion relates to the latest Wealth Management Report and formed the basis of a discussion on The Experts blog on Dec. 17.

OLIVIA S. MITCHELL: Each New Year's Eve, millions of us make financial resolutions for the next 12 months and predictably, most of us never end up keeping them. But as this year-end approaches, it's time to heed Benjamin Franklin, a very wise man, who knew a secret: "You may delay but time will not, and lost time is never found again."

So what should we look out for in 2014? Here are my suggestions:

Figure out how to reward yourself when you do something difficult. My colleague Katherine Milkman discovered that people who can only read their favorite trashy novels at the gym are much more likely to get their exercise. Dina Pomeranz shows us how to make not spending fun with a saving buddy you text/email every time you move toward your goal. Set up a low-cost online savings account with a motivating title ("My Reward Fund"), and put any change you have toward it. It'll add up.

Make it easy on yourself. Put every bill you can on autopay, including the bill for your own retirement. Call your human-resources office or log on to your retirement-savings website and bump up your pension contributions. Be sure to put in enough to get your full employer match for the best return on your saving dollar. If possible, set up auto-escalation so that every year, your percentage contribution to the retirement plan increases automatically. As Mother used to say, "If you don't see it, you won't spend it!"

Invest in financial literacy: It'll pay you the rest of your life. Our financial knowledge quiz is a nice way to take stock of what you need to learn, and some fun free videos can help you make better financial decisions. Wharton also has a free website for educators, students and just plain folks offering over 400 lessons on personal finance, economics, entrepreneurship, accounting and marketing.

Olivia S. Mitchell is a professor of business economics and public policy at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania where she focuses on pensions, household finance and risk management.

GREG MCBRIDE: Track your spending. By consistently tracking your spending every dollar that goes out the door this becomes the starting point for other good financial habits such as setting and adhering to a budget, regular savings and maximizing efficiency in your spending. The essence of building wealth requires someone to spend less than they bring in, and tracking your spending against a budget is the scorecard to which you can hold yourself accountable.

Greg McBride (@BankrateGreg) is a senior financial analyst and vice president for Bankrate.com, providing analysis and advice on personal finance.

MANISHA THAKOR: This new year, commit to paying your financial knowledge forward by sharing your best and worst financial moves with someone younger whom you care about.

Unlike other areas of our life fitness, nutrition, parenting, etc. our financial well-being isn't a topic that many of us talk about socially with our family and friends. As a result, many young people head out into their work lives with unrealistic expectations around spending and savings. Just think of the difference you could make in someone's lives by sharing lessons such as these:

Avoiding credit-card debt, and if you do have it, developing a plan to pay off more than the minimum monthly payment each month.

Starting to save for retirement (via 401(k)s, 403b, IRAs) as early as possible in your working years.

How to figure out how much car or home you can truly afford (Hint: It's usually less than a bank is willing to lend you!)

As an added benefit, when you share your hard-earned financial knowledge with the next generation you will naturally find yourself becoming more mindful about your own finances. It's the same way, once you start walking or going to the gym regularly, you naturally find yourself being more mindful of what you eat.

So this 2014, commit to helping a young person in your family, your office, or your community increase their financial well-being. That one simple step will pay dividends to you as well!

Manisha Thakor (@ManishaThakor) is founder and chief executive of Santa Fe, N.M.-based MoneyZen Wealth Management LLC.

LARRY ZIMPLEMAN: The most realistic and important financial resolution that people can make is to live within their means. That means setting aside some amounts to invest out of every paycheck not just when it's convenient. It's important to pay yourself just like you pay for food, transportation, housing, etc. You will gain a real feeling of control once you see those amounts accumulate over time.

Larry D. Zimpleman is chairman, president and chief executive of Principal Financial Group.

MIKE PIPER: Save 1% more. That is, increase your retirement savings contributions by 1% of your gross income.

Near the end of each year, financial planner and blogger Jim Blankenshiprallies the personal finance blogosphereto encourage people tosave 1% more per year. And it is a great idea.

Bumping up your savings rate by 1% results in a small change to your take-home pay so small that you might not even notice the difference in terms of your monthly budget. But the impact on your net worth over time could be dramatic.

As of this writing, the personal savings rate in the U.S. isjust 4.9%. In other words, if you're currently average, to increase your savings rate by 1%, the proportion by which you would have to reduce your spending is very small, but the proportion by which your savings rate would increase is huge (roughly one-fifth).

This strategy can work wonders if you're young. Increase your savings rate by 1% this year, then do the same thing next year. And the year after that. If you start right when you get your first job out of school, you'll be saving at a pretty good pace well before you hit the peak earning years of your career.

Mike Piper (@michaelrpiper) is a Missouri-licensed CPA and the author of the blog ObliviousInvestor.com. He is also the author of several personal-finance books, including his latest, "Social Security Made Simple."

CHARLES ROTBLUT: One resolution you can easily complete before January ends is to create an emergency plan for your finances. This is a document instructing your spouse, children or trusted adviser on what to do if you are suddenly unable to manage your finances. Ideally, this document should cover how you want your portfolio managed, where your banking and investment accounts are located, all outstanding loans, what bills are sent to you in electronic form or automatically paid, and insurance information. It doesn't need to include account numbers, but the person you trust to step in should be able to step in to either directly access those accounts or have power of attorney enabling them to do so.

Having an emergency plan does three things. First, it helps to ensure your finances are managed the way you would like them to be. Second, it creates one less worry for your spouse or children at a time when they will be stressed. Third, it gives you a blueprint to fall back upon when you are worried about what the market is doing and are unsure of what the best long-term decision is.

Charles Rotblut (@charlesrotblut) is a vice president with the American Association of Individual Investors.

MICHELLE PERRY HIGGINS:Instead of trying to completely change spending or savings habits, I say: Start small. For example, my "1% rule" is an easy resolution to make and keep. My recommendation to investors is to increase their retirement savings by a mere 1%. That is it. One small percentage increase. The amount isn't outrageous and is therefore achievable in most budgets. Many times I hear, "Michelle, I didn't even notice it was gone when I got my paycheck." But when they check their retirement savings account balance at the end of the year, they are often surprised at how much of a difference that 1% can make.

Michelle Perry Higgins (@RetirementMPH) is a financial planner and principal at California Financial Advisors.

MATT HOUGAN: Save in the future. Many of us will get a raise in the new year. Set aside half of it to fund your retirement savings, create a rainy-day fund, or contribute to your kid's 529 plan.

Because it's money you don't have today, you probably won't even notice.

Aside from Fees, What's the Best Way to Assess Financial Advisers?

The price of a financial adviser can tell you only so much about his or her ability to manage your money.

With this issue in mind, we posed the following question to The Experts: Aside from fees, what's the best way for individuals to assess a potential financial adviser?

This discussion relates to the latest Wealth Management Report and formed the basis of a discussion on The Experts blog on Dec. 18.

LARRY ZIMPLEMAN: First of all, you should conduct interviews to find the right financial adviser, just like you'd pick a doctor, dentist or any other professional. Fees matter but other things are also important.

Find out what qualifications the adviser has (certified financial consultant, chartered financial analysts, etc.). Ask how many years they've been in the business and ask for references (and check them!). However, the most important thing to evaluate is whether the adviser's view of risk and reward is identical to yours. If you are risk averse, make sure they share your point of view. If you believe in long-term, asset-allocation strategies, make sure they are in sync with that.

Finally, once you choose a financial adviser, make sure you review the results regularly and that the adviser is carrying out your intended strategy.

MIKE PIPER: Read the adviser's Form ADV Part 2. This is a form that advisers must file with the Securities and Exchange Commission or with the state in which they are registered. It tells you all sorts of information about the adviser, written in plain English, with very little sales talk. "Just the facts," so to speak.

You can learn everything about the adviser''s compensation: Do they charge an hourly rate? A percentage fee based on assets under management? Commissions? Are the fees negotiable?

You can learn about the adviser's investment philosophy to check whether it matches with your own: Are they a buy-hold-and-rebalance investor? Or do they believe in shifting asset allocation as a part of a market timing (aka dynamic asset allocation, aka tactical asset allocation) strategy?Do they prefer low-cost index funds and ETFs? Or do they use actively managed funds in the hope of achieving outperformance? Or do they use individual stocks and bonds?

You can check whether the adviser offers services that are a good fit for your needs: Do they provide comprehensive financial planning? Or do they focus exclusively on portfolio management?If they do provide financial-planning services, can you purchase such services on an as-needed basis, or do you have to sign up for a continuing fee?

Often, if you have several advisers you're considering, checking each of their ADV Part 2 brochures will be a quick way to rule out some of the advisers and develop questions to ask the others when interviewing them.

To get a hold of an adviser's Form ADV Part 2 brochure, you can contact them and request it or, if you would prefer not to give the adviser your contact information, you can look up the firm's form on theSEC Investment Adviser Search website.

CHARLES ROTBLUT: Beyond doing a background check (contact your state regulators, do a search on brokercheck.finra.org and adviserinfo.sec.gov, confirm credentials with the certifying organization, and then do a Google search on the adviser's name to see what comes up), talk to potential advisers about their management style. What type of investments do they personally favor? Do they like to be more aggressive or more conservative? How often can you expect to hear from them? Do they send out regular emails or newsletters? If you call with a question, will you realistically get to speak to them or will you be directed to assistants instead? How quickly can you expect a response under normal circumstances?

The greatest adviser in the world can be unsuitable for you if his or her personality and yours don't match. Every adviser has a certain approach to working with clients and every investor has different needs. This is why it is important to have a very open and candid discussion with an adviser you are considering. Talk about how often you want or don't want to be contacted. Discuss your investment style and whether you want to be aggressive or conservative. Bring up any investments you want to manage separately from the adviser and how much or how little input you want on it. Be very clear about what you want in the relationship and clearly state that you will fire an adviser whose approach differs from what he or she tells you.

It's better for both you and the adviser to identify differences in style before a formal relationship is established. A good adviser will be willing to give you the answers you don't want to hear. A bad adviser will smile and tell you what you want to hear even when he or she knows it isn't true. If you have doubts that the adviser is being sincere in answering your questions, walk away and find someone else.

MANISHA THAKOR: To me, the greatest value that a financial adviser provides is helping you avoid costly missteps. The most effective way to do this is through the use of a clearly articulated written financial plan. Now, I'm not talking about an 80-page printout in a three-ring binder from some off-the-shelf financial software. I'm talking about a truly customized, short and actionable financial road map that you can refer to when making key financial decisions and/or when the markets are choppy. As such, I think the best way to assess a potential financial adviser is whether or not they provide this. (I am assuming you've already established that the adviser uses a fair and transparent fee structure and operates as a fiduciary versus under the suitability standard).

As an example of what I'm talking about, for each of my clients, I create a one-page summary where we visually depict where a client currently stands financially, where they ultimately want to go, and what specific action steps they need to take to get there. This document is supported by a Monte Carlo analysis to identify optimal savings rates if in the asset-accumulation stage or spending rates if in the asset drawdown stage and a written Investment Policy Statement clearly articulating an asset allocation and cash management strategy.

The benefit of an adviser who works in this manner is threefold:

This type of customized planning requires an adviser get to know you deeply (your goals, values, dreams, fears)

The presence of a written plan ensures you have a system of checks and balances for when your emotions might come into play (think: Did you blink in 2007-2009?)

This process moves the emphasis from trying to beat the market (which study after study shows is a loser's game) to truly meeting your life goals.

TOM BRAKKE: It is important to find out where an adviser is on the spectrum between a "relationship person" and an "investment person." Doubtless they have a combination of those skills, but few have the two attributes in approximate balance. Usually advisers for individuals skew toward the relationship end of the scale.

Understanding the capabilities of a prospective adviser will help you determine whether you are a match in terms of communications. But it will also let you see what expertise others in the adviser's organization will need to provide to help you reach your goals.

It is as frustrating dealing with an "investment person" who doesn't understand your relationship needs as it is working with a "relationship person" who doesn't have a depth of knowledge on investment matters. Therefore, it's important to find the right fit and to not be afraid to get a second opinion every once in a while.

MATT HOUGAN: Make sure they have a fiduciary duty to act in your best interests. Then, ask them what they think about index funds. They don't have to be index-fund zealots, but if they think that active management still works in all areas of the markets, they are selling you a pile of goods.

With 2013 nearly behind us now and the new year just around the corner, we decided to ask The Experts the following question: What's your biggest worry about the markets in 2014?

This discussion relates to the latest Investing in Funds & ETFs Report and formed the basis of a discussion on The Experts blog on Dec. 6.

GUS SAUTER : I'm not worried about the markets in 2014. They may go up or they may go down. If they go up, we make money. If they go down, we can invest new money at lower prices. I can hardly wait for whatever happens.

George U. "Gus" Sauter is a senior consultant to Vanguard Group Inc . From 2003 through 2012, Mr. Sauter served as Vanguard's chief investment officer.

SHARYL GARRETT: In the U.S., we are currently undergoing a serious leadership crisis over a number of critical subjects: health care, re-regulations of financial advisers, employment, climate change, you name it. Colleagues have labeled this "Congress Risk."With so many American investors potentially or directly impacted by these issues, I feel that the work Congress gets done, or fails to get done, will have a major impact on U.S. investors' attitudes about investing in the very short term.

Another challenging area is finding reasonable investing opportunities in the fixed-income markets with our interest rates being so low.Some investors are taking on substantially more risk than they have traditionally to receive a similar rate of return.If you've got a home mortgage or any debt, for that matter and you've got fixed-income investments, consider paying off the debt instead.You will not get that high of an after-tax return from such a secure investment in 2014.

Longer term, I'm worried about the global financial markets and the weakening of the U.S. dollar.However, my guess is that nothing much will change along these lines in the next year or so.

Sheryl Garrett (@SherylGarrett) is founder of the Garrett Planning Network Inc.

LARRY ZIMPLEMAN : I think the biggest consensus worry for the markets in 2014 is the possible rise in interest rates causing fixed-income funds to post negative returns.

If that is a concern for you, my suggestion is that you: 1) shorten your fixed-income duration, and 2) reduce your fixed-income exposure to the lower bound of your longer term asset allocation but do not pull completely out of fixed-income investments. Market performance is random enough that you still want to maintain some exposure despite the risk of rising interest rates.

Larry D. Zimpleman is chairman, president and chief executive of Principal Financial Group .

RICK FERRI: My biggest worry is that investors worry too much about 2014. Don't worry about the return of any asset class over any single year. Establish a portfolio based on your needs and hold it for the long term.

My second worry is that investors are still paying too much for investment products and advice. There is no reason to pay a lot of money for access to the financial markets. There are many excellent low-cost index funds and ETFs available today. In addition, the era of the 1% adviser fee is over.

Rick Ferri is founder of Portfolio Solutions LLC and the author of six books on low-cost index fund and ETF investing. His blog is RickFerri.com.

CHARLES ROTBLUT : The immediate worry is yet another fiscal standoff in January and February. Everyone knows the potential for this occurring, but I won't predict what politicians will or won't do.

The other identifiable risk is economic growth. Does growth accelerate next year, does it stay steady or does it slow? Nobody knows, but a pausing of economic expansion would hurt profit growth and call prevailing stock valuations in to question.

The biggest risk to investors is not what will or won't happen next year, but rather inflation and longevity risk (the risk of outliving your savings). These are long-term risks that are best combated by staying invested and periodically adjusting your allocations back to target.

It is human nature to focus on what might happen over the short term, but it is more important to think long term.

Charles Rotblut (@charlesrotblut) is a vice president with the American Association of Individual Investors .

GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS: We have had five straight years of positive stock-market returns with no meaningful correction, which is unusual. At some point, the inevitable correction will come; this is how the markets roll.

I am more worried about what the politicians in Washington may do to harm our steady economic progress and turnaround. The level of partisanship has reached deafening levels, and the government shutdown was simply inexcusable. I am also sad to see that no meaningful tax reform will likely happen in 2014.

George Papadopoulos is a fee-only wealth manager in Novi, Mich., serving affluent individuals and families. You can follow him at twitter (@feeonlyplanner), connect with him at Google+ or visit his firm's website.

TOM BRAKKE: There is an active and healthy debate going on about the valuation of the stock market. Some measures show it as quite overvalued and some put it into above-normal valuation. It is certainly not "cheap" on an historical basis.

If you think of valuation as an odds board, the odds of strong future stock-market returns have been getting worse for investors as prices have risen without very much support in the way of better sales and earnings. And pessimists would argue that with margins at historically high levels and interest rates relatively low, the surprises would be negative ones rather than positive ones.

But no formula can capture the calculus of the market in the short term, so the historical odds may not matter during 2014. There is no way to know for sure.

Tom Brakke, CFA (@researchpuzzler) is a consultant, writer and investment adviser who specializes in the analysis of investment decision making and the communication of investment ideas.

ELEANOR BLAYNEY : I worry about the continued growth of financial assets in 2014 or, more specifically, the way this growth is being achieved.

The Federal Reserve's ongoing quantitative easing has had the effect of inflating asset values of publicly traded businesses. Without growth in revenues, companies have nevertheless seen their valuations increase, as a result of Fed-engineered low interest rates used to discount the future earnings of these enterprises. The stock-market prognosticators seem to wade deeper into the Kool Aid as the market bounds higher, pointing to "still reasonable" price/earnings ratios which, they say, are a sign that the bull will keep running.

It strikes me as out of whack when every piece of genuinely good news more jobs, industrial production, retail sales is an occasion for a stock market nose dive, with traders panicked that QE will come to an end. In my book, positive numbers are something to invest into, rather than run from.

I worry about the irrationality of knowing full well that interest rates can't get any lower, but behaving as if they could.

As an advocate for consumers, it also bothers me that the wealth and income gap in this country is getting wider and more politically and socially disruptive. Low interest rates have benefited only the wealthiest in this country. For those who desperately need credit, quantitative easing might as well be taking place on another planet. Credit-card rates and payday loans are still at usurious levels.

But, all said and done, I wonder if I should be less worried than, in fact, I am. Twenty-five years as a CFP professional has taught me that worry is a short-term indulgence.It's fun, but not necessarily wise, to gripe about what's wrong with the world today. Good planning and a long-term perspective works far better than Valium.

Eleanor Blayney (@EleanorBlayney) is consumer advocate of the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards.

MICHELLE PERRY HIGGINS: Contrary to what you might think, I don't worry about the stock market. Perhaps that comes with having been in my profession for more than 17 years and seeing the good, bad and downright ugly when it comes to investment cycles.

One of the things that concern me most in general is that I see so many investors that still fail to see the value in creating a long-term financial plan. Another concern I have is how unprepared most people are for the unexpected. It is always a good idea to have a solid written plan in place in the event of illness, an incapacitating accident or even death. That's what will worry me in 2014 and until the day I retire.

Michelle Perry Higgins (@RetirementMPH) is a financial planner and principal at California Financial Advisors.

JOHN ROGERS : While 2013 has been a strong year for most investors, I would sound a note of caution for 2014 due to market fragility. Several surveys, including one the CFA Institute ran recently with Edelman, show that investors remain wary of financial markets and market practices. In addition, we sponsored a survey just released by the Economist Intelligence Unit which found that although financial-services executives overwhelmingly recognize the importance of ethical behavior in the industry, there is still a significant gap between that belief and the industry's practices.

The "risk off" trade, which sees investors exiting stocks and similar assets en masse, could be triggered by a wide range of events. With trust in the markets and institutions at a low ebb, the trigger finger is quite twitchy.

John Rogers is the president and chief executive of the CFA Institute.

GREG MCBRIDE : Let's start with what I'm not worried about. I'm not worried about a stock-market correction. Rather, I expect it, and will welcome it as a buying opportunity.

My biggest worry is that the stock market will continue to rise uninterrupted at a pace much faster than the underlying fundamentals such as revenue and earnings growth warrant. That would only bring greater pain later when investors refocus on the fundamentals.

Greg McBride (@BankrateGreg) is a senior financial analyst and vice president for Bankrate.com, providing analysis and advice on personal finance.

MATT HOUGAN: Crowding. Investors have rushed into high-yielding corners of the market like emerging-markets debt, master limited partnerships (MLPs), bank loans and other strategies. It makes sense: Treasurys yield next to nothing, and investors need income. Buying something like bank loans which offer relatively high yields and no interest rate risk is a no-brainer.

But we've all seen this story before. When something's a no-brainer in investing, it's ends badly.

Ask yourself: When is the last time that investors poured billions of dollars into an asset that most of us have never heard of before &and it turned out well?
