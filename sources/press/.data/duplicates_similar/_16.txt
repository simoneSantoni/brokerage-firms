Fund house and tech giant aim to pursue artificial intelligence

BlackRock is in discussions with Google, the technology group, to create a joint venture that the world's largest fund house hopes will enable it to improve returns.

The tie-up, which would be a first for the fund market, will seek to explore how artificial intelligence might be used to improve investment decisions.

Pierre Sarrau, chief investment officer of multi-asset strategies at BlackRock, says the company is talking to a UK-based Google company, adding that it is a "very exciting joint venture".

It is unclear which Google company that might be, but the internet giant last year acquired London-based DeepMind Technologies, which specialises in artificial intelligence - an area of particular interest to BlackRock.

DeepMind, founded in 2010 by Demis Hassabis, aims to combine "the best techniques from machine learning and systems neuroscience to build powerful general-purpose learning algorithms". Machine learning tries to create algorithms that predict future events using current data.

Asked about a possible partnership with Google DeepMind, a spokesperson for BlackRock says: "We use big data and machine-learning investment techniques across many strategies today. We are excited about the potential they offer."

Google declined to comment.

Earlier this year BlackRock hired Bill MacCartney, a former Google scientist, to help it apply machine learning to quantitative investment strategies.

Mr MacCartney works with the US fund house's global equities research team from its base in Silicon Valley.

Mr Sarrau says: "[The Silicon Valley hub is focused on] building tools to help us gather information from big data."

Several asset managers, including Amundi, BNY Mellon, State Street and NN Partners, have expressed an interest in analysing large volumes of data.

In a paper published in May 2015, BNY Mellon said machine learning could be used to identify "correlations and patterns" that "cannot be observed manually or even with traditional analytical techniques that require significant human guidance".

"There is a requirement for machines and data to link together initially," the paper adds.

Asset management houses are already making use of the increased amount of data available to them through social media sites.

BlackRock said last week that it is using data gathered from both Google and Twitter, the microblogging site, to help it formulate investment decisions. NN Investment Partners says it is also doing this.

Speaking at a fund market conference earlier this year, asset management executives warned that those who did not "get on board the big data train" would be "left behind".

Alongside investment processes, sales and operations were named as areas where data could help fund houses improve their business.

Although fund managers recognise that big data could provide valuable insights, many remain uncertain about how to apply vast data sets from sources as disparate as Twitter and Starbucks, the coffee chain, to their investment processes.

Nick Thomas, a partner at Baillie Gifford, the Edinburgh-based fund house, told FTfm: "We are absolutely fascinated by the power of big data and how it makes Google a fantastic business, and we are some of the biggest holders of [companies] such as Amazon [the ecommerce group] and Baidu [the Chinese search company], who are at the cutting edge of using data to build amazing internet businesses.

"But trying to fit some of those ideas into our investment process is difficult because we take a very long-term, slow approach to investing."

Biotech sell-off hurts specialist funds; INVESTING

Woodford fund hit following Clinton attack on drug costs

Popular funds including Neil Woodford 's new investment trust have been hit by the sell-off in biotechnology stocks, which have dived almost 24 per cent in the past two months.

The 880m Woodford Patient Capital Trust , launched in April, shed 6.2 per cent of its net asset value over the past month due to declines by holdings such as Prothena and Northwest Biotherapeutics . Over three months, it is down 5.8 per cent, according to figures from FE Analytics.

The 634m Axa Framlington Biotech fund, an open-ended product held by many self-directed investors, meanwhile shed 12.2 per cent over the past month and 16.8 per cent over three months.

That followed years of steady rises, however. The Axa fund was up 280 per cent in the four years to July, meaning investors who entered the fund early will still have made substantial gains.

The biotech sell-off was sparked by comments from the US Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, who said she would look to reform drug pricing if she is elected president in 2016.

Commentators including Janet Yellen , chair of the US Federal Reserve , had previously warned of stretched valuations in the fast-growing biotechnology sector, which looks to exploit biological processes to make drugs and other products.

Mr Woodford's head of investment communications, Mitchell Fraser-Jones, said in a trust update: "The portfolio's US stocks were among the weakest performers, as sentiment towards US biotech remained sour.

"Given the way that the sector has traded this year, with very strong performance in the first half, the sell-off is perhaps unsurprising.

"We have, however, been disappointed that stocks such as Prothena and Northwest Biotherapeutics have become so embroiled in it - the valuation attached to their shares is very far from the bubble-like levels that some . . . peers have reached."

The company has seen nothing to change the fundamental investment case for these stocks, he said.

"Although September was a disappointing month in performance terms, we retain absolute conviction in the long-term outlook for the trust," Mr Fraser-Jones added.

Patient Capital, which mainly invests in early-stage and early-growth companies - not exclusively in the biotech sector - is designed for investors who intend to commit money for at least five years.

It has shed 2.2 per cent of net asset value since its launch in April , but is still trading at an 8.8 per cent premium because of investors' faith in Mr Woodford's extended record.

Linden Thomson, manager of the Axa biotech fund , said her fund does not hold Valeant or Turing Pharmaceuticals , two of the companies most associated with drug price inflation, since she does not classify them as biotechnology companies.

Like Mr Woodford, she has made no significant changes to her portfolio - whose largest holdings are Celgene Corp and Gilead Sciences - as a result of recent market swings.

"We believe that fundamentals remain solid for this sector and maintain our forecast of 20 per cent growth over the next two years," said Ms Thomson. "In an environment concerned about growth, the biotech sector is one area which looks likely to continue to grow strongly through various market cycles."

Demographic trends and demand from countries outside the US and western Europe will continue to support the industry, she added, although it does face question marks over the sustainability of high drug prices, and must negotiate competition from generic drugs.

Rival healthcare funds have also taken a hit: Polar Capital's biotechnology fund shed 13.4 per cent over the three months to the end of September, while funds run by Candriam Investors Group and Pictet Asset Management were down 14.7 and 13.4 per cent respectively.

Among trusts, Frostrow's Biotech Growth Trust is down 23.5 per cent over three months, and the Worldwide Healthcare Trust, run by the same company, has shed 13.3 per cent of its value.

Polar Capital Global Healthcare Growth and Income declined 8.78 per cent over three months, while rival SV Life Sciences International Biotechnology Trust shed 16.4 per cent.

Jeremy Beckwith, director of manager research at Morningstar, said that biotech shares' fall was "a necessary correction after a phenomenal bull run". "It's had such a strong run and made some much money that the first time there was some bad news, people were bound to take some profits," he said.

"This is a high-risk, high-return sector. They [investors] need to understand how much they can afford to lose and whether they want to take on this sort of risk."

It's October in New York and the sun is blazing. I packed all the wrong clothes. But who can complain? There's nothing like autumn among the sun-soaked skyscrapers of Manhattan, with the pumpkins, the Halloween decorations and the leaves turning from green to orange to red.

I've arrived just in time for the finance-themed, intellectual marathon of the year: the FT pub quiz, organised by the New York division of FT Alphaville. They've set the questions, found the venue, invited the guests and, most importantly, bagged former Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker and the Financal Times' US managing editor Gillian Tett as quiz masters.

With hosts of that calibre, not to mention a prize list that includes drones and signed editions of Volcker's own 2012 "rule" restricting banks' ability to speculate (the toughest regulation to hit Wall Street since Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002), is it any wonder the event is so oversubscribed that we've had to hire a bouncer?

Paul Volcker arrives with Gillian Tett and is immediately escorted to the liquidity distribution zone - or bar. As we are introduced, I'm struck not just by how tall he is - 6ft 7in - but also by his charm and humour. At which point Tett remarks that chairman Volcker, who contributed questions of his own for the quiz, has stumbled across errors in the other sections. So much for Google, eh? A more stringent internet search quickly confirms - unsurprisingly - that he is right. We've made a factual error regarding the unemployment rate and inflation. Frantic question-restructuring follows.

"So, when will the Fed be raising rates?" a colleague asks him, cheekily.

"Not before 2056!" quips Volcker.

He's keener to talk about how the quiz will be a bridging of knowledge gaps. There's his knowledge of finance and our technological insight on social media and modern telecoms devices. Volcker calls this a fair exchange, though I suspect he is overegging his ignorance. When I mention bitcoin, he defines the mechanics that underpin the system in two short sentences. After the quiz starts, it soon becomes clear Volcker is probably as big an icon in financial circles as Kim Kardashian is on Instagram. Neither is he a social media newbie. On the sidelines, a queue begins to form for Volcker selfies.

While I'm in town I've arranged to meet financial crime author and writer Jeffrey Robinson for lunch at what he claims is a proper New York institution: Katz's Delicatessen on East Houston Street, best known as the setting for that cinematic moment when Sally met Harry to give him some much-needed advice on women. We chat about Robinson's new projects, his time cruising with the City of London police and celery-tonic soda, while chomping on pastrami sandwiches stacked 15cm high. Then Robinson insists on taking me to the Strand Bookstore on Broadway and its rare editions and crime aisles, where I clock his book and insist he signs it. Before we part, we exchange gifts - for me, a mug; for him, a book by Thomas Levenson called Newton and the Counterfeiter , about when the man who discovered gravity was offered a job as warden of the Royal Mint.

My day meeting authors with a penchant for shadowy areas of finance isn't over. I've arranged to meet the quant of all quants, Emanuel Derman, author of My Life as a Quant and Models Behaving Badly , for dinner in an Indian restaurant by Columbus Circle.

I can't wait to get his perspective on machine learning, volatility and feedback loops and Derman doesn't disappoint. His is a unique mind but one grounded in reality - what you'd expect from a former physicist. The conversation turns to Chappie , the 2015 AI film based in Johannesburg, which I recommend he - as a South African quant - should watch, especially after I discover he's a fan of Die Antwoord, the rap-rave duo who feature in the movie.

New York Comic Con sold outmonthsago but I am lucky to have wangled a press invite from Felix Salmon, editor at the multimedia network Fusion, to his panel on "The Amazing Economics of Star Trek ", featuring economists Paul Krugman and Brad DeLong. The panel also features Manu Saadia, author of the new book Trekonomics .

We quickly learn that the post-scarcity environment of Star Trek - where anything can be produced with replicators, and money doesn't exist - is probably not a utopian state. In fact, the panellists emphasise that the highly meritocratic society is likely to be highly unequal. For example, we, the viewers, only see the adventures of the top 1 per cent of the top 1 per cent of the top 1 per cent.

I ask the panellists whether the Fed will have raised rates by the 24th century? No one dares to answer - presumably because there is no money by then, and thus no interest rates?

At least I'm left with a workable forecast. Somewhere between 2056 and star date 2364 seems likely.

BUY

Banks

Barclays (BARC)

Shares in Barclays fell nearly 3 per cent this week, and at 249p trade 14 per cent below this year's peak

Former JPMorgan investment banker Jes Staley is expected to be appointed chief executive of Barclays in the next few weeks. Mr Staley will be stepping into the shoes of former chief executive and retail banker Antony Jenkins who was sacked less than three months after John MacFarlane took over as chairman. Mr MacFarlane is expected to maintain a hands-on style of management even after relinquishing his interim executive role and going back to being chairman.

Before joining US hedge fund Blue Mountain Capital in 2013, Mr Staley spent 30 years at JPMorgan, and rose to be head of its investment bank. His expected appointment raises questions about the bank's direction, and whether it will steer more towards the investment banking side than its retail operations. Outwardly, this need not be a cause for alarm; the investment bank boosted pre-tax profit by more than a third to 1.4bn in the first half of this year, but it was this side that suffered the worst as a result of the economic crash.

Barclays is in the process of a significant restructuring of its operations, having shed over 10 per cent of its workforce and a quarter of the assets on its balance sheet. UK banks are also having to go through a protracted scheme whereby retail banking is ringfenced from investment banking activities to protect taxpayers from having to bail out a bank again. Barclays faces a tough challenge because of the size of its investment bank arm which grew with the acquisition of the US operation formerly run by Lehman Brothers. Jonas Crosland

BUY

Media

Next Fifteen Comms (NFC)

Next Fifteen shares have risen 7 per cent since July. They trade on 13 times forecast earnings, which looks cheap

Few marketing and media relations agencies count Google, Amazon and Facebook among their clients; Next Fifteen Communications added Intel and Airbnb to its impressive roster in the six months to the end of July, as brisk demand for its data analytics, software and digital communications services fuelled a 31 per cent rise in operating profit to 7.2m.

Next Fifteen has been quick to embrace new ways of getting clients' messages across, including analysing data to hone campaigns and using new channels such as social media.

These efforts underpinned organic sales growth of a tenth in the US as Outcast, Beyond and other agencies won work.

The group also shelled out 2.4m to acquire three UK agencies and continued to streamline its non-US overseas operations.

This process, which has involved pruning the client base, cut constant-currency revenue by 9 per cent in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, but helped more than double the operating margin in Asia Pacific to 13.2 per cent.

The company's management remains dedicated to digital innovation. Its Agent3 unit recently built a software platform that provides insights into customers for the sales and marketing departments of large companies. Next Fifteen plans to boost investment in product development and sales support here.

Broker Investec Securities expects pre-tax profit of 15.6m for the year to January 2016, giving earnings per share of 15.3p. Theron Mohamed

HOLD

General retailers

N Brown (BWNG)

Broker Peel Hunt thinks it could be "a stretch" for the retailer to meet current forecasts

Shares in retailer N Brown trade on a fairly undemanding forward price/earnings ratio of 14, and the dividend yield is generous, but investors have been burnt before on this one.

The share price rose by 7 per cent after the group reported first-half results that were better than expected. However, expectations were low as a result of extensive restructuring under way at the company and last year's profit warning. Even on an adjusted basis, pre-tax profits for the half-year to August 29 fell 16 per cent to 35m.

Chief executive Angela Spindler told investors to expect a stronger finish to the current financial year. That's because exceptional costs associated with the revamp - which involved 380 redundancies and the closure of 18 clearance stores in the first half, costing nearly 15m - should fall to between 2m and 3m in the second half.

As the operational transformation from a catalogue-led business to a digital retailer continues, N Brown is also changing the way it reports its financial results. For the first time, the group split its revenues into "product" and "financial services". The former grew 6.1 per cent during the first six months as digital sales took off, while the latter - which tracks the money N Brown makes on the credit it offers customers - dipped 0.4 per cent. Overall, like-for-like sales grew 3.1 per cent.

Peel Hunt expects pre-tax profits of 86.6m for the current financial year, giving earnings per share of 24.6p, compared with 86.2m and 21p for the year ended February 2015. Harriet Russell

Stock Screen: Cheap, High-Growth Aim Shares

The excitement the Alternative Investment Market (Aim) evokes in many investors often centres on the huge gains it is possible to make from finding the right go-to growth stock, writes Algy Hall.

My Cheap, High-Growth Aim Shares screen hit upon one such situation last year when it picked Trakm8. The shares delivered a flabbergasting total return of almost 250 per cent over the 12 months. Even after that amazing run, the shares can hardly be seen as expensive given that they make a reappearance among the screen s picks for this year, too.

There were actually nine shares from Aim that produced higher returns than Trakm8 over the 12 months, all of which considerably outflanked the biggest risers from the FTSE All-Share index

The success stories from last year s screen may present the case for Aim, but its failures also represent a case for the opposition. Among the big fallers from the 19 shares selected were a number of companies hit by the falling oil price and reduced capital expenditure by the industry.

The cumulative total return from the screen now stands at 4.8 per cent over the two years I ve run it, compared with a negative 5.8 per cent from the index. If I factor in a 2 per cent charge to account for the high dealing costs associated with small-caps, the cumulative total return drops to 2.7 per cent.

Relative to the market, the screen s performance can be said to be decent, but I feel it has yet to distinguish itself. That said, the methodology certainly seems capable of turning up some interesting situations   even if these do come accompanied by some less welcome investment ideas. The valuation criteria the screen uses is based on a cash and dividend-adjusted price-to-earnings-growth ratio, which I ve called a genuine value (GV) ratio. It is calculated as follows:

Enterprise-value-to-operating-profits ratio divided by dividend yield plus average forecast growth for the next two fiscal years

The rest of the criteria for the screen centre on a hunt for high forecast earnings growth, though growth that looks suspiciously high (an average of over 100 per cent for the next two financial years) is ignored. Broker forecasts for small-caps can be very subjective and the screen also seeks a bit of comfort from a sound balance sheet. Where earnings growth has been achieved historically, the screen wants to see that it is supported by sales growth. The full screening criteria are:

%Ï Average forecast earnings per share (EPS) growth rate over the next two financial years of more than 20 per cent but less than 100 per cent.

%Ï Three-year revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) equal to at least half three-year EPS CAGR.

%Ï A genuine value ratio of less than the median average.

%Ï Forward next 12-month price/earnings ratio outside the most expensive quarter of stocks screened.

%Ï Net debt/cash profit (Ebitda) of less than 2.5 times.

%Ï A current ratio (current assets/current liabilities) of more than 1.

This year, 17 shares were highlighted by the screen. I ve taken a closer look at the shares showing the best momentum, offering the highest dividend yield:

32 Red   The UK s new point-of-consumption gambling tax has been a blow to online gambling companies. Unlike peers, 32 Red held off on heavy marketing ahead of the tax s introduction, which has left it with plenty of cash to recruit new players now the tax has been ushered in. Its efforts have been made all the more effective because many rivals have reined in their marketing spending.

Impressively, 32 Red has been managing to recruit new users without experiencing any serious deterioration in yield per user, and first-half casino revenues were 21 per cent ahead. The company, which is principally focused on the UK, is also seeing an improved performance from its Italian business which reported a 61 per cent revenue increase. The integration of Roxy Palace, acquired this year, is going well.

Belvoir   Lettings-focused estate agency chain Belvoir operates a franchise model. The beauty of a good franchise operation for shareholders is that a company can operate a large network of income-generating units with relatively minimal overheads   just the central costs needed to support franchisees. That means there s the potential for a large amount of earnings to be paid out as dividends, which is what Belvoir has been doing.

But while this means Belvoir s dividend payout is high, the dividend cover is slim. Profit growth is expected to boost cover, though, with broker Cantor Fitzgerald forecasting that earnings will be 1.3 times the level of the payout in 2016. And while last year s net operating cash inflow of 250,000 didn t come close to covering the 1.6m paid out as dividends, a solid balance sheet provides some reassurance, with Cantor forecasting that net debt will represent less than half cash profits in 2016.

During its second half, the company has bought two letting agencies in the Midlands which has helped boost earnings growth expectations as well as helping advance its  multi-brand  strategy. The equity-funded deals are expected to mean Belvoir ends the year with 213 outlets, compared with 166 at the halfway stage.

Swallowfield   A new strategic plan means cosmetics manufacturer Swallowfield is showing early signs of promise and could drive substantial earnings growth over coming years. Indeed, broker N+1 Singer thinks in the best-case scenario the company could generate compound annual earnings growth in the three years to June 2018 of over 50 per cent taking EPS to 22p, which includes the tax benefits of past losses. That compares with 2015 EPS of 6.5p. For now, the broker s official 2018 forecast is 19.4p.

Forecasting so far out is necessarily a matter of extreme conjecture, but Swallowfield s full-year results in September provided encouragement despite the negative impact of the euro s weakness. Plans to improve efficiency have helped the group put 230,000 worth of cost savings in train and further savings of 150,000 have been identified. The company also reported two contract wins in global brands, which helped validate increased focus on products where it has a strong advantage and sees good growth. There were also encouraging signs on the potential take-up of the owned brands the group has been developing and is getting ready to roll out.

Management s confidence in prospects was underlined by the decision to reinstate a dividend at 2p. Strong dividend growth is forecast with N+1 pencilling in a payment of 3p for the current financial year rising to 5p in 2018, which would be equivalent to a 3.6 per cent yield. The potential looks undeniably exciting.

Analytics groups are using increasingly creative methods to assess loan applications

The US's middle classes are drenched in debt and demand is slowing. So how do banks build profits? By bending the rules.

Two of the top credit analytics companies are exploring new ways of assessing consumers' ability to handle loans, turning away from traditional sources of data such as credit cards and car loans to scour phone and utility bills, change-of-address records and information drawn from DVD clubs and suppliers of rent-to-own furniture.

The efforts could open up new classes of customer for the big US banks , and come as lenders struggle to generate steady profits in an environment of tightened regulation and ultra-low interest rates. In third-quarter results this week, the US's three biggest banks - Wells Fargo, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase - have reported year-on-year declines in quarterly revenue .

One of the companies, Fico, has been working on a pilot project with a dozen US credit card companies, and now claims to have developed reliable ways to price loans to millions of people who have historically been off the grid.

Will Lansing , chief executive of the San Jose, California-based company, said Fico was increasingly looking at data on a spectrum: with credit card repayment history at one end - the most reliable guide to creditworthiness - and at the other, information volunteered on social media platforms such as Facebook.

"If you look at how many times a person says 'wasted' in their profile, it has some value in predicting whether they're going to repay their debt," he said. "It's not much, but it's more than zero."

Credit cards and car loans are likely to be among the bright spots in the US banks' third-quarter figures, with much of the growth driven by segments considered subprime . But mortgages and personal loans should be patchier, suggesting that many consumers have borrowed about as much as they can.

Aggregate household debt balances were unchanged in the second quarter at $11.85tn, according to the New York Federal Reserve, and remain more than 6 per cent below the pre-Lehman peak.

TransUnion, another credit-analytics group, has embarked on a project to tap alternative data sources to help people with marred records get better terms.

Both Fico and TransUnion say they are responding to demand from their ultimate customers, the banks, which worry that by declining people without traditional credit scores they are turning away potential sources of profit.

"The market was absolutely hungry for a solution," said Jim Wehmann, executive vice-president for scores at Fico.

Fico, which led the practice of custom scoring in the 1950s and whose scores are now used in about 90 per cent of credit decisions in the US, is pursuing its project in partnership with Equifax, one of the top three credit-reporting bureaux, and LexisNexis Risk Solutions.

The new model gives high marks to people who have regularly paid bills, and have not moved around enough to suggest problems paying rent.

Some of the new credit-eligible customers are new to the country, some are young - and some have simply not borrowed enough to generate traditional files. But the alternative data suggest that many are a good credit risk. "We can now score the previously unscoreable," said Mr Wehmann.

Mike Mondelli, Chicago-based senior vice-president of alternative data services at TransUnion, said a broader approach to scoring could lead to cheaper loans for 23m consumers.

From the banks' point of view, he said, it is "good for adding more customers at an acceptable risk rate".

AIG Likes That New Underwriter Has No Underwriting Training; Madhu Tadikonda joined AIG in 2013 as part of its  science team,  which now tops 150 employees

American International Group Inc.'s new chief underwriter for its big business-insurance unit doesn't have underwriting training, and that is exactly what the company likes about him.

It would seem like just another job announcement when the New York company Thursday named a new chief underwriting officer for its big business-insurance unit, but the appointment of data scientist Madhu Tadikonda signifies sweeping change in the insurance industry.

AIG says it isn't getting rid of traditional underwriters, but instead wants to augment their work with data science. Underwriters evaluate the risks of insuring a particular client or entity, determining the likelihood and potential for claims over the life of the policy.

The new chief underwriter is a 43-year-old Princeton University graduate who studied philosophy and later earned an M.B.A. from Stanford University. He worked previously at a consulting firm and in venture capital helping credit-card companies and retailers with computer modeling techniques for marketing and sales, among other assignments.

Mr. Tadikonda joined AIG in 2013 as part of a  science team" committed to helping the global insurer apply computer-analytical techniques to its insurance business.

AIG Commercial Insurance Chief Executive John Doyle said that Mr. Tadikonda is unusual for the new assignment because he hadn't trained for years as an underwriter, but that is what he wanted.

 I appointed him because of his unique background," he said in an interview.  I want him to challenge some of the conventional ways we've done things in the past, to look at our data assets in a different more creative way. We need people in key leadership roles that can help the team more broadly understand how we can do things in a different and better way."

AIG's move  signifies that insurance is  in a new era, where the importance of sophisticated data analysis is becoming increasingly apparent," said Robert Hartwig, president of trade group Insurance Information Institute.

Across the insurance industry some companies still rely almost exclusively on underwriters' gut instincts. But AIG Chief Executive Peter Hancock has for several years championed use of science, data and analytics to assess risk. In late 2011, he hired a  Chief Science Officer" and the science team now tops 150 employees.

Mr. Tadikonda, who worked alongside underwriters in his job on the science team, said that computer models won't replace human judgment.

 People feel very comfortable popping up over their cubicle and asking the three people they sit next to whether they've seen an account like this or how they handled a situation," he said in an interview.  The models crystallize or summarize that kind of experience across all of AIG's underwriters over a long period of time."

The models  aren't great" for all cases or conditions, so  that is where the human perspective is valuable," he added.

Mr. Tadikonda replaces Tim Carter, who moves to another role at AIG. Mr. Carter had a more-traditional background: years of working up the ranks of underwriting departments, after earning a mathematics degree and becoming an actuary.

Biotech sell-off hurts Woodford trust and specialist funds

Popular funds including Neil Woodford s new investment trust have been hit by the sell-off in biotechnology stocks, which have dived almost 24 per cent in the past two months.

The 880m Woodford Patient Capital Trust, launched in April, shed 6.2 per cent of its net asset value over the past month due to declines by holdings such as Prothena and Northwest Biotherapeutics. Over three months, it is down 5.8 per cent, according to figures from FE Analytics.

The 634m Axa Framlington Biotech fund, an open-ended product held by many self-directed investors, meanwhile shed 12.2 per cent over the past month and 16.8 per cent over three months.

That followed years of steady rises, however. The Axa fund was up 280 per cent in the four years to July, meaning investors who entered the fund early will still have made substantial gains.

The biotech sell-off was sparked by comments from the US Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, who said she would look to reform drug pricing if she is elected president in 2016.

Commentators including Janet Yellen, chair of the US Federal Reserve, had previously warned of stretched valuations in the fast-growing biotechnology sector, which looks to exploit biological processes to make drugs and other products.

Mr Woodford s head of investment communications, Mitchell Fraser-Jones, said in a trust update:  The portfolio s US stocks were among the weakest performers, as sentiment towards US biotech remained sour.

 Given the way that the sector has traded this year, with very strong performance in the first half, the sell-off is perhaps unsurprising.

 We have, however, been disappointed that stocks such as Prothena and Northwest Biotherapeutics have become so embroiled in it   the valuation attached to their shares is very far from the bubble-like levels that some 	. 	. 	. 	peers have reached. 

The company has seen nothing to change the fundamental investment case for these stocks, he said.

 Although September was a disappointing month in performance terms, we retain absolute conviction in the long-term outlook for the trust,  Mr Fraser-Jones added.

Patient Capital, which mainly invests in early-stage and early-growth companies   not exclusively in the biotech sector   is designed for investors who intend to commit their money for at least five years.

It has shed 2.2 per cent of net asset value since its launch in April, but is still trading at an 8.8 per cent premium because of investors  faith in Mr Woodford s extended record.

Linden Thomson, manager of the Axa biotech fund, said her fund does not hold Valeant or Turing Pharmaceuticals, two of the companies most associated with drug price inflation, since she does not classify them as biotechnology companies.

Like Mr Woodford, she has made no significant changes to her portfolio   whose largest holdings are Celgene Corp and Gilead Sciences   as a result of recent market swings.

 We believe that fundamentals remain solid for this sector and maintain our forecast of 20 per cent growth over the next two years,  said Ms Thomson.

 In an environment concerned about growth, the biotech sector is one area which looks likely to continue to grow strongly through various market cycles. 

Demographic trends and demand from countries outside the US and western Europe will continue to support the industry, she added, although it does face question marks over the sustainability of high drug prices, and must negotiate competition from generic drugs.

Rival healthcare funds have also taken a hit: Polar Capital s biotechnology fund shed 13.4 per cent over the three months to the end of September, while biotech funds run by Candriam Investors Group and Pictet Asset Management were down 14.7 and 13.4 per cent respectively.

Among trusts, Frostrow s Biotech Growth Trust is down 23.5 per cent over three months, and the Worldwide Healthcare Trust, run by the same company, has shed 13.3 per cent of its value.

Polar Capital Global Healthcare Growth and Income declined 8.78 per cent over three months, while rival SV Life Sciences International Biotechnology Trust shed 16.4 per cent.

Jeremy Beckwith, director of manager research at Morningstar, said that biotech shares  fall was  a necessary correction after a phenomenal bull run .

 It s had such a strong run and made some much money that the first time there was some bad news, people were bound to take some profits,  he said.

The role of biotech in an individual investor s portfolio should depend on their risk appetite, he added.  This is a high-risk, high-return sector. They need to understand how much they can afford to lose and whether they want to take on this sort of risk.

Start-up threat to creaking banks

To judge by her CV, Anne Boden is an old-style banker to the core. She has a conventional career behind her, spanning stints at Lloyds, Standard Chartered, UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland, culminating as chief operating officer of Allied Irish.

Now, however, Ms Boden has moved into the vanguard of the digital revolution. As chief executive of "http://starlingbank.co.uk/", a London-based start-up, she believes the future of high-street banking is not on the high street at all, but on mobile-only platforms such as the one she is midway through setting up.

 Big banks are far too complicated. All their branches and products and legacy systems are very inefficient,  Ms Boden says.

And she is not alone in holding such views. Across the financial services sector, but particularly in banking, start-ups are endeavouring to shake up a staid industry.

Three connected complications make this a rich vein to tap. In the boom times of the late 1990s and early 2000s, many banks failed to invest in technology, preferring simply to ride the wave and maximise profits. During the financial crisis, meanwhile, there was no time to think of tech investment. And in the post-crisis period there has been no money. The net result across much of the world is a banking system that is creaking at the joints.

The industry has been distracted for years, says Piyush Gupta, chief executive of DBS, Singapore s biggest lender.  Collectively, we have taken our eyes off Net 2.0. 

Groups that expanded aggressively through acquisition have some of the biggest challenges thanks to a common failure to integrate multiple IT systems. Kartik Ramakrishnan, senior vice-president at Capgemini, a consultancy, says the task in hand is vast.

 The financial services industry is one of the biggest spenders on technology,  he says.  However, the majority of this spend is on maintenance activities, largely due to the investment required to keep legacy systems operational. 

Royal Bank of Scotland, which led a three-way  ¬71bn "http://ftalphaville.ft.com/tag/abn-amro/page/2/" just before the financial crisis, has become synonymous with IT failures. After "http://www.rbs.com/news/2014/11/rbs-reaches-it-incident-settlement.html" in the summer of 2012 it took weeks to clear a backlog of 100m unprocessed transactions that froze customers out of their accounts.

Despite a 750m programme of investment, RBS was hit by another embarrassing glitch this summer.

Some of the biggest banks with the greatest need to make amends for past under-investment are now spending billions of dollars a year   not just to maintain old systems, but to try to upgrade them at last.

 There is an urgent need for the traditional players to acknowledge the presence of new digital challengers,  says Mr Ramakrishnan.

 [Banks need] to develop more agile, responsive IT to support faster time to market, better product innovation and improved customer service. 

DBS of Singapore is among the banks convinced it still has time to make amends. Next-generation technology is now  front and centre of our priorities , says Mr Gupta, who adds that the timescale for getting it done is limited.

 If you don t get the digital transformation right in the next five years, you will be history,  he says.

As with other bank bosses, Mr Gupta is alarmed at the inroads made into traditional banking territory by non-banks, particularly technological behemoths, from Alibaba in China to Apple across much of the rest of the world.

Their expansion into payment services is particularly worrying for the banks because it directly challenges the banks  relationships with their customers.

Other core banking activities   such as lending   are under attack from technology start-ups, particularly so-called peer-to-peer (P2P) lenders.

By using sophisticated software to match people or companies with money to lend to those who want to borrow, they can often offer loans more cheaply and cut out the middlemen bankers.  We are steadily taking their customers,  says Giles Andrews, co-founder of Zopa, the world s oldest P2P lender, who adds:  We are doubling our market share every year. 

A handful of initiatives pose similar threats to other areas of the traditional financial services market.

In asset management, for example, Alibaba has attracted vast inflows across China, thanks to the combined power of its technology and its dominant brand name.

In insurance, a patchwork of initiatives has spread across broking and analytics.

It is in banking services, however, that the greatest changes are afoot. Here, technology companies, large and small, have been helped in their competitive efforts by the increasing regulatory constraints imposed on traditional banks in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis.

While banks have been forced to accept tougher regulatory capital requirements, making much of their core lending more expensive, challengers from outside banking are only lightly regulated.

In some countries, politicians have even gone out of their way to favour non-banks, conscious that there are votes to be won in making life harder for the kinds of banking institutions that were so closely identified with the financial crisis.

In the UK, for example, P2P lending is about to be given the tax breaks and government imprimatur of an Isa, a tax-efficient savings vehicle. At the same time, a new 8 per cent bank supertax has been announced for old-style banks.

The banking industry is not taking the assault lying down. With the trauma of the crisis, and much of the expense of post-crisis regulation now absorbed, the stronger banks have not only begun to invest heavily in unseen back-office IT. There is also a good deal of customer-facing tech investment, ensuring that some banks, at least, are keeping pace with upstart challengers.

A number of models are emerging. Spanish lenders BBVA and Santander have each set up pools of funding to buy up tech-based firms. BBVA even went so far as to acquire Simple, one of the more eye-catching of the US start-up lenders. Meanwhile, BNP Paribas has established Hello, a mobile-focused lender operating across a large chunk of the eurozone.

For Ms Boden at Starling, such initiatives miss the point because, in most cases, the high-tech front ends of the new style still rely on old bank infrastructure.

Of her own enterprise she says:  We re different. We re going to be able to offer free current accounts without subsidy from other products.

 That s because we don t have the big network overheads of branches and legacy systems. 

If she is right, then perhaps the greatest potential for a more modern form of banking may lie in emerging markets, where old-style infrastructure was never built.

Across Africa, for example, payment services using basic mobiles rather than smartphones are already widely available. In such markets, tech-savvy start-up lenders could do very well indeed.

Many believe, however, that the current phase of traditional financial services being challenged by upstart technology companies will morph into a new world order, in which the best of the old operators integrate the latest technology, either under their own steam or via acquisition.

 The financial services industry is at a crossroads,  says Mr Ramakrishnan.  But we firmly believe that some firms will retake the initiative and challenge the new digital challengers at their own game.

 Indeed, we may see symbiotic relationships emerge, where both established firms and challengers come together to create a mutually beneficial partnership.

Of her own enterprise she says:  We re different. We re going to be able to offer free current accounts without subsidy from other products.

 That s because we don t have the big network overheads of branches and legacy systems. 

If she is right, then perhaps the greatest potential for a more modern form of banking may lie in emerging markets, where old-style infrastructure was never built.

Across Africa, for example, payment services using basic mobiles rather than smartphones are already widely available. In such markets, tech-savvy start-up lenders could do very well indeed.

Many believe, however, that the current phase of traditional financial services being challenged by upstart technology companies will morph into a new world order, in which the best of the old operators integrate the latest technology, either under their own steam or via acquisition.

 The financial services industry is at a crossroads,  says Mr Ramakrishnan.  But we firmly believe that some firms will retake the initiative and challenge the new digital challengers at their own game.

 Indeed, we may see symbiotic relationships emerge, where both established firms and challengers come together to create a mutually beneficial partnership.

Cyber security Standard access codes could soon become a thing of the past, reports Hannah Kuchler

Wearables have been used to track our steps, deliver emails to our wrists and monitor our sun exposure. But now connected devices on our bodies could help us access online banking systems.

Nymi, taken from the Greek suffix -onym for name, is experimenting with a system that lets people prove who they are with their heartbeat. Halifax, part of UK bank Lloyds, Canada's RBC and MasterCard are partners.

Everyone's heartbeat is individual to them, so by wearing a wristband that transmits the signal to the device being used for online banking, or even a till at a checkout, you can prove your identity.

Shawn Chance, vice-president of marketing and business development at Nymi, says the company aims to "make all the passwords go away". "The idea of a password being used for security is almost eroded," he says. He adds people tend to keep a note of them in insecure places.

Banks want to better secure their systems from hackers, who like latter-day bank robbers are attracted to the money in their - now digital - vaults. There are also more sophisticated nation state attackers who desire not only cash, but data and seek to make a political impact by targeting an adversary's most prestigious financial institutions.

Many banks are cautious about putting any extra burden on consumers, already stressed by remembering codes and passwords, and who prioritise convenient and easy access to their money over security.

Even Nymi is unlikely to be accepted as a wearable given its limited use. "We don't have any illusions that, in order for the device to be useful for an everyday person, it has to do a lot more than get you into online banking," Mr Chance says. So the company is making wristbands for employees that allow or restrict access to parts of the office or IT network as an additional feature.

Banking is often held up as the sector that has devoted great amounts of time and resources to cyber security. But the threat facing institutions is also changing fast, forcing them to regularly seek out new solutions.

Tammy Moskites, chief information security officer at Venafi, a digital security company that works with four of the top five US banks, says the types of attacks have changed since she worked in information security for banks six years ago.

In the past, she says: "What we found . . . was attacks were on online banking, wire transfers, man-in-the-middle phishing-type attacks, about intercepting or redirecting money, sending it to Nigeria, rather than to payroll."

Now attackers are using techniques that are harder to detect: "The nation state type of attack is just stealing this information to show they can do it . . . the money is usually redirected to support the crazies of the world, terrorists, people causing havoc."

But as banks have moved towards greater encryption in the effort to keep data safe - even if it is stolen - they have created another problem. They cannot see what is moving in and out of their networks because it is encrypted.

"Banks, as well as other companies in general, encrypt more and more of their data," Ms Moskites says. "In the past, it was just the most critical information, things required by regulators, now they are going above and beyond that. However, when it is leaving their environment, the tools notoriously don't see that data, [making banks blind] to potential problems."

Some banks are trying to address this by making sure they know what is encrypted and why and are looking at ways to decrypt it briefly as it leaves the network.

Mark Nicholson, chief operating officer at Deloitte cyber security practice Vigilant, says banks are increasingly turning to analytics to try to identify who is moving money without placing a burden on their customers.

"What we're seeing is an unwillingness to implement technologies which would cause friction to the consumer," he says. "So they are using analytics on transactions to understand if certain types of transaction look anomalous - from a profile and history of the times of day you usually transact, from which general internet provider address, browser, machine details, etc."

US-based Vasco Data Security works with more than half of the world's banks to prevent account takeover and transaction tampering for online and mobile banking. John Gunn, a vice-president at Vasco, says US consumers are more focused on convenience and service than security because they have no lasting exposure to losses from hacking or fraud. "Here in the US, consumers don't care as much because their status as a victim is quickly and painlessly alleviated by their bank, and usually within 24 hours," he says.

As a result, Vasco has to focus on verifying customers' identities discreetly and it has about 20 ways to authenticate a mobile banking customer. "Most of them are done in the background, without the user even knowing they are happening," Mr Gunn says.

Start-up threat to creaking banks

Lenders are alarmed by the inroads being made into their territory, writes Patrick Jenkins

To judge by her CV, Anne Boden is an old-style banker to the core. She has a conventional career behind her, spanning stints at Lloyds, Standard Chartered, UBS and Royal Bank of Scotland, culminating as chief operating officer of Allied Irish.

Now, however, Ms Boden has moved into the vanguard of the digital revolution. As chief executive of Starling Bank , a London-based start-up, she believes the future of high-street banking is not on the high street at all, but on mobile-only platforms such as the one she is midway through setting up.

"Big banks are far too complicated. All their branches and products and legacy systems are very inefficient," Ms Boden says.

And she is not alone in holding such views. Across the financial services sector, but particularly in banking, start-ups are endeavouring to shake up a staid industry.

Three connected complications make this a rich vein to tap. In the boom times of the late 1990s and early 2000s, many banks failed to invest in technology, preferring simply to ride the wave and maximise profits. During the financial crisis, meanwhile, there was no time to think of tech investment. And in the post-crisis period there has been no money. The net result across much of the world is a banking system that is creaking at the joints.

The industry has been distracted for years, says Piyush Gupta, chief executive of DBS, Singapore's biggest lender. "Collectively, we have taken our eyes off Net 2.0."

Groups that expanded aggressively through acquisition have some of the biggest challenges thanks to a common failure to integrate multiple IT systems. Kartik Ramakrishnan, senior vice-president at Capgemini, a consultancy, says the task in hand is vast.

"The financial services industry is one of the biggest spenders on technology," he says. "However, the majority of this spend is on maintenance activities, largely due to the investment required to keep legacy systems operational."

Royal Bank of Scotland, which led a three-way  ¬71bn acquisition of ABN Amro just before the financial crisis, has become synonymous with IT failures. After RBS's systems fell down in the summer of 2012 it took weeks to clear a backlog of 100m unprocessed transactions that froze customers out of their accounts.

Despite a 750m programme of investment, RBS was hit by another embarrassing glitch this summer .

Some of the biggest banks with the greatest need to make amends for past under-investment are now spending billions of dollars a year - not just to maintain old systems, but to try to upgrade them at last.

"There is an urgent need for the traditional players to acknowledge the presence of new digital challengers," says Mr Ramakrishnan.

"[Banks need] to develop more agile, responsive IT to support faster time to market, better product innovation and improved customer service."

DBS of Singapore is among the banks convinced it still has time to make amends. Next-generation technology is now "front and centre of our priorities", says Mr Gupta, who adds that the timescale for getting it done is limited.

"If you don't get the digital transformation right in the next five years, you will be history," he says.

As with other bank bosses, Mr Gupta is alarmed at the inroads made into traditional banking territory by non-banks, particularly technological behemoths, from Alibaba in China to Apple across much of the rest of the world.

Their expansion into payment services is particularly worrying for the banks because it directly challenges the banks' relationships with their customers.

Other core banking activities - such as lending - are under attack from technology start-ups, particularly so-called peer-to-peer (P2P) lenders.

By using sophisticated software to match people or companies with money to lend to those who want to borrow, they can often offer loans more cheaply and cut out the middlemen bankers. "We are steadily taking their customers," says Giles Andrews, co-founder of Zopa, the world's oldest P2P lender, who adds: "We are doubling our market share every year."

A handful of initiatives pose similar threats to other areas of the traditional financial services market.

In asset management, for example, Alibaba has attracted vast inflows across China, thanks to the combined power of its technology and its dominant brand name.

In insurance, a patchwork of initiatives has spread across broking and analytics.

It is in banking services, however, that the greatest changes are afoot. Here, technology companies, large and small, have been helped in their competitive efforts by the increasing regulatory constraints imposed on traditional banks in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis.

While banks have been forced to accept tougher regulatory capital requirements, making much of their core lending more expensive, challengers from outside banking are only lightly regulated.

In some countries, politicians have even gone out of their way to favour non-banks, conscious that there are votes to be won in making life harder for the kinds of banking institutions that were so closely identified with the financial crisis.

In the UK, for example, P2P lending is about to be given the tax breaks and government imprimatur of an Isa, a tax-efficient savings vehicle. At the same time, a new 8 per cent bank supertax has been announced for old-style banks.

The banking industry is not taking the assault lying down. With the trauma of the crisis, and much of the expense of post-crisis regulation now absorbed, the stronger banks have not only begun to invest heavily in unseen back-office IT. There is also a good deal of customer-facing tech investment, ensuring that some banks, at least, are keeping pace with upstart challengers.

A number of models are emerging. Spanish lenders BBVA and Santander have each set up pools of funding to buy up tech-based firms. BBVA even went so far as to acquire Simple, one of the more eye-catching of the US start-up lenders. Meanwhile, BNP Paribas has established Hello, a mobile-focused lender operating across a large chunk of the eurozone.

For Ms Boden at Starling, such initiatives miss the point because, in most cases, the high-tech front ends of the new style still rely on old bank infrastructure.

Of her own enterprise she says: "We're different. We're going to be able to offer free current accounts without subsidy from other products.

"That's because we don't have the big network overheads of branches and legacy systems."

If she is right, then perhaps the greatest potential for a more modern form of banking may lie in emerging markets, where old-style infrastructure was never built.

Across Africa, for example, payment services using basic mobiles rather than smartphones are already widely available. In such markets, tech-savvy start-up lenders could do very well indeed.

"The financial services industry is at a crossroads," says Mr Ramakrishnan. "But we firmly believe that some firms will retake the initiative and challenge the new digital challengers at their own game.

"Indeed, we may see symbiotic relationships emerge, where both established firms and challengers come together to create a mutually beneficial partnership."

Marketers May Be Falling Out of Love With Product Placement; Product placement on broadcast TV has been on the decline for several years.

Ad clutter is generally increasing as marketers find more and more places to peddle their products. But there is one place where ads are declining: smack in the middle of prime time TV shows.

The number of product placements appearing during the first week of the new broadcast season declined 45% to 104, compared to last year's premiere week, according to Nielsen.

The number of in-program placements has declined for several seasons. There were 4,455 product placements made during last year's broadcast TV season, a 3% drop from the year-earlier season and down 20% from the 2012-2013 season.

Why the drop? Some blame the emergence of new advertising platforms.

 There are so many more options available for advertising now and every year its grows," said Chad Dreas, Nielsen's managing director of media analytics, pointing to the growth of digital advertising and social media advertising.

Cost is also keeping advertisers at bay. Integrations are a  big commitment," said Andy Donchin, chief investment officer at Amplify US, an ad-buying unit of Dentsu.  There is an out of pocket premium" that advertisers have to pay that sometimes can be hard to justify, he added.

Still, some of the world's biggest brands routinely use the ad tactic. Apple, Starbucks, Chevrolet, Ford and Google were the largest users of product placement last year on broadcast TV. Combined, those brands were responsible for 30% of all in-program placements during the last broadcast season, Nielsen said.

Product placement has been a part of the TV business since the early days of the medium. About a decade ago, the practice exploded as marketers saw it as a way to sidestep the damaging effects of TV commercial-skipping devices. At the same time, TV networks jumped on the opportunity and now they aggressively package product plugs into many of their ad deals.

That took the product placement business, which had been dominated by small firms that had relationships with set designers and Hollywood show runners, to a whole new level. Product plugs became more pronounced and elaborate. Advertisers were no longer satisfied with having a character on a show reach for a branded soda can   many sought bigger brand integrations that included getting the product or its attributes mentioned on the show. Indeed, there were roughly 8,500 in-program placements during the 2009-2010 broadcast season, Nielsen said.

Despite the recent decline in plugs, there is evidence to suggest that many advertisers still believe product placements works. During Stephen Colbert's debut as the host of CBS's  Late Show" last month, Mr. Colbert spent several minutes poking fun at the fact that he was obligated to promote Sabra roasted red pepper humus on the air.

Next week viewers will see messages from health insurer Cigna Corp. baked into some programs airing on Walt Disney's ABC. In an effort to promote how important getting a check-up from your doctor is, the insurance company worked with ABC to have some cast members of  Jimmy Kimmel Live" swap jobs, on air, so they can go to the doctor for a checkup.

Cigna said having its pitch embedded or mentioned in a program helps a TV viewer to better remember the message. The product integration  amplifies the commercial message," said Stephen Cassell, global branding officer at Cigna.

A recent Nielsen study found that when a product plug aired in the same program as standard commercials for the same brand, the ability for a consumer ages 18 to 49 to remember the brand increased 18%. Product integrations  add value and increase the effectiveness" of ads, added Mr. Dreas at Nielsen.

The latest job moves in the trading industry and coverage of people making the news in the world s financial capitals

Preuss to step away from Eurex role in Deutsche Brse reorganisation

Deutsche Brse, Europe s largest exchanges operator by market capitalisation, has unveiled a wide-ranging internal reorganisation that will see Andreas Preuss step away from his role as head of the Eurex derivatives exchange.

The internal reshaping comes five months after Carsten Kengeter, a former UBS banker, became chief executive with a plan to  put client focus at the heart of its structure.  In a statement on Wednesday, Deutsche Brse said it would create a new  Clients, Products and Core Markets  unit that will encompass its derivatives trading, clearing and settlement business. It will be headed by Jeffrey Tessler, chief executive of its Clearstream settlement business.

Mr Preuss, deputy chief executive and for many years Deutsche Borse s most senior representative at industry events, will become chief executive of a new division, called  IT & Operations, Data & New Asset Classes . It will combine Deutsche Borse  market data unit, the European Energy Exchange and 360T, the foreign exchange trading network the company bought for  ¬725m over the summer.

The group s cash equities business, which includes the well-known Frankfurt Stock Exchange Xetra, will be separated from the Eurex derivatives business and given its own divisional status  given its high political as well as macroeconomic importance , the company said. The enlarged division, named  Cash Market,Pre-IPO& Growth Financing , will include certificates and warrant businesses and the creation of an  innovative pre-IPO market . It will be led by Hauke Stars, who was previously responsible for Deutsche Borse s market data division and the renewal of its IT infrastructure.

Mr Kengeter will be directly responsible for group strategy, mergers and acquisitions as well as government relations. (Philip Stafford, November 12)

London Stock Exchange Group appoints MSCI s Corrado as COO

London Stock Exchange Group has appointed Chris Corrado from MSCI as both group chief operating officer and chief information officer to replace the departing Antoine Shagoury.

The appointment is effective immediately. Mr Corrado, who has also held a series of senior technology officer roles at banks like Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Merrill Lynch and UBS as well as companies outside financial services, including eBay and AT&T Wireless. He began his career at IBM.

Mr Shagoury is returning to his family in the US.  I d like to extend my warmest sincere thanks to Antoine for his leadership and outstanding contribution to the Group over the past five years. Antoine has identified a strong successor and developed a deep bench of talent to carry on his legacy,  said Xavier Rolet, LSE group chief executive.  I m confident the Group will benefit from Chris  deep experience as we continue to diversify our business and grow our global footprint. (Philip Stafford, November 12)

London Stock Exchange Group hires former CME lobbyist Jachym

Jonathan Jachym, the former CME Group senior lobbyist in Washington, has re-emerged in a similar role for the London Stock Exchange Group as the US becomes an increasing focus of business for the UK bourse.

Mr Jachym quit the CME at the start of September after five years in the role to  pursue another opportunity , as he described in a departing email. He was previously executive director, government relations at CME in Washington and held a similar position in Europe for three years.

Mr Jachym will become head of North America regulatory strategy and government relations for the LSE, according to two people familiar with the move.

His appointment comes as North American market assumes a greater role in the overall LSE business. Its $2.7bn purchase of Frank Russell, the index compiler, has meant that around 30 per cent of turnover comes from the US. To underscore that focus, this year the LSE has also licensed a series of Russell and FTSE indices to CME Group, the world s largest futures exchange, to develop equity index futures and options. It agreed a similar deal with another Chicago exchange, CBOE, in February. Mary Schapiro, who was chair of the Securities Exchange Commission between 2009 to 2012, also joined the LSE s board on July 1.

Before that, Mr Jachym was legal and regulatory counsel at the Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness, a US consumer trade group. (Philip Stafford, October 9)

London Stock Exchange Group names new head of exchange

The London Stock Exchange Group, which runs exchanges, indices and trading platforms, has promoted Nikhil Rathi to be the chief executive of its stock exchange business, the London Stock Exchange.

He will replace Alexander Justham, known through the industry as  JJ , who informed the group of his decision to leave earlier this year after three years in the role, the bourse said in a statement.

Mr Justham previously had responsibility for regulatory strategy, government and public affairs, and UK regulation, and formerly worked at the UK financial regulator, the-then Financial Services Authority.

Xavier Rolet, group chief executive of the LSE, said:

 I would like to warmly extend my personal thanks to JJ for his great contribution and wish him all the best for the future. 

Mr Rathi joined the LSE from the UK Treasury last year to be its chief of staff and director of international development. His roles at the finance department included director of the financial services group representing the UK government s interests in the EU and internationally.

 During the last year, Nikhil has played a key role driving the Group s strategy in key markets, such as China and India as well as supporting key integration projects across the group,  Mr Rolet added. (Philip Stafford, September 29)

Deutsche Brse appoints Gotsman as derivatives adviser

Ilan Gotsman, one of Europe s leading futures trading entrepreneurs, has joined Deutsche Brse as an adviser to develop its Eurex derivatives business.

The 51-year old Israeli was appointed with immediate effect, the German exchange told employees in a memo released on Tuesday.

His role will be to advise Eurex on ways to increase both volume and open interest in contracts, product development, pricing structures and improve its competitive position. He will also advise on identifying other growth opportunities, the company said.

He will report to Carsten Kengeter, the group s new chief executive, and Andreas Preuss, deputy chief executive and head of Eurex.

Mr Gotsman has maintained a low public profile but is well-known within the futures industry. In the early 1990s he helped to set up GH Financials, a London-based clearing broker.

He has also founded Butterfly Investments, which uses proprietary mathematical models to identify mispricing in the exchange-trade interest rate derivative. He also founded Matrix Capital Markets Ltd, a private trading derivative company in 2003. (Philip Stafford, September 8)

Markit names Mutnikas as co-head of Solutions business

Markit, the UK data provider, has appointed a former Bank of England risk adviser to help develop its fast-growing analytics business.

The London-based group named Yaacov Mutnikas as managing director and co-head of its Solutions business, it said in a statement. He reports to Lance Uggla, chief executive, and also joins Markit's executive team. He began last Thursday.

"I want analytics to be growing force in Markit in the future," said Mr Uggla. "When you think about the use of technology, the quantitative use of risk, in margin for collateral and the pieces of the post 2008 world, there is a lot of analysis required. It needs an analytic mind but also someone comfortable with technology and software. Yaacov has the toolbox to make a big difference."

Turnover at the unit rose 17 per cent to $82.3m in the three months to June 30, driven by new business wins and acquisitions. Excluding deals, Markit s Solutions business has recorded organic growth of 13 per cent in the first six months of the year.

Mr Mutnikas has worked as a senior adviser to the Bank of England on systemic risk. He has also worked at Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund, and risk management software business Algorithmics, where he was chief technology officer. It was sold to IBM for $387m in 2011.

He is also a keen rower and was part of the team that holds the record for the fastest 8-man crossing of the Atlantic. (Philip Stafford, September 7)

DTCC names Scharf as chief security officer

DTCC, the US post-trade services provider, has appointed former Bloomberg and Experian executive Stephen Scharf to the newly-created position of chief security officer.

The move will allow Mark Clancy, also DTCC chief information security officer, to become the full-time head of a venture to combat threats from computer hacking in financial markets.

Mr Scharf was previously global chief information security officer at Experian, the credit data scoring company.

The group said Mr Clancy will be able to assume his full-time position as chief executive of Soltra, the project between the DTCC and the financial services industry to encourage banks and other critical infrastructure companies to improve the sharing of information on cyber attacks.

 Risk management remains a top priority across the industry, and we look forward to Stephen s contributions as we continue to protect DTCC and the global markets,  said Andrew Gray, managing director, group chief risk officer at DTCC. (Philip Stafford, July 21)

WFE names FCA s Hill to key policy role

The World Federation of Exchanges, a trade association for the world s bourses, has hired Gavin Hill from the UK s main markets watchdog as its new head of regulatory affairs.

Mr Hill spent 14 years at the Financial Conduct Authority and its predecessors, and has overseen equities, derivatives and commodities exchanges since 2006 as a manager in its Markets and Supervision Divisions. He was also responsible for the FCA s commodity markets policy and served on committees for the Euronext College of Regulators.

The 50-year old organisation has moved to London and reshuffled its staff to bolster its role as an active lobbyist, compared to a traditional focus on market data and industry research.

 The addition of Gavin will significantly strengthen the WFE team and reinforce its regulatory capacity and institutional knowledge as well as its City of London stakeholder network at a key time for the organisation,  said Nandini Sukumar, the new chief executive of the WFE.

Mr Hill starts at the WFE on September 21. (Philip Stafford, July 7)

LCH.Clearnet names Vinci as head of US repo unit

LCH.Clearnet, the world s largest over-the-counter swaps clearer, has appointed John Vinci from BNY Mellon to spearhead a push into the US fixed income clearing business.

Mr Vinci, who will become Head of US RepoClear, will be responsible for developing the clearing house s business in a critical part of daily market operations.

Repo markets grease the wheels of the financial system by allowing bonds to be exchanged for cash on the proviso that they will be repurchased at a later date. At present LCH largely clears cash bond and repo trades across 13 European markets. Monthly volumes average around  ¬13tn.

 This new appointment will support the business  growth ambitions in North America, working with our clients and members to deliver greater efficiencies in the US fixed income markets,  said David Weisbrod, chief executive of LCH s US business.

Mr Vinci will start on July 13 and report to Mr Weisbrod and Bruce Kellaway, global head of fixed income at LCH. He has also worked at JPMorgan Chase and Bankers Trust.(Philip Stafford, July 7)

LSE appoints former SEC chair Schapiro to its board

Mary Schapiro, one of the US s most experienced markets regulators, will join the board of the London Stock Exchange Group as a non-executive director.

Her appointment reflects the LSE s focus on US stock and derivatives markets for growth. The group is hoping to capitalise on two trends   greater use of passive investments like exchange traded funds and a regulatory mandate to risk manage more over-the-counter swaps through clearing houses.

Ms Schapiro, who was chair of the Securities Exchange Commission between 2009 to 2012, will join on July 1. She has also been chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US derivatives regulator, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (Finra).

 Mary s extensive knowledge of the US financial and regulatory landscape, her broad global markets experience, and her understanding of complex financial infrastructure will be of great value to the group as we continue to grow our global footprint,  said Chris Gibson-Smith, LSE chairman.

Last year the LSE bought index compiler Frank Russell Company from insurer Northwestern Mutual   its largest deal to date   to expand into indices and exchange traded funds. More than $5tn in assets are benchmarked to Russell indices, which include the well-known Russell 2000 for listed small-cap US companies.

The LSE also created a new role, head of its US business, to be held by David Weisbrod. Mr Weisbrod will be responsible for implementing the LSE s plans for the region and also co-ordinate its relationship with its main regulators and other public stakeholders.

He will continue in his role as chief executive of the US business of LCH.Clearnet, the world s largest swaps clearing house. (Philip Stafford, June 11)

NYSE appoints Cunningham as new COO

The New York Stock Exchange has promoted Stacey Cunningham, once a floor trader at the Big Board, to be its new chief operating officer.

In her new role, Ms Cunningham will oversee the rollout of a new trading technology platform, called Pillar, and the introduction of NYSE's planned midday auction, which is intended to boost liquidity in thinly-traded securities.

Ms Cunningham, previously president of the exchange's governance division, will report to Tom Farley, NYSE Group president. She has also worked as head of sales and relationship management for NYSE. After leaving trading a decade ago, she also worked at Nasdaq.

 Stacey will contribute to our work on enhancing and simplifying our equities platforms, advocating for listed companies and our trading customers in market structure discussions, and innovating to deliver more value to the global capital markets,  said Mr Farley. (Philip Stafford, June 3)

Hasenpusch set to take over at CME Clearing Europe

CME Group, the world s largest futures operator, is set for a change of head at its European clearing business.

Lee Betsil, the current head of CME Clearing Europe, is expected to return to the US over the summer and the Chicago-based group plans to replace him with Tina Hasenpusch, the unit s current chief operating officer, according to two people familiar with the situation. Ms Hasnpusch s appointment is dependent on approval by UK regulators, the people said.

CME began clearing off-exchange interest rate swaps to challenge the market incumbent LCH.Clearnet for a share of the $500tn business two years ago, and has expanded to clear commodity, power and energy futures traded on its London-based exchange.

Its clearing house is also testing changes to the way it calculates the margin required to back interest rate swaps and will provide estimates for the impact on open positions to its clearing members later this year. (Philip Stafford, May 21)

Virtu appoints former ICAP Nixon to board

Virtu Financial, the US high-speed electronic market maker, has appointed former ICAP executive John Nixon to its board of directors, effective immediately.

Mr Nixon, who was most recently head of ICAP s US business, left the UK interdealer broker in March after a 16 year career in which he held a range of senior positions.

He had overseen ICAP s fixed income electronic broking business in the US, which covered some of the group s most important revenue-generating desks. His period in charge included the creation of ICAP s electronic over-the-counter interest rate derivatives platform, called iSwap, as well as its new swap execution facility, the new electronic marketplaces mandated by US regulators as they seek to strengthen global OTC markets.

Virtu lifted the lid on some modern high-speed trading practices when it floated on Nasdaq last month, with an equity market capitalisation of just under 3bn.

 I have known John during his successful career at ICAP and always relied on his integrity and judgment. We look forward to benefiting from his insights on the board as well as his deep and long term relationships,  said Vinnie Viola, Virtu s executive chairman, in a statement. (Philip Stafford, May 5)

Pickle joins TraditionSEF board

Robert Pickel, the former chief executive of Isda, has joined the board of the TraditionSEF, the US swap trading venue operated by Swiss interdealer broker Tradition.

Mr Pickel, who will become a non-executive director, stepped down from Isda after 17 years at one of the world s largest derivatives trade associations, where he led the industry response to the series of financial reforms agreed by politicians to banks and markets after the financial crisis.

Among the reforms included a US mandate to trade swaps on electronic marketplaces known as Swap Execution Facilities, or Sefs. In response many interdealer brokers such as Tradition, ICAP and Tullett Prebon brought out their own platforms to compete with already existing electronic fixed income trading venues like Tradeweb and Bloomberg.

 Bob is an industry leader who has been at the forefront of market reform, transparency, regulatory compliance and best practice for nearly two decades,  said Scott Fitzpatrick, chief executive of TraditionSEF.  He brings a tremendous network of relationships and a wealth of knowledge and experience to Tradition, and we are delighted that he recognises the value of Tradition s Sef strategy and has agreed to join our Sef Board.  (Philip Stafford, April 16)

Sir, Lawrence Summers identifies secular stagnation as a threat to the global economy and suggests that central banks support assets carrying a risk premium (The Big Read, October 8) . He doesn't say which instruments they should use or how they should use them.

Governments are used to investing in infrastructure, roads, bridges and even housing. It makes good press to cut a ribbon opening a new railway line wearing a yellow hard hat. In today's post-industrial world though, growth is generated researching, designing and developing monoclonal antibodies, artificial intelligence software, high temperature superconductors, social media platforms and similar products combining low physical capital and high intellectual capital. Outside a few well-known clusters, there is an acute shortage of capital managed by erstwhile serial entrepreneurs-turned- fund managers working with intellectually curious engineers and scientists to rapidly create products with the potential to create growth of significance to gross domestic product.

It is politically hard for civil servants to invest public money creating the seeds of such growth, yet professionally managed seed funds are one of the few instruments with the potential to give access to the wealth currently only available to the few lucky enough to thrive in the golden tech clusters.

Now is the time for central banks and governments to absorb the risk premium of creating equity seed capital funds with the scale, ambition and professionalism needed to stimulate sustained post-industrial growth.

WSJ.D Technology: Dell Considers Acquisition of EMC --- Private-equity firm would assist purchase; spinoff of VMWare is possible under a deal

Dell Inc. and private-equity firm Silver Lake are in advanced talks to buy EMC Corp., according to people familiar with the matter, a deal that would rank as the biggest technology-industry takeover ever and remove questions about EMC that have hung over the data-storage company for more than a year.

A deal for EMC could be reached within a week, according to some of the people, though it is also possible one won't be reached. The deal currently being discussed calls for the buyers to spin off some of EMC's VMware Inc. unit, some of the people said. EMC has been considering several options since The Wall Street Journal reported it was doing a strategic review last year, but this now seems to be the most likely outcome.

Shares of EMC were up 4.8% in middaytrading Thursday after the Journal reported on the possible deal. EMC has a market capitalization of $50 billion, and a deal would likely be valued at about that level, the person said. Chip maker Avago Technologies Ltd.'s pending $37 billion agreement to buy Broadcom Corp. is currently the largest pure-tech takeover ever struck.

There has been a wave of tech and other takeovers this year, and merger volume overall is running at a near-record pace.

EMC has been under pressure to boost its stock price since last year, when activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. took a roughly 2% stake in the company and urged it to spin off VMware. EMC owns 80% of VMware, which has a market value of $34 billion. An arrangement struck in January between Elliott and Hopkinton, Mass.-based EMC that had barred the fund from publicly pressuring EMC expired last month. Elliott has since stayed quiet.

Analysts have said it would make sense for Dell, which was taken private in a landmark leveraged buyout in 2013, to buy EMC's big data-storage operation.

Dell went private in a roughly $25 billion buyout by its founder, Michael Dell, and private-equity firm Silver Lake. Out of the public spotlight, it has pivoted from personal computers, which are facing headwinds from tablet computers and smartphones, toward more-profitable areas such as storage and security.

A deal with EMC would cement Dell's transition from a consumer-facing company to one focused on technology for large companies -- a far cry from the company Mr. Dell founded in his University of Texas dorm room in 1984.

Dell still carries more than $11.7 billion in debt, according to FactSet. It wasn't immediately clear how it would finance a potential purchase of EMC.

EMC reports its quarterly earnings on Oct. 21, and some analysts have speculated that the company has until then to announce a deal or risk a proxy fight. An acquisition or other big deal for EMC could also solve another question that has been looming over the company: the fate of its chief executive, Joe Tucci. Mr. Tucci indicated he might retire at the beginning of the year, though to date no succession plan has been announced.

EMC had held talks with Dell, the Journal reported in September 2014. EMC also had been in discussions about a merger with Hewlett-Packard Co., which ended before H-P announced plans to split itself in two in October 2014.

EMC was once synonymous with data storage. The company was a darling of the tech boom -- its shares were one of the best performers in the S&P 500 in the 1990s -- but it has fallen on harder times since. The shares have fallen 13% this year and are little changed from when Elliott began its campaign. In July, the company reported a 17% drop in quarterly profit and lowered its full-year outlook.

Storage has been a drag on earnings, a development attributed by EMCexecutive David Goulden on the company's most recent quarterly conference call to a "secular shift to the new digital age, defined by cloud, mobile, social and big data." Revenue growth at EMC's storage division has slowed from a 16% increase between 2010 and 2011 to a 2% gain between 2013 and 2014, according to regulatory filings. It competes with companies including NetApp Inc., Hewlett-Packard and International Business Machines Corp. A new competitor, Pure Storage, went public Wednesday, falling 5% in its debut.

EMC also owns software-development company Pivotal and network-security provider RSA. Its segments are run as separate businesses under a so-called federation structure that Elliott criticized. It isn't clear which, if any, might be included in a buyout of EMC by Dell.

A deal could amount to a win for Elliott, which has become one of the biggest activist investors focused on technology companies. Since disclosing its EMC stake in July 2014, it has launched campaigns and secured at least partial victories at companies including Informatica and Citrix Systems Inc.

Dorsey's role at Twitter raises Square concerns; Having a part-time chief comes at an awkward time for payments start-up

When Starbucks signed an agreement with Square to use its mobile payment app in its US coffee shops three years ago, it was hailed as the big debut for the then small payments start-up.

But that partnership quietly foundered last year, as the promise of millions of customers using the Square app to pay for coffee never materialised. Square Wallet, the mobile app featured in the partnership, was shut down and Howard Schultz, Starbucks chief executive, resigned from the Square board after one year.

Square is a $6bn company on the verge of going public. The Starbucks partnership is largely forgotten, but it illustrates some of the company's key challenges - and the many questions that remain over its focus. Concerns are also mounting after Jack Dorsey, the company's co-founder and chief executive, was appointed permanent chief executive of Twitter , his other start-up, on Monday.

For Square, having a part-time CEO has come at an inconvenient time. For two years it has been undergoing a difficult transition from being a consumer-facing payments app - the original dream behind the Starbucks partnership - to being an enterprise-facing company, whose fastest-growing services include providing capital to small businesses and selling subscriptions to business analytics software.

"Square kept playing around with consumer-facing products, but every single one of those products has been killed," says Zach Goldstein, founder of Thanx, a loyalty rewards company.

Payments processing still provides most of Square's revenue. Manhattan Venture Partners forecasts that the company will process $42bn in payments this year, generating $1.5bn in payments revenues - up 40 per cent from last year.

In 2010, when Square launched its first card reader, a white plastic device that connects to either an iPad or iPhone, it was one of the first such products that was available for small merchants, such as food trucks or farmers' market stalls.

But rising competition has put this business under threat, with rival payment processors from bigger companies such as Amazon and PayPal offering lower transaction fees.

There are also questions over how much longer merchants will rely on swiping credit cards, as mobile payments software such as Stripe and Braintree become more commonplace, and bricks-and-mortar stalls are replaced by online stores.

One of the bright spots for investors is Square Capital, which provides finance to small businesses in exchange for a fee repaid over time, similar to a loan.

The service, launched in May 2014, has handed out more than $225m, and is lending money at a rate of $1m a day. People close to the company say that Square Capital is highly profitable, adding that its rapid growth in recent months has helped propel Square towards profitability.

The return on these capital advances can be handsome: a $10,000 cash advance profiled on the Square Capital website generates a fee of 13 per cent. That is analogous to an annualised interest rate of more than 40 per cent, assuming the cash advance is repaid over four months. Yet Square is a relative late-comer to the boom in small business lending services: companies such as PayPal, Lending Club, OnDeck and Prosper all have fast-growing small business credit programmes as well.

Mr Dorsey issued a kind of manifesto for Square in a tweet on Monday. "Square stands for economic empowerment. We stand for financial systems that serve instead of rule. We stand for levelling the playing field."

However, the dramatic shifts the company has undergone in the past five years - from consumer-facing app to small business lender - suggest that there may be more pivots to come.

Square recently branched into food delivery, buying Caviar, and is expanding its enterprise software offerings. Some analysts worry about a lack of focus. "They have experimented with a lot of tangential business lines, and most of them haven't worked out that well," says Max Wolff, chief economist at Manhattan Venture Partners.

Being chief executive will only become harder with an IPO, as the company's business model will be under even closer public scrutiny. Square filed confidentially for an IPO this year to test the waters, and may publicly reveal its prospectus in coming months.

Square has already raised nearly $600m from investors, but some venture capitalists believe it may be preparing to tap the public markets now because private interest has dried up. At a time when companies such as Uber, the ride-hailing app, are delaying IPOs because of plentiful private funding, Square is doing the opposite. "No one wants to pay a huge price any more from the private side for Square," says one venture capitalist, who is not an investor in Square. "This may have been the best way for them to get money."

Square's investors range from well-known venture capital firms such as Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins to institutional investors including GIC and Silicon Valley heavyweights such as Yahoo chief executive Marissa Mayer. Those willing to go on the record put a positive spin on Mr Dorsey splitting his time between Twitter and Square.

"I think this will raise the profile of Square and open up new partnership opportunities," says Essam Abadir, chief executive of Aspire Ventures. As a chief executive, "you don't have to be a full-time operator, you have to be a full-time visionary".

Square's investors can only hope that is enough.

Moments

Feature launches to help inexperienced users

Twitter has launched Moments, a feature for finding news and entertainment on the messaging platform, in a product shake-up just a day after it appointed Jack Dorsey, right, as permanent chief executive.

Moments, previously known as Project Lightning, is aimed at new or inexperienced Twitter users looking for specific streams of information, with tweets curated around news and events by a team of editors.

Madhu Muthukumar , product manager for Moments, described it as "the best of what's happening on Twitter in an instant".

Moments is available to users in the US, and Twitter is working to roll it out globally.

Pricing Power Boosts Drug Firms --- Steady increases by companies outpace inflation and often are imposed even when demand falls

Demand for a drug called Avonex has declined every year for the past 10.

Not a problem for its manufacturer. U.S. revenue from the drug has more than doubled in that time, to $2 billion last year.

The key: repeated price increases. The multiple sclerosis drug's maker, Biogen Inc., raised its price an average of 16% a year throughout the decade -- 21 times in all.

It is an example of drug companies' unusual ability to boost prices beyond the inflation rate to drive their revenue, even when demand for the drugs doesn't cooperate.

A result of this pricing power is that across 30 top-selling drugs sold by pharmacies, U.S. revenue growth has far outpaced demand in the past five years, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of corporate filings and industry data. Revenue growth averaged 61%, three times the increase in prescriptions.

Attention has focused lately on new drugs with eye-popping prices and on a few whose price a new owner abruptly raised several-fold. But what many drug companies rely on for sales growth is a pattern of steady increases, year in and year out, on older medicines. Wholesale-price increases for the 30 drugs analyzed by the Journal averaged 76% over the five-year stretch from 2010 through 2014. That was more than eight times general inflation.

For 20 leading global drug companies last year, 80% of growth in net profits stemmed from price increases in the U.S., according to a May report by Credit Suisse.

Pricing power helps some in the pharmaceutical industry to compensate for sluggish demand, new competition or weak product pipelines. "Pricing has covered up a multitude of other disappointments over the past 15 years" in the sector, said Geoffrey Porges, a biotech analyst at AllianceBernstein LP.

This is no cause for cheer, of course, to certain other market participants, notably the many large companies that pick up the tab for their employees' prescriptions. Drug pricing has helped drive up spending on benefits at Lowe's Cos., said Bob Ihrie, a senior vice president at the home-improvement retailer.

"It's one thing when you read about a new drug in the newspaper, and all the costs of launching it. But when it's drugs that have been on the market and you see these price increases, you go, 'Why would this be?'" Mr. Ihrie said. "I feel like we're really being taken advantage of."

Pharmaceutical companies defend their pricing as helping to finance development of innovative medicines, an expensive and risky enterprise they say wouldn't attract investment without the potential for large returns when a new drug succeeds.

Many in the industry also say a focus on drug prices is shortsighted because it overlooks drugs' role in helping to contain overall health-care costs by preventing disease complications.

Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group, said that eventually, prices for all drugs will decline sharply when they lose patent protection and go generic.

Avonex maker Biogen has noted the central role of price boosts in the drug's success. "For 2014 compared to 2013, the increase in U.S. Avonex revenues was primarily due to price increases, partially offset by a decrease in unit sales volume of 10%," Biogen said in its 2014 financial report. A similar note has appeared in its annual reports since 2005.

But Biogen points to the way this revenue funds its quest for new medicines. The company spent an average of $1.19 billion annually on R&D from 2005 through 2014, or 24% of total revenue. Besides Avonex, the company has brought out two other multiple sclerosis drugs and is studying a treatment to repair nerve damage from the disease.

"Over the past two decades, which is the life of Avonex, we've done more than any other company to improve the treatment of multiple sclerosis," said Daniel McIntyre, a Biogen senior vice president. "The reality is that revenues from therapies available today make this possible."

What gives the pharmaceutical industry so much pricing power? Part of the reason is the patent protection drug makers have on new products, which keeps competitors from offering copies for up to two decades. "It's easier for consumers to substitute a car that meets their needs than it is to substitute a patented drug because no one else can make it," said Fiona M. Scott Morton, an economics professor at Yale University.

Another part of the answer is the insurance-based health system, in which consumers rarely feel the full brunt of price increases.

In most markets, products are ordered, paid for and consumed by the same party, notes Sara Fisher Ellison, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist. But prescription drugs are ordered by a physician, used by a patient and usually paid for by a third party, either an insurer or a large employer.

Neither doctors nor patients typically have much of a sense of drugs' prices. That blunts what economists call price sensitivity, the tendency of higher prices to curb demand.

"It confuses incentives and dampens the normal economic dynamics," Ms. Ellison said.

In addition, some drugs long on the market develop customer loyalty that provides a price umbrella. If patients who started on a drug such as Avonex a decade ago are happy with it, they or their doctors may see no reason to switch to a new one that comes along.

At an investment conference in 2009, Biogen's then-CEO James Mullen was asked whether the company could keep raising Avonex's price. He said he was surprised at "how unresistant the market has been to price increases." Mr. Mullen declined to comment.

Until about a year ago, price increases were garnering little public attention because spending on drugs had moderated. U.S. expenditures for most prescription drugs grew by an average of 2.7% from 2007 through 2013, according to data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. That was a slower growth rate than in several previous years, due largely to greater use of generics as some big-selling drugs lost patent protection.

The moderating price effect from generics now is tapering off. Pharmacy-benefits manager CVS Health Corp. said drug spending by its customers jumped 12.7% last year, more than triple the prior year's rise.

Price boosts represented more than 80% of this increase, CVS said.

Similarly, Medicare's spending on its prescription-drug benefit rose 8% last year on a per capita basis, after several years of averaging less than 1%. A leading reason for the surge was "price increases for both brand-name and generic drugs," Medicare's board of trustees said in a recent report.

The Journal examined 30 of last year's top drugs by revenue that are sold by U.S. pharmacies, looking at data from the start of 2010 through the end of 2014. The analysis used corporate financial statements, prescription figures from IMS Health Holdings Inc. and wholesale-pricing data provided by Truven Health Analytics. It excluded drugs that weren't yet on the market in 2010 or for which full data weren't available.

For 18 of these 30 drugs, both revenue and the number of dispensed prescriptions for them rose. But revenue rose twice as fast as prescriptions.

For the cancer drug Gleevec, from Novartis AG, prescriptions rose 2% over the five years, but the wholesale price doubled, to $102,000 for a year's supply at the end of 2014. The price increases helped to drive Novartis's U.S. revenue from the drug up 69% over the period, to $2.17 billion in 2014.

Gleevec is a strikingly effective drug that has been approved for more cancers since its 2001 launch for chronic myeloid leukemia, or CML. Asked about the price increases on Gleevec, Novartis said it is "a life-changing medicine" whose "success is funding the next generation CML innovations."

Drug makers often give rebates from the wholesale prices -- also called list prices -- to large purchasers such as insurers and pharmacy-benefit managers. Even so, the wholesale prices are a meaningful measure because they are the starting point from which rebates are given.

In competitive markets such as asthma and diabetes therapy, which have multiple drugs that can be substituted for one another, manufacturers often give especially large rebates as they seek better positioning on insurers' "formularies" of covered drugs.

Take insulin, of which there are several brands, among them Humalog from Eli Lilly & Co. The company gave rebates averaging 56% of its list price last year, Credit Suisse estimates.

A spokeswoman for Eli Lilly said that although it doubled Humalog's price over five years, steep rebates meant that its net price rose only 3%.

With a drug that is harder to substitute for, such as Amgen Inc.'s arthritis treatment Enbrel, discounts are shallower. Amgen raised Enbrel's wholesale price 88% over the five years. The rebates it provided averaged 21% last year, Credit Suisse estimates.

Over the five years from 2010 through 2014, U.S. prescriptions for Enbrel rose 2% while Amgen's revenue from it went up by a third.

Some rebates are locked in. Medicaid and the Veterans Health Administration are legally entitled to rebates of at least 23.1% and 24%, respectively, on purchases of patent-protected drugs. Drug companies must also pay additional rebates to the two health programs if their drug prices exceed inflation.

Among the 30 retail drugs the Journal examined, 10 produced revenue increases for their makers last year despite lower demand. Prescriptions for these drugs declined an average of 17%. But their wholesale prices went up an average of 80%. After discounts, revenue from the drugs rose 22%.

For two drugs in the 30, both revenue and demand fell. But revenue fell less.

For a different category of drugs -- those usually administered in doctors' offices, such as intravenous cancer drugs -- prescription volumes aren't reliably tracked by commercial databases. To assess these, the Journal identified last year's 10 top-selling such drugs and analyzed 2010-13 data on how much Medicare reimbursed doctors for them. Medicare bases these reimbursements on the average price that drug makers report receiving from customers, excluding certain government buyers such as the Veterans Health Administration and Medicaid.

For four of the doctor-administered drugs, the number of billing claims from doctors fell, yet Medicare's outlays to doctors rose because prices went up.

For example, Medicare payments for Neulasta, an infection-fighting drug sold by Amgen, rose 12% over the four years, while claims from doctors who used it fell 8%.

The manufacturer reported that the average net price it received for this 13-year-old drug rose 24% over the four years, undergirding Medicare's higher payouts.

An Amgen spokeswoman said the company prices its products to "reflect the economic value that is delivered to patients, providers and payers."

Avonex, the drug with 21 price increases during a decade of falling demand, reached the U.S. market in 1996. It was just the second drug shown to delay symptoms of the most common form of multiple sclerosis.

The injected drug had been beaten to the market by one called Betaseron, now sold by Bayer AG. Both are genetically engineered versions of a protein called beta interferon. Avonex needed less-frequent injections and soon claimed half the market.

The maker of Avonex, Biogen, initially set its wholesale price at about $9,200 for a year of treatment. The strategy at that time focused on expanding the market, said a former Biogen vice president of sales, Michael Bonney. "We probably had pricing power, but we decided not to exercise it," he said.

As more MS drugs appeared, including some taken orally, (Avonex is injected), Avonex's share of the market steadily fell. Each year from 2005 through 2014, the company sold fewer units of Avonex, company financial statements show.

But Biogen's U.S. revenue from the drug kept growing as it raised the price up to three times a year. In the decade through 2014, the wholesale price, before discounts or rebates, more than quadrupled to an annual $62,000 per patient.

When former CEO Mr. Mullen was asked about the price increases at the 2009 investment conference, he said, according to a transcript: "If there's price increases that can be taken and delivered to shareholders, we'll go get it, but I do think we got to make sure we take a long enough view and you don't start to put this thing in a box, where you get the backlash."

Today, Avonex is among the least-popular MS drugs, said Clyde Markowitz, a specialist in the disease at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, but it is still used by patients who have had good results. While costs for all MS drugs have skyrocketed in the past decade, Dr. Markowitz said, Avonex's price growth has been extraordinary.

"It's absolute insanity, what's happened," he said. "For a drug that's 20 years old, and they just keep jacking up the price."

Rich Connecticut Has Poor Pension Stash

The state with the richest population may not have enough money in its own pockets.

Connecticut has roughly half of what it needs to pay future retirement benefits for its workers, meaning the home to scores of hedge funds and some of the country's wealthiest towns is wrestling with financial distress rivaling that of Kentucky or Illinois.

Some investors concerned about the size of Connecticut's pension hole are backing away from bonds issued by the Constitution State or demanding bigger rewards to hold them. Investors in some Connecticut state bonds now get a premium of about half a percentage point above benchmark bonds from other states, up from 0.28 percentage point a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters Municipal Market Data. Only four other U.S. states are now priced as riskier bets.

Still, some in the state say Connecticut's affluence is making it difficult to overcome complacency about fiscal problems. Yields on the state's debt would be even higher and budget problems would be worse if not for a deep pool of wealthy in-state investors willing to gobble up Connecticut's tax-deductible debt, according to analysts.

"There's almost limitless money to buy Connecticut bonds," said Matt Fabian of research firm Municipal Market Analytics. Investors "are getting less of a risk premium than I think you deserve because of the high demand created by the wealth of the taxpayers in the state," added Paul Mansour, head of municipal research at Hartford, Conn.-based Conning.

Connecticut's surprising pension predicament shows how even the wealthiest parts of the U.S. are struggling to keep pace with ballooning retirement obligations that now amount to $1 trillion nationally.

Connecticut's unfunded pension liabilities more than doubled over the past decade to $26 billion as the state's retirement system reeled from inadequate state contributions, a subpar investment record and longer lifespans for its retirees.

The state, boosted by wealth concentrated in towns such as Greenwich and New Canaan, has a per capita income of $64,864, the highest in the U.S., according to a Fitch Ratings analysis of Bureau of Economic Analysis data. But the state still finished the fiscal year ended June 30 in the red as tax revenues fell below expectations and has projected annual deficits of $650 million or more after its current two-year budget cycle ends, according to a report by the state's Office of Fiscal Analysis.

The state's pension problems represent "a ticking time bomb," said State Sen. L. Scott Frantz, a Republican whose district includes the wealthiest section of the state. He is worried residents will leave and Connecticut will "end up as another Detroit," a city that filed for bankruptcy protection in 2013, absent more dramatic changes.

Some Connecticut officials and union leaders said they are unfazed by the pension problems and pledge to reverse the deficit in the coming decades. Their strategy hinges partly on predictions the various state retirement systems will be able to earn 8% or more annually, a goal that is more optimistic than most public pensions across the U.S. The average target for all state plans is 7.68%, according to the National Association of State Retirement Administrators.

"The truth of the matter is that the state of Connecticut can afford to make up the difference over time," said Dan Livingston, a Hartford-based labor attorney who has negotiated on behalf of the state's public workers for decades.

Connecticut's pension gap developed as a result of decisions made over decades to scrimp on payments when the economy sputtered and to cut taxes, according to state leaders and public-finance experts. And there is a quirk: Connecticut officials contributed almost no money to the state's various public pensions from the late 1930s until the early 1980s, meaning little had been saved up because the state had chosen not to prefund the retirement system for future payouts.

The smaller base of assets hurt Connecticut during the 1990s when a run-up in the stock market pushed most pensions around the U.S. to fully funded status -- meaning they had more assets than liabilities, according to Gregory Mennis, director of Pew Charitable Trusts' public-sector retirement-systems project. Connecticut's ratio of assets to liabilities, meanwhile, was just 72% in 2001, according to Pew, which tracks pension-fund finances.

Furthermore, according to the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, Connecticut's annual investing returns have trailed the national average by a full percentage point since 2000, because of a heavy allocation to stocks that inflicted deep losses first during the dot-com bust and then the 2008 financial crisis. Connecticut pensions eventually shifted some bets to nontraditional investments, like hedge funds, but those produced lower returns as the equity markets rallied in recent years.

Connecticut only has 51.9% of the assets it needs to pay future obligations to workers, lower than all states except for Illinois and Kentucky, according to the National Association of State Retirement Administrators.

Connecticut has scaled back pension benefits in recent years, reducing cost-of-living adjustments for retirees and pledging to make the appropriate annual payments to fully fund the system by 2032. State officials have raised taxes twice since 2011 as a way of covering some liabilities, reduced its workforce by more than 3% and held back on deeper spending on education and local aid.

Connecticut now allocates 10% of its budget to paying down unfunded pension obligations, up from about 7% four years ago, according to Connecticut Office of Policy and Management Secretary Ben Barnes, who oversees the budget.

"We have plenty of resources to address whatever shortfalls, or whatever fiscal crisis might develop in the short run," Mr. Barnes said.

But there are signs that the pressure on Connecticut could intensify absent deeper changes. Standard & Poor's Ratings Services lowered the outlook on Connecticut's bonds in March to negative from stable, meaning they could be downgraded from their current double-A rating. Moody's Investors Service already has placed Connecticut among the lowest-rated states. And Fitch Ratings, although it removed Connecticut's negative outlook in July, warned the state has a "narrow margin of flexibility."

States rarely default and generally carry higher ratings as a result. Moody's, which changed the way it calculates pension costs two years ago, has been more aggressive at downgrading states and cities with sizable unfunded obligations, while S&P and Fitch have generally taken a more optimistic view.

Fredrena deGraffenreaidt, a 61-year-old state retiree from East Hartford, is worried about whether future benefit cuts would force her to sell her house and move to a cheaper state, she said.

"Everyone sees us as this very wealthy state and yet our pension isn't 100% funded," Ms. deGraffenreaidt said. "How is that possible?"

NESTLE

Talks Consider Deal

With Ice-Cream Firm

Nestle SA is in advanced talks with European ice-cream maker R&R Group to form a joint venture for ice cream in Europe and Africa with an annual revenue of three billion Swiss francs ($3.1 billion).

The world's largest packaged-foods company said the proposed joint venture with R&R, owned by French private-equity firm PAI Partners, would help its ice-cream business grow.

It expects the tie-up to be implemented next year and to be chaired by Luis Cantarell, Nestle's executive vice president for Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. R&R said the chief executive of the combined business would be its CEO Ibrahim Najafi.

Switzerland-headquartered Nestle will contribute its ice-cream businesses in Europe, Egypt, the Philippines, Brazil and Argentina to the new joint venture and transfer its European frozen-food businesses, excluding the pizza operation.

Nestle holds roughly 10.8% of the global ice-cream market, while R&R has 0.8% according to research firm Euromonitor. The new joint venture would help Nestle better compete with archrival Unilever PLC, which has a 22.8% share of the global ice-cream market and which last week said it had agreed to buy Italian ice-cream maker Grom.

TELENOR

Company Divests

VimpelCom Stake

Telenor ASA of Norway said Monday it has decided to divest its one-third interest in VimpelCom Ltd., the Amsterdam-based telecommunications operator facing accusations of corruption by U.S. and Dutch authorities.

Based on VimpelCom's closing price on Friday, Telenor's 33% stake is worth approximately 20 billion Norwegian kroner, or roughly $2.4 billion. That compares with Telenor's overall market value of 233 billion Norwegian kroner.

Telenor said selling the asset could take some time, adding it expected to record a noncash impairment of 7.5 billion Norwegian kroner against its third-quarter earnings to reflect Vimpelcom's lower value in its books.

Shares in VimpelCom, one of Russia's largest telecom companies, have lost 67% of their value in the past two years.

HTC

Smartphones Maker

Posts Quarterly Loss

HTC Corp. said Monday that it swung to a net loss for the third quarter as the company continued to struggle in the competitive smartphone market.

Taiwan-based HTC said its net loss totaled 4.48 billion Taiwan dollars (US$137 million) for the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with a net profit of NT$600 million a year earlier. The company's revenue dropped 49% to NT$21.4 billion from NT$41.9 billion in the same period last year.

The downbeat results came as no surprise as HTC has issued a profit warning and announced a series of restructuring efforts, including job cuts, in response to sluggish demand and weak sales in China.

Once the world's top smartphone maker by volume, HTC in 2013 fell out of the top 10 largest handset vendors by shipments.

SUNCOR

Takeover Bid Made

For Oil-Sands Firm

Suncor Energy Inc. on Monday said it launched an all-stock takeover offer valued at 4.3 billion Canadian dollars ($3.3 billion) for struggling oil-sands producer Canadian Oil Sands Ltd.

Suncor, Canada's largest crude-oil producer, said its offer of 0.25 of a share for each Canadian Oil Sands share represents a 43% premium based on closing share prices on Friday. ,

Suncor, which is based in Calgary, Alberta, values its unsolicited offer at C$6.6 billion, including Canadian Oil Sands debt.

The offer for Canadian Oil Sands, which owns 37% of the Syncrude oil-sands mining consortium, comes as the oil producer struggles with a slumping stock price due partly to low crude prices.

Suncor recently said it was looking at selling some of its future production amid slumping oil prices and a expanding debt load.

For Suncor, the deal would give it a growing presence in the Canadian oil sands.

IPhone Maker Buys

Startup VocalIQ

Apple Inc. has purchased an artificial-intelligence startup that could help make iPhone users' interactions with the virtual assistant Siri more natural.

Apple bought VocalIQ Ltd., a U.K.-based software maker working on ways to improve computers' ability to understand human speech, and to "speak" more naturally. The terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

An Apple spokesman confirmed the deal with the company's standard statement after an acquisition, saying Apple "buys smaller technology companies from time to time, and we generally do not discuss our purpose or plans."

VocalIQ didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

GOOGLE

Group Adds Funding

For Messaging Firm

Google Inc. has invested in a new round of funding for Symphony Communication Services LLC that values the Wall Street-backed messaging company at roughly $650 million, people familiar with the matter said.

Google's support adds a technology-industry stalwart to the list of banks and investment firms -- such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley and BlackRock Inc. -- that have backed Symphony and its fledgling communications software.

Symphony's latest funding round is expected to close this week, the people said.

Representatives for Google and Symphony declined to comment.

Symphony was created as an alternative to Bloomberg LP's terminals, which have long been a hallmark of trading floors but are viewed as a significant cost center for financial firms.

BOC AVIATION

EVA Airways Gets

Two Airbus Planes

BOC Aviation, the aircraft-leasing arm of Bank of China Ltd., has arranged a long-term lease of two Airbus A330-300 jets to EVA Airways Corp. of Taiwan.

The placement of the twin-aisle planes, in addition to two Boeing Co. 777-300ER jets already flying with EVA Air, reflect the continued growth and maturity of the Singapore-based firm's leasing business.

The smaller single-aisle jets such as the Airbus A320 or the Boeing 737 are easier to place with airlines and preferred by leasing firms. BOC Aviation has a portfolio of 256 owned and managed aircraft operated by 61 airlines.

IDI Gazeley Marks First Investment in the Netherlands With Warehouses Purchase; Logistics real-estate arm of Brookfield Property Partners bought portfolio for around $124 million

The logistics real-estate arm of Canadian firm Brookfield Property Partners LP has bought a portfolio of 13 warehouses in the Netherlands.

IDI Gazeley on Monday said it acquired the properties from Dutch real-estate fund Eurindustrial NV. The deal, at just under  ¬110 million ($124 million), marks IDI Gazeley's first investment in the Netherlands, broadening its European presence.

The warehouses are leased to companies including United Parcel Service Inc. and Canon Inc.

Industrial "http://www.wsj.com/articles/property-investors-flock-to-europes-warehouses-1427996643" as investors, on the hunt for returns, have tuned in to a growing need among "http://www.wsj.com/articles/e-commerce-is-triggering-rapid-changes-in-warehouse-values-1432140502" for distribution capabilities.

The investment volume of industrial property was  ¬6.1 billion in the second quarter, up from around  ¬5 billion in the year-earlier period, according to broker CBRE.

The increasing level of investment has steadily pushed returns lower. In Europe, the capitalization rate a measure of yield for industrial property in the third quarter was 6.6%, having fallen consistently each quarter from 8.1% in the second quarter of 2013, according to Real Capital Analytics.

 We have seen strong demand" for this and other logistics portfolios, said Pat McGillycuddy, chief executive, Europe and China, at IDI Gazeley.

Increased investment into real-estate assets around the world has sparked concerns that the market for offices, shopping centers and warehouses could be overheating.

Brookfield isn't the only global real-estate investor to expand its footprint in European warehouses. Blackstone Group LP created a logistics arm, Logicor, in 2012 to buy up European logistics sites. Last year the group more than doubled the size of its portfolio to over  ¬2 billion.

IDI Gazeley has warehouse holdings valued at over $3.6 billion in North America, Europe and Asia, with 57 million square feet of assets under management. It operates in seven counties in Europe, and is planning to continue acquiring assets in the Netherlands and elsewhere, Mr. McGillycuddy said.

Hedge fund recruits ex-Google engineer as technology chief; Financials

Two Sigma, a rapidly expanding $28bn quantitative hedge fund group, has hired a senior Google engineer to be its chief technology officer.

The move highlights how the ranks of computer scientists are swelling in the increasingly algorithmically powered alternative investment industry.

The hedge fund group has hired Alfred Spector from Google, where he spent eight years as vice-president of research and special initiatives until leaving earlier this year. At Google, Mr Spector - who has a PhD in computer science from Stanford University - worked on machine learning, speech recognition and translation. Before that he worked at IBM.

Two Sigma was set up in 2001 by computer scientist David Siegel and statistician John Overdeck. Both have a background from DE Shaw, another large "quant" hedge fund, and harness the immense strides in computing power, data management and complex algorithms to mine global markets for lucrative investment opportunities.

"Alfred's unique skills and experience in the areas of engineering, research, and strategy are ideally suited to our company at this stage in our development," said David Siegel, co-chairman of Two Sigma. "We are confident that he will help us continue to innovate for the benefit of our investors."

A number of high-profile Wall Street luminaries have jumped ship for the West Coast tech industry in recent years, such as Ruth Porat , who left her position as chief financial officer at Morgan Stanley for the same position at Google.

But the hedge fund world can still offer compensation packages that are competitive with even the biggest Silicon Valley giants, and a similarly intellectual challenge.

"Technology has had exceptional and growing impact in nearly every sector over the last 20 years. When it comes to investment management, Two Sigma has an unmatched ability to apply technology for beneficial innovation," Mr Spector said in a statement.

"I am excited to work with such a talented team of professionals to help advance the use of technology to discover value in the world's data and much more."

So-called "systematic" investment managers and strategies have been one of the hotter areas in the hedge fund industry in recent years, but some analysts are concerned that their tendency to often target a specific level of market volatility as a risk management tool could ironically be aggravating market movements.

On its website Two Sigma describes its investment approach as scientific, and said "risk is a living thing in our business, and we watch over it carefully".

Moody's Corp. said Wednesday that market volatility and subdued economic growth in some regions continue to moderate fixed-income activity, and the ratings firm lowered its revenue guidance for its ratings business outside the U.S.

Despite that warning, Moody's the world's No. 2 ratings firm by revenue and total number of ratings issued after Standard's & Poor's Ratings Services backed its earnings guidance for the year in a news release ahead of its investor conference in New York.

 We continue to see generally accessible financial market conditions, as well as strong demand for many of our Moody'sAnalytics products," said Chief Executive Raymond McDaniel.

At the Moody's Investors Service ratings unit, the company's biggest revenue driver, revenue for the year is still expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range. But outside of the U.S., revenue in that unit is seen declining in the low-single digits, compared with July's call for flat sales.

Revenue at the analytics division, which provides financial data and other types of market intelligence to investors and banks, is still expected to increase in the mid-single-digit range, though professional services revenue is now seen falling in the low-double-digit range, versus Moody's earlier call for a drop in the high-single digits.

In all, the company still expects earnings of $4.55 to $4.65 a share.

U.S. stocks edged higher Tuesday, but pared their sharpest gains as a rally in biotechnology shares fizzled.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 47.24, or 0.3%, to 16049.13, while the S&P 500 added 2.32, or 0.1%, to 1884.09.

The Nasdaq Composite Index shed 26.65, or 0.6%, to 4517.32.

Stocks bounced from the opening bell, with the Dow notching a 117-point rise that reversed course as the day went on. A recovery in beaten-down biotech stocks lost steam, sending the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index down 0.6%. The index is down 18% in the last month.

Other health-care shares ended higher. Health stocks in the S&P 500 gained 0.9%.

 People are trying to do a little shopping," said Michael Antonelli, equity sales trader at brokerage firm Robert W. Baird.  We are seeing good buy orders on our desk."

Demand for ultrasafe government debt rose. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.053% from 2.093% on Monday as prices rose.

Global stock markets have been sliding in recent sessions because of renewed worries over slowing growth and questions over the Federal Reserve's "http://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-dudley-still-likely-on-track-for-2015-rate-rise-1443448239".

Benjamin Mandel, executive director at the multiasset solutions group at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, which oversees $170 billion, said his team has been whittling down exposure to stocks this year in favor of fixed-income assets.

 You just don't want to be captive to these knee-jerk reactions and the spillover from emerging markets," Mr. Mandel said.  We continue to be circumspect about equities."

European shares fell. The Stoxx Europe 600 lost 0.7%. The DAX in Germany fell 0.35%. "http://www.wsj.com/articles/glencore-shares-rebound-despite-gloomy-china-outlook-1443514378" as well as an emissions scandal at Volkswagen AG have added to investor unease.

Shares of IHS Inc. rose 5% after the information and analytics provider said profits in its latest quarter rose 26%.

Later this week, investors will get an update on the U.S. job market, which could give guidance on the Fed's timeline for rate increases. The report, due Friday, is expected to show 200,000 jobs were added in September. The unemployment rate is expected to remain at 5.1%.

China's September reading on manufacturing activity on Thursday will provide new evidence on the economic health of the country.

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/asian-shares-slide-1443497639". Japan's Nikkei Stock Average shed more than 4%, erasing all gains for the year. The Shanghai Composite Index lost 2%.

 Individual events are building up on a very negative picture for confidence. When markets are in a fragile mood, everything is bad news," said Michael Stanes, investment director at Heartwood Investment Management, which oversees about $3.5 billion in assets.

In commodities, U.S.-traded crude oil rose 1.7% to $45.23 a barrel. Gold fell 0.4% to $1,1127.10 a troy ounce.

Cost of Credit-Card Fraud Is Set to Shift; Retailers that haven t upgraded systems to accept more secure chip cards to assume risk

A change that is putting new credit cards in many Americans' wallets will also shift billions of dollars of card-fraud liability to retailers from big banks.

Merchants are scrambling to deal Thursday with the end of a longtime policy in which financial institutions absorbed the cost of certain fraudulent credit-and-debit card transactions.

Starting that day, the merchants will have to foot the bill for the transactions if they haven't upgraded their payment terminals to accept new, more secure cards.

For millions of U.S. consumers, the new cards being rolled out are replacing the familiar action of swiping a card with dipping it at the cash register. After the change, consumers in most cases will still not be liable for fraudulent transactions on their cards.

Behind the scenes, though, the risks of card fraud are shifting. Under timetables announced by card networks Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc., most card issuers starting Thursday are expected to immediately start passing certain fraudulent transaction costs onto retailers that don't have the capability to process the chip-based cards, industry executives said.

The move from the old cards with the magnetic stripe on the back to the new ones with an embedded computer chip is aimed at reducing fraud with counterfeit cards. Historically, card issuers such as banks and credit unions covered those costs.

The new chip cards, which have been flooding consumer mailboxes for months, provide a unique code for each transaction, compared with static data that are contained on the traditional magnetic strip.

While the chip itself won't stop thieves from hacking a merchant's payment system, any stolen card information will be virtually useless since the data change each time it is used.

Some of the nation's largest merchants have already switched on the upgraded terminals, which should shield them from the new liability. Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Home Depot Inc. and Target Corp. are among the big retailers that have already been processing chip-card transactions. Best Buy Co. says it will have chip-card readers in more than 1,400 stores by Thursday, while Lowe's Cos. says it expects to have chip-card capabilities in more than 90% of its nearly 1,800 stores by the end of October.

Many smaller merchants won't have the technology ready in time. Only about 19% of merchants will have the equipment to accept the chip cards by the end of the year, according to Mercator Advisory Group, a consulting firm.

Companies that process payments for merchants are adding staff and training workers to deal with retailers that may be surprised to find themselves on the hook.

Robert Carr, chief executive officer of Heartland Payment Systems Inc., a Princeton. N.J., company that processes debit-and credit-card transactions for merchants, estimates that about 150,000 of his 180,000 customers, aren't ready to accept chip cards.

 Small merchants are going to be shocked and I think they're going to be mad as hell," said Mark Horwedel, chief executive of the Merchant Advisory Group, an organization of retailers.

In recent months, issuers have sent out more than 200 million of the new chip cards, which also contain the magnetic strip so they can still be used at merchants that haven't upgraded their equipment. Merchants aren't officially required to install the technology to accept the new cards, but they risk incurring more costs if they don't.

Counterfeit cards represented $3 billion of the estimated $3.8 billion in fraud losses attributed to brick-and-mortar store transactions last year, according to Aite Group, a Boston-based consulting firm.

The new chip cards have a visible computer chip embedded on the front. Consumers must dip them into a slot at the bottom of the checkout terminal and leave them there throughout the transaction rather than making a quick swipe in the traditional method.

Other countries around the world have experienced significant declines in counterfeit fraud since their governments required the adoption of new chip cards and terminals.

In the U.S., the decision to upgrade to the new cards is made by card issuers such as American Express Co., Capital One Financial Corp., Bank of America Corp. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

The merchant decides whether to upgrade the payment terminal, while card networks such as Visa and MasterCard set the rules for liability.

The Retail Industry Leaders Association, a trade group that represents merchants, estimates retailers are spending more than $8 billion to upgrade payment systems to accept the new cards. It says  most large retailers will have the new terminals running this fall."

Small and-midsize merchants may be particularly vulnerable because they have been slower to adopt the new technology. Restaurants, grocery stores and liquor stores are also among the most popular places where cardholder data are stolen, according to Rippleshot, a fraud-analytics firm in Chicago.

 We're increasing our resources in anticipation of a potential spike" in the number of fraudulent charges that will be charged back to the merchant, said Deanna Karhuniemi, vice president of chip-card strategy at Chase Commerce Solutions, a J.P. Morgan Chase unit that processes payments for merchants.

Despite the new rules, card issuers will continue to bear the cost of fraud stemming from counterfeit cards that contain data stolen from nonchip cards.

A recent report from Mercator estimates that 58% of credit cards will be chip-enabled by the end of 2015. Banks are also now issuing chips on debit cards as well.

Commercial Property -- The Commish: Newmark Grubb Knight Frank Reaps the Fruits of a Deal

By Theresa Agovino

On Monday, a big chunk of Cushman & Wakefield's Boston leasing and sales brokerage team is set to begin work at Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, in a resolution of one of the brokerage industry's biggest battles for brains this year.

Newmark Chief Executive Barry Gosin had been pursuing the team, led by Boston top-producer Rob Griffin, for three years. He moved in for the win as Cushman closed its $2 billion merger with DTZ this month. The group includes about 30 brokers.

"He was relentless," said Mr. Griffin. But he added: "He gave me time to think of it."

Poaching the Griffin team was a major -- but not inexpensive -- coup for Newmark, which has been on a growth tear since 2011, when it was acquired by BGC Partners Inc., a spinoff of Cantor Fitzgerald. Boston is a big prize: It was the second-largest U.S. sales market for commercial property in the 12 months that ended in June, with $9.84 billion in deals, according to Real Capital Analytics.

The deal also is a major step in the efforts by Mr. Gosin and Newmark President James Kuhn in building the firm's sales business, an important piece of its strategy to build a firm with the global clout of industry leaders CBRE Group Inc. and JLL. It comes a few months after Newmark purchased Apartment Realty Advisors, one of the largest brokers of U.S. apartment buildings, for $110 million.

This year, Newmark will broker sales of about $20 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. Next year it could do $30 billion to $35 billion, these people said.

"We hope that Rob will do for the commercial market what ARA did for us in residential," Mr. Kuhn said in an interview Saturday.

But losing the Griffin team was an out-of-the-gate setback for Cushman and its chief executive, industry veteran Brett White, who also is pushing hard to make the firm an upper-echelon player like JLL and CBRE. Cushman's brokerage operation in Boston has been badly hurt, although the office remains strong in appraisal and building management.

The departures were a textbook example of one of the big risks of mergers in the real-estate-services business: Top producers can walk out the door.

Newmark's success at luring the Griffin team also underscores the intensity of the competition these days for talent in the hot brokerage business, which is being fueled by rising deal activity. Mr. Griffin also talked to other firms about a possible move, and the signing bonus being discussed for his group exceeded $20 million, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Mr. White, of Cushman, has promised to be a fierce competitor in the industry scrum over talent. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal this month -- before news of Newmark's Boston Tea Party broke -- he pointed to the financial muscle of the investment group led by private-equity firm TPG.

"I don't think anyone can doubt that our ownership is eager to deploy capital," he said.

Mr. White predicted that Cushman would generate enough money from cash flow to finance growth, so it wouldn't need to take on more debt or more equity from its owners. He declined to specify how much cash flow the firm had available, but experts estimate that next year Cushman could generate about $200 million.

Newmark's parent, BGC, also has a sizable war chest. This year, BGC said it was planning to sell its Trayport business, which designs commodity-trading systems, in a deal expected to boost its available capital.

Markets
The New Bond Market: Big Buyers of Corporate Debt Are Other Corporations; More than half of corporate cash is invested in investment-grade corporate bonds

Companies reaching for better returns on their cash have found a new favorite investment other companies' bonds and they are loading up.

Cash-rich companies like Apple Inc., Oracle Corp. and Johnson & Johnson are snapping up corporate bonds sold by highly rated companies such as Verizon Communications Inc. and Gilead Sciences Inc.

More than half of corporate cash held by U.S. companies this August was invested in investment-grade corporate bonds, a record, according to investment-software company Clearwater Analytics. Meanwhile, treasurers have reduced their companies' holdings of more traditional investments such as U.S. Treasurys, commercial paper and bank certificates of deposit.

Companies are betting highly rated corporate bonds are safe repositories for cash that will pay higher rates than more traditional bank deposits or money-market funds. But they are also increasing the risk to an asset where principal protection is the priority.

If interest rates rise quickly, the value of their lower-yielding existing bonds could plummet. A major market disruption could also make it difficult for companies to sell their holdings if they need the cash. Either could lead to write-downs or actual losses if they sell at lower prices than they paid.

For now, treasurers are figuring the bet isn't that risky. Companies' balance sheets are in good shape, and buyers are focusing on bonds that mature within five years, which carry lower risks than bonds that take longer to mature.

Still, the past offers plenty of examples of companies that got burned when reaching for yield. Procter & Gamble Co. lost more than $100 million after it bought derivatives from Bankers Trust Co. in 1993 in an unsuccessful bet that interest rates would remain low. MetroPCS Communications Inc. wrote down millions in investments in 2007 because it invested in auction-rate securities and couldn't sell the holdings. Even mainstream investments can have hiccups in tough times. After Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.'s 2008 collapse during the financial panic, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. was forced to borrow $600 million from its credit lines because it couldn't access cash trapped in locked money-market funds.

 To get more return, you have to take more credit risk," said a treasurer at a large technology company that has actively been buying corporate bonds.

Aggressive buying by their peers is one factor that has spurred U.S. companies to issue enormous quantities of debt. As of Sept. 24, issuance of investment-grade corporate debt including financial borrowers hit $1 trillion in 2015, on pace for a record year, according to data tracker Dealogic.

One frustration for treasurers is short-term interest rates that have remained near zero since late 2008. Adding to that is a bevy of regulations that have made it more difficult for them to park money in bank accounts or money funds.

New banking rules by the Federal Reserve have made it more expensive for banks to hold large corporate deposits. As a result, they are discouraging companies from socking too much money away in their accounts.

New Securities and Exchange Commission rules could make money-market funds less attractive by forcing them to abandon their $1 share price and allow them to impose fees on shareholders for withdrawing assets or suspend redemptions temporarily to thwart panic selling.

That makes treasurers' less confident that they will get all their money back, and have access to their money, in a crisis. The rules won't take effect for another year, but treasurers are already turning elsewhere.

 There's really no other game in town," said Ben Campbell, chief executive officer of Capital Advisors Group Inc., which advises companies on their cash- management strategies.

The biggest corporate investors in bonds come from the technology and pharmaceuticals sectors, where companies have cash to spare. iPhone maker Apple, for one, held almost $100 billion worth of corporate bonds at the end of June. That was a 25% increase from the end of its 2014 fiscal year, representing almost half the cash and cash equivalents on its balance sheet. The total is also almost equal to the value of bonds issued in June this year.

Oracle, the business-software maker, held $28.9 billion in corporate debt at the end of May, 73% more than a year ago. The bonds made up 53% of the company's cash and equivalent assets.

Pharmaceutical giant Johnson & Johnson held $3.5 billion of corporate bonds at the end of June, roughly 10% of its liquid, financial assets, and a 162% increase from the end of 2014. Rival Amgen Inc. held $15.9 billion in bonds at end of June, up 22% from December.

Many of those companies also have much of their cash in Europe, where rates are even lower than in the U.S. With few places to put it, and unable to bring the funds home without paying U.S. taxes, the corporations are investing in the bond market, said one banker who has sold bonds to companies.

 They've gone from an infrequently seen but nice-to-have participant to a very commonly seen participant," the banker said.

Borrowers say companies are playing big roles in some large transactions. When Verizon issued the largest bond on record two years ago to fund the takeover of Vodafone Group PLC's share of their U.S. wireless joint venture, many  large companies" helped take down the $49 billion in securities, said Fran Shammo, the company's finance chief. He declined to name them.

Earlier this month, corporations were among the bidders for $10 billion in bonds issued by pharmaceutical giant Gilead, a person familiar with the transaction said.

The corporate buyers have started to make their presence felt in the market. As their appetite for bonds has increased, prices for securities with shorter maturities have risen, said John Majoros, a managing director at Wasmer, Schroeder & Co., which manages $5.5 billion in assets.

He said his firm has been buying bonds with longer maturities to get around that competition and hopefully find better bargains.

Home-improvement retailer Lowe's Cos. was able to sell $250 million of bonds maturing in 2018 at full price earlier this month because of high demand. Conversely, it offered debt maturing in 10 and 30 years at a discount to entice investors. Investors ask for discounts on securities to boost their yields.

The bond buying is causing companies to act like mutual funds or brokers, investing cash on behalf of their shareholders, argued Victoria Ivashina, a finance professor at Harvard Business School.

 This is a risky business," she said.  Can they get it wrong? Absolutely they can get it wrong."

OCWEN FINANCIAL

Job Cuts Represent

10% of Workforce

Ocwen Financial Corp. plans to cut about 300 residential servicing jobs at its Waterloo, Iowa, facility, accounting for about 10% of its total U.S. workforce.

The mortgage-servicing company said the employees can apply for jobs at other Ocwen facilities and will try to lease out half of the building.

After more than a year of problems with regulators, Ocwen has worked to sell some of its mortgage-servicing rights and concentrate on mortgages that are not owned by government agencies.

In May, the company said it would discontinue residential-servicing operations at its Houston facility, affecting about 140 employees.

CARL ICAHN

New Website for

Investor to Air Views

Billionaire investor Carl Icahn is launching another website to make his views known.

The new site, CarlIcahn.com, adds to a series of websites and social media accounts on which Mr. Icahn periodically posts commentaries and announcements that fall under public disclosure rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

By far, Mr. Icahn is most active on Twitter, where @Carl_C_Icahn describes himself as "Chairman of Icahn Enterprises LP; etc., etc.," and boasts that while "some people get rich studying artificial intelligence. Me, I make money studying natural stupidity."

It was on Twitter that Mr. Icahn said he would accept the Treasury secretary nomination if Donald Trump were elected president, an offer he previously had said on his blog that he would turn down, saying: "I am flattered but do not get up early enough in the morning to accept this opportunity."

GENERAL ELECTRIC

Firm to Create

1,000 Jobs in U.K.

General Electric Co. said Thursday it struck a deal with the U.K. that could eventually create 1,000 jobs there, the industrial conglomerate's latest move to create jobs abroad after the U.S. Export-Import Bank's charter lapsed this summer.

GE said it reached an agreement with the U.K. export credit agency for up to $12 billion in export financing to support orders in markets including Brazil, Ghana and India. It said the 1,000 jobs would be focused in the energy sector. It said it would continue to expand its business in countries where export financing is available.

COCA-COLA

New System in U.S.

Consolidates Bottlers

Coca-Cola Co. said Thursday that it plans to bring some of its top U.S. bottlers together under a new supply system, the soda giant's latest move to cut costs amid tepid sales.

The new national supply group will include independent bottlers Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, Coca-Cola Bottling Company United, Swire Coca-Cola USA and the company-owned Coca-Cola Refreshments and Coca-Cola North America. Together, the bottlers account for 95% of the volume produced in the U.S.

The initial terms of the agreement call for Coca-Cola Refreshments, which is owned by Coke, to divest nine production facilities valued at about $380 million to the other bottlers between 2016 and 2018.

Coke has said that it is aiming for $3 billion in cost-cutting for the year, and is redirecting savings into marketing like its "Share a Coke" campaign.

IBM

Watson Subsidiary

To Be Expanded

International Business Machines Corp. on Thursday announced a new San Francisco location for its artificial intelligence unit Watson, signaling an expansion of the business widely known for its artificial intelligence that beat human contestants on the "Jeopardy" quiz show.

The new California location is the second for Watson, which has been based in New York City.

In addition, IBM said Watson was expanding its product offerings to developers who use the platform to build apps and roll out new business functionality across industries from health care and retail to wine-buying.

The upgrades include new speech, language and vision tools that IBM said will help organizations tap what is projected to be a $143 billion app market next year.

BHP BILLITON

BlackRock Cuts

Stake in Miner

BlackRock Inc., the world's largest asset manager, has cut its shareholding in resources giant BHP Billiton Ltd., selling stock as a global commodities slump pushes its share price to the lowest level since 2008.

BlackRock ceased to be a substantial shareholder in BHP, the world's biggest miner by market value, on Sept. 22, according to a regulatory filing to the Australian Securities Exchange.

UBER

Brussels Court Bans

Low-Cost Car Service

A Brussels commercial court has banned Uber Inc.'s controversial low-cost service in the European capital, an Uber spokesman said Thursday, adding yet another woe to the U.S. tech firm's business in Europe.

The spokesman said the ruling meant it would have to stop its UberPop service in Brussels within 21 days or else be fined 10,000 euros ($11,250) for each day it operates, with an overall fine capped at 1 million euros.

"We are looking at the implications of this ruling," Uber spokesman Gareth Mead said.

The company could decide to temporarily suspend its UberPop service in Brussels as it files for an appeal, the spokesman said.

The commercial court's ruling in the case, which was brought to court by taxi company Taxis Verts, doesn't apply to Uber's other services -- including Uber X -- which is more expensive than its UberPop service, but still cheaper than standard taxi fares.

FONTERRA

Dairy Giant Lifts

Payout Forecast

Dairy giant Fonterra Co-Operative Group has lifted its forecast payout for farmers against a backdrop of improving global dairy prices.

Fonterra forecast it will pay its 10,500 farmer shareholders NZ$4.60 ($2.89) per kilogram of milk solids in the current season, which began June 1, up from a prior forecast of NZ$3.85.

The improved forecast reflects the lift in global prices since July with whole milk powder increasing 44% and skim milk powder increasing 21% over the period, said Fonterra Chairman John Wilson.

He noted, however, current global prices are still unsustainable. Dairy prices are down more than 50% since early 2014.

In movie parlance, 21 grammes is said to be the "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/21_Grams".

Keep this in mind as we explore 21 Inc s big product reveal this week   a $399.99 "http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B014RD021C?camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B014RD021C&linkCode=as2&linkId=K36ZRXOEXVD5LYXL&redirect=true&ref_=as_li_tl&tag=21inccorsit-20"that s also a  bitcoin computer    which, according to endorsements from Larry Summers (he of secular stagnation fame), Marc Andreessen and others, could be as big as the internet if not a solution to world peace.

The 21 Bitcoin Computer, from 21.co, built atop a platform originally aimed at "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi" of basic computer science in schools, supposedly allows you to mine bitcoins in the background while doing regular computing stuff.

Yet the sum of bitcoins earned is so small that 21 doesn t even pretend that you can cover the original upfront cost of the device, let alone make a profit. You re paying for the right to waste electricity servicing the bitcoin network in return for a bitcoin shaving that earns you some sort of  node * stake in the system.

Vitalik Buterin "https://www.reddit.com/r/ethereum/comments/3lvo37/so21dropped_their_first_product_today_smart/cv9yp0w" has crunched the numbers and he points out:

So you re paying $399 upfront and getting $0.105 per day or $38.3 per year, and this is before taking into account network difficulty increases, the upcoming block halving (yay, your profit goes down to $0.03 per day!) and, of course, the near-100% likelihood that you won t be able to keep that device on absolutely all of the time. I seriously hope they have multiple mining chips inside of their device and forgot to mention it; otherwise you can outcompete this offering pretty easily by just preloading a raspberry pi with $200 of your favorite cryptotokens.

You can read more about how the 21 device is fundamentally loss making on "https://21.co/" (yes, a Colombian domain). There you will also find useful information about how the value of bitcoin isn t really underpinned by shameless rent seeking but   who d have thought   productivity and output. Usefully, 21.co also offer the community "https://21.co/faq/" about how economics work:

For those now thinking Larry Summers + Miners + Pointless Wasted Energy + Productivity illusion must equal = THE BIGGEST KEYNESIAN COALMINE EXPERIMENT OF ALL TIME & Who knows. Maybe. It s certainly more convenient than staging "http://business.time.com/2011/08/16/paul-krugman-an-alien-invasion-could-fix-the-economy/"

But there are surely better and fairer ways to distribute a fixed amount of wealth to the wider population? Also, can a Bitcoin Raspberry Pi actually fix Kennedy airport the way Summers would like? We re not so sure.

But of course the  computer  is not supposed to be a Bitcoin miner, instead it s what the industry likes to call a devkit, which suggests it s really a means towards an endlessly stimulative  digging up apps -economy. And who knows maybe one day someone will develop an app that helps the world bypass Kennedy airport altogether or better still gets planes to mine bitcoins as they fly so that cryptocurrency can rain down into a giant  Fix Kennedy Airport  escrow account. There are so many possibilities.

Indeed, 21 Inc expects its node-based micro-transaction-accepting developer army might even disrupt the business models of Google, Facebook and Twitter by uprooting the advertising-based digital model altogether.

You see, in 21 Inc s mind it s not a lack of wealth or real world resources that discourages people from paying for digital stuff on the internet. It s peoples  distrust of sharing information on the web combined with the friction of logging into a PayPal account.

Instead, with 21 everyone has the opportunity to earn an unsoiled bitcoin ration which can be spent any way they please, protecting their identity throughout the transaction process. The fact that this immediately turns the digital economy into a rationing system whilst also bifurcating the market between fresh bitcoins and second-hand bitcoins (undermining one of the core features of money, which is that it s supposed to be fungible) is apparently besides the point.

What s also lost on 21 Inc is that it s not really the ability to take micropayments that s the problem for the digital economy. It s the fact that people aren t prepared to pay more than a dollar shaving for a digital good, because in their list of priorities tangible goods are still more important than digital goods  and they re not prepared to substitute one for the other.

As regards privacy and information sharing, the following from 21 Inc s "https://21.co/terms/" is worth a read:

Markets
Brazil s Central Bank Moves to Prop Up Real Amid Volatility; Currency move comes after Congress hands victory to President Dilma Rousseff on spending vetoes

SO PAULO Brazil's central bank intervened to try to calm the country's volatile foreign-exchange market and prop up the Brazilian currency, the real, which has been sliding"http://www.wsj.com/articles/brazils-real-hits-two-decade-low-1442962341".

The bank announced in the early afternoon auctions of currency-swap contracts, which offer businesses a hedge against the weaker real, and auctions of dollar-repurchase agreements, which temporarily inject dollars into the market. Later Wednesday afternoon, the bank announced two more repurchase auctions.

The real fell from 4.0150 to the dollar Wednesday morning to 4.1430 in the early afternoon, according to Tullett Prebon via FactSet. The real exited active trading at 4.1325 to the dollar, after closing at 4.0450 on Tuesday.

The bank has used auctions of both instruments before to help support the real. In 2013, the central bank started a program of regular auctions of dollar-swap agreements. The bank stopped auctioning off new swap agreements earlier this year, but has been rolling over existing contracts. The central bank also has auctioned off dollar-repurchase agreements on three occasions in recent weeks.

The central bank use of repurchase and swap auctions provided a brief boost for the real, but it would need to sell reais directly into the market to have a longer-lasting impact, said Luiz Carlos Baldan, a director of the Fourtrade brokerage in So Paulo.

The bank's actions came after Brazil's Congress handed a "http://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-congress-upholds-most-of-rousseffs-vetoes-on-extra-spending-1443006711" earlier in the day, sustaining presidential vetoes of spending bills that would have worsened the nation's fiscal problems at a time when the government is struggling to close a massive budget hole.

In a tense legislative session that started Tuesday night and continued into the wee hours of the morning, legislators voted to allow the president to kill expensive spending bills.

Lawmakers permitted 26 of Ms. Rousseff's 32 vetoes on bills that together would have added an estimated 127 billion reais ($31.5 billion) to government outlays.

The bills vetoed included ones granting hefty salary increases to government workers and tax breaks on fuel, among other things.

 It was a victory for the government accounts. If the vetoes were overturned, it would represent a big cost for this administration and future ones," said Cristiano Oliveira, chief economist at Banco Fibra in So Paulo.

Still, investors remain jittery about prospects for Latin America's largest economy. The real fell from 4.0150 to the dollar Wednesday morning to 4.1430 in the early afternoon, according to Tullett Prebon via FactSet. The real exited active trading at 4.1325 to the dollar, after closing at 4.0450 on Tuesday. The currency has slumped sharply in recent days, going from 3.9480 against the dollar at the close on Friday, to Wednesday's record lows against the U.S. currency. The real was launched in 1994, replacing the previous currency as part of a plan to tame the country's out-of-control inflation.

 They didn't do anything they haven't done before, that's why the dollar went back up again" shortly after the announcement, he said.  The bank should come in and sell dollars for real. If I sell my car, I don't ask for it back after just a few weeks, what's the point?"

The Brazilian currency has lost about 70% of its value against the dollar in the past 12 months as "http://www.wsj.com/articles/brazil-sinks-into-recession-on-second-quarter-output-contraction-1440765489" and a corruption scandal at state-controlled oil company Petrleo Brasileiro SA"http://www.wsj.com/articles/brazilian-police-seek-to-question-former-president-in-petrobras-probe-1442008371".

Ms. Rousseff, who hasn't been implicated in the scandal, has nevertheless seen her approval ratings plummet to less than 10%. Her efforts to shrink the government's budget deficit, and protect Brazil's investment-grade credit rating, have been complicated by her unpopularity, which has made it difficult to get her economic austerity program approved by Congress.

 The increasing financial sensitivity seems to be driven by the economy's political obstacles," said Alfredo Coutio, director for Latin America at Moody'sAnalytics. Ms. Rousseff  is facing strong resistance in Congress, and the risk of a political crisis is increasing."

Standard & Poor's downgraded Brazil's rating to "http://www.wsj.com/articles/s-p-drops-brazil-debt-rating-one-notch-to-junk-1441838102" earlier this year, and analysts and traders expect other ratings companies to follow suit in coming days or weeks. Fitch and Moody's still give Brazil investment-grade ratings.

While Wednesday's legislative action kept Brazil from digging itself an even deeper fiscal hole, Congress delayed decisions on a half-dozen other measures vetoed by Ms. Rousseff, including a bill that would increase some judiciary salaries by as much as 70%. The remaining bills would generate 47 billion reais ($11.5 billion) in additional spending through 2019, according to government estimates.

Lawmakers so far have shown little willingness to cooperate with Ms. Rousseff to pass deep program cuts and large tax increases needed to shore up Brazil's shaky finances.

BofA's Moynihan Backed as Chairman

CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Bank of America Corp. shareholders voted to let Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan keep both jobs at the company, a vote of confidence for the executive after a tumultuous period of nearly six years at the helm.

While some shareholders said Tuesday they would push for other changes to the board, the result provides Mr. Moynihan with a clear mandate to continue his efforts to boost profits by simplifying the bank's structure and keeping costs in check until interest rates rise and can boost revenue.

The bank announced after a 15-minute shareholder meeting that 63% of shares cast had supported its move to allow Mr. Moynihan, 55 years old, to keep both executive roles. The vote was a setback for pension funds and other activist investors that have pushed to separate the roles at several companies, including Bank of America, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets.

"We're happy with the results" of the vote, Mr. Moynihan said after the meeting, which was attended by a crowd of fewer than 100 people. Asked about the decisions made by the bank that led to the vote, Mr. Moynihan replied: "You don't look back."

The bank now has to tackle other challenges. Its share price has fallen about 9% over the past 12 months, a sharper decline than at other large U.S. banks. The lender also needs to resubmit its "stress test" to the Federal Reserve by next week, after the central bank told Bank of America in the spring that it needs to correct weaknesses in its capital planning. The resilience test helps determine what the bank can pay in dividends.

Still, Tuesday's tally provided a surprisingly decisive margin, considering that the two largest U.S. pensions lobbied investors to vote against BofA's recommendation. Some bank officials had told people recently that the vote could go either way.

Shareholders who voted with the bank pointed to outreach from executives and Jack Bovender, the board's lead independent director, that suggested Bank of America was taking seriously their concerns about the board's decision to combine the CEO and chairman roles despite a 2009 bylaw that divided them.

State Street Global Advisors, the bank's second-largest shareholder, according to FactSet, originally had concerns about the 2014 move to make Mr. Moynihan chairman without prior shareholder input. But officials at the money-management unit of State Street Corp. said the bank's board was responsive to their concerns in part through the work of Mr. Bovender.

"We recognize that leadership could be provided by an independent chair or a strong lead independent director," said Rakhi Kumar, State Street Global Advisors' head of corporate governance. The fund manager decided to vote for the bank proposal.

Bank of America's results were roughly in line with those of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., where in 2012 40% of shareholders voted to split the chairman and CEO roles under James Dimon amid concern over the "London whale" trading loss. However, the 37% of shareholders supporting a split in the roles at Bank of America exceeded the percentage at J.P. Morgan that supported a split in 2013, when big U.S. pension funds mounted a campaign similar to the one they did this year at Bank of America.

After the vote Tuesday, bank officials pledged that the board would meet more regularly with the biggest shareholders, though the bank gave no indication that investors should expect changes to the board, despite a push from some shareholders.

"This is as strong a board as I've ever seen or ever been engaged in," said Mr. Bovender, former chairman and CEO of hospital chain HCA Inc.

Some shareholders said after the vote that they will continue to lobby for changes to the board.

We "do expect the board to adopt a more active oversight role," said Ricardo Duran, a spokesman for the California State Teachers' Retirement System. "We'd like to see better stock performance."

"I hope they don't just put blindfolds on," said Buzzy Geduld, CEO of the hedge fund Cougar Capital, which voted its 2.5 million shares against the bank.

Proposals to split the CEO and chairman roles this year have gained an average of about 30% support at big U.S. companies, according to ISS Voting Analytics.

Real Estate
Big Landlords to Merge, Betting on Rising Rents; Barry Sternlicht s Starwood Waypoint to combine with Colony American Homes

Two big owners of single-family rental homes said Monday they have agreed to merge, a bet that rents will keep rising and homes will remain difficult for many Americans to buy.

Starwood Waypoint Residential Trust, a publicly traded real-estate investment trust run by Barry Sternlicht, the longtime real-estate investor who is Starwood Capital Group's chief executive, will combine with closely held Colony American Homes Inc. in a deal that values Colony at about $1.5 billion based on Starwood Waypoint's closing share price Friday. The Wall Street Journal had reported the deal earlier Monday, citing people familiar with the talks.

Under the terms of the agreement, Colony shareholders will receive about 65 million shares of Starwood Waypoint. The deal has been approved by the boards of both companies and is expected to close in the first quarter of next year. Starwood Waypoint shares were inactive premarket.

 We believe this merger demonstrates the power of scale and consolidation and really crystallizes the long-term durability of the single-family rental industry," said Thomas J. Barrack Jr., the executive chairman of Colony American Homes' parent, Colony Capital. He will serve as nonexecutive co-chairman of the combined company alongside Mr. Sternlicht.

The two companies own a combined total of more than 30,000 homes valued at nearly $8 billion. Messrs. Sternlicht and Barrack were part of the rush by big investors to buy foreclosed homes in bulk, often sight unseen and at steep discounts, after the U.S. housing market collapsed.

Such investors concentrated their buying in some of the hardest-hit areas, including southern Florida, Phoenix, Atlanta and California, hoping to gain enough size in each market to make management of the properties more efficient.

Other major buyers of single-family rental homes include Blackstone Group LP, which has spent nearly $10 billion to acquire and spruce up about 50,000 foreclosed homes now rented through its Invitation Homes LP.

The proposed merger of Starwood Waypoint and Colony is a bet that the percentage of Americans who own homes will remain unusually low. While the foreclosure crisis has receded, toughened lending standards have pushed millions of Americans out of the homebuying market.

Higher interest rates would increase borrowing costs and make it harder for some renters to buy homes.

The Federal Reserve decided last week not to raise short-term interest rates from near zero, where they have held since 2008, but the central bank is expected to revisit the matter later this year.

The U.S. homeownership rate is at its lowest level in nearly 50 years, falling to 63.5% in the second quarter, according to the Commerce Department.

In contrast, single-family rentals now add up to 13% of overall housing stock, up from 9% in 2005, according to a report by Moody'sAnalytics.

Rents have been climbing steadily, though some analysts and investors question how long it can last, especially in areas with weak wage growth. Many of the rental homes scooped up by big investors are in those parts of the U.S.

The single-family rental home business was long dominated by mom-and-pop operators. Big investors have used their access to capital and number-crunching skill to barrel into the market. "http://www.wsj.com/articles/racing-to-buy-homes-sight-unseen-1428940421" it has developed to guide decisions that include which neighborhoods to target.

The response from stock-market investors has been mostly tepid so far.

As of Friday, Starwood Waypoint shares were down about 20% since its spinoff from Starwood Property Trust last year. Shares of American Homes 4 Rent, which owned 37,491 homes in 22 states as of June 30, have risen 2.7% since their stock-market debut in August 2013.

Blackstone executives have said they plan to eventually list shares of Invitation Homes through an initial public offering.

Bond buyers have been more enthusiastic, snapping up the debt issued by some companies in the sector.

In the two years since Blackstone's Invitation Homes sold the first bond backed by rents from a pool of houses, $13 billion of such bonds have been sold, according to Kroll Bond Rating Agency Inc.

Single-family rental companies must convince investors that the single-family rental model will remain viable if homeownership levels rebound. Some outsiders also question how much more firms like Blackstone, Colony and Starwood Waypoint can grow now that so many of the most deeply discounted foreclosed homes have been purchased.

Single-family rental companies also face questions about their ability to maintain tens of thousands of scattered properties. The chores include cutting lawns, fixing sinks, insurance and keeping track of rental rates and payments.

Big investors need to amass enough market share to keep their operating costs in check.

In June, Starwood Waypoint said the company and other institutional investors owned roughly 200,000 of the 15.3 million U.S. rental homes, suggesting significant room for expansion if other conditions are ripe.

The two companies believe that a merger would result in as much as $50 million in cost reductions.

If the deal goes through, Colony investors would own 59% of the combined company's shares, while Starwood Waypoint shareholders would own 41%. Starwood Waypoint would issue new shares as part of the merger.

Credit Firm Equifax Makes Offer for Australia's Veda

MELBOURNE, Australia -- Consumer-credit reporting company Equifax Inc. is seeking to break into the Australian market, pitching a takeover offer for one of the country's biggest credit-reference providers valued at about 2.28 billion Australian dollars (US$1.64 billion).

Equifax said on Friday it had made a nonbinding offer for Sydney-based Veda Group Ltd.

If a takeover is successful, it would give Equifax a substantial foothold in the region at the same time Australia is adopting a comprehensive credit-reporting policy that brings it into line with most of the developed world, including many of the countries where Equifax operates.

Veda said it received a cash offer from Equifax to buy the company at A$2.70 a share, a 35% premium to Veda's closing share price on Thursday.

Veda's shares, which had fallen about 13% in 2015 ahead of the approach, jumped 31% on Friday to A$2.62.

"Veda is a strategic asset," said Ed Prendergast, a portfolio manager at Pengana Capital in Melbourne, which owns shares in the Australian company.

Equifax has no meaningful presence in Australia or New Zealand, Mr. Prendergast said, adding that for it to build a business there from scratch would be costly and would take it many years to build up the necessary credit data to be considered a major rival.

Veda holds credit information on about 20 million individuals and 5.7 million businesses in Australia and New Zealand.

Atlanta-based Equifax said the proposal to buy Veda was financially compelling, and consistent with its strategy to expand into new markets.

Equifax ranks among the market leading credit data and analytics providers in the U.S., Brazil, Canada and more than a dozen other countries. In early 2014 it bought U.K.-based debt-management software company TDX Group, which has a regional office in Sydney.

Veda said its board would evaluate the offer, although there was no certainty it would result in a firm bid or that the terms would be acceptable.

Any offer is subject to conditions including due diligence and approval from regulators, including Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board, which advises the government on foreign takeovers, it said.

The offer comes as Australia adopts comprehensive credit reporting, an effort to expand credit-history sharing under a voluntary reporting system adopted by the financial industry. Analysts have said the system, which is expected to take several years to roll out fully, promises a boost in revenue for companies such as Veda because it will open up additional information about the accounts individuals have and how well they meet repayments.

Veda reported a net profit of A$78.4 million on revenue of A$338.8 million in the year through June.

Economy
Fed Delays Interest-Rate Liftoff; Officials still expect to move this year, but express concerns about global tumult

Majority of central bank officials still expect to increase rates this year

The Federal Reserve left short-term interest rates unchanged after weeks of market-churning debate, putting off a historic move to end an era of ultra-cheap credit amid worries about weak growth overseas.

While central-bank officials don't believe recent global economic and market turbulence will throw the U.S. economy off track, they want to be sure before they push rates higher.

 In light of the developments that we have seen and the impacts on financial markets, we want to take a little bit more time to evaluate the likely impacts on the United States," Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said Thursday at a press conference following a two-day policy meeting.

The decision left uncertain for a while longer just when the Fed would raise its benchmark rate, which has been near zero since December 2008. Most of the policy makers at the meeting, 13 of 17, indicated they still expect to move this year, but that was down from the 15 who held that view in June. The central bank has two more scheduled policy meetings this year, in late October and mid-December.

U.S. stock markets gyrated after the Fed announcement. The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended down 65.21 points, or 0.4%, to 16674.74. Meanwhile, the yield on two-year Treasury notes, which in part reflects market expectations of rate movements in the medium-term, posted its largest single-day decline since late December 2010.

The decision to leave rates unchanged, after months of discussion about raising them, reflected in part Ms. Yellen's cautious nature as an individual and leader.

The Yale University-trained Ph.D. economist is known inside the central bank for liking to arrive at airports hours before departure and preparing weeks in advance for big speeches, reflections of a desire to avoid unnecessary surprises. Moving rates now, at a time of uncertainty about the economic outlook, would have been out of character for her.

 The central aspect of her nature on this and other jobs is not to leave any stone unturned and to be really prepared and buttoned up. Much more often than not, that will lead to no surprises," said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economics professor who served with Ms. Yellen at the Fed in 1994, when he was vice chairman and she was a governor.  Had the Fed raised interest rates today that would have really surprised markets for no good reason."

The Fed cut its benchmark interest rate called the federal funds rate to near zero in December 2008, three months after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and ensuing financial chaos. It has kept the rate there ever since, an effort to encourage borrowing, spending and investing to boost economic growth more broadly.

Low rates have spurred a boom in auto sales and upturns in some financial sectors, like commercial real estate, but not broad economic vigor. They have also been accompanied by a steady drop in the official unemployment rate from 10% in 2009 to 5.1% in August.

Many officials, including Ms. Yellen, believe the drop in the jobless rate indicates that slack in the economy is gradually getting eaten up and will eventually lead to a pickup in inflation. The Fed's preferred measure of inflation has run below its 2% objective for more than three years and the Fed reiterated Thursday that it doesn't want to start raising rates until officials are more confident inflation will rise toward that target.

Ms. Yellen emphasized, and Fed officials' forecasts underscored, that policy makers still expect to raise the short-term interest rate which is a rate banks charge each other on overnight loans before year-end.

However, some economists say the Fed now risks waiting too long to act.

 The longer they wait, the more difficult their job is going to be 12 or 18 months from now," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sAnalytics. Mr. Zandi said the jobless rate, at 5.1%, is near levels where pressures could start building that cause inflation or asset-price bubbles. He expects it to move below 5%, a key marker of a healthy and stable level for unemployment, in a matter of months.

 The main risk is that they now wait too long and that then they have to play catchup and have to raise rates very aggressively and undermine economic growth," he said.

Easy-money advocates cheered the Fed's decision. David Blanchflower, a Dartmouth College economist and former policy maker at the Bank of England, said the Fed has bigger problems than the potential for asset bubbles, namely a labor market that remains far from full health, as evidenced by slow growth in wages.

 We'll worry down the road about those things," Mr. Blanchflower said.  We have real things to worry about right now, rather than those maybes."

Taylor Greene, 23 years old, said he was relieved that the Fed opted against raising interest rates on Thursday because he has been saving to buy a house.  There's that pressure to get in before rates go up and prices go up," said Mr. Greene, who currently rents a condominium in Tempe, Ariz.

Mr. Greene, an analyst at a consulting firm, said he'd paid little attention until recently to the Fed.  Before now, I had been focused on just getting money into my savings account for that down payment," he said. Now, his rent is rising, and he's ready to move.  With the market really picking up steam, you wonder,  What is the Fed going to do? How are they going to respond to this?' "

Ms. Yellen said officials discussed raising rates now, and she saw the merits of the case to move. But caution won over the chairwoman and others.

 An argument can be made for a rise in interest rates at this time," she said. But she said officials decided to hold off  in light of the heightened uncertainties abroad" and the prospect of low inflation for a longer period. The Fed wants  a little bit more time" to make sure the U.S. economic outlook hasn't fundamentally shifted, she said.

After a series of unanimous policy votes this year, Thursday's vote was 9-1. Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, dissented, calling for a rate increase now.

The dissent underscored divisions that are building inside the central bank about how to proceed. Six officials submitted projections before the meeting that called for two interest-rate increases this year, which suggests Mr. Lacker has backing for the call to start moving. Not all of the 17 Fed bank president and board governors who attend the meeting actually vote for the decision, which explains why only one dissented while others want to start.

Fed officials have several worries at the moment. Growth in China has slowed and might be on a softer path than expected. Ms. Yellen appeared to let slip an unusual knock on how Chinese officials are handling the slowdown in the world's second largest economy.

 Developments that we saw in financial markets in August, in part, reflected concerns that there was downside risk to Chinese economic performance and perhaps concerns about the deftness in which policy makers were addressing those concerns," she said.

Another worry is the strength of the U.S. dollar, which has appreciated 8% against a broad basket of other currencies this year. The stronger currency puts downward pressure on exports and import prices, movements at odds with the Fed efforts to spur economic growth and raise currently low inflation.

 Recent global economic and financial developments may restrain economic activity somewhat and are likely to put further downward pressure on inflation in the near-term," the Fed said in the official policy statement released by the central bank after the meeting. It added that it was  monitoring developments abroad," a signal of the Fed's heightened state of worry that slow growth outside the U.S. could hurt the American economy.

Fed officials have been signaling for months they plan to raise rates this year. Central to their optimism is a view labor markets are improving rapidly and reducing slack in the economy, a precursor to some lift in inflation.

 On balance, labor market indicators show that underutilization of labor resources has diminished since early this year," the Fed said in its policy statement.

Before the meeting, investors had come to believe the Fed wouldn't move. In futures markets before the meeting, traders attached a 27% probability to a rate increase Thursday, but a 64% probability to an increase by December, according to calculations made by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. After the meeting they saw a 45% probability of a move by December.

Their projected path of rates has become shallower in recent months. The median projection for rates at the end of 2015 dropped to 0.375% from 0.625% in June. It also dropped to 1.375% at the end of 2016 from 1.625% projected in June. It fell to 2.625% at the end of 2017 from 2.875% projected in June. In the long-run the Fed projected the fed funds rate will reach 3.5%, down from an earlier estimate of 3.75%.

One reason for the shifting outlook: Officials have become a bit less optimistic about the economy's long-run growth potential. They projected the economy will grow at a rate between 1.8% and 2.2% per year in the long-run, down from their June estimate of growth of 2.0% to 2.3% in the long-run. A more lumbering economy has less capacity to bear much higher rates.

The Fed's economic projections underscored the challenge officials face in reading the current economic backdrop. Fed officials reduced their estimates for the path of the unemployment rate. They see it reaching 5.0% by year end and 4.8% by the end of next year, a lower rate than previous estimates of 5.3% and 5.1% respectively.

Textbooks suggest that as estimates for the jobless rate fall, estimates for inflation should rise. But officials reduced their inflation estimates, thanks in part to downward pressures from lower oil prices and a stronger dollar. They don't see the inflation rate, as measured by the Commerce Department's personal consumption expenditures price index, reaching their goal of 2% until 2018, near the end of Ms. Yellen's first term as chairwoman.

Deloitte Resigns as Tianhe Chemicals Auditor; Tianhe has faced criticism from the group Anonymous Analytics

HONG KONG Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Ltd., the auditor of Tianhe Chemicals Group Ltd., has resigned from auditing the embattled Chinese chemicals firm.

Tianhe, which went public in Hong Kong in June of last year in a US$748 million initial public offering, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/tianhe-chemicals-shares-plunge-after-long-trading-halt-1412831736" a few months later from the group Anonymous Analytics, which calls itself an advocate for corporate transparency but doesn't disclose who its members are.

In September of last year, Anonymous Analytics released a report alleging that Tianhe had kept two sets of financial books -- one for investors and one for Chinese authorities -- and that the company overstated sales of a chemical agent called anti-mar used in products such as smartphones.

The activist group said it wouldn't profit from the report, although a disclaimer noted that, while it holds  no direct or indirect interest" in Tianhe, its consultants, affiliates or clients may have a short position in the stock.

Tianhe, the Hong Kong-listed company which counts Morgan Stanley's private-equity arm among its investors, has repeatedly denied the Anonymous allegations, calling them false and groundless. Morgan Stanley was one of the lead banks on Tianhe's IPO.

Spokespeople for Tianhe, Deloitte and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.

Tianhe said late Thursday its board had on Tuesday informed Deloitte it wouldn't accept a draft report the auditor had prepared, in which the auditor refrained from expressing an opinion on Tianhe's financials.

 In these circumstances, Deloitte is of the view that, for all practical purposes, the audit has come to an end," Tianhe said, adding that Deloitte gave a formal notice of its resignation as auditor to the board and the audit committee on Wednesday. Tianhe said it will try to find a new auditor.

Trading in Tianhe's shares has been halted at the company's request since March. Tianhe at the time said it needed more time to provide further information to its auditors concerning its 2014 annual results, which haven't been released.

In August, Tianhe said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange that  there are three areas where the Auditor considers that its concerns have not been fully addressed" and which were delaying the publication of the 2014 results. Tianhe said in the filing its audit committee had conducted an investigation into the issues cited by Deloitte.

Morgan Stanley, an early investor in Tianhe through a private-equity unit, owns a stake of about 8.9% in the company and is the second-largest shareholder after the Wei family, according to filings.

Symphony is a real challenge to Bloomberg

Over the years, many "Bloomberg killers" have launched and failed. They have come for the king of the financial data and analytics business and missed.

Now comes Symphony, a start-up messaging service and technology platform, nurtured by Goldman Sachs in its tussle with Bloomberg. This is a problem: if there is one organisation that other banks and investment managers resent more than Bloomberg, it is Goldman. On past form, Symphony's launch this week could be written off.

That would be an error, not because Symphony itself is bound to succeed but because it need not kill Bloomberg to do so. It is not attacking the target head-on, like Bloomberg rivals such as Thomson Reuters. It is using another approach to technology to compete in a different way, just as Android, the open source mobile platform supported by Google, took on Apple's closed world.

It may flourish - and even if it does not, its model could work for someone else. Technology has evolved, making it easier for rivals both to compete with each other and to attack a bigger foe. The fact that 14 others, including BlackRock, the world's largest fund manager, joined Goldman to back Symphony shows that something has changed.

Bloomberg has always appeared to be vulnerable: its orange and black screens; its weird array of keyboard commands; its reliance for 80 per cent of its $8.5bn annual revenues on selling terminals at a fixed price of $21,000 per year each, with no discount even if they are used only to send messages; its cult-like internal culture created by Michael Bloomberg , its founder.

Yet it prospers because, despite the requirement for its 325,000 terminal users to learn an entirely new language, it focuses relentlessly on serving them. The terminal seamlessly integrates data, analytics, messages, and even the ability to trade derivatives and bonds. If something is wrong, or feels wrong, the user calls and it gets fixed.

Bloomberg is more than a network; it is a community . A portfolio manager can chat online about a trade with a salesperson at an investment bank, review a spreadsheet and other data, and execute it, all within their Bloomberg terminals. It is the virtual equivalent of the old-style stock exchange, a gathering place for everyone in the finance business. This makes it, as a rival says enviously, "very sticky".

How do you attack it? With difficulty, many have found. Thomson Reuters, its main rival, steadily lost ground despite launching fightbacks and "Bloomberg killers" - its market share in 2014 was 26 per cent compared with Bloomberg's 32 per cent , according to Burton-Taylor, a research group. Upstarts such as FactSet, Markit and Capital IQ are growing but are relatively small.

One crack appeared in 2013 when Bloomberg journalists were found to have observed subscriber activity for stories . Goldman, which pays for 2,500 Bloomberg terminals, and was developing its own messaging and communication system, protested loudly. It later folded this software into Symphony to encourage others to join.

Banks used not to worry about paying Bloomberg's bill. But times are tougher - tighter regulation has hurt their bond and currency trading divisions. Bloomberg is also competing more directly with them by letting users execute trades directly, rather than using bank-backed electronic trading platforms such as TradeWeb.

No matter how angry Wall Street got about such trends, it could not have done much about them were it not for the evolution in technology. Open source software, cloud computing and the internet have made it simpler to compete with networks such as Bloomberg. Symphony need not do everything - it can build a platform and let others write software and applications.

This will be less like Bloomberg than a Wall Street app store, on which a data provider such as Markit, a bank such as Goldman, or an asset manager such as BlackRock offers pricing and data widgets, or integrates theirs with others. Some services will be private, with only a few users; others open to all.

It will also be far cheaper - from only about $15 per month for the basic message service . Goldman wanted to build its own messaging network so all of its 35,000 employees - from operations and back-office staff to analysts - could communicate even if they did not have a Bloomberg terminal. Symphony similarly aims to spread widely rather than seizing the high ground.

The biggest obstacle is the buyside - the asset managers and hedge funds at which Bloomberg is entrenched, where a new service is another screen to cram on to a desk. Symphony will appeal to investment banks with thousands of back office employees, but what about hedge funds with only a few?

It may yet rise up the ranks, spread across the buyside, and knock the king off the throne but that is unlikely. Although Wall Street has fallen on comparatively hard times, it still has deep enough pockets to buy Bloomberg terminals for the elite traders and salespeople who want them.

Symphony will not kill Bloomberg. But it, or something like it, could make a big impact by being different. That counts as success.

The Property Report: Tech Hot Spots Fetch Prices on High End

The hulking art deco structure at 1355 Market St. in San Francisco is an 11-story former wholesale furniture mart in the gritty Mid-Market neighborhood, where drug addicts and homeless people dot the sidewalks.

So how is it among the most valuable office buildings ever sold in the city?

The property known as Market Square, home to Twitter Inc.'s headquarters, is one of a growing handful of low-slung former industrial buildings that are fetching prices on par with top-quality office towers. Now filled with fast-growing technology and media companies, these offbeat buildings are challenging the notion of the downtown skyscraper as the dominant symbol of corporate real estate.

Big investors and banks are piling in, sending prices skyward in large U.S. markets, for two simple reasons: The rents are high and the buildings are full.

A fund run by the Shorenstein Co. in recent weeks sold a 98% interest in Market Square to a venture led by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s asset-management arm for about $835 per square foot, valuing it at about $920 million, people familiar with the deal said. That would be the highest price per square foot paid for a large office building in the city since 2007, according to Real Capital Analytics LLC.

Less than a mile away, a five-story former jewelry mart where Airbnb Inc. has its headquarters is being sold by Beacon Capital Partners to asset manager TIAA-CREF for about $735 per square foot. The price of the building, nestled below a set of elevated highway ramps far from the BART subway, is near the $770 per square foot that Salesforce.com Inc. paid earlier this year for a giant office tower downtown.

Further south in Los Angeles, a 464,000-square-foot century-old office building sold last week for $200 million, in what the seller said was a record price per square foot for downtown Los Angeles. Before selling it, developer Rising Realty stripped out its offices and carpeting, filling it up with startups.

Nearby, Shorenstein is nearing another big deal. The company is in talks with online media startup BuzzFeed Inc. to rent a century-old former Ford Motor Co. factory for which it paid $37 million last year, according to people familiar with the matter.

Ever since the recession, the market for office space has been shifting, with technology companies and media organizations showing a preference for office space with character. Often referred to loosely as "creative space," it usually entails vast swaths of open space, low or nonexistent cubicle walls, exposed brick walls and bare ceilings. Couches, foosball tables and even beer kegs are commonplace.

Corporate towers, by contrast, are often viewed as sterile offices of a past generation, the province of those who must wear suits and ties to the office.

But because there are only so many brick warehouses to go around, demand has outstripped supply, pushing rents up near those typically paid by private-equity firms or banks.

Take the Playa Vista neighborhood of Los Angeles, where tech companies including Google Inc. have offices. Asking rents in the area for such creative space average about $41 per square foot, well above the $24 per square foot sought for traditional office buildings in the area, says real-estate-services firm JLL.

"These tenants are paying the rent," said Carl Muhlstein, a Los Angeles-based broker with JLL who has focused on creative office space. Mr. Muhlstein helped fill a former U.S. Postal Service sorting facility in the neighborhood that was converted to an office building aimed at media and tech companies. After it was leased with tenants like Sony Corp.'s PlayStation division, it sold earlier this year to Invesco Ltd. for more than $800 a square foot. By comparison, the 24-story tower at 801 S. Figueroa St. in downtown Los Angeles sold late last year for $430 per square foot, according to Real Capital Analytics.

Shorenstein was early in capitalizing on the trend. The San Francisco company, known in prior generations for its holdings of skyscrapers, bought the building at 1355 Market for $110 million in 2011 and embarked on a renovation dazzling enough to lure Twitter. As the tech industry took off, the neighborhood began to transform, with companies like Uber Technologies Inc. gobbling up space. Rents rose, Twitter expanded, and the building filled up.

Warehouse-like spaces are catching on even in New York, where rents topping $100 were once reserved for trophy towers in Manhattan on the edge of Central Park. Now buildings in former manufacturing areas like the Meatpacking District and the area south of Union Square are fetching such rents as available space is filled up by companies including Google and Facebook Inc. A handful of boxy new buildings planned for these neighborhoods are aiming for rents as high as $150 per square foot.

Vornado Realty Trust, a major owner of trophy New York towers, is also making a big push into offbeat office districts. It recently announced a $190 million deal to buy a building in the West Chelsea neighborhood north of the Meatpacking District, where it has become one of the largest landlords.

Nontraditional buildings are "in incredibly high demand by the class of tenant that doesn't want to work in a 'Class A' building with a lot of old guys that wear ties," said Steven Roth, chief executive of Vornado.

UK COMPANIES
New digital lender targets mobile-using customers; Banks

A new digital retail bank is launching in the UK in an attempt to capture the soaring number of people managing their accounts using mobile devices.

Ricky Knox , a technology investor and co-founder of money transfer service Azimo, is set next week to unveil Tandem, the latest bank to try to challenge the big high street lenders.

The launch of Tandem, which is expected to receive its licence from the regulator before the end of the year, comes months after Atom was approved by the Bank of England as the UK's first mobile app-focused bank.

Mobile apps are now the most popular way to bank, having overtaken branches and desktop access to the internet, with customers set to check their current account on mobile devices 895m times this year, surpassing the 705m branch interactions, according to research firm Caci.

However, the challenger banks that have launched in recent years have had mixed success, with some struggling to build market share and increase profits. A number of smaller lenders have criticised a proposed new bank tax that they say will disproportionately hit the sector.

Tandem, which will offer consumer products including current accounts and mortgages, is understood to have raised nearly 100m in capital, backed by a group of 10 institutional investors.

Mr Knox said that it would aim to work with people to manage their money, rather than focusing on product sales.

The lender plans to mine "big data" to better tailor products to customers' requirements.

Mr Knox, who founded Tandem with Matt Cooper, a former director of Capital One Bank, claimed the team had an advanced credit rating and scoring process to underpin efficient lending decisions.

He said the business wanted to "provide this service for everyday people over the smartphone".

Unlike Atom, Mr Knox said Tandem would not be digital-only, as it would also provide a call-centre.

"We expect people will use mobile as the primary banking channel, and the call-centre for large transactions," he said.

But he added that the lender was "never going to be for customers who need a branch. We have a lot of cost advantages as a result and can offer cheaper products, with no legacy issues or old IT systems".

FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - MONEY
Mini-bond returns are puny - are they worth the risk? ADVENTUROUS INVESTOR

Over the past year or so alternative finance has thrust itself into the mainstream of investment. Barely a week goes by without some new crowdfunding campaign or peer-to-peer loan launch.

Some are sensible, some less so. But Zopa, the sector pioneer, has built a very solid franchise that increasingly smells like a mainstream financial services business online. Its deadly rival Ratesetter has also branched out into new forms of lending.

At the other end of the alternative finance spectrum we have riskier crowdfunding campaigns, some of which offer equity investments at ludicrous valuations, and even more ludicrous projections for growth. Yet I have no doubt that lurking on platforms such as Crowdcube, Seedrs and Syndicate Room, there will be more than a handful of great new businesses that will make the leap on to the public markets (not least the platforms themselves).

But some innovations worry me. Mini-bonds are one. Now, I'm a great fan of retail friendly bonds. The Order book for Retail Bonds (Orb) at the London Stock Exchange has been fruitful for bond investors and I'm very happy with my own investments in bonds issued by Tesco Personal Finance, EnQuest, Premier Oil and Provident Financial bonds.

As the yield on many of the best issues has fallen below 5 per cent, many investors have gone in search of yield higher up the risk spectrum, chasing all sorts of new issuers, many of them using alternative finance platforms.

Let's compare two recent issues - Iwoca's bond placing on the UK Bond Network, and Scottish company BrewDog's immensely popular listing on Crowdcube.

UK Bond Network tends to focus on structuring issues that look and feel more like traditional bond structures. There's a focus on more established businesses, with asset backed security, and higher yields for the extra risk being taken. The Iwoca issue, raising 1m, offered sophisticated private investors a return of 9 per cent for one year, with yield payments secured on Iwoca's short term loans to small and medium-sized businesses.

Crowdcube has also done a brilliant job in bringing bonds into the UK market through its own mini-bond platform, giving investors a fairly constant stream of issues that pay a yield of between 6 per cent and 9 per cent depending on the nature of the business.

BrewDog is an established business. It has raised countless millions via its " Equity for Punks " programme - the 2015 issue was the fourth iteration of equity fundraising. But having raised 14m via this route - not uncontroversially it must be said, given some of the detail in its fundraising documents - the Scottish brewer is now looking to raise money for a "BrewDog Bond". This is a mini-bond and will hopefully raise up to 6m, and pay out a 6.5 per cent fixed rate per annum.

In many respects there's much to like about this issue. Bonds are more secure than equities (usually), and the fact that Crowdcube has agreed to market the BrewDog bond should give investors some comfort. Crowdcube has even tied up with debt rating firm Moody'sAnalytics to attach a "Probability of Default" (POD) score to mini-bonds, judging the issuer's likelihood of default on any existing credit obligations (not including the mini-bond). At the launch of the BrewDog programme, the average POD for Crowdcube mini-bonds was 3.3 per cent. Moody's awarded the BrewDog Bond a 0.3 per cent POD.

Like virtually all mini-bonds this issue is unsecured and non-transferable. Interest repayments will be made biannually. The term appears to be four years and the minimum investment is 500.

For me, investors need to ask two questions. First, will they get their money back? The second is are they adequately rewarded for the risk? I'd say that both Iwoca and BrewDog probably pass the first test. BrewDog in particular has been growing like gangbusters - an average of 138 per cent a year since 2007 - and is a well-known brand. It's also raised a huge amount of equity, which will need to be burnt through before bonds are threatened.

But I'm not sure I am adequately rewarded for the risk as 6.5 per cent for four years strikes me as parsimonious. Iwoca's 9 per cent for one year is a much better bet. A lot can happen in four years, including interest rate rises, global recessions, regulatory changes and the chance of good old-fashioned business failure.

Frankly, yields of 6 to 8 per cent can be had from investing in stock market funds such as P2P Global Investments and SQN Asset Finance, which lend to hundreds of small businesses. Unless issuers up the rates I'd be very cautious about committing your capital to many of these mini-bonds.

David Stevenson is an active private investor writing about his own investments. He may own shares in the companies mentioned. adventurous@ft.com

Ex-Boss of NYSE Rips Today's Markets

The former head of the New York Stock Exchange says modern markets have sacrificed fairness for speed.

Richard Grasso, chairman and chief executive of the NYSE from 1995 to 2003, said in an interview to be broadcast Sunday for the television show "Wall Street Week" that the market swings last month were a sign something was awry with the capital markets.

"A fast market is not necessarily a fair market, as evidenced by that Monday open," he said in a clip of the interview viewed by The Wall Street Journal, referring to the tumultuous early trading on Aug. 24.

The action that day has drawn scrutiny from regulators, exchanges, institutions and everyday investors -- and sparked discussions about how to tweak the market to prevent similar problems. There were nearly 1,300 trading halts, most of them in the first part of the day, and some stocks dropped rapidly before recouping losses in a matter of minutes.

"Frankly, some of the things that went on that day need very close scrutiny," Mr. Grasso said in an interview Friday with the Journal. "A day like that, where Facebook's shares go from $86 to $72 to $84 in a matter of minutes will cause the public to lose confidence in the markets."

Mr. Grasso stepped down from the NYSE in 2003 after a controversy over the nearly $140 million he received in retirement pay, deferred compensation and benefits that year.

He led the NYSE at a time when it was the dominant venue for trading stocks, handling roughly 80% of all transactions. Members of the NYSE earned high salaries, and the exchange reflected their wealth, featuring a high-end Luncheon Club where traders dined on steak and oysters amid artwork and wild game mounted on the wall.

For the most part, Mr. Grasso is no longer involved in the securities market. He serves as a member of the advisory board of the Delaware Board of Trade Holdings Inc., which is aiming to build a stock exchange for startups.

Some market observers said Mr. Grasso's views were out of date. David Weisberger, managing director at the market-analytics firm RegOne Solutions, said it cost investors much more to trade stock during Mr. Grasso's era, because specialists on the floor of the exchange had more control over trading.

"The market now is far more egalitarian than it's ever been," he said.

Mr. Grasso also criticized how exchanges sold proprietary feeds of stock-trading data to some clients, while many in the market relied on a slower feed.

"Creating an advantage to an institutional user or a particular type of trader that disadvantages the retail investor is bad for the country, bad for the markets and bad for your business," he said in the television interview.

Exchanges have said the proprietary feeds contain information that only some market participants are interested in, such as the full list of all orders to buy or sell a stock at certain prices. They say such data is too voluminous and fast-changing for an everyday investor to use for trading.

On Friday, NYSE, a part of Intercontinental Exchange Inc., Nasdaq Inc. and BATS Global Markets Inc. all declined to comment. Jeffrey Sprecher, chairman and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange Inc., also has repeatedly said the U.S. stock market is too complex and has called on participants to agree to simplify it.

Mr. Grasso added in the television interview that Regulation NMS, which stands for national market system and was designed to link all the U.S. markets, was a "sad, sad experiment."

The regulation, which was passed by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2005 and implemented in 2007, was designed to ensure investors got the best price available on any public U.S. market. It knitted together all the exchanges and trading venues across the country to create a single, though disparate, market. It required transactions be conducted at the "national best bid or offer," meaning each venue had to continuously check the prices available at competitors to verify a transaction was compliant. It also meant the NYSE no longer had a monopoly on trading in its own listed stocks, helping spur a host of competitors.

The rules contributed to market hiccups like last month's swings because they allowed for a major expansion in the number of places where stocks could trade, he said.

"No one anticipated 60 different venues where an IBM or a Microsoft trades," he said during the television interview.

Mr. Grasso told the Journal that he recommends a broad-based review of the markets as a first step toward addressing the problems he sees. He said such a review would involve participants from across the exchanges and regulatory agencies and would focus on "how to modernize the oversight structure to reflect what the market has become."

Mr. Grasso said in the television interview that a good rule of thumb for market changes was to ensure that "little old grandma in tennis shoes" also benefited.

If "you've taken care of her, you've taken care of everyone else," he said.

Head of McGraw Hill Financial s S&P Ratings Division Steps Down; Firm also outlines plans to combine S&P IQ with SNL Financial acquisition

McGraw Hill Financial Inc. said Neeraj Sahai, president of its Standard & Poor's Ratings Services business, has resigned after less than two years in the post to pursue other opportunities. 

The announcement came as the company also unveiled plans to combine its S&P Capital IQ unit with its recent SNL Financial LC acquisition. McGraw Hill "http://www.wsj.com/articles/mcgraw-hill-financial-to-buy-snl-financial-for-2-2-billion-1437997457"for the financial-data provider at the beginning of the month, part of a larger effort to shed its origins as a publishing company and become a global financial data provider. 

Chief Executive Douglas L. Peterson, a former Citigroup Inc. executive, said in a prepared statement on Tuesday that Mr. Sahai  has been a key leader at S&P Ratings during a critical period, overseeing the implementation of significant, global regulatory requirements while at the same time strengthening the financial performance of the business."

Mr. Sahai "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304011304579219770027877240"from Citi in early 2014. Most recently before joining S&P, he was head of Citi's securities and fund services business and acted as chief fiduciary officer of the bank.

Earlier this year, McGraw Hill reached settlements which cost the firm more than $1.5 billion that resolved government lawsuits and investigations tied to the S&P Ratings unit. The cases involved S&P's ratings of mortgage-bond deals before and after the 2008 financial crisis. 

On Tuesday, the company also named Mike Chinn, former president and CEO of SNL Financial, as president of the combined S&P Capital IQ/SNL Financial. Mr. Chinn, who started at SNL as an analyst in 1994, had been president of SNL for 10 years and was named CEO in 2010.

Mr. Peterson said placing the combined S&P Capital IQ/SNL Financial under the leadership of Mr. Chinn best positions the business for opportunities in the global markets it serves.

S&P Capital IQ, which is McGraw Hill's second-largest division by revenue, after its ratings business, provides real-time financial data and analytics to investment banks, money managers and corporations. SNL is best known as a provider of in-depth banking industry data and analysis, but more than a third of SNL's revenue comes from nonbanking areas that include energy, insurance and real estate.

The head of the Italian insurer presents himself as a straight-talking numbers man, writes Rachel Sanderson

Mario Greco, chief executive of Italy's Generali, Eur-ope's third-biggest in-surer by premiums, speaks softly but gives every sign of being ready to do battle. It is not surprising: after turning the company round over the past three years, he still faces residual scepticism, fresh challenges and outside expectations about how corporate Italy should act.

"This is a company that is coming back," he insists of the insurer, whose share price has nearly doubled since he took the top job three years ago. A competitive road cyclist in his free time, he sits on the edge of his chair in Generali's Milan headquarters, his foot persistently tapping as if reaching for unseen pedals.

"Generali is coming back from nowhere because we started from a very low level," he says. "We are changing gear. We are finishing a turnround story and we are opening a value story, which is a significant change. To people who say 'you haven't fixed it', [I say] 'look at the numbers'."

Mr Greco, who studied international economics in the US and started his career at McKinsey, is in the vanguard of a rising generation in Italian capitalism.

His pugilistic talk is new at the top of corporate Italy - but he is not alone. His fellow CEOs at the country's leading companies, such as Intesa Sanpaolo, Telecom Italia, Eni and Enel, were all installed after the financial crisis and the eurozone sovereign crisis crashed share prices. All are confronting tough turnrounds at their respective businesses after the drubbing dealt by the crises. And all are faced with the task of restoring corporate Italy's image in the outside world, marred by a long economic stagnation and a reputation for crony capitalism.

Mr Greco, 56, joined Generali from Zurich Insurance Group in the heat of the eurozone debt crisis. The board, in a typically bloody Italian board coup, had just ousted its chairman, Cesare Ger-onzi, and CEO, Giovanni Perissinotto, in swift succession after the insurer lost two-thirds of its value in five years.

Mr Greco's appointment was significant because of the size of the group - Generali has  ¬500bn in assets under management, a behemoth in a country dominated by small and midsized businesses - and its place in Italian corporate culture.

The insurer under its old guard was an example of the type of Italian crony capitalism that raises a red flag for foreign investors in the eurozone's third-largest economy.

Generali sat amid a web of cross-shareholdings, which in the good times gave it unmatched influence but in the crises became the network through which contagion spread fast.

Mr Greco has cut costs and slashed its shareholdings in companies that included Telecom Italia, selling nearly  ¬4bn in assets to boost its capital.

"People bet I would make a capital increase three years ago - they can keep on making this bet," he says. Mr Greco reiterates that he still has no intention to raise capital since the asset sales have boosted Generali's economic solvency ratio, a key measure of financial strength, to 186 per cent at the end of 2014, more in line with its peers Axa and Allianz.

Mr Greco presents himself as a straight-talking numbers man, in a deliberate distinction from the avuncular manner of Italy's older executives.

Generali aims to pay  ¬5bn in dividends over the next four yearscompared with  ¬900m last year.

"We are now on a different journey to remunerate shareholders and increase the value of the company, and do that above the market average. This is completely new."

Mr Greco may have dragged Generali's governance and strategy into the 21st century but, like the leaders of many Italian businesses, he must now confront new problems spawned by technology and globalisation.

The International Monetary Fund warned earlier this year that the business models of European insurers are becoming un-sustainable after a dramatic fall in interest rates.

Mr Greco says he is prepared to deal with low bond yields "until 2018". He is shifting Generali's business mix to more fee-earning products to boost profits and away from life insurance, where setting up new contracts incurs heavy costs upfront. He also faces more competition arising from big data and is increasing spending on technology.

In addition, he has hired outsiders and foreigners to reflect Generali's presence in more than 60 countries with 78,000 employees and 72m customers. He hired New Delhi-born, Cambridge and Harvard-educated Nikhil Srinivasan as chief investment officer, who is now Italy's most prominent non-Italian executive.

His bet on new blood appears to have paid off. For 2014, Generali posted an investment return of 10 per cent on assets exceeding  ¬400bn, which beat its peers, according to a report from research company Sanford Bernstein.

But for some analysts with the memory of eurozone crisis contagion still fresh, the focus remains on Generali's  ¬50bn of Italian government debt and  ¬90bn of Italian liabilities, which remain a concern and a sign that the effects of its change may be superficial.

Mr Greco will have none of it. "The fact that we are strong in Italy, is this a sin? Is this a mistake? Is this something I have to feel regretful about? I don't think it is," he snaps, showing an exasperation shared by many of Italy's executives about the perception of the country internationally. "This is one of the top 10 countries in the world by GDP. We make profits in Italy, we have high market share, Italy is growing," he says.

Another exhalation of frustration greets a suggestion that Generali might provide credit to small and midsized businesses, since traditional bank lending has shrivelled during the downturn.

"Never, never," he says of the popular idea among lawmakers that insurers such as Generali could disintermediate banks. "I have been very clear with everyone at a European level and a national level. We can't help . . . It is not that we don't want to . . . We cannot do things that we do not have the competence to do," he says, his foot still urgently tapping out its staccato beat on the floor.

Like most of Italy's new corporate class, Mr Greco was a supporter of 40-year-old reformist prime minister Matteo Renzi when he came to power 18 months ago. With his combative attitude, Mr Renzi was their political counterpart. Since then, business leaders' affection has cooled as deep reforms have failed to materialise and the government growth target of 0.7 per cent this year is starting to look a stretch.

"We need much more reform as Europeans, and we need much more as Italians," is all Mr Greco will say.

But he stresses that he wants to applaud Mr Renzi and his team for the ef-forts they have made to ask Italy's corporate leaders how they can support them internationally, such as through trade missions.

That this is a great step forward reflects as much as anything how broken Italy's corporate system had become during 20 years of economic stagnation under its discredited political class of the right and left.

"The government is acting in a way where you can see that they are trying to help companies like ourselves. I feel that we are starting to have the support of the country," Mr Greco says. "This is a simple thing but important. You feel you belong to a place."

UK COMPANIES
Tesco nears $6bn deal with MBK to offload South Korea unit; Retail

Tesco has chosen a consortium led by South Korean buyout group MBKPartners as the preferred bidder for Homeplus, its business in the country, according to people close to the deal.

The MBK consortium, which includes the state-run National Pension Service, won exclusive negotiating rights with an offer worth about $6bn, backed by the Canada Pension Plan and the Singapore state's Temasek investment company, said one of the people. The transaction would be the biggest private equity buyout to take place in South Korea.

"They are likely to sign the deal soon," the person said, but added that "details of the contract could still change" as they were still being finalised.

Tesco had reportedly sought a price of more than $7bn. It has drawn strong interest from buyout groups as it involves a rare, large-size target.

MBK, South Korea's biggest private equity fund, fought off competition in the form of a joint bid from US buyout group KKR and Hong Kong-based Affinity Equity Partners, as well as from Carlyle Group of the US.

With the deal, the MBK-led group would gain entry to South Korea's highly competitive retail sector. Homeplus is the country's second-largest discount store chain, after Shinsegae's E-Mart, generating annual revenues of more than $7bn from more than 900 outlets.

Tesco is selling Homeplus , the South Korean business once regarded as the jewel in the crown of its international operations, to bolster its balance sheet following profit warnings and 7bn in writedowns this year.

The sale of its biggest overseas division will help the UK-based retailer pay off part of debts that total about 21.7bn. Tesco is also seeking to sell its Dunnhumby analytics business , which is valued at up to 2bn.

Tesco's other international businesses include more than 1,700 stores in Thailand, a business in Malaysia and a presence across central and eastern Europe.

The South Korean market has been especially difficult for big-box retailers because of legislation restricting where they can open outlets and requiring supermarkets to close every other Sunday to help smaller grocers compete.

There are also signs of increasing strain in the South Korean economy amid sluggish domestic consumption. Homeplus reported a Won300bn ($254m) net loss in the financial year that ended February 28, reversing from a Won463bn profit a year earlier, as revenues fell 4 per cent to Won8.6tn.

"It is still an attractive deal for the buyer despite such difficulties. MBK seems to think there is still room to boost the value of Homeplus after acquisition," said an investment banker.

MBK is an Asia-focused private equity group set up in 2005 by former Carlyle managers, with about $8.1bn in assets under management.

Tesco was the only competitive foreign retailer in South Korea, gaining traction due to a policy of localisation, while rivals Walmart and Carrefour pulled out of the country after years of losses. It entered South Korea in 1999 in a joint venture with Samsung Corp.

Auto Union Pushes Plan For Health Care Group

By Christina Rogers and Anna Wilde Mathews

The Wall Street Journal

Copyright  2015, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 

The United Auto Workers union is pushing Detroit car makers to put all their employees under one health-care umbrella, creating a powerful purchasing group that could upend traditional health care markets.

The union's idea would create a joint purchasing group for the three largest U.S. auto makers that would cover factory and white-collar workers and union-affiliated retirees. The group could total nearly 1 million members, a scale it believes would have unprecedented leverage in negotiating directly with hospitals, drug companies and others.

Assuming the idea even gets off the ground, it could take one to two years to set up and longer to generate significant savings, health-care experts said.

Ford Motor Co., Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and General Motors Co. largely rely now on health insurers to negotiate deals with hospitals, doctors and other medical providers for their workers' and white-collar retirees' plans. A separate UAW-affiliated trust fund manages health care expenses and benefits for about 750,000 hourly retirees and their dependents.

UAW President Dennis Williams previously has described the plan as a way for auto makers to gain more control over health-care expenses and win cost savings. He wants the purchasing group overseen by a board of union and auto industry executives. A prior effort to pull together employees of the three stalled in 2011 because auto makers weren't interested in pursuing it.

It is unclear how insurers like Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan -- which handles much of the Detroit auto makers' health care business -- would fit into this new model. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan declined to comment.

A Ford spokesman said even if it were to negotiate directly with providers "we still need a benefits administrator" due to the complexity of claims, suggesting a role for Blue Cross Blue Shield would remain.

GM and Fiat Chrysler each said they would be open to discussing ways to reduce the rising costs of employee medical care, but declined to comment specifically on the idea.

The UAW declined to make Mr. Williams available for an interview.

The union official is leading contract negotiations with the auto makers on a new, four-year deal to replace a contract expiring this month.

Analysts say the health-care proposal would be a way to free up savings for a wage increase.

Detroit car companies spend more than $2 billion annually on medical care for factory workers and dependents. Mr. Williams has said the purchasing group could include the auto maker's 90,000 white collar workers and their dependents. The UAW-affiliated health care trusts have a combined $61 billion in assets.

UAW members at the U.S. car makers typically pay between 6% and 8% of their medical costs, compared with the 28% of costs paid by the average U.S. manufacturing worker, according to researcher Truven Health Analytics.

Auto makers have said their employee health-care costs are rising at an unsustainable rate and could creep higher with a federal tax on benefit-rich plans beginning in 2018.

Union officials are reluctant to agree to shift more of the cost burden to workers, according to people familiar with negotiations. The union has a record of suggesting ways to maintain generous medical benefits while offering cost-effective strategies to auto makers.

In 2005, as the domestic auto makers lost market share and faced rising costs for current and retired workers, then-UAW President Ron Gettelfinger proposed setting up trusts known as voluntary employee beneficiary associations, or VEBAs, to take billions of dollars of retiree health-care costs off the car companies' books.

That proposal was adopted in 2007 as financial losses mounted at the auto makers, and the shift led to a significant decline in the auto makers' annual labor costs.

Mr. Williams, a VEBA trustee, has a keen view on how the retiree plans has operated. Since they were established in 2010, the trusts have managed to expand benefits and restore full vision and dental coverage for retirees while keeping annual cost-growth in the low single digits, said industry experts.

Health spending growth in the U.S. has generally been muted in recent years, running at around 4% annually, a slowdown that some economists have attributed to the recession and its after-effects.

Under his plan, Mr. Williams has said the car makers and the retiree trusts would continue to fund their health benefits separately. In addition to joint negotiating with health-care providers, the group would look for ways to manage costs and quality of care more efficiently.

One option for the purchasing pool, say people familiar with the matter, would be for it to establish "centers of excellence," a model in which employers contract with a few highly-rated medical centers for better rates on procedures such as knee surgery.

Companies including Boeing Co., Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. and Lowe's Cos. have such setups, which typically supplement traditional health plans

Lowe's has a deal with the Cleveland Clinic and flies employees to Ohio for heart surgeries at no cost to the worker.

The savings from direct deals between employers and health-care providers can be substantial, with some arrangements producing cost-reductions of between 10% and 20% compared with traditional coverage plans, said Erin Tatar, national leader at Towers Watson & Co.'s health management practice.

Employers often work with third parties to facilitate their deals with health-care providers -- including insurers that administer traditional health benefits, as well as outside operators.

The idea of employers striking deals directly with hospitals, doctors and other medical providers has gained attention lately as companies seek to trim costs and better control quality. More hospitals are also eager to open direct relationship, some with designs on launching their own health-insurance units.

Crafting direct contracts "is incredibly complex to execute," said Towers Watson's Ms. Tatar.

Volatility Spurs Debate: Humans vs. Machines

By Bradley Hope and Dan Strumpf

English
(Copyright (c) 2015, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

A string of messy stock-market openings in recent weeks has reinvigorated a debate about the relative effectiveness of humans versus machines in handling moments of extreme volatility and market uncertainty.

On one side is NYSE Group, the Intercontinental Exchange Inc. unit that on Tuesday relied again on an unusual response to large market swings: Floor traders known as specialists opened action in some heavily traded stocks by hand in a bid to facilitate orderly trading.

On the other is a host of electronic-trading firms such as BATS Global Markets Inc. In a strongly worded rebuke to its rival on Tuesday, BATS Chief Executive Chris Concannon said that NYSE Group's process for opening trading on stocks listed at the exchange was "broken" and that major changes needed to be made to protect investors from future problems.

"No one on the planet operates that way, and no one should operate that way," he said in an interview, adding that he sees "very limited value" in the use of humans on the trading floor. BATS operates entirely electronic exchanges.

An NYSE spokeswoman said in a statement that its "time-tested model for opening stocks with a blend of human oversight and sophisticated technology results in less volatile opens and enhanced price discovery, in particular for important days such as IPOs and during extreme market volatility."

The prospect of continued volatility is driving concerns from investors, exchanges and trading firms to avoid disruptions in the markets. Exchanges are also fierce competitors and have been known to use their rivals' problems to advance their own market models.

Mr. Concannon's comments touched on the long-running discussion among market participants about the NYSE's historic trading floor at its headquarters on Wall Street, where floor-based traders handle the opening and closing of stocks and seek to buffer the market during times of volatility.

NYSE officials and floor brokers have argued for years that they serve a crucial role providing slower trading within today's high-speed, electronic markets.

But there have been persistent questions about whether Intercontinental Exchange, which bought the NYSE in 2013, will keep the floor open. Critics have complained that, in today's overwhelmingly electronic market, its usefulness is primarily as backdrop for televised stock reports. Intercontinental Exchange has said it has no plans to do away with the trading floor.

"The debate is about whether we need a slower market structure or a faster market structure on days with large systemic volatility," said David Weisberger, managing director at market-analytics firm RegOne Solutions. The slower version is driven largely by people, whereas the faster one is controlled by computers and trading algorithms, he added.

The NYSE spokeswoman defended the exchange's approach by contrasting it with a notable failure a rival experienced with its own initial public offering.

"As BATS experienced with its IPO, relying exclusively on technology for opening stocks and IPOs can have disastrous consequences," she said, referring to BATS' decision to cancel its IPO in 2012 because of a glitch in its trading system.

On Aug. 24, in particular, trading problems exposed flaws in the market architecture, many analysts said. Amid unease over China's economy and the Federal Reserve's timeline for raising interest rates, a huge wave of sell orders hit the markets in the morning.

NYSE invoked the rarely used Rule 48 to allow market-makers to forgo disseminating information about how potentially volatile stocks might trade. The rule was designed to make it easier to open the markets faster, but many stocks ended up opening late.

That led to other issues. Many exchange-traded funds fell sharply because the underlying stocks hadn't yet begun trading, making it difficult for market-makers to accurately price ETFs that included those shares. Elsewhere, the prices for some stocks, including blue chips General Electric Co. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., plummeted more than 20%, adding a drag on ETFs linked to them. The many price swings triggered nearly 1,300 halts of stocks and ETFs, and many shares didn't formally open for trading until 9:45 a.m. or, in some cases, after 10 a.m.

Meanwhile, Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. opened stocks listed on its exchange "within one second," according to Nelson Griggs, head of listings at Nasdaq. NYSE-listed stocks also started trading on Nasdaq and BATS despite the fact that they hadn't opened on the NYSE. Because order books were thinner at BATS and Nasdaq than at the home exchange, traders say that contributed to price swings.

The confusion prompted dozens of listed companies to call Nasdaq to find out what was happening, Mr. Griggs said.

"What the market and issuers crave is certainty," he said. "There was a clear dearth of information. We had an enormous amount of calls coming in from people trying to figure out what was happening."

Several market observers pointed to the trading of shares of the private-equity firm KKR & Co. as an example of how things went awry. Shares opened at $10 on Aug. 24, roughly 50% below the closing price the Friday before, despite there being no significant news about the company. They traded as low as $8 before rebounding to $18.69 at the end of the day.

"That was a sign that something really went wrong," said Andrew Brooks, vice president and head of U.S. equity trading at T. Rowe Price.

Another factor slowing the start of trading, apart from Rule 48, were trading constraints that forced an unusually large number of NYSE stocks to be opened manually by traders on the exchange floor, said John McCarthy, general counsel at brokerage firm KCG Holdings Inc. Stocks on other exchanges, such as the Nasdaq, opened electronically without issue, he said.

When a stock opens manually, floor traders pair off buy and sell orders before kicking off trading at an agreed-upon price. In an electronic open, trading begins right away and orders are matched electronically.

"There's fewer specialists on the floor than there used to be, and they literally have to work through these stocks," Mr. McCarthy said. "They're just doing what the computer would do otherwise."

On a normal day, about three-quarters of the stocks that KCG opens from the floor of the exchange are handled electronically and the rest are opened manually using floor personnel, Mr. McCarthy said. But because of the volatility on Aug. 24, it was the reverse.

"On a day like Monday, it created what I would argue was a delay that wasn't beneficial for the market in a kind of extreme environment," he said.

As for Rule 48, several floor brokers said they believed the NYSE should consider phasing out its use or invoking it less frequently. "I understand why it was created, but there has to be a better way to handle the open on volatile days," said Peter Costa, a floor trader and president of Empire Executions Inc.

Ted Weisberg, a longtime floor trader and founder of floor brokerage Seaport Securities Corp., said invoking Rule 48 can speed up the opening of stocks but leads to less transparency.

"When you invoke Rule 48, you've opted for speed over price discovery and speed over transparency," he said. "'What's in the public's best interest is transparency and time to react."

An NYSE spokeswoman said: "Rule 48 allows us to expedite the opening of stocks on volatile days while maintaining the hallmark transparency that we are known for."

International Property: Vancouver: Starwood Nears Sale Of Famed Lodging

Until now, the biggest mystery hanging over Vancouver's world-renowned Bayshore Inn has been the six-month stay there in 1972 by billionaire recluse Howard Hughes, who sparked a media siege featuring a failed attempt to take his picture from a passing hang-glider.

Today, there is a different type of mystery unfolding at the prime downtown property in Vancouver, British Columbia. Now known as the Westin Bayshore, the hotel was put on the block early this year by owner Starwood Capital Group and is nearing a sale for roughly C$270 million ($205 million) to C$290 million, dwarfing initial estimates, according to people familiar with the deal.

The big questions: Who is going to buy it, and why would anyone pay that much for the 511-room waterfront parcel? The expected price will be one of the highest ever for a Canadian hotel, on a price-per-room basis.

Still, there has been no shortage of prospective buyers. Six approached the city to explore redevelopment options, according to Brian Jackson, Vancouver's director of planning. A couple of dozen parties expressed interest to listing agent Cushman & Wakefield Inc., with a large overseas contingent, mostly from China. The deal with Starwood is expected to close this year, according to people familiar with the matter

One high-profile bidder: Concord Pacific Developments Inc., which reshaped Vancouver's downtown skyline in the early 1990s, redeveloping Expo 86, the old World's Fair site, into a 2.5-mile long, multitower condo community that houses thousands of new arrivals from China and Hong Kong.

Concord Pacific confirmed it bid on the Bayshore but declined to comment further.

Many expect the buyer will try to develop condominiums on the site, reflecting the intense demand for homes in the area and the quick pace of price increases.

But obstacles abound. For starters, it will be tough for a developer to shoehorn more luxury towers into densely packed Coal Harbour, a high-rise condo district and one of Canada's most coveted addresses.

"We've had a number of inquiries from people who wanted to tear down the hotel and replace it with more height, more density, more residential," said Mr. Jackson. "To all of that, we said, 'No.'"

The risks over the pending deal are similar to those in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Boston and other North American cities with hot condo markets.

Developers are paying up for prime sites with visions of enormous condo projects, but they are making a bet they will be able to overcome local opposition that inevitably materializes.

Luxury condos, mostly on or near the waterfront, peaked prerecession in the C$1,800 to C$2,000 range before falling to around C$1,500 to C$1,600, said Michael Ferreira, a principal at Urban Analytics, which researches mixed-use projects.

Prices started skyrocketing again by 2014, and if the Bayshore were rezoned, the average sale price could easily hit C$2,500 a square foot and possibly rise to C$3,000 or even more, Mr. Ferreira said.

The property includes the original 11-story Bayshore Inn, built in 1961, the 18-story 1970 hotel, and a newer, 60,000-square-foot conference center. Mr. Hughes holed up in the hotel penthouse, and the mystery of why he came, what he did and why he left remains a puzzle to a generation of Vancouverites.

Starwood bought the hotel with partners in 2005, paying $96.5 million, according to real-estate tracker Real Capital Analytics. By 2013, the value was pegged at $146.2 million

The biggest hurdle facing buyers interested in redeveloping the property is the zoning of the 6-acre site since 1991. City officials say it is "shrink-wrapped and bubble-wrapped" to preserve the existing hotel precinct and curb the scale of redevelopment.

Opposition also is likely from the hotel's unionized workforce and affluent Coal Harbour residents whose water views could be jeopardized.

One high-profile bidder: Concord Pacific Developments Inc., which reshaped Vancouver's downtown skyline in the early 1990s, redeveloping Expo 86, the old World's Fair site, into a 2.5-mile long, multi-tower condo community that houses thousands of new arrivals from China and Hong Kong.

Concord Pacific confirmed it bid on the Bayshore, but declined other comment.

Many expect the buyer will try to develop condominiums on the site, reflecting the intense demand for homes in the area and the dizzying pace of price increases.

But obstacles abound. For starters, it will be tough for a developer to shoehorn more luxury towers into densely packed Coal Harbour, a high-rise condo district and one of Canada's most coveted addresses.

 We've had a number of inquiries from people who wanted to tear down the hotel and replace it with more height, more density, more residential," said Mr. Jackson.  To all of that, we said,  No.'"

The risks over the pending deal are similar to those being played out in San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York and Boston and other North American cities with hot condo markets. Developers are paying up for prime sites with visions of enormous condo projects, but they're making a bet they'll be able to overcome local opposition that inevitably materializes.

In Vancouver, condo prices have been soaring thanks to strong demand mostly from Chinese buyers and younger Canadians.

High-end luxury condos, mostly on or near the waterfront, peaked prerecession in the C$1,800 to C$2,000 range before falling back to earth post-downturn to around C$1,500 to C$1,600, said Michael Ferreira, a principal at Urban Analytics, which researches mixed-use projects.

Prices started skyrocketing again by 2014, and if the Bayshore were rezoned, the average sale price could easily hit C$2,500 a square foot and possibly rise to C$3,000 or even more, Mr. Ferreira said.

The property includes the original 11-story Bayshore Inn, built in 1961; the 18-story 1970 hotel, and a newer 60,000 square-foot conference center. Mr. Hughes holed up in the hotel penthouse, and the mystery of why he came, what he did and why he left remains a puzzle to a generation of Vancouverites.

Starwood bought the hotel with partners in 2005, paying $96.5 million, according to real estate tracker Real Capital Analytics. By 2013, the value was pegged at $146.2 million

The biggest hurdle facing buyers interested in redeveloping the property is the zoning of the 6-acre site since 1991. City officials say it is  shrink-wrapped and bubble-wrapped" to preserve the existing hotel precinct and curb the scale of redevelopment.

Opposition also is likely from the hotel's unionized workforce and affluent Coal Harbour residents whose water views could be jeopardized. And the 1961 mid-rise tower is a candidate for heritage status, a landmark designation, complicating any bid to scrap it.

 If we lose the Bayshore and Howard Hughes' suite, it would be death by a thousand cuts," said Aaron Chapman, a local historian who has conducted hotel tours.

Some developers took a pass on the bidding including high-end property developer Grosvenor Americas, which is building Grosvenor Ambleside in West Vancouver and has priced penthouse units at close to C$4,000 a foot.

 Operating a hotel for a number of years is not what we do," said Michael Ward, general manager for Grosvenor in Vancouver.

A full-blown rezoning could take two to five years and be fraught with delays and opposition.  You'd have to achieve among the highest level condo prices Vancouver has ever seen to make the numbers work," Mr. Ward said.

ECB: Don't Ease to Appease

A central bank's work is never done, it seems. Last week's market swings have led to building expectations that the European Central Bank will boost its 1 trillion euro stimulus program. But this week's monetary-policy meeting looks unlikely to deliver that.

The ECB has a tricky situation on its hands. A truly convincing and robust eurozone recovery is still a thing of hope rather than reality. Expectations for global growth have fallen due to fears of a slowdown in China and other emerging nations. Market measures of inflation expectations have taken a drubbing again due to falling oil prices. And the euro -- probably the single most important channel for propping up eurozone growth and inflation -- has strengthened.

But there still are good reasons for the ECB to wait and see what happens. First, the economic data so far has suggested that the eurozone economy is proving resilient, with domestic demand playing an important role. Monetary data released last week showed an impressive 12.1% year on year rise in the so-called M1 aggregate, which measures currency in circulation and overnight deposits and which tends to be a good leading signal for growth. Sentiment surveys have remained robust, despite the shocks of recent months.

Second, events elsewhere will matter. The ECB would get more bang for its policy buck if it were to ease once the U.S. Federal Reserve has started raising interest rates. That would probably lead to a weaker euro than otherwise. The ECB has been frustrated in the past by twists and turns in Fed policy; the outcome of September's U.S. rate decision is clearly uncertain.

Third, August's market panic may turn out to be just that: a panic. ECB President Mario Draghi declined to pander to jittery markets in June when German bunds sold off sharply, saying the central bank wouldn't tame volatility. Markets have become excessively dependent on central bankers and are too quick now to call for support; to ride to the rescue when it isn't clearly necessary would simply embed that unhealthy reliance even more deeply.

Finally, there is still a year to go on the ECB's current program. Mr. Draghi may well reinforce that the ECB's purchases are flexible and will respond to changing circumstances. But he needn't -- and shouldn't -- overhaul the plan just yet.

Is comScore's Revenue Growth That Strong?

Growth-starved investors have rewarded companies that can increase revenues. But investors should dig into what is driving their growth.

Internet analytics company comScore is an example. It reported second-quarter revenue of $91.4 million on Aug. 4, up 14% from a year earlier. A note within its quarterly filing explained, though, that $10.8 million was "nonmonetary" revenue. Exclude that, and comScore's revenue would have grown only 3%.

Nonmonetary revenue is financialspeak to say comScore booked revenue from barter agreements where actual cash wouldn't be changing hands. In this case, it was for the exchange of data with other companies.

ComScore appears to have been acting in accordance with the relevant accounting standards in its approach. These let companies record nonmonetary transactions with "commercial substance" at the estimated fair value of the assets surrendered.

Even so, the significance of these nonmonetary revenues to the company's top line warrants scrutiny. Growth in revenue from bartering accounted for the majority of comScore's sales growth in the most recent quarter.

What's more, the gains are based on estimates of the assets' fair value; that is subjective by nature and has been open to question in the past in other industries, namely banking. A further wrinkle: About 20% of the nonmonetary revenue in the second quarter came via a related-party transaction. ComScore didn't identify the company.

The issue of nonmonetary revenue has piqued investors' interest. At an Aug. 12 investor conference hosted by Oppenheimer, comScore finance chief Mel Wesley responded to an analyst's question about bartering. The company uses data-sharing agreements to get access to data sets owned by others that it deems necessary for developing products, Mr. Wesley said.

These arrangements allow it to avoid having to pay for the data or enter into revenue-sharing agreements. And comScore determines how much revenue to book based on the average historical cash sales of the same product. That seems like an appropriate approach to fair-valuing the asset, but investors don't know much beyond that about the company's method.

Mr. Wesley added that comScore doesn't often do such deals. But its filings show nonmonetary revenue has ramped up significantly over the past 12 months. It accounted for about 8% of comScore's total revenue over the period, versus only 2% in the previous 12 months.

ComScore's stock, meanwhile, reached a 52-week high last month, closing at $64.64 on Aug. 17. It has fallen a bit since then but is still up about 40% from a year ago.

Granted, comScore released the mobile version of its validated Campaign Essentials (vCE) product for advertising analytics in the spring, and its Xmedia tool for measuring audiences across TV and digital media is now in beta. It stands to reason the company would have greater need for the swapped data sets in the quarters leading up to these product launches.

And while comScore has reported an annual net loss for the past five years, some analysts value it on the basis of free-cash flow, which would be unaffected by nonmonetary sales. Free-cash flow, defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and capital lease payments, rose 63% in the first half of 2015 and more than doubled in the second quarter.

Still, this doesn't change the fact that much of the company's reported top-line growth has come from revenue that brings no cash in the door. And, while comScore backs out noncash expenses such as stock-based compensation in its adjusted earnings calculations, it doesn't back out noncash revenue.

Indeed, the transactions raise eyebrows among accounting specialists. "If nothing else, it makes the revenue growth suspect," said Charles Mulford, a professor of accounting at Georgia Tech's Scheller College of Business. "They're adhering to the letter of commercial substance. But an investor should ask: Does it capture the economic substance?"

A company swapping data with another company wouldn't see any benefit to future cash flows -- a measure of commercial substance -- unless it can go out and resell the data, Mr. Mulford said.

That remains something of an open question for comScore. It says its vCE business, of which vCE Mobile is a part, already accounts for about 10% of revenue and is expected to contribute $100 million in annual revenue by 2017. Xmedia has yet to fully launch, though, so the bulk of its cash flows are hypothetical.

Investors have reason to be wary of nonmonetary revenue, says J. Edward Ketz, a professor of accounting at Penn State University. Standard setters didn't go far enough in modifying accounting rules after Internet companies swapping fiber-optic capacity ran into trouble with their accounting early in the last decade, he argues.

Investors cheering comScore's top-line growth should take closer note of where it is coming from.

Buffett's

Buy Into

Phillips

Gushes

Maybe Warren Buffett will start calling it Phillips 132.

Berkshire Hathaway has come back for seconds at Phillips 66, disclosing a nearly 11% stake in the energy company after Friday's close.

Oil prices were near their all-time peak back in 2008, when Mr. Buffett first bought into ConocoPhillips, then an integrated oil and gas company. He later admitted to "terrible timing" with that investment and used it as currency in a shares-for-assets swap with wholly owned Berkshire unit Lubrizol.

To the untrained eye, Mr. Buffett's new commitment to Phillips 66 -- a 2012 spinoff from ConocoPhillips, owning its downstream units -- might look like another instance of buying at the top. After all, a confluence of factors such as wide spreads between U.S. crude and refined-products prices on global markets have made the past several quarters some of the most profitable ever for U.S. refiners.

An equal-weighted basket of stocks in the industry has beaten the S&P 500 by 22 percentage points so far this year. But a buildup of fuel inventories could squeeze profits when the summer driving season ends in September.

Take a closer look, though. Many nonrefining businesses within Phillips 66, such as its midstream unit, are substantial and stand to benefit if currently beaten-down oil and natural-gas prices rebound. That business is absorbing the lion's share of capital expenditure -- a contrarian move worthy of Mr. Buffett himself. In fact, he is making his own big bet on energy infrastructure. In 2014, Berkshire Hathaway Energy absorbed 43% of all capital expenditure at the conglomerate.

Clearly then, Phillips 66, with its valuable assets outside of red-hot refining, is a company making the sorts of investments that Mr. Buffett values, and in the types of assets he covets. Berkshire's stake is too large to be a simple portfolio move and instead smacks of a strategic step.

It could be a precursor to yet another swap, perhaps for assets complementary to Berkshire's existing infrastructure. Rather than the refining units that are all the rage, Mr. Buffett would be more likely to target units suffering from low petroleum prices, or pipelines that offer steady, utility-like returns.

He didn't get the nickname the Oracle of Omaha by buying at the top of the market.

-- Spencer Jakab

Overheard

It has been a bad year for Asian businesses evocative of James Clavell's "Noble House."

That 1981 best seller was the story of Hong Kong's largest conglomerate suffering financial trouble and intrigue. So investors fond of Clavell's fiction may want to follow the facts regarding Noble House (China) Holdings, a small, Hong Kong-listed restaurant business that the local regulator warned Friday had too few shareholders holding 91% of the stock. Though the regulator didn't say as much, such concentration warnings could suggest the stock isn't moving up and down according to market forces. Then there's Noble Group, the Hong Kong-based but Singapore-listed commodities trader whose accounting has been under scrutiny since February and whose credit is now in trouble.

Considering the original "Noble House" was all about a conglomerate's struggle to survive -- it succeeds at the end -- Clavell lovers will surely want to tune in.

FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - MONEY
Arch-traditionalist private banks go mobile

Technology for customers is a 'work in progress'

Private banks are known for centuries of tradition: advice given to generations who have filed into the same oak-panelled office. Service was paramount: the customer always came first.

But now the model is shifting. Service still rules, of course, but many private banks operating in the UK, including C. Hoare & Co and those managed by Kleinwort Benson and Credit Suisse are all poised to launch new web- or mobile-based apps for their wealthy clients.

"More than 80 per cent of our transactions are being done through the internet," says Alexander Hoare, managing partner of C. Hoare, which, founded in 1672, is the UK's oldest independent bank.

Hoare is set to launch its mobile banking app in the first quarter of next year, and is not alone in introducing new ways of banking.

"Technology and the way that people will relate to their banks is potentially a threat," says Roger Weatherby, chief executive of Weatherbys Bank, "but it is also an opportunity. It places smaller banks potentially on a level playing field with the other larger banks."

But it has been many years coming. Customers of UK retail banks have been able to access their accounts through mobile apps for several years. So why the delay?

"[The greater adoption of technology] is a work in progress," says Sebastian Dovey, managing partner of Scorpio Partnership, the consultancy. "I'm sure that the industry looks at technology almost aghast in terms of how it might reduce the need for advice. The thought is that, if you give them everything on app, they'll run off and never use an adviser again."

For Christian Nolterieke, managing director of MyPrivateBanking Research, the banks are concerned about not putting a foot wrong. "Their clients are of the utmost importance," he says. "And because of this, they are still trying to figure out how to approach them best. These are banks who know they have to do it, but are slow because they want to do it right."

And the market is vast. Scorpio Partnership estimates the global private banking at approximately $20.6tn, with potential advisable assets - those that could be banked, but are currently not - at $37.6tn. Part of the banks' move stems from simply not wanting to be left behind by the marketplace, but it is also recognition of the shifting demographic of the newly rich: the wealthy are becoming younger and more web savvy.

Citi Private Bank, which focuses exclusively on wealthy individuals or families with more than $25m, launched a digital service called In View, offering "clients a comprehensive snapshot of their wealth in one place, giving bankers and clients a world of data at their fingertips", according to its website. We spent a lot of time really looking at what was going on in financial services, but also holistically at how digital was changing the world," explains Tim Tate, head of digital strategy at Citi Private Bank. In practice, the service gives clients the same level of access to the data as the bankers themselves.

"They can manipulate that data in many ways, changing the analytics. With paper reporting you only get one view - and that is the view that the banker has designed for you.

"Now they have a platform that allows them to define their own view of their portfolio as they want to see it, and which benchmark they want to use. It puts the power in the hands of the client."

To an extent, this is antithetical to the traditional private banking model, in that there is no physical face-to-face contact and the client is able to do everything they want themselves - something Mr Tate readily acknowledges.

"The important thing is, we're not trying to force everyone to do everything themselves," he says. "Some people absolutely want a digital model, some want a hybrid and some want an analogue model. Those who don't want to do everything themselves can still receive their traditional private banking services."

James Fleming, chief executive of Arbuthnot Latham, agrees - but with qualifications. For him, technology is a "tremendous enabler but no substitute for human interaction". He continues: "I meet a lot of clients day in and day out, and the answer that they give me is that they are looking for a personal relationship on a long-term basis.

"But technology is a given; it has to be in place. You have to have mobile banking and the ability to see investment portfolios, for example, but I don't see them as a substitute."

Yet others suggest that the more traditional private banking model is under threat - and needs to change. Paul Kearney is managing director and head of the private investment office at Kleinwort Benson, which is currently developing a mobile-based web app for its private banking clients.

"We have been working on the threats to our current model and the traditional relationship, which is very much face to face and how you meet and face clients. We are very strongly of the view that the model is going to be under huge threat. Future generations are not going to expect face to face as a normal model of doing business."

If existing players do not give private banking clients the digital services they want, new entrants could fill the gap.

"There are opportunities for challenger banks," Mr Weatherby adds. "But there is plenty to go round. Depending on which survey you look at, there are about a million people who would be classified as high net worth or ultra-high net worth - and would essentially come into our bracket of 3m of net assets. But I can't sit here and promise to give everyone a fantastic service; we would only really be able to offer that to less than 20,000 customers.

"At the moment, we have in the region of 4,000 customers, so there's good room to grow - and still 980,000 left over for the rest."

Apps and platforms

Younger customers drive digital change

Private banks have to adapt to a new generation of customers or face missing out, says Philip Harris, chief executive of Credit Suisse's UK private bank.

He says it is rolling out a "digital private bank" in Europe and the UK at some point in 2016 "in recognition that clients want to interact with their wealth, and institutions that don't allow that or facilitate that in a way that is sustainable will fail. It is a recognition that this is the way the market is going and we want to be in the vanguard."

In the UK, 91 per cent of affluent consumers use mobile websites for financial matters, and two-thirds use mobile apps provided by their bank or wealth manager, according to the global survey of mobile disruption in wealth management.

Kleinwort Benson is also developing a mobile app with younger customers in mind. "We are looking towards those who are currently in their teens and early 20s - the next generation of entrepreneurs and professionals," says Paul Kearney, managing director and head of the private investment office.

"We want to make sure that we have a model that is ready for that - ensuring what we have is relevant, rather than shoehorning what we do on to a mobile platform."

Volatility and key questions investors should ask

After the shock of 'Black Monday', FT reporters look at the big issues for investors: equities, funds, bonds, pensions and property

Billed as the "Great Fall of China", stock markets around the world plunged on Monday in response to fears that China's economic growth was running out of steam - only to bounce back and recover their weekly losses by Friday.

In a rollercoaster week for investors, the FTSE 100, S&P 500 and FTSE Eurofirst 300 all briefly went into correction territory - a fall of more than 10 per cent - but stock markets in Germany and emerging markets witnessed falls of 20 per cent or more from their peaks due to their greater exposure to China.

See-sawing stock markets were accompanied by better than expected economic data from the US, underlying the dilemma for central banks over whether to raise interest rates.

Some economists argue this backdrop has increased levels of market skittishness, pointing to the potential impact of a rate rise on global liquidity. While this week's events are being described as a correction, rather than a crash, the global outlook from economic forecasters can best be summed up as "fear, but not panic".

For private investors taking stock of their portfolios, here are the questions you need to ask as you prepare to navigate future volatility:

How worried should investors be about events this week?

China was the catalyst for this week's sell off. The Shanghai Composite Index slumped on "Black Monday" after Beijing enacted a surprise currency devaluation, followed on Tuesday by cutting interest rates.

While markets elsewhere have largely rebounded, the Shanghai index finished 8 per cent lower on the week.

Traders can play the short-term markets, but investors need to think long term. This week, advisers urged investors not to panic, to take any actions in stages, and consider how to diversify their holdings.

Data from trading platforms show that private investors used the volatility to buy into some of the UK's biggest listed companies.

The Share Centre reported three times the usual amount of trading activity on Monday, with 42 per cent of trades being FTSE 100 listed stocks. Lloyds, GlaxoSmithKline, BP and Royal Dutch Shell were its most popular traded stocks on that day, but overall 45 per cent of orders were buys, and 55 per cent were sells.

It was a similar story at direct-to-consumer investment platforms including Barclays Stockbrokers and TD Direct - though a survey of more than 8,000 clients of Interactive Investor carried out for FT Money showed that 78 per cent had not been tempted to buy stocks, bonds or funds as the markets fell.

Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at Interactive Investor, says: "The panic button has not been pushed by 'have and hold' investors."

Looking forward, equity markets - and "bond proxies" in particular - still look overpriced. Commodities are cheap for a reason, as prices have been driven down by declining demand from China, though brave contrarians may now be sizing up the sector. Many investors may choose to sit on cash, and wait for bigger falls to bring buying opportunities.

The FTSE 100 was hit harder than many other developed market indices because of its overseas-facing companies, many of which are exposed to China and other emerging markets. Its largest names include miners and oil companies, categories that have suffered far more than companies focused on UK consumers.

While the index has bounced back, this week's events were a wake-up call for those invested in passive funds that track the market.

"You may be happy that over the long term it will even out, but investors need to be aware that passive funds are large-cap dominated and will hold many companies that have already risen in value," says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

"There is a real risk of a hard landing for China and therefore we think there is scope for further losses on commodity funds and emerging market investments despite the already significant declines," says Jason Hollands, managing director at Tilney Bestinvest.

Which investments provided the best insulation?

Active managers of UK equity funds shielded investors from the worst of this year's market turmoil, with almost seven in 10 performing better than the falling FTSE 100 and FTSE All-Share indices.

A focus on the UK domestic economy has saved many funds from a battering at the hands of international markets. Before this week's volatility, funds such as Standard Life's UK Opportunities and UK Ethical funds each shed about one per cent over the past month, according to figures from FE Analytics, even as the FTSE 100 dropped 7.2 per cent.

Two Miton funds, UK Value Opportunities and Undervalued Assets, each declined by less than four per cent over the same period. All four of these funds made returns of at least 10 per cent over the past year, even as the FTSE 100 was down 10.9 per cent. The Miton Undervalued Assets fund has a particularly strong record over three years, returning 80 per cent to investors over that period and placing it in the top 1 per cent of funds.

"We've seen wages growing ahead of inflation and now consumers can make the decision to spend that on things like TVs and cars. We are overweight companies that benefit from that," says Henry Flockhart, investment director at Standard Life.

Similar patterns are evident across UK actively managed equity funds, according to statistics from Hargreaves Lansdown and Lipper. A focus on domestic-facing stocks rather than FTSE 100 mega-caps helped 60 per cent of active funds beat the highest-performing tracker over six months, and almost 70 per cent over the past three months, according to Lipper.

Jake Moeller, head of UK and Ireland research at Lipper, notes that UK equity income funds fared well due to their naturally defensive positioning, while utility stocks have also helped many of the better-performing funds.

"Some fund managers have eschewed utilities because of the level of state ownership but anything which has exposure to inelastic demand is going to be much more buoyant at the moment," he says.

Mr Flockhart at Standard Life Investments says he is looking to add to holdings in FTSE 100-listed Burberry, the luxury fashion retailer, whose shares have fallen almost 28 per cent since its peak in February, due to its exposure to Asian markets.

"That's obviously been hit by the slowdown but it's the kind of long-term story that we'd still be happy to add to. It's about the middle classes in emerging markets and it's away from the infrastructure-driven growth that we've seen," Mr Flockhart says.

Georgina Hamilton, co-manager of the Miton UK Value Opportunities and Miton Undervalued Assets funds, says lower stock prices had enabled her to top-up holdings in domestically focused UK companies with strong balance sheets.

The Miton managers have favoured companies in areas such as home maintenance and improvement, and retailers such as JD Sports. They also hold housebuilders such as Bellway and Barratt. This is a sector that the Standard Life managers view positively, holding stocks such as Galliford Try and Crest Nicholson. They have been using the market turbulence to top up their holdings.

"Our large overweight in the housebuilding sector has worked very well for us, particularly since the general election," says Lesley Duncan, investment director at Standard Life.

However, it is hard to find a fund manager who thinks that oil or mining stocks are cheap. "A number of oil companies and miners have looked overly leveraged to us, with too little cash flow," adds Ms Hamilton. "They need not only to be cheap, but to have a strong balance sheet."

Global asset managers say European equities look more attractive. "For investors, one key takeaway is that selling has restored value in some areas, particularly Europe," says Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock.

Companies exposed to global trade, especially in Germany, have been particularly punished, he says, leading to German stocks now trading at less than 12 times forward earnings and 1.5 times book value - about 45 per cent lower than the US market.

Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management also sees value in European equities, but is more cautious about emerging markets, which have been directly affected by China's turmoil.

Some managers were even more cautious. F&C's multi-manager team, headed by Rob Burdett and Gary Potter, says the current "heightened volatility . . . creates opportunities for investors, but for the moment we are not significantly adding to positions".

Savers who do not have to access their pension for a number of years have been advised to sit tight as losses should be recouped over the longer term, but those who have entered drawdown have more to fear.

Pension provider Hargreaves Lansdown has put together an action plan for retirement savers in drawdown plans. It suggests pensioners keep at least one year's income in cash in their pension plan, to serve as a buffer during extreme markets.

Hargreaves also recommends limiting withdrawals from a drawdown plan. "Falling markets could have a significant impact on those drawing too much from their pension plans," says Danny Cox, head of financial planning at Hargreaves. "Spend too much and the drawdown plan can suffer irreparable damage."

The third piece of advice is for savers to draw income from underlying assets in the plan not the capital, to avoid exacerbating losses. "Investors who stick to a natural yield strategy should be better placed to navigate choppy waters," says Mr Cox.

The fourth point is a rudimentary one: ensure your portfolio is diverse and balanced with a mix of assets including cash, fixed interest products and shares.

Bonds tend to do well during times of market volatility, particularly those in perceived "havens" such as UK and German government bonds. Prices in both markets rise when investors are worried about the rest of the market.

Yields on ten-year UK gilts, the market benchmark, fell below 1.7 per cent early this week, although they have since climbed back to 1.9 per cent as the situation calmed.

If wider market volatility continues and investors push back their expectations for interest rate rises in the US and UK, money could keep pouring into gilts, meaning that yields will keep tracking down.

Investors who have taken more risks with their money, putting it into, say, emerging market bonds, have had a difficult week. JPMorgan says total returns on emerging market bonds denominated in local currencies are now down by 12 per cent in the year to date.

Nevertheless, it is notable that bonds have not experienced the same drama as equities, commodities and currencies. Where prices go from here will depend on what China and the US do next.

Regulators in the US and UK have dropped hints that the turmoil is likely to push back a rise in interest rates. Predictions that Federal Reserve would raise US interest rates in September are looking shaky: William Dudley, a top Fed official, told a conference this week that the case for tightening monetary policy as early as September "seem[s] less compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago," though his comments were followed by stronger-than-expected economic data.

The speed of a UK rate rise had already been a matter of debate after only one member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee voted for a rise this month. The volatility on stock markets is likely to reinforce such a view.

Another reason to think rates may stay at their record lows is the recent drop in the oil price. Placing aside Thursday's "short squeeze" , falling commodities prices mean economists are reviewing their earlier expectations of inflation rises towards the end of the year. For now, consumer price indices may well remain flat or even retreat into deflation territory, discouraging a rate boost.

Mortgage lenders have shown little consensus in recent days over the direction of the market. Ray Boulger, technical director at broker John Charcol, says: "Some lenders have put rates up a bit; some have been put them down; some have been putting some up and some down."

But in the medium term, the longer the wait for a Bank of England rate rise, the longer borrowers have to take advantage of record low interest rates on fixed-term mortgages.

"It does seem to me that the first rise in the bank rate has to be put back, so from a cost point of view that has to be an advantage," Mr Boulger says.

Property observers have speculated on the impact of Asian turmoil on demand for top London property among overseas buyers, traditionally a key part of the capital's prime market. But rather than constraining demand, some believe the events of the past week will stoke it, much as the eurozone crisis of 2010 brought an influx of Italian, French and Greek buyers to London.

Grainne Gilmore, Knight Frank head of UK residential research, says there had been an intensification of interest from Chinese buyers. "The extra volatility has enhanced London's reputation as a safe haven property market."

Yolande Barnes, head of Savills World Research, agrees that wealthy overseas buyers looking to diversify their portfolios could give a boost to the top end of the London market. But the effect would be small and balanced by slower wealth creation and lower levels of investment. "Ultimately, the net effect is likely to be neutral."

Billed as the  Great Fall of China , stock markets around the world plunged on Monday in response to fears that China s economic growth was running out of steam   only to bounce back and recover their weekly losses by Friday.

In a rollercoaster week for investors, the FTSE 100, S&P 500 and FTSE Eurofirst 300 all briefly went into correction territory   a fall of more than 10 per cent   but stock markets in Germany and emerging markets witnessed falls of 20 per cent or more from their peaks due to their greater exposure to China.

See-sawing stock markets were accompanied by better than expected economic data from the US, underlying the dilemma facing central banks over whether to raise interest rates.

Some economists argue that this backdrop has increased levels of skittishness in the markets, pointing to the potential impact of a rate rise on global liquidity. While this week s events are being described as a correction, rather than a crash, the global outlook from economic forecasters can best be summed up as  fear, but not panic .

For private investors taking stock of their portfolios, here are the questions you need to ask as you prepare to navigate future volatility:

How worried should investors be about events this week?

China was the catalyst for this week s sell off. The Shanghai Composite Index slumped on  Black Monday  after Beijing enacted a surprise currency devaluation, followed on Tuesday by cutting interest rates.

While markets elsewhere have largely rebounded, the Shanghai index finished 8 per cent lower on the week.

Traders can play the short-term markets, but investors need to think long term. This week, advisers urged investors not to panic, to take any actions in stages, and consider how to diversify their holdings.

Data from trading platforms show that private investors used the volatility to buy into some of the UK s biggest listed companies.

The Share Centre reported three times the usual amount of trading activity on Monday, with 42 per cent of trades being FTSE 100 listed stocks. Lloyds, GlaxoSmithKline, BP and Royal Dutch Shell were its most popular traded stocks on that day, but overall 45 per cent of orders were buys, and 55 per cent were sells.

It was a similar story at direct-to-consumer investment platforms including Barclays Stockbrokers and TD Direct   though a survey of more than 8,000 clients of Interactive Investor carried out for FT Money showed that 78 per cent had not been tempted to buy stocks, bonds or funds as the markets fell.

Mike McCudden, head of derivatives at Interactive Investor, says:  The panic button has not been pushed by  have and hold  investors. 

Looking forward, equity markets   and  bond proxies  in particular   still look overpriced. Commodities are cheap for a reason, as prices have been driven down by declining demand from China, though brave contrarians may now be sizing up the sector. Many investors may choose to sit on cash, and wait for bigger falls to bring more attractive buying opportunities.

Which areas suffered the most?

The FTSE 100 was hit harder than many other developed market indices because of its overseas-facing companies, many of which are exposed to China and other emerging markets. Its largest names include miners and oil companies, categories that have suffered far more than companies focused on UK consumers.

While the index has bounced back, this week s events were a wake-up call for those invested in passive funds that track the market.

 You may be happy that over the long term it will even out, but investors need to be aware that passive funds are large-cap dominated and will hold many companies that have already risen in value,  says Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.

 There is a real risk of a hard landing for China and therefore we think there is scope for further losses on commodity funds and emerging market investments despite the already significant declines,  says Jason Hollands, managing director at Tilney Bestinvest.

Which investments provided the best insulation?

Active managers of UK equity funds shielded investors from the worst of this year s market turmoil, with almost seven in 10 performing better than the falling FTSE 100 and FTSE All-Share indices.

A focus on the UK domestic economy has saved many funds from a battering at the hands of international markets. Before this week s volatility, funds such as Standard Life s UK Opportunities and UK Ethical funds each shed about one per cent over the past month, according to figures from FE Analytics, even as the FTSE 100 dropped 7.2 per cent.

Two Miton funds, UK Value Opportunities and Undervalued Assets, each declined by less than four per cent over the same period. All four of these funds made returns of at least 10 per cent over the past year, even as the FTSE 100 was down 10.9 per cent. The Miton Undervalued Assets fund has a particularly strong record over three years, returning 80 per cent to investors over that period and placing it in the top 1 per cent of funds.

 We ve seen wages growing ahead of inflation and now consumers can make the decision to spend that on things like TVs and cars. We are overweight companies that benefit from that,  says Henry Flockhart, investment director at Standard Life.

Similar patterns are evident across UK actively managed equity funds, according to statistics from Hargreaves Lansdown and Lipper. A focus on domestic-facing stocks rather than FTSE 100 mega-caps has helped 60 per cent of active funds to beat the highest-performing tracker over six months, and almost 70 per cent over the past three months, according to Lipper.

Jake Moeller, head of UK and Ireland research at Lipper, notes that UK equity income funds had fared well thanks to their naturally defensive positioning, while utility stocks have also helped many of the better-performing funds.

 Some fund managers have eschewed utilities because of the level of state ownership but anything which has exposure to inelastic demand is going to be much more buoyant at the moment,  he says.

Where do fund managers sense buying opportunities?

Mr Flockhart at Standard Life Investments says he was looking this week to add to his existing holdings in FTSE 100-listed Burberry, the luxury fashion retailer, which has seen its shares slide by almost 28 per cent since its peak in February thanks to its exposure to Asian markets.

 That s obviously been hit by the slowdown but it s the kind of long-term story that we d still be happy to add to. It s about the middle classes in emerging markets and it s away from the infrastructure-driven growth that we ve seen,  Mr Flockhart says.

Georgina Hamilton, co-manager of the Miton UK Value Opportunities and Miton Undervalued Assets funds, says lower stock prices had enabled her to top-up holdings in domestically focused UK companies with strong balance sheets.

The Miton managers have favoured companies in areas such as home maintenance and improvement, and retailers such as JD Sports. They also hold housebuilders such as Bellway and Barratt. This is a sector that the Standard Life managers also view positively, holding stocks such as Galliford Try and Crest Nicholson. They have been using the market turbulence to top up their holdings.

 Our large overweight in the housebuilding sector has worked very well for us, particularly since the general election [in May],  says Lesley Duncan, investment director at Standard Life.

However, it is hard to find a fund manager who thinks that oil or mining stocks are cheap.

 A number of oil companies and miners have looked overly leveraged to us, with too little cash flow in the context of their leverage,  adds Ms Hamilton.  They need not only to be cheap, but have a strong balance sheet. 

Further afield, global asset managers say European equities look more attractive.

 For investors, one key takeaway is that selling has restored value in some areas of the market, particularly in Europe,  says Russ Koesterich, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock, the world s largest asset manager.

Companies exposed to global trade, especially in Germany, have been particularly punished, he says, leading to German stocks now trading at less than 12 times forward earnings and 1.5 times book value   about 45 per cent lower than the US market.

Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management says it also saw value in European equities, but was more cautious about emerging markets, which have been most directly affected by China s turmoil.

Some managers were even more cautious, however. F&C s multi-manager team, headed by Rob Burdett and Gary Potter, says the current  heightened volatility 	. 	. 	. 	does create opportunities for investors, but for the moment we are staying patient and not significantly adding to positions .

Should I panic about my pension?

Savers who do not have to access their pension for a number of years have been advised to sit tight as losses should be recouped over the longer term, but those who have entered drawdown have more to fear.

Pension provider Hargreaves Lansdown has put together an action plan for retirement savers in drawdown plans. The first thing it suggests is for pensioners to keep at least one year s income in cash in their pension plan, to serve as a buffer during extreme markets.

Hargreaves also recommends limiting withdrawals from a drawdown plan.  Falling markets could have a significant impact on those drawing too much from their pension plans,  says Danny Cox, head of financial planning at Hargreaves.  Spend too much and the drawdown plan can suffer irreparable damage. 

The third piece of advice is for savers to draw income from the underlying assets in the plan not the capital, to avoid exacerbating losses.  Investors who stick to a natural yield strategy should be better placed to navigate choppy waters,  says Mr Cox.

The fourth point is a rudimentary one: ensure your portfolio is diverse and balanced with a mixture of assets including cash, fixed interest products and shares to protect it during market falls.

What about bonds?

Bonds tend to do well during times of market volatility, particularly those in perceived  havens  such as UK and German government bonds. Prices in both markets rise when investors are worried about the rest of the market.

Yields on ten-year UK gilts, the market benchmark, fell below 1.7 per cent this week, although they have since climbed back to 1.9 per cent as the situation calmed.

If wider market volatility continues and investors push back their expectations for interest rate rises in the US and UK, then money could keep pouring into gilts, meaning that yields will keep tracking down.

Investors who have taken more risks with their money, putting it into, say, emerging market bonds, will have experienced a difficult week. According to JPMorgan, total returns on emerging market bonds denominated in local currencies are now down by 12 per cent in the year to date.

Nevertheless, it is notable that bonds have not experienced the same drama as equities, commodities and currencies. Where prices go from here will depend on what China and the US do next.

Will volatility delay an interest rate rise?

Regulators in the US and UK have dropped hints that the turmoil is likely to push back a rise in interest rates. Predictions that Federal Reserve would raise US interest rates in September are looking shaky: William Dudley, a top Fed official, told a conference this week that the case for tightening monetary policy as early as September  seem[s] less compelling to me than it was a few weeks ago,  though his comments were followed by stronger-than-expected economic data.

The speed of a UK rate rise had already been a matter of debate after only one member of the Bank of England s Monetary Policy Committee voted for a rise this month. The volatility on stock markets is likely to reinforce such a view.

Another reason to think rates may stay at their record lows is the recent drop in the oil price. Placing aside Thursday s  short squeeze , falling commodities prices mean economists are reviewing their earlier expectations of inflation rises towards the end of the year. For now, consumer price indices may well remain flat or even retreat into deflation territory, discouraging a rate boost.

What could this mean for the property market?

Mortgage lenders have been showing little consensus in recent days over the direction of the market. Ray Boulger, technical director at broker John Charcol, says:  Some lenders have been putting rates up a bit; some have been putting them down; some have been putting some up and some down. 

But in the medium term, the longer the wait for a Bank of England rate rise, the longer borrowers have to take advantage of record low interest rates on fixed-term mortgages.

 It does seem to me that the first rise in the bank rate has got to be put back, so from a cost point of view that has to be an advantage,  Mr Boulger says.

Property observers have speculated on the impact of Asian turmoil on the demand for top London property among overseas buyers, traditionally a key part of the capital s prime market. But rather than constraining demand, some believe the events of the past week will stoke it, much as the eurozone crisis of 2010 brought an influx of Italian, French and Greek buyers to London.

Grainne Gilmore, Knight Frank head of UK residential research, says there had been an intensification of interest from Chinese buyers.  The extra volatility has enhanced London s reputation as a safe haven property market.

But the effect would be small and balanced by slower wealth creation and lower levels of investment.  Ultimately, the net effect is likely to be neutral.

Big-data software company Splunk Inc. on Thursday gave an upbeat guidance for the current quarter and raised its revenue forecast for the year, as revenue jumped 46% in the July quarter.

Shares jumped 4.2% in recent after-hours trading.

For the current quarter, the company expects revenue between $158 million and $160 million, above analyst estimates of $155 million.

For the year, the company raised its revenue guidance to the range of $628 million to $632 million, from $610 million to $614 million.

While Splunk's revenue and customer base have been growing rapidly, the company has in the past struggled to post a profit.

Earlier this year, Splunk hired Snehal Antani as chief technology officer. Mr. Antani was previously with GE Capital. He replaced Todd Papaioannou, who left in November.

Over all, in the most recent quarter, Splunk reported a loss of $55.3 million, or 44 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $60.8 million, or 51 cents a share.

Excluding stock-based compensation and other items, the company reported a profit of 3 cents a share.

Revenue jumped to $148 million from $102 million a year ago.

Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected earnings of 2 cents a share and revenue of $140 million.

Blackstone Hunts for Commercial Property Opportunities in China;  Volatility can be your friend  if you have longer-term perspective, firm s Asia real-estate chief says

HONG KONG Blackstone Group LP is looking for buying opportunities in China's commercial property market amid slowing growth and market turbulence in the world's No. 2 economy.

Christopher Heady, head of the private-equity firm's closely watched Asia real-estate business, said employment remained high and the service sector healthy in certain Chinese markets despite the broader slowdown in growth.  People are still spending money and standards of living are improving," he said in an interview Wednesday.  We see over the medium to long term this trend as continuing."

That means choice properties in top-tier markets such as Beijing and Shanghai as well as in second-tier cities remain attractive, Mr. Heady said. The fund is less focused on less developed Chinese cities, which are more likely to be dependent on a single industry, he said.

 Volatility can be your friend if you have a medium to long term perspective," he said.  In public capital markets, when prices come down in theory that should create opportunities."

Blackstone is a "http://www.wsj.com/articles/blackstones-latest-fund-raises-14-5-billion-in-institutional-capital-1427734491" in Asia and abroad. Blackstone's Asia property fund, Blackstone Real Estate Partners Asia, is the region's largest, raising a total of $5 billion over four closings since 2013, according to industry data tracker Preqin. It has counted as partners major investors such as major domestic developer China Vanke Co. and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, China's currency-exchange agency.

Other developers have sounded cautious notes about the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-flood-economy-with-cash-as-global-markets-lose-faith-1440380912", which is set to grow at its slowest pace in 25 years. Those fears have sparked a global market selloff in recent days.

 You get pretty spooked by what's been happening. Could this trigger a wider issue in global financial markets?" said Mark Gabbay, chief executive at LaSalle Investment Management.  It hasn't impacted the real-estate market just yet, but it's a yellow flag."

"http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/08/25/global-markets-set-for-more-volatility-live-blog/" is making it difficult to sell assets in China now, Mr. Gabbay said, adding that risk premiums are rising as well.  Are we in crisis zone? Yes, but not long enough to make material changes to our portfolio," he said, adding that LaSalle Investment Management had already moderated its exposure in China to around 10% of its Asia portfolio in recent years as Japan and Australia looked more attractive.

Such volatility can lead to bottom-fishing opportunities, but only in select markets, said Goodwin Gaw, chairman of Hong Kong-based investor Gaw Capital Partners. Mr. Gaw echoed Mr. Heady in describing volatility as a  friend," adding that Gaw Capital has been cautious in China in the past few years as it focused on only select  trophy assets" and specific niche sectors such as logistics.

 If the recent volatility results in distressed situations with forced sale opportunities, then funds availability will actually increase rather than decrease," said Mr. Gaw.  U.S. is actually getting quite healthy and Europe stabilizing so China weaknesses could provide a window for Western investors to increase exposure into China."

China's commercial property market is "http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2015/07/22/chinas-latest-ground-zero-for-property-glut-shenyang/", according to Chinese government statistics.

Investment in office-building development rose more than 13% to 326.4 billion yuan ($50.92 billion) in the first seven months of 2015 from a year earlier, compared with growth of more than 21% for all of 2014.

Office-building construction starts fell nearly 15% to 32.96 million square meters in the first seven months of this year from the year-ago period, compared with 6.7% growth for all of last year.

Blackstone's Mr. Heady said recent market turmoil -which knocked China's main stock index down by more than one-fifth in four trading days alone -and a surprise devaluation of the yuan this month have had only a limited impact.

 More relevant to us is the real economy. There, frankly, we haven't seen a tremendous change over the past few months or at least in last couple of weeks of volatility," Mr. Heady said.  Our views remain fairly consistent as it relates to China. The economy is slowing down and I don't think that's a big surprise to anybody."

Blackstone is focusing on real-estate plays that focus on middle-class consumption, he said.

 There's going to be a series of bumps along the road as the economy transitions away from heavy fixed asset investment, which over time will have a diminishing return on investment," Mr. Heady said.  The result of that transition is the growth rate is overall slowing down. It's almost as if there's two-speed economy. Some parts are growing slower than others. The old economy sectors like industrials, commodity and heavy industries are suffering considerably right now."

China makes up around 40% of Blackstone's real-estate investments in Asia, with the rest in India, Japan, Australia and Singapore.

Nearly $250 billion has been invested into Chinese real estate from overseas in the past decade, of which development sites accounted for 75%, according to a recent report by investment management firm TH Real Estate, citing data from Real Capital Analytics. Investors from the U.S., including Blackstone, make up 7% of the inbound investment, the third-largest group behind Hong Kong's 70% and Singapore's 15%.

TIAA-CREF Teams Up With Swedish Pension Funds to Invest in European Property; Joint venture will combine $2.5 billion worth of 15 properties already owned by the firms

U.S. investor TIAA-CREF and Swedish National Pension Funds AP1 and AP2 have teamed up on European office investments.

Their joint venture will combine  ¬2.2 billion ($2.5 billion) worth of 15 properties already owned by the firms, and over the next three years will aim to buy another  ¬2 billion of office space.

By merging the property portfolios,  we're going to be able to diversity our European office portfolio without any more capital requirements," said Phil McAndrews, chief investment officer of TIAA-CREF Global Real Estate.

The groups plan to make further office acquisitions in Europe, focusing on London, Paris and cities across Germany.

 We believe there is a case for core assets in Europe," Mr. McAndrews said.

The tie-up comes amid a surge of demand for commercial property in Europe, where the pace of deal-making in the first half of this year was the strongest since 2007, according to Real Capital Analytics. Investors bought $49.4 billion of office properties in Europe in the first half of 2015, up 17% from the year before, data show.

Returns in real estate look attractive to investors facing low interest rates. In the London neighborhood of Mayfair, home to many of Europe's biggest hedge funds, the capitalization rate a measure of yield was at a historic low of 3.5% in June, according to real-estate broker Cushman & Wakefield. This is still above the yield on 10-year U.K. government bonds, which Tuesday was around 1.87%, according to Tradeweb.

The new investment vehicle, called Cityhold Office Partnership, will be managed by TH Real Estate, an overseas investment manager owned by TIAA-CREF, which has $86 billion of real-estate assets under management.

The funds will target core assets in major cities because  in the short term, our preference is liquidity," said Jasper Gilbey, director at TH Real Estate.

Investments can also branch out into areas that typically offer greater returns. The funds can be invested into leasing, renovation and development projects in London, Paris and Germany, as well as target core assets in cities like Madrid, Milan and Amsterdam.

AP1 and AP2 are two of five such funds in the Swedish pension system. Both funds have about 300 billion Swedish kronor ($36 billion) of assets under management.

Study Criticizes Slow 'Dark Pools'

By Bradley Hope

Dark pools' creaky infrastructure and slow computer systems are more of a threat to investors than the ultrafast traders that lately have fueled anxieties about the private trading venues, according to new research.

The technological shortcomings can cost mutual funds and hedge funds millions of dollars over time, New York research firm Tabb Group plans to say in a release Wednesday.

Tabb's study is one of the most detailed examinations yet of trading activity inside private trading venues run by banks and consortiums that operate away from exchanges and allow investors to trade with greater anonymity, at a lower cost and sometimes in bigger blocks.

The use of these venues is under increasing scrutiny as regulators negotiate settlements with Barclays, Credit Suisse Group AG and other large banks over improprieties in how they operated their dark pools, according to people familiar with the matter.

Tabb's research is based in part on more than 10 months of detailed trading data from Boston Company Asset Management LLC, an investment firm that managed about $44.4 billion as of the end of June. Boston Company has hired the Tabb Metrics data-driven analytics company created by Tabb Group to help analyze transaction costs for carrying out trades in the markets.

A group of researchers led by former Barclays PLC executives Linda Giordano and Jeff Alexander compared the time-stamped results from Boston Company's brokers with data from Thesys Technologies LLC, the technology arm of the high-frequency trading firm Tradeworx Inc.

What they found is the Boston Company's orders at times were getting filled at prices that were "suboptimal" in some dark pools, meaning they could potentially have gotten a better result if a trade was carried out more quickly.

The researchers said costs associated with weak infrastructure and slow processing were at times as much as 50 times higher than cases in which fast traders are able to find small opportunities to buy or sell stocks at better prices than other investors relying on slower data feeds.

David Brooks, the head trader at Boston Company, said the results appeared to confirm something his team had felt anecdotally for years: "It felt like there was a cost in trying to trade in the more than 40 venues across the market," he said.

Boston Company had persistent problems in some pools with a particular order type that was designed to achieve a buy or sell at the midpoint between the best bid and offer for a stock in the market, according to the study.

For instance, if a stock was offered to buy at $10 and for sale at $10.02, Boston Company might seek to obtain a midpoint purchase in a dark pool at $10.01.

But in the high-speed market, prices change rapidly and opportunities can easily be missed because of latency issues. If the market for that share rapidly changed to $9.99 to buy and $10.01 to sell, Boston Company would prefer to obtain the shares at the midpoint, $10. Slower pools might not update in time to get the better price.

Such dark pools gave suboptimal fills for trades as much as 24.7% of the time, according to the study.

Mr. Brooks said he had instructed his brokers to "deprioritize" some dark pools after seeing the results of the research and change some of the strategies.

While Tabb didn't identify the dark pools by name in the study, the researchers said they had already held meetings with several of the operators about the processing problems. Some of the operators said they were making changes to reduce the problem, they said.

Struggling Bond Market Presaged Stock Woes

By Gregory Zuckerman and Mike Cherney

As global stock markets tumble and analysts fret over the health of economies such as China and Brazil, bond investors are saying once again, we told you so.

Corporate-bond markets have been showing signs of weakness this summer, even before major stock indexes plunged in recent days. While there are no signs so far that the global stock rout is turning into a broader crisis, some analysts say the bond market often does a better job than the stock market anticipating economic turns and that investors should focus on debt-market trends for signs of when stability will return.

"Credit markets led stocks in 2000 and 2008," said James Bianco, president of Bianco Research LLC. He said credit spreads, reflecting companies' borrowing costs relative to the government's, have been widening, or increasing, for a year and are "showing no signs of stopping." Mr. Bianco added that "something is not right" in the world.

There are good reasons investors tended to ignore the warning signs from high-grade and junk bonds this year, despite the market's solid record of predicting problems. For one thing, stocks were climbing. And much of the troubles in corporate bonds seemed due to tumbling energy prices, which were pressuring debt of companies in that business. About 20% of the junk-bond market is made up of energy-related companies, according to some estimates.

Surging sales of corporate bonds amid low interest rates was another reason to ignore problems in the bond market. Some said price weakness was simply a result of this surge of supply. Meanwhile, investors have been favoring securities that offered higher yields than government debt and were snapping up new corporate bonds.

Still, the bond market's bearishness this year was corroborated by unease in various commodity markets, in which oil, copper and some other commodities have been under pressure for much of the year.

Now, some bond veterans say the softness in investment-grade and junk bonds was a canary in the coal mine and that bond investors, once again, have demonstrated an ability to anticipate global economic shifts better than stock investors.

"The equity market has been catching up with the sloppiness of the junk market," said Ken Monaghan, head of global high yield at Amundi Smith Breeden, which oversees about $9 billion.

As of Friday, U.S. junk bonds were down 0.07% on the year, a figure that reflects interest payments and price changes, according to the S&P U.S. Issued High Yield Corporate Bond Index. Yields have increased from about 6.5% at the beginning of the year to about 7.2% as of Friday, according to the index, indicating lower prices.

Junk bonds were down further early Monday. The SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond ETF, which tracks the market, had shed 0.6% at midday, according to FactSet.

Investors have acted accordingly, yanking about $3 billion from high-yield mutual funds this year, according to Thomson Reuters unit Lipper. Should the trend continue, it would be the third year in a row that investors pulled cash out of high-yield mutual funds. Before 2013, there hadn't been a net outflow in high-yield mutual funds since 2005, according to Lipper.

Veteran junk-bond analyst Martin Fridson, chief investment officer of Lehmann Livian Fridson Advisors LLC, says the high-yield market is close to fair value, but isn't at attractive levels. Junk bonds, which have yields almost six percentage points above comparable Treasury yields, would need to yield more than seven points before the junk market is a buy, Mr. Fridson says.

Defaults are also beginning to increase. The trailing 12-month default rate for high-yield firms globally increased to 2.4% in July from 2.3% in June, according to Moody's Investors Service. The oil and gas sector has accounted for a quarter of the year's defaults, with metals and mining recording 20% of defaults year to date.

"The high-yield bond market is past its prime as far as the current recovery is concerned," said John Lonski, chief financial-markets economist at Moody'sAnalytics. Still, Mr. Lonski said the junk-bond market isn't "flashing red" yet. Moody's is predicting that the global default rate will end 2015 at 2.7%, which would be below the historical average of 4.5%. "It's more flashing amber," Mr. Lonski said. "But again, this is no time for complacency."

Splenda Sweetener Getting a New Owner; J&J unit agrees to sell consumer sucralose brand to Heartland Food

The artificial sweetener brand Splenda is changing hands, as Heartland Food Products Group agreed to buy it from a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson.

Financial terms weren't disclosed. Heartland said private-equity firm Centerbridge Partners LP assisted in sealing the deal and would become a shareholder in Heartland after the acquisition is completed.

Splenda sweetener products contain sucralose, a no-calorie sweetener. The brand, known for its yellow packaging with blue lettering, can be used as a substitute for sugar.

Johnson & Johnson's McNeil Nutritionals unit is selling the rights to the Splenda brand that consumers buy in groceries or use at restaurants and coffee shops. Tate & Lyle PLC, which helped discover sucralose in the 1970s, will retain the rights to use the Splenda brand name when sucralose it manufactures is used as an ingredient in food and drink products, according to people familiar with the brand.

Many of Tate & Lyle's patents for sucralose ended almost a decade ago, allowing manufacturers around the world to produce the sweetener. One of those is Heartland, which already makes sucralose, as well as stevia, saccharin, aspartame and other sweeteners.

Acquiring Splenda would allow Heartland to use the brand on packaging of sucralose it already produces. The company, based outside Indianapolis, said the acquisition is expected to result in more than 100 new jobs across its manufacturing, distribution and corporate operations.

Johnson & Johnson said that the sale was part of its ongoing strategy to concentrate on key consumer areas such as baby care, pain care and oral care. The transaction is expected to close before year-end.

The sale comes at a time of rising consumer awareness of artificial sweeteners, a $2 billion industry, according to the analytics firm IHS Chemical. This month, PepsiCo Inc. rolled out a new version of Diet Pepsi that substitutes sucralose for aspartame, an artificial sweetener better known as Equal and NutraSweet. PepsiCo said the change was prompted by consumer desire for aspartame-free diet soda.

A 2005 study by the European Ramazzini Foundation of Italy labeled aspartame a carcinogen, stoking consumer concern about the sweetener. But the Food and Drug Administration later discredited the study and the European Food and Safety Association in 2013 ruled out any associated risk of genetic damage or cancer from aspartame.

The change at Diet Pepsi positioned the soda opposite aspartame-sweetened Diet Coke. Coca-Cola continues to stand by that ingredient, which helps give Diet Coke the distinctive taste that has made it the top-selling diet soda in the U.S.

Sucralose remains one of the largest sweeteners by volume, but there has been increasing competition in the category from Chinese companies like Niutang Chemical Plant Co. and JK Sucralose Inc. Tate & Lyle this year announced it planned to restructure its sucralose division and make Splenda sucralose a  low-cost and sustainable business."

Heartland's pending acquisition of Splenda for consumers could further cut into Tate & Lyle's sweetener sales, which declined 15% in the year ending March 31. Tate & Lyle sells sucralose it makes to Johnson & Johnson, which uses it in the Splenda packets and zip-seal pouches it sells to restaurants and grocers.

Salesforce.com Unveils Software for Wealth-Management Advisers; Salesforce Financial Services Cloud is part of firm s effort to target high-value industries

How does a business software company keep growing after it has pushed into a wide swath of offices with general-purpose tools? Go vertical.

Salesforce.com Inc., which makes software used by salespeople to keep tabs on clients and prospects, on Tuesday announced a variant of its sales-management tools tailored for a specific industry: wealth management.

In the past, Salesforce has expanded from sales into other horizontal categories like customer service, marketing and business analytics, all sold by subscription over the Web. The new offering, called Salesforce Financial Services Cloud, is the first fruit of an effort to target high-value industries.

The company is moving into vertical markets as revenue growth of its flagship sales software has lagged that of its newer services.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff and President Keith Block last year signaled their plans to focus on specific industries. The company has pushed to get its software into government agencies and said it was considering specialized services for health care and life sciences.

Mr. Block last week told analysts the focus on vertical industries was undertaken  very carefully and very thoughtfully."

Some other business-technology companies, including file-sharing service Box Inc. and human-resources software firm TriNet Group Inc., also are tailoring their software by industry.

Salesforce isn't asking brokers to ditch their existing software. Rather, it is pitching Salesforce Financial Services Cloud as a way to knit together programs that advisers currently use to, say, rebalance clients' investment portfolios or keep tabs on their financial goals.

Salesforce officials echoing many brokers and financial-management professionals say wealth-management companies must adjust as younger people grow up and demand new kinds of services. The industry now is  a bunch of 55-year-old men selling to a bunch of 55-year-old men," Simon Mulcahy, Salesforce's senior vice president of financial services, said in an interview.

The new software was many months in the making, Mr. Mulcahy said. The company sought extensive consultation with wealth-management firms and interviewed millennials about what they wanted from their financial and professional advisers.

Still, Salesforce's newest service is a work in progress. Company representatives on Monday told journalists that the name had shifted from the brand Mr. Mulcahy initially discussed,  Salesforce Wealth Cloud."

CFO Journal: Chief Accountants Are Adding Up

By Kimberly S. Johnson 
813 words
25 August 2015
The Wall Street Journal
J
B5

Copyright  2015, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 

There's a new VIP in the corporate finance department: the chief accounting officer.

These senior-level accountants have long been a fixture at large multinational companies. But, thanks to the cost and intricacies of today's regulatory and accounting requirements, their numbers have multiplied and their duties have expanded beyond managing their company's books and preparing financial statements.

"The [chief financial officer] can't individually do it all, but running the stress tests" to predict the impact of regulatory changes, "that's my responsibility," said MetLife Inc. Chief Accounting Officer Peter Carlson. "It allows [the CFO] to do more externally and strategically."

Since 2009, there's been nearly a 40% rise in the number of chief accounting officer titles, according to findings from Russell Reynolds Associates.

Companies are "looking for a higher level of strategic chief accounting officer," said Kristi Walters, executive director of executive recruiting firm's CFO practice. They "need someone who's willing to stand up and debate or give other ideas," about the best way to balance the spreadsheet, Ms. Walters said.

As the CFO's right hand, accounting chiefs are tackling thorny issues, such as when and how to recognize revenue, or how to report to quarterly numbers to comply with both U.S. and foreign standards.

They are also taking on new burdens. Like Metlife's Mr. Carlson, many accounting chiefs attest to the accuracy of their company's financial filings. Their signature on these documents makes them liable -- along with the CFO and chief executive -- if the numbers turn out to be false.

Making heavy-hitting specialists more accountable for financial reporting might be having a positive effect. Since 2005, the number of large companies warning regulators that their prior financial statements might not be valid dropped 90%, according to data and research firm Audit Analytics. That suggests improvement in the safeguards companies use to prevent fraud and miscalculations.

Companies are placing heavier emphasis on such internal controls since the Sarbanes-Oxley corporate-governance law of 2002, "so all of a sudden you're going to have to have someone with more skills to handle it," said Don Whalen director of research for Audit Analytics.

At many companies, the accounting chief's job has broadened to include multiple types of accounting. Mr. Carlson's job at MetLife changed in 2010 when the company acquired a foreign life insurance unit from American International Group for $16.2 billion. Now, a third of MetLife's operating profit comes from outside the U.S. Keeping financial records that comply with accounting and insurance rules in the U.S as well as international standards adds to the complexity, he said.

So, too, does doing business with the federal government, which requires its own form of accounting, said Barbara Niland, CFO of shipbuilder Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. This month the company promoted Assistant Controller Nicolas Schuck, to accounting chief.

Ms. Niland says that having a chief accounting officer frees her up to develop strategy and interact with the board and investors.

While some companies consider controllers akin to chief accounting officers, a controller doesn't always fit the bill. "I think what happened over the last 15 years is that the accounting function started to separate from the controller function," said Gary Kabureck, former chief accounting officer at Xerox Corp.

During his 12 years as chief accounting officer, a separate controller focused on budgeting and planning, while Mr. Kabureck was responsible for the nuts and bolts of global bookkeeping.

He also attended every meeting of the board's audit committee and wrote more than two dozen comment letters to standard-setters such as the Financial Accounting Standards Board.

"My job was to know the finer points of generally accepted accounting principles," said Mr. Kabureck, now a member of the International Accounting Standards Board, which sets financial reporting rules for more than 100 countries.

"The role needed someone diplomatic, with a backbone. I was the signing officer; I was the first one going down if things blew up," he said.

As the cost of regulatory compliance and the consequences of a slip-up mount, many companies are willing to pay six to seven figures a year for a top-notch accountant in exchange for peace of mind.

Simone Lagomarsino, chief executive of Calif.-based Heritage Oaks Bancorp, said that so far this year it is spending four times as much as last year on compliance and risk management to cope with an increase in mortgage and banking requirements.

Last week Heritage promoted controller and chief accounting officer Jason Castle to CFO. Mr. Castle said his time as the company's lead accountant gives him a deep understanding of the controls involved in steering a regional bank in a highly regulated environment.

Markets
Bonds Market Saw Global Selloff Coming; Some bond veterans say softness in investment-grade and junk bonds was  canary in the coal mine 

 As "http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-stocks-set-to-tumble-again-as-global-market-selloff-continues-1440418890" and analysts fret over "http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-aftershocks-could-stay-feds-hand-1440446394" bond investors are saying once again, we told you so.

Corporate-bond markets have been showing signs of weakness this summer, even before major stock indexes plunged in recent days. While there are no signs so far that the global stock rout is turning into a broader crisis, some analysts say the bond market often does a better job than the stock market anticipating economic turns and that investors should focus on debt-market trends for signs of when stability will return.

 Credit markets led stocks in 2000 and 2008," said James Bianco, president of Bianco Research LLC. He said credit spreads, reflecting companies' borrowing costs relative to the government's, have been widening, or increasing, for a year and are  showing no signs of stopping." Mr. Bianco added that  something is not right" in the world.

There are good reasons investors tended to ignore the warning signs from high-grade and junk bonds this year, despite the market's solid record of predicting problems. For one thing, stocks were climbing. And much of the troubles in corporate bonds seemed due to tumbling energy prices, which were pressuring debt of companies in that business. About 20% of the junk-bond market is made up of energy-related companies, according to some estimates.

Surging sales of corporate bonds amid low interest rates was another reason to ignore problems in the bond market. Some said price weakness was simply a result of this surge of supply. Meanwhile, investors have been favoring securities that offered higher yields than government debt and were snapping up new corporate bonds.

Still, the bond market's bearishness this year was corroborated by unease in various commodity markets, in which oil, copper and some other commodities have been under pressure for much of the year.

Now, some bond veterans say the softness in investment-grade and junk bonds was a canary in the coal mine and that bond investors, once again, have demonstrated an ability to anticipate global economic shifts better than stock investors.

 The equity market has been catching up with the sloppiness of the junk market," said Ken Monaghan, head of global high yield at Amundi Smith Breeden, which oversees about $9 billion.

Junk-bond prices began falling in April, decreasing roughly 5.7% from 101.1 cents on the dollar to 95.3 cents on Friday, according to Barclays figures. Stocks, however, kept rising. By mid-May, the S&P 500 was up 3.5% on the year to 2130.82, though the stock index is down 11.2% since then, to 1893.21.

As of Friday, U.S. junk bonds were down 0.07% on the year, a figure that reflects interest payments and price changes, according to the S&P U.S. Issued High Yield Corporate Bond Index. Yields have increased from about 6.5% at the beginning of the year to about 7.2% as of Friday, according to the index, indicating lower prices.

Junk bonds were down further on Monday. The SPDR Barclays High Yield Bond ETF, which tracks the market, shed 1.2% Monday, according to FactSet.

Some junk bonds have fared better than others. As of Friday, bonds from energy companies are down 10.1% this year, reflecting price changes and interest payments. But debt from junk-rated firms excluding energy are up 1.8%, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices. Yields on energy bonds have soared to 12.1% from 9.1% at the end of last year, but excluding energy firms, yields are a more modest 6.4%, up from 6%.

Rising yields have put a damper on bond issuance, with junk-rated oil and gas firms selling $31.2 billion in new debt so far this year, compared with $41.5 billion at this time last year. Companies in other sectors have sold $180.4 billion, compared with $183.7 billion at this time last year, according to Dealogic figures.

Investors have acted accordingly, yanking about $3 billion from high-yield mutual funds this year, according to Thomson Reuters unit Lipper. Should the trend continue, it would be the third year in a row that investors pulled cash out of high-yield mutual funds. Before 2013, there hadn't been a net outflow in high-yield mutual funds since 2005, according to Lipper.

Veteran junk-bond analyst Martin Fridson, chief investment officer of Lehmann Livian Fridson Advisors LLC, says the high-yield market is close to fair value, but isn't at attractive levels. Junk bonds, which have yields almost six percentage points above comparable Treasury yields, would need to yield more than seven points before the junk market is a buy, Mr. Fridson says.

Defaults are also beginning to increase. The trailing 12-month default rate for high-yield firms globally increased to 2.4% in July from 2.3% in June, according to Moody's Investors Service. The oil and gas sector has accounted for a quarter of the year's defaults, with metals and mining recording 20% of defaults year to date.

 The high-yield bond market is past its prime as far as the current recovery is concerned," said John Lonski, chief financial-markets economist at Moody'sAnalytics.

Still, Mr. Lonski said the junk-bond market isn't  flashing red" yet. Moody's is predicting that the global default rate will end 2015 at 2.7%, which would be below the historical average of 4.5%.

 It's more flashing amber," Mr. Lonski said.  But again, this is no time for complacency."

J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley to Form Data Company; Entity would consolidate efforts to clean and store reference data, helping banks save money, sources say

Wall Street is giving its data a deep clean.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group and Morgan Stanley are working to create a company that will pull together and clean reams of reference data at a lower cost than what they would spend individually, according to people familiar with the matter.

The new entity, which will create a stream of consistent data that banks use to help determine pricing and transaction costs, is the latest example of increasingly cost-conscious banks coming together to save on head count, expenses and time.

Growing pressures on bank profits are prompting the firms to seek new ways to save money, including partnerships they may haven't considered a decade ago.

The initiative is currently dubbed  SPReD", which stands for Securities Product Reference Data, and is likely to be launched as a new entity in the next six to 12 months, the people said. Each founding bank is investing  seven figures" for the entity, the people said.

The company will work specifically with reference data on financial instruments, including identifiers like names, codes and symbols that each institution already buys. It will start with listed derivatives and equity data, with fixed income-related data added later.

The project would consolidate efforts to clean and store the vast amount of data, centralizing a function that many banks have previously done individually, with some housing data in a variety of units within their organization.

Banks typically use market data from vendors and glean it from public sources, run it through their systems and  scrub" the data to get so-called  golden copies" that are consistent and ready for use across the business, one of these people said. That consistent data can help save on transaction costs across the organization.

The banks selected SmartStream Technologies ltd. last year after soliciting bids and ideas for the structure of the new entity from firms that provide outsourcing and other middle and back-office services.

They plan to spin off a portion of SmartStream's business, including some existing reference data clients, into the new entity, with the consortium of banks taking a stake.

Wall Street's largest firms have increasingly joined forces since the financial crisis to create new entities that help them save money, meet regulatory needs or challenge incumbents.

Still, these efforts often face challenges in negotiating how proprietary information will be treated and protected, balancing the interests of rival financial firms that are investing in them and working with existing vendors who fear a change in the status quo will eat into their revenue.

It is also difficult to get a majority of big banks to sign up for a utility at the get-go, because of those risks and the high cost of spearheading. Corporations have also grown increasingly wary of relinquishing control of critical data to third-party entities because of cybersecurity fears.

With revenues under pressure since the financial crisis and expenses growing as a result of new regulations, banks have sought new ways to save money by working together.

Noninterest expenses, which include salaries, investments in technology and compliance costs, at the six biggest U.S. banks by assets rose 11.9% from 2009 to 2014, according to the banks' filings. That group includes J.P. Morgan, Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Wells Fargo & Co., Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.

Data management spending has usually been in the multiple tens of millions of dollars, sometimes up to hundreds of millions depending on the size of the large bank, said Omer Sohail, who leads the U.S. banking and securities analytics team at Deloitte Consulting LLP.

The new entity will create tailored data feeds for each client using existing sources of data that firms receive from a variety of vendors. Each bank or client will continue to negotiate those data vendor relationships themselves.

Earlier this year J.P. Morgan created a central system within the bank that pulled streams of reference data from all of its providers into one hub, a person familiar with the process said. The new entity will take over scrubbing reference data for the bank, ultimately feeding it back into J.P. Morgan's system, as part of its cost savings initiative.

Using consistent data allows the banks to form accurate pricing for trades and can be essential for risk and compliance reviews that could arise.

This comes amid a push by large U.S. and European banks, under growing regulatory and cost pressures to collaborate more than they have in the past.

Last August, six big banks and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. formed a new entity to pull together client data to meet more stringent know-your-customer regulations.

Symphony Communications Services, LLC, is another closely watched consortium-backed project on Wall Street. A group of 14 large banks and asset managers formed the company last year, and it then"http://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-led-group-of-financial-firms-buys-perzo-1412176909"Perzo Inc. The company's secure messaging service is seen as an alternative to costly Bloomberg terminals and it is currently working to raise additional capital.

Goldman Sachs also previously led a collateral management initiative called  Project Colin" that involved several other financial services firms. The group working on that project also considered creating a new entity, but decided instead to use services from fintech startup AcadiaSoft earlier this year.

As part of that collateral management initiative, BNP Paribas SA, Citigroup, Socit Gnrale SA, UBS Group AG, ICAP PLC, The Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. and Euroclear invested in AcadiaSoft in July, joining nine existing bank investors.

 Rather than upgrade their internal systems individually, they are looking at what shared services can be brought to the market that can be implemented once," said Chris Walsh, who was named chief executive of AcadiaSoft at the time of the new investments.

NATIONAL NEWS
Statistics agency struggles to make move from London to Wales add up; ONS review: Former BoE deputy tipped to recommend return of high-level presence in capital

The Newport headquarters of the Office for National Statistics is a nondescript office block in a windy industrial park on the outskirts of the Welsh port. For its critics, this drab location has become an emblem of the ONS's distance from economic professionals in the City and policymakers at the Bank of England and the Treasury.

Sir Charlie Bean, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, has been tasked by the government to lead a farreaching review into the organisation after a series of controversies, from its accounting treatment of quantitative easing, to errors in key statistics to its almost universally-criticised website.

The review, billed as a move to "futureproof" economic statistics for a digital era, will assess whether the UK's statistics are relevant, robust and credible.

But within the overarching remit, Sir Charlie is tipped to make a simple geographical recommendation: the reestablishment of a high-level presence in London, in both a practical and symbolic move to bring the organisation closer to its most prominent users.

The ONS's move out the capital in the late 2000s was part of the Labour government's drive to shift large numbers of civil service jobs out of the south-east.

Most other government departments kept their policy advisers and most senior staff in London, moving only branches with specific functions. But the ONS embarked on a wholesale relocation to the Newport office.

Staff there praise the work-life balance and the surrounding countryside, but that was not enough to stop about 90 per cent of the London-based staff deciding to quit rather than move to south Wales. Many joined the Treasury and BoE, forcing the ONS to rebuild its knowledge base.

That task has been made all the more difficult in an era of dual-income households because of the lack of other large employers in Newport, say critics, meaning the ONS has struggled to recruit the right staff. Others lament the lack of once-common rotations and secondments between the ONS, BoE and Treasury, which enabled the sharing of knowledge and advice. These have dwindled to a trickle because of the long journey.

Last but not least, the financial crash ushered in an era of budgetary cuts, just as the ONS needed to adapt to the accelerating big data movement and the switch to online services.

Investment has been squeezed and staff morale is suffering, with only 20 per cent telling the annual civil service people survey they believed their pay was reasonable compared with people doing a similar job in other organisations.

Since 2008-09, funding for the organisation has been reduced by 30 per cent in real terms, leading John Pullinger, the national statistician, to warn of a "critical need" to review the financing of statistics.

Within the old-school office shell, there are modern touches: open-plan seating, a Costa Coffee concession and posters promoting new initiatives, but senior figures recognise that more than cosmetic upgrades are needed.

In his foreword to the ONS's formal business plan - motto: "better statistics, better decisions" - Mr Pullinger warned bluntly of the risks if the organisation did not evolve. The ONS could "become irrelevant as decision makers consider that our services are no longer helpful to them" or be "unable to change fast enough to reflect the imperatives of the data revolution".

Jonathan Athow, the deputy national statistician in charge of economic data, who joined this year in a shake-up of senior management, is one of the new guard driving change. Formerly of HM Revenue & Customs and the Treasury, Mr Athow told the FT it was time for the ONS to "be more on the front foot", adding he hoped the Bean review would conclude the organisation was making strides but needed to move "further and faster".

Top of Mr Athow's in-tray is the requirement to make better and more efficient use of data collected by the government for other purposes. The statistical office sends out 45,000 monthly surveys to companies to gather key data that feed into the national statistics; last week it announced plans to harvest data directly from HMRC's value added tax returns, which it estimates could halve the number of surveys it needs to send.

However, progress remains agonisingly slow: the transition from paper to electronic forms is expected to take four years.

Concerns about both the new and existing IT systems are also widespread.

The other new deputy national statistician, Heather Savory, a former chairwoman of the Open Data User Group, told her first meeting of the UK Statistics Authority Board that a "complete upgrade" of the ONS technology platform was needed.

And while the ONS has established a big data team, its pilot projects - including scraping price data from supermarkets and investigating whether geolocated data from Twitter can give fresh insights into internal migration - are still in the very early stages.

The question now is whether reestablishing a presence in London, improving the ONS's performance and digital presence, and focusing more on explaining numbers rather than just producing them can all be achieved without spending more money or cutting the volume of statistical output.

WSJ.D Technology: Samsung Tries to Revive Phone Sales --- Smartphone maker unveils pay service, bigger screens in bid to answer Apple, others

Samsung Electronics Co. is leaning on bigger screens and a mobile payment system to try to fend off competition from rivals like Apple Inc. as it battles declining market share in a rapidly slowing smartphone market.

The South Korean company on Thursday unveiled in New York a pair of new devices, including a large-screen variation on its Galaxy S6 Edge flagship handset. So fierce is the competition with Apple that Samsung moved up its event by several weeks to avoid a direct confrontation with Apple, which typically plans a September event to introduce its latest iPhone.

Samsung's Galaxy S6 Edge, first launched in April, was initially a hit with consumers, but the company wasn't able to fully capitalize on the device's popularity due to a misreading of market demand and difficulties in ramping up production of curved screens.

Its latest model, known as the Galaxy S6 Edge+, is an effort to regain momentum for its premium smartphones (roughly defined as $450 or more), which drive the bulk of profits in Samsung's mobile division.

Samsung's mobile division has been hit hard as once-explosive growth in the global smartphone market begins to cool. In the second quarter, global smartphone shipments rose 15%, their slowest pace in six years, according to data tracker Strategy Analytics.

Even after the release of the Galaxy S6 Edge earlier this year and its flat-screen counterpart the Galaxy S6, Samsung suffered a 38% drop in operating profit during the second quarter from a year earlier. Its quarterly mobile profits are now less than half what they were just two years ago, at the peak of the company's mobile dominance in 2013.

Compounding the pain, Samsung has lost market share in the wake of last year's release of two hit Apple products, the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus with its larger screen. Those products cut deeply into Samsung's dominant position in larger-size premium handsets -- a corner of the market that it had mostly to itself.

Strategy Analytics said Samsung's market share fell to 21.2% in the second quarter, while Apple, and Chinese competitors like Huawei Technologies Co. and Xiaomi Corp. each gained ground.

On Thursday, Samsung also formally launched its mobile-payment service, Samsung Pay, an attempt to compete with Apple, Google Inc. and others on mobile payments. The service is compatible with the three Galaxy S6 smartphones and the new Galaxy Note. It will allow consumers to pay for purchases with their phones at the checkout line.

Like Apple Pay, the Samsung service relies on the traditional payment networks, allowing people to use their existing card accounts. And while Apple's offering only works with next-generation readers, Samsung Pay also can be used at checkout counters that use traditional magnetic-strip card readers.

Samsung said the payment service will launch in the U.S. on Sept. 28, after rolling out in Korea on Aug. 20.

Its new mobile offering is an attempt to ride its lead in curved screens during a year when Apple is likely to offer only incremental design changes to its existing iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus devices, said Daniel Gleeson, a senior analyst at IHS Technology.

The Galaxy S6 Edge+ brings the number of Samsung's flagship smartphones this year to three. Samsung also unveiled Thursday the Galaxy Note 5, the fifth iteration in a line of oversize smartphones.

"By bringing out a larger version of the S6 Edge, Samsung is trying to compete with Apple more effectively in that space," Mr. Gleeson said.

On Thursday, Samsung also sought to reposition the Galaxy Note as a productivity-focused device for business consumers. It will offer a detachable hard keyboard, similar to the BlackBerry, once hugely popular among office workers.

Samsung has also created a feature called SideSync, which allows consumers to sync messages across phones and computers using Windows or Apple's operating systems. It also teamed up with YouTube to launch a live streaming feature to its camera, called Live Broadcast.

The company teased the coming launch of a smartwatch, called Samsung Gear S2. That device will be unveiled at an event in Berlin on Sept. 3.

Both phones will be available in the U.S. and Canada on Aug. 21 and online presales began Thursday.

Edward Jones Fined by SEC --- Firm to pay $20 million to settle charges it overcharged municipal- bond buyers

By Aaron Kuriloff

The Securities and Exchange Commission, moving against abusive practices in the municipal-bond industry, penalized a major brokerage firm for overcharging customers.

Edward Jones will pay $20 million to settle charges that the St. Louis-based firm and Stina R. Wishman, the former head of its municipal underwriting desk, improperly sold new bonds to customers at prices higher than those negotiated with bonds' issuers, the SEC said. The agency said the firm's practice cost customers at least $4.6 million.

It is the SEC's first pricing-related case against an underwriter selling new municipal securities.

Edward Jones and Ms. Wishman settled without admitting or denying the SEC's findings. An Edward Jones spokesman said the firm will fully compensate the 13,000 current and former clients who were overcharged between 2009 and 2013. The firm said it cooperated fully with the SEC investigation and has taken steps to enhance its municipal-bond business.

A lawyer representing Ms. Wishman couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

Some analysts said the case opens a new front for the SEC's enforcement efforts in the sale of bonds backed by state and local government-related entities, showing a changing focus from problems related to disclosure to those related to pricing. SEC commissioners Luis Aguilar, Daniel Gallagher, Kara Stein and Michael Piwowar said in a statement the case illustrates the need for better rules on transparency in bond pricing.

"The Commission's recent enforcement action against [Edward Jones] involving the offer and sale of municipal bonds to retail investors highlights the need for clear rules requiring the disclosure of mark-ups and mark-downs," they wrote, urging the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board to complete rules mandating increased price transparency. "If not, we believe the Commission should propose rules to address this important issue," they wrote.

Chairwoman Mary Jo White said in June 2014 that the SEC would work with Finra and the MSRB on rules for increased pricing transparency, saying the importance of such disclosure was greater in the current low interest-rate environment, where brokers' compensation can measurably impact investors' returns.

"This information should help customers assess the reasonableness of their dealer's compensation and should deter overcharging," she said.

Small investors make up around 70% of the $3.7 trillion municipal bond market, either individually or through mutual funds. But researchers have found that significant markups persist on municipal bonds sold to retail investors, long after similar practices in other markets have largely been swept aside by changing technology, competition and enforcement efforts.

Elaine Greenberg, partner in the securities litigation, investigations and enforcement practice at Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe LLP, said the case sends a message to municipal-market participants that the SEC is on the hunt for violations of securities law or MSRB regulations in both the primary and secondary markets.

"They're really looking at all aspects of the market, whether it's disclosure, market structure or pricing," she said. Ms. Greenberg previously served as head of the SEC's specialized unit on municipal securities and public pensions.

The SEC said that Edward Jones took new bonds into inventory, then wrongly sold them to customers at higher prices.

In some cases, the firm didn't offer the bonds to its customers until secondary trading began, then sold them at inflated prices. The SEC also charged the firm with failing to adequately supervise some secondary-market trades.

The settlement includes about $5.2 million in payments to current and former customers who were overcharged, the SEC said. Ms. Wishman agreed to pay $15,000 and will be barred from working in the securities industry for at least two years. Edward Jones now discloses the percentage and dollar amount of markups on all fixed-income trade confirmations to retail customers, the SEC said.

"It's a very visible and painful warning that will put a fire under other firms that aren't fully compliant with SEC rules," said Matt Fabian, partner at Concord, Mass.-based research firm Municipal Market Analytics. "It's important that customers have faith in the prices on municipal bonds offered for sale."

The SEC called the municipal-bond market "illiquid and opaque" in a 2012 report and called for greater protections for investors.

The report said transaction costs and markups are typically higher for individual investors than for institutions, unlike in U.S. equity markets, and some studies have shown that "the opacity of the market contributes to the relatively higher prices paid by retail investors."

Andrew Ceresney, director of the SEC's Enforcement Division, said Thursday's move demonstrates the SEC's commitment to maintaining the integrity of the market, which he called critical to financing U.S. infrastructure such as bridges and schools.

"It also further illustrates our continued focus on the municipal market and ensuring that participants in this market follow all legal requirements," he said.

Goldman to Give Out Trading 'Secret Sauce'

By Justin Baer

In a major shift for Goldman Sachs Group Inc., the firm is preparing to give away some of the "secret sauce" behind its trading ideas.

Goldman will soon offer clients access to more of its in-house tools, such as high-powered databases that analyze markets and manage risk, according to the firm's executives. Those proprietary systems have long been key elements enabling Goldman to sidestep market turmoil and ring up outsize profits in better conditions.

Given direct access to these tools, Goldman clients could use the technology to build their own trading systems and potentially make purchases independent of the firm.

But the firm's executives believe the upside outweighs those concerns. Goldman is betting that its clients, such as hedge funds and other money managers, will use the individual applications, or apps, to develop strategies and then execute their trades with the firm.

By deepening ties with those clients, Goldman hopes it will pick up other business from them as well.

The development has been a centerpiece of a new technology strategy developed by R. Martin Chavez, the firm's chief information officer.

Goldman, like other big banks, is facing a raft of new regulations and an unyielding shift toward electronic markets. Both promised to crimp profits, and the firm felt it needed to adapt.

Historically, Goldman clients could contact the firm and ask it to create customized investment strategies using its proprietary research and analytical tools. Now Goldman is rolling out the apps, that let clients access those analytics from their own desktops via a Web-based platform, the people said.

The new Web-based platform is in many ways an attempt by Goldman to bolster its technology bona fides.

In recent years, Goldman caught flak in the tech community for helping to prosecute one of its programmers for allegedly stealing trading code. That protective stance appeared to present a contrast to tech giants such as Google Inc. and Facebook Inc., which have opened their software to outside developers and racked up profits.

"Everyone looked to the West Coast, and saw how Silicon Valley" was sharing information and making use of their analytic capabilities, said Mr. Chavez in an interview.

Goldman plans to let clients customize the new apps and integrate them into their own systems, he said.

Most details of Goldman's strategy haven't been previously reported. Some of the apps have been available in pilot programs, but they will be rolled out more broadly over time.

Some outsiders and Goldman alumni question whether the firm will win enough client business to justify sharing more of its analytics with clients. Others, including some rivals, are skeptical Goldman will give clients complete access to its in-house tools. Some analysts and Goldman clients say the move conceptually makes sense.

"This is the business of the future," said Richard Prager, head of global trading at BlackRock Inc., the world's biggest money manager, with almost $5 trillion in assets. "Wall Street firms have got to reinvent themselves."

The first apps in development are designed to serve money managers, pensions, hedge funds and other clients of the firm's equities and fixed-income trading businesses, according to people familiar with the matter. The apps are an extension of an internal software platform, called Marquee, that Mr. Chavez conceived years ago.

Goldman also aims to create Marquee-based applications for customers of its other divisions, including investment banking, the people said.

One of the first apps, called Simon, provides tools that allow smaller brokers to create and analyze equity-linked derivatives for their retail clients.

Goldman officials have said 20 firms signed up for a pilot program that began in early 2014. That program helped more than double the firm's sales of U.S. equity-linked notes last year, people familiar with the matter said.

A second app, Strategy Studio, aims to help money managers devise quantitative investments based on their views on broad economic themes.

Reuters previously reported the launch of a Marquee-based product to help clients execute block trades.

Aside from Marquee, Goldman has considered commercializing and ultimately spinning out other programs, including Lagoon, a program that allows employees to access business applications on their mobile phone securely, and Orbit, an email service, people familiar with the matter said.

"We're constantly asking ourselves about all of it," Mr. Chavez said. "Is this software better for clients and the planet if it's inside Goldman? Or is it better if we extend the platform to clients, or in some cases does a spinout into open source or a company make more sense?"

Goldman's analytics, headlined by a risk-management database called SecDb that will be more widely available to clients, have long been admired across Wall Street for helping make it the industry's most-profitable securities firm.

Forged in the wake of Goldman's struggles with bond-trading losses in the 1990s, and made possible by steady advancements in computer power, SecDb allowed Goldman to look across its trading and lending activities to unearth hidden risks.

The modern-day SecDb calculates 23 billion prices across 2.8 million positions and 500,000 market scenarios, Goldman President Gary Cohn said at a June investor conference. He called the database "a significant competitive advantage."

Mr. Chavez, who was promoted from co-head of equities to chief information officer in 2013, was behind the idea to share the firm's tools more broadly with clients. He says the plan won the support of firm's senior executives.

Regulators put dark pools back in the dock; Analysis: Trading room

SEC's likely $20m fine for agency broker ITG intensifies scrutiny of block trading

Michael Lewis's book Flash Boys promised to expose the world of highfrequency trading, but attention has focused on the share-trading venues known as "dark pools".

US markets regulators are set to impose a record fine of about $20m on Investment Technology Group, an agency broker, to resolve allegations that it failed to disclose information about order types to the various investment groups that were buying and selling shares on its private venue.

The scale of the pending fine propels ITG to the top of a growing list of alternative trading venues that have been punished for infractions.

Venues are promoted as a way for asset managers to trade large blocks of shares without moving the market price. More than a third of daily US trading is executed away from public exchanges, and regulators are concerned that public markets may no longer reflect up-to-date information.

Exchanges say dark pools use reference prices from public markets that then lose the business. Trade sizes in dark pools have dropped to the point where they are indistinguishable from transactions on public markets.

As the list of punishments grows, operators and their users are left with an uneasy pact. Given its status, ITG's transgression is a particular blow for the industry. "As one of the largest 'agency only' asset managers, they were held to a higher standard," says Larry Tabb, chief executive of Tabb, a US capital markets consultancy.

ITG provides industry trading technology, and its analytics had access to many asset managers' order books, he adds. "So to hear that ITG even had thoughts of leveraging parent order information for its own gain really surprised and shocked many clients."

The Securities and Exchange Commission settled early cases, with Pipeline and Liquidnet agreeing to pay fines of a couple of million dollars.

Since last year's publication of Mr Lewis's book, the crackdown has stepped up a notch. UBS was fined $14.4m in January and ITG is set to raise the bar. The New York attorney-general has alleged that Barclays favoured some high-speed traders using its dark pool trading venue while misleading institutional investors. The bank denies the allegations. And last week Hong Kong regulators fined BNP Paribas for failing to disclose information to investors.

The crackdown has stirred up debate about ways to improve the market, beyond higher standards and transparency of operators. Mr Tabb has argued for a series of technological improvements, including standardising and synchronising timestamps, and greater transparency on how client orders are routed through the system.

Many of the cases go back five or six years, so the people involved are not always at the same employer, and the slow punishment process has drawn criticism.

Another factor is complexity. "Trading algorithms have become so complicated, it is physically impossible for the head of an electronic trading desk to have full understanding of all the nuances of their behaviour 'by hand'," says Denis Ignatovich, a former Deutsche Bank trader turned software entrepreneur.

"So if a developer or product manager introduces a 'feature' that, for example, unlawfully prioritises one set of clients versus another, it may take you a very long time to detect this by looking at the post-trade data alone."

Last year he co-founded Aesthetic Integration, which develops tools for banks and exchanges to verify trading patterns. But some fund managers are wondering if a fundamental change is needed so they can trade large blocks of shares shielded from banks and high-frequency traders.

A group of nine of the largest asset managers is developing a not-for-profit venue called Luminex Trading and Analytics . A similar project, the Plato Partnership , is under way in Europe. The New York Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange plan to introduce intraday auctions.

Auctions allow traders to place orders at particular prices. Matching bids and offers are executed in a set timeframe but the trade is not dependent on an investor's speed in the market.

Last week Norway's sovereign wealth fund said the mix of investors was changing. People were leaving investment banks for asset management, while retail investors' orders sent to broker-dealers were matched with banks and rarely touched exchanges, it noted.

But many people question whether there is enough activity from asset managers to support more venues or trading of large blocks of shares.

"I have my doubts as to how much is out there to be traded," says Richard Balarkas, former chief executive of Instinet Europe, an agency broker. "There are lot of venues that exist that could be used. Liquidnet and [ITG's] Posit do a good job, but they're not getting huge amounts of the market."

The Property Report
Deal of the Week: Sale/Lease-Back Deals Attract Smaller Firms

One of the fastest-growing trends among big retail and restaurant chains in recent years has been a practice called sale/lease-backs, by which retailers sell their stores, pocket the profits and then lease the stores back from the buyer.

The transactions allow companies to cash out the value of their real-estate holdings, which have risen sharply in recent years. But they can also saddle companies with large lease expenses that can become burdensome over time.

Still, a number of companies are taking the sale/lease-back plunge. Last month, Sears Holdings Corp. sold 235 properties to Seritage Growth Properties, a real-estate investment trust, for $2.7 billion. Sears, which spun off Seritage, will lease back a majority of the acquired properties. In June, Darden Restaurants Inc., the owner of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, said it was jettisoning 430 of its more than 1,500 restaurants to a publicly traded REIT and leasing them back.

Now the sale/lease-back trend is starting to catch on with smaller entities, including health-care facilities and medical office buildings.

Consider DEC Property LLC, the owner of a 13,000-square-foot medical office building in Tempe, Ariz. In June, DEC, which is owned by seven physicians, sold the 10-year-old single-story building to Nashville, Tenn.-based Community Healthcare Trust Inc. for $2.8 million. An endoscopy practice, of which several of the sellers are a part, then leased back 10,400 square feet of the space to continue their practice. A school occupies the remaining space. Before the sale, the endoscopy practice locked in its lease with the sellers for five years, with two five-year options. That made the property more marketable.

"When you buy a medical office building, you're not buying the bricks and mortar -- you're buying the practice," said Colleen McPherson, vice president of the Healthcare Services Group at Colliers International. "This building increased in value substantially because of the lease that was put in place with the practice/tenant."

Due to the rising demand for medical care by both aging baby boomers and maturing millennials, the vacancy rate for medical office buildings is dropping, from 10.3% in 2010 to 9.6% in the second quarter of 2015, according to commercial real-estate firm Marcus & Millichap Inc.

At the same time, due to a flow of cash into the sector, prices are rising, from $208.11 a square foot in June 2010 to $239.94 a square foot in June 2015, according to New York-based data firm Real Capital Analytics Inc., with average capitalization rates dropping from 8.3% to 7% over the same period. The cap rate, a valuation measure, is equal to a property's annual income divided by its purchase price.

Facilities deemed to be less risky because they are anchored by medical practices are worth even more. According to Marcus & Millichap, brand-new medical facilities with leases extending 10 years or more in strong urban locations are trading at cap rates in the low-6% range.

Medical office buildings are also perceived as somewhat recession-resistant, since demand for medical care is strong in both good economic times and bad. According to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, at the height of the recession and financial crisis in 2008, health-care REITs fared better than other sectors, with a negative return of 11.98% for the year. In comparison, the FTSE NAREIT All Equity REIT Index, which tracks all REITs, was down 37.7% that year.

But sale/lease-backs can hurt a company's bottom line. That is one reason why major hospital systems aren't selling off their portfolios to capitalize on high prices. "If a hospital sells, they incur a rent expense, which is a significant impact to their operating margins," said Mary Beth Kuzmanovich, national director of Healthcare Services for Colliers.

In May, Marcus & Millichap brokered the sale/lease-back of a nine-building, 401,428-square-foot medical office portfolio that sold for $131 million. The properties, anchored by the Illinois Bone and Joint Institute, were all located in the Chicago metro area.

But sale/lease-backs can have a negative impact on a company's bottom line. That is one reason why major hospital systems aren't selling off their portfolios to capitalize on the current high prices.  If a hospital sells, they incur a rent expense, which is a significant impact to their operating margins," said Mary Beth Kuzmanovich, national director of Healthcare Services for Colliers.

Still, at least one industry analyst believes the sale/lease-back trend will continue.  New highs for health-care real-estate values have made sale/lease-backs and other monetization opportunities very attractive for owners," said Kevin Tyler, a health-care analyst at Green Street Advisors LLC, a real-estate research firm in Newport Beach, Calif.  People are looking at their real-estate holdings and saying,  Hey, we're at a point in the cycle where we haven't seen these values before. Let's take some chips off the table and focus on our operations going forward.'"

Tech
Coursera Partners With Tech, Financial Firms for Online Classes; MOOC providers, possible game-changers in education one day, seek profitable niche

One of the largest providers of massive open online courses is teaming up with several major financial and technology companies to offer new classes this fall, the latest sign "http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-future-of-college-its-online-1430105057" providers are scaling back their ambitions to upend "http://www.wsj.com/articles/daphne-koller-on-the-future-of-online-education-1433532321" to make a profit.

Coursera's new offerings are sponsored and partially designed by several major financial and technology corporations. Instead of the Great Books, they focus "http://www.wsj.com/articles/corporate-training-gets-an-online-refresh-1412194344"and professional development.

The company's collaboration is the latest step the nascent online sector has taken toward monetizing its massive, global audience by trying to bridge the yawning skills gap that continues to dog the U.S. labor market. Studies show that 40% of employers in the U.S report difficulty filling jobs.

Rick Levin, Coursera's chief executive, said the courses dubbed the Global Skills Initiative will enable companies to expand the global pool of available talent in their respective industries and help universities provide courses that are in tune with what employers want.

 This is a natural evolution. We've found over the last year that there is tremendous demand for job-relevant skills," said Mr. Levin.  We embrace bringing universities and companies together."

MOOCs were developed in Canada around 2008 and have been dominated by three providers that have teamed up with hundreds of universities to create courses ranging from introduction to philosophy to nanotechnology. Though they have drawn wide interest and grand pronouncements, they have fallen short of the hype that accompanied their birth. Courses can cost schools several hundred thousand dollars to produce and the percentage of students who finish a class has been mired in the single digits.

 It's a great idea in search of a business model," said Jeff Silber, a for-profit higher education analyst for BMO Capital Markets.

Coursera, which has received millions of dollars in venture capital and attracted 12 million students world-wide, still gives its core product away free. In 2013, the company added the option for students of buying a certificate for up to $100 to prove they had completed a course. In 2014, those single classes evolved into certifications for a series of courses and the prices went up to around $200. The new credentials will cost as much as $600.

Coursera competitors Udacity and edX already offer courses that bridge the academic and private sectors. Udacity offers certificates called nano degrees based on a series of online courses developed with input from Google Inc. and AT&T Inc., among other companies. EdX created a course sequence called the XSeries Programs, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a consortium of about 50 companies, including United Parcel Service Inc., Procter & Gamble Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

Coursera's new model centers around its sweet spot: Though just one in three of its 1,000 courses are in business, computer science or data analysis, the subjects draw 61% of the company's students. Completion rates in those courses are more than double the 8% company average, a spokesman said.

The initial Global Skills Initiative classes include Essentials of Corporate Financial Analysis and Decision Making created by the Bank of New York Mellon and the University of Melbourne; the Internet of Things in conjunction with Qualcomm Inc. and the University of California, San Diego; and Big Data in conjunction with big-data software company Splunk Inc. and UC San Diego. Additional companies include Cisco Systems Inc., Microsoft Corp. and UBS AB.

 There's a huge gap between what companies need and what students are training to do," said Rob Reed, chief education evangelist of Splunk, adding that the potentially massive Coursera audience would help students to learn new skills that would make them attractive in the job market and raise the visibility of Splunk's products.

 We want to prepare our students for life after graduation," said Jeffrey Elman, the director of technology enhanced education at UC San Diego.  This can help."

ECB recovery plan hit by weak business investment; Moody's Analytics  study

The European Central Bank's attempt to kick-start the eurozone economy is being held back by a stubborn reluctance of companies to invest, with many preferring to hoard cash or buy back their own stock, according to research.

The ECB faces a paradox as its aggressive monetary easing has lowered companies' return on investments, leaving them struggling for viable, long-term projects, according to Moody'sAnalytics.

"Although the ECB's accommodative monetary policy aims to support lending, the policy, maybe unintentionally, reduced the return on future investment and undermined investment growth,'' said Tomas Holinka, an economist at Moody'sAnalytics. Until returns increase, the report concludes that "weak investment growth will remain a drag on long-term potential growth in the eurozone".

Returns on financial assets from high-quality government debt to the riskiest corporate bonds have fallen as the world's central banks, including the ECB, have flooded financial markets with trillions of dollars since the financial crisis.

Investment in the eurozone has plunged since then and has remained weak. In 2008, the year US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed, investment in equipment and infrastructure accounted for 23 per cent of collective gross domestic product. Last year it was 19.5 per cent, according to Eurostat, the EU's statistical office.

Instead, many businesses have used profits to repay debt, fund share repurchases or simply build up cash piles.

German companies have almost doubled retained profits since 2006, while other eurozone companies have also increased retained earnings since 2014, with Portuguese firms leading the gain.

In Depth: Company Tracks Bank Cards And Sells Data to Investors

Yodlee Inc.'s main business is providing online personal-finance tools to 11 of the 20 largest U.S. banks in assets.

But when bank customers use those tools, Yodlee has another way of making money: The company sells some of the data it gathers from credit- and debit-card transactions to investors and research firms, which mine the information for clues about trends that can move stock prices.

"Yodlee can tell you down to the day how much the water bill was across 25,000 citizens of San Francisco" or the daily spending at McDonald's throughout the country, says Peter Hazlehurst, Yodlee's former chief product officer.

The details are so valuable that some investment firms have paid more than $2 million apiece for an annual subscription to Yodlee's service, according to people familiar with the matter. Buyers include Point72 Asset Management LLP and Tiger Global Management LLC.

Yodlee's side business marks an escalation in the long-running arms race among investors who try to turn data into investing profits. Card transactions are an especially coveted example of "alternative data," a broad term for information that goes beyond traditional measurements like stock-price history.

Some of the world's most sophisticated investors analyze location data from mobile-phone carriers, cargo-ship movements and construction permits scanned in from local-government offices across the U.S. The data troves can cost anywhere from $50,000 to $4 million a year, says Gene Ekster, who has held alternative-data-related jobs since 2008.

"It used to be that you'd hire people to go out and do research or count the number of people going into a store," Mr. Ekster says. "Now there is enormous effort in analyzing data and finding tradable signals from a range of new sources. It's still in the early stages."

The information being sold and sifted is more granular than ever.

Investment firms have used Yodlee's data to compare purchases made by visitors to specific theme parks owned by SeaWorld Entertainment Inc., including SeaWorld and Busch Gardens, say people familiar with the situation.

Investors can zoom in on transactions related to tickets, merchandise, food and parking. SeaWorld's securities filings and earnings announcements disclose only the company's overall revenue from admissions and "food, merchandise and other" sales. SeaWorld declines to comment.

Yodlee, based in Redwood City, Calif., hasn't publicly disclosed that it sells the data to investment firms. Before its initial public offering last year, Yodlee said it provides data for "multiple research uses," such as "to enhance predictive analysis."

The company won't identify its data-buying clients. The business is part of a larger operation that produced about 10% of Yodlee's total revenue last year, according to the company.

In a statement, Yodlee (pronounced YOHD-lee) says it has "a very limited number of strategic partnerships with firms to develop more sophisticated analytic solutions."

Yodlee also says it "adheres to strict privacy standards to ensure that the transaction data in our data products is anonymized and does not contain personally identifiable or attributable information," according to a statement.

The company says banks largely remove details that could be traced back to a specific person before the data is shipped to Yodlee. Yodlee then puts the data through a separate process that scrubs out any remaining identifiers.

Yodlee says its "strategic partners" are barred from "reselling, sharing or otherwise providing the de-identified transaction elements to any party" and are "further expressly prohibited from even attempting to re-identify any individual or any Yodlee customers from the data."

Some researchers have claimed they were able to "re-identify" people in anonymized data unrelated to Yodlee through the use of other data sets.

In January, researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology said in Science magazine that they could unmask roughly 90% of people in a database of anonymous credit-card transactions with four pieces of information that included date and transaction location. They used a private database provided to them by an unidentified company.

Someone trying to identify a hypothetical person named Scott from a database of anonymized card transactions would need to know only a few pieces of additional information from other sources, the researchers said.

If Scott made a purchase at a certain bakery one day and ate dinner at a specific restaurant the next day, the person probably could "re-identify" Scott from the database, according to the researchers.

Yodlee says no one can be re-identified from its data set. "There is no possibility that anyone's identity can be determined," the company says in a statement.

Peter Swire, a privacy expert at Georgia Institute of Technology hired by Yodlee to review its privacy safeguards after questions from The Wall Street Journal, says the company is "doing the technical and administrative things that regulators have recommended" to reduce the risk of data being re-identified.

He says investment firms have no reason to reverse-engineer the information they buy from Yodlee because "they are not in the business of playing spy and figuring out what the transaction history of one individual or finding the name of an individual."

Investment firms say they take precautions with alternative data. "The world of data is a bit like the Wild West, and we want to and have to be on the highest of high roads with the data we process," says Mark Herr, a spokesman for Point72, one of Yodlee's biggest data buyers.

The Stamford, Conn., firm has $11 billion in assets and was formerly known as SAC Capital Advisors LP. In 2013, SAC agreed to plead guilty to insider-trading charges, pay $1.8 billion in fines and stop managing money for outside clients.

Point72 has a division called Aperio to find and analyze data on behalf of trading groups throughout the firm. Aperio attempts to glean insights from the "torrent of publicly available data out there," says a person familiar with Point72.

The spokesman adds that Point72 uses a compliance system to make sure the information doesn't contain any material, nonpublic or personally identifiable information.

Last year, Yodlee had revenue of $89.1 million, up 27% from $70.2 million in 2013. The company's annual revenue has nearly doubled since 2010 and is expected to climb as high as $110.5 million this year, Yodlee said in May.

Yodlee begins collecting transaction data from bank customers after they sign up to use online tools powered by Yodlee.

Some information also goes to Yodlee through a practice called "screen scraping." If a person uses a budgeting app created by Yodlee and gives the app permission to access their bank accounts using their username and password, Yodlee can capture the transaction history in those accounts.

Yodlee's clients access current and historic data through an online portal. Data available to some customers included billions of transactions since 2011 and was gathered from as many as six million "users," according to a document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The document said individual transactions can include any of several pieces of information, such as transaction date, location, amount and merchant name. Yodlee says that location and merchant information "occurs only in a very small percentage of the transactions reported."

Some transactions can include numbers assigned by Yodlee to individual debit- and credit-cards. That helps investors and research firms that buy Yodlee's data track spending trends, say people familiar with the use of the data.

Mr. Swire, the privacy expert hired by Yodlee, says the identification numbers sometimes can change over time.

Banks have expressed few qualms about Yodlee, saying their contracts with the company specify what it is allowed to do with customer information. Credit- and debit-card users typically grant permission to the banks when they set up their account and agree to the bank's privacy policy.

HSBC Holdings PLC lets Yodlee use only "aggregated data that is combined with statistical information from other sources," according to an HSBC spokesman. Yodlee may not sell "individual client or HSBC-specific data."

A Citigroup Inc. spokesman says the data Yodlee has access to "contains no personally identifiable information." Bank of America Corp., which generated nearly 14% of Yodlee's revenue last year, says the bank "ensures all third-party vendors protect customer data at standards that meet our policies, regulatory guidance and requirements, and are in accordance with our customer privacy policy."

USAA, which focuses on serving current and former military members and their families, doesn't permit Yodlee to "store personally identifiable information about our members," according to a USAA spokeswoman.

Personal Capital Corp.'s app uses Yodlee's system to aggregate accounts so customers can see their overall net worth, cash flow, asset allocation and portfolio performance.

In response to questions about Yodlee, Saikat Maiti, Personal Capital's chief information security and trust officer, says in a statement that the firm is partners with a "third party that in the course of providing the service collects and anonymizes data that they may utilize."

After being contacted by the Journal, Personal Capital also added a new paragraph to its customer privacy disclosure that says outside firms might "be contractually allowed to rent, sell or otherwise make commercial use" of customer data.

Among Yodlee's largest customers, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. doesn't participate in the data-selling side business. A spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan says the bank doesn't give Yodlee any access to transaction-level data and doesn't allow the company to sell such data.

Yodlee was started in 1999 and focused at first on building relationships with financial institutions. The company later developed a new business helping financial-app companies help customers track their finances.

Yodlee says more than 800 organizations were using "the Yodlee platform to power their consumer-facing digital offerings" as of Dec. 31.

Banks and other financial institutions that are Yodlee customers have more than 100 million customers. Banks pay Yodlee a fee every time a customer uses a tool powered by the company.

Yodlee's largest investors as of March 31 include mutual-fund giant Fidelity Investments, private-equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC and customers Bank of America and Tiger Global. Tiger Global, with $20 billion in assets, uses Yodlee data as part of its investment research.

In May, Yodlee Chairman, President and Chief Executive Anil Arora told analysts and investors that the company sees itself as the "leading cloud-based financial platform."

Yodlee has a "vision to transform digital financial services by simplifying and improving the lives of anyone with a financial account," he added. Mr. Arora cited as a growth opportunity "leveraging our unique big data assets and analytics capabilities."

Transaction data is especially useful for understanding trends at publicly traded restaurant companies, clothing firms and theme-park operators like SeaWorld, according to people familiar with the matter. Share prices of such companies are tied closely to quarterly revenue, so surprises can lead to big price swings.

Hedge-fund executives and people familiar with Yodlee say its data product is one of best and priciest available to investors, reflecting a growing strategy by information gatherers to cash in on "exhaust," or data collected while doing other business.

Yodlee's data customers include the investment research arm of Investment Technology Group Inc., say people familiar with the matter.

On its website, the New York brokerage says it has access to a "daily extended consumer transaction panel of over 3 million users and anonymized transaction level data from over 4 million accounts." ITG declines to comment on the sources of its data.

Data-analysis firm Verisk Analytics Inc., of Jersey City, N.J., a Yodlee rival, says it doesn't sell "customer-level spending data" but analyzes it for banks, retailers and other clients. Cardlytics Inc., based in Atlanta, doesn't "supply intelligence to any Wall Street firms," the company says in a statement.

At Yodlee, the data-crunching work is in such hot demand that the company has subcontracted the job of making sense of the information for some clients. The Earnest Research Co., a New York startup, analyzes data from Yodlee on behalf of certain hedge funds, say people familiar with the matter.

Earnest produces weekly reports on sales and transactions at more than 70 retail companies from Urban Outfitters Inc. to McDonald's Corp., these people said. Yodlee declines to comment on its relationship with Earnest, and Earnest didn't respond to requests for comment.

Microsoft Corp. and Salesforce.com Inc. have joined private-equity investors Permira Advisers LLC and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board in the roughly $5.3 billion deal to take private data-software company Informatica Corp.

The sizes of the stakes by Microsoft and Salesforce Ventures weren't disclosed Thursday in Informatica's news release, which also announced the closing of the deal with Permira and the Canada pension plan. The deal represents "http://www.wsj.com/articles/permira-cppib-poised-to-take-informatica-private-in-5-billion-deal-1428398039" so far this year, The Wall Street Journal reported in April.

Under the terms of the deal, stockholders received $48.75 in cash, less taxes, for each share they owned, according to The Journal.

The Vanguard Group, BlackRock Fund Advisors and Elliott Management Corp. were the largest shareholders as of March 31, according to regulatory filings.

 Now as a private company, with a long view measured in years, not quarters, we will have more flexibility and more time to implement our transformative innovation road map and to evolve our business model," said Sohaib Abbasi in a news release, who will stay on as chairman.

Founded in 1993, Informatica, which will stop trading Thursday on Nasdaq, helps companies organize and analyze broad swaths of information, tapping the growing demand for help with managing what is known as big data. The company had revenue of around $1 billion in 2014, up about 11%.

Chief product officer Anil Chakravarthy has taken on the acting chief executive post, while former Adobe Systems Inc. CEO Bruce Chizen has joined Informatica as special adviser.

As of Dec. 31, Informatica had 1,237 workers and research and development centers in 10 countries, according to regulatory filings.

Bean seeks statistics agency rethink as disquiet over its performance mounts

Former bank deputy governor calls for evidence towards his evaluation of controversy-hit ONS

In the 1970s, says Sir Charlie Bean, the UK was "probably the world leader in statistics". As he prepares to tackle the question of whether the facts and figures produced by the Office for National Statistics are fit for purpose, Sir Charlie admits the UK is not quite "the leader of the pack" any more.

The Bank of England's former deputy governor was appointed last month by Chancellor George Osborne to lead an in-depth review of UK economic data.

Speaking to the Financial Times as he calls on the statistics community to contribute evidence, he stresses the ONS is "clearly still producing top quality statistics". Yet in government circles, disquiet with its performance has been growing.

Over the past few years, the ONS has been embroiled in a series of controversies. Its accounting treatment of the proceeds of quantitative easing, which it later reversed, was criticised for artificially flattering the public finances. Errors in a range of statistics such as construction and trade led to the stripping of the national statistics "kitemark" by the UK Statistics Authority.

It has endured scathing criticism of its website and creaking IT infrastructure, sparking concern that outside data terminals used by the likes of traders could publish the information before it was up on the official ONS site. That led to the controversial suggestion that crucial market-moving statistics might have to be released gradually to reduce pressure on its computer system.

One topic on the table is the issue of whether the ONS needs to re-establish a senior team in London.

When the ONS relocated to Newport in 2007 it lost nearly 90 per cent of its senior staff, and the team running core economic statistics suffered in particular. Many of those who left took up positions in the Treasury, the BoE or the City - which partly explains the chorus of criticism from those institutions.

Economists say one of the biggest issues since the move has been that the relationship between staff at the ONS, BoE and Treasury has been weakened because secondments between those organisations are harder if one of them is four hours away. That means ONS statisticians can no longer routinely puzzle over oddities in the data with colleagues in nearby institutions and res-olve them before mistakes are made. Jonathan Athow, the new head of economic statistics at the ONS, has said a small London team "could be helpful".

The other oft-repeated grumble is that the organisation has focused too heavily on the technicalities of data production and has lost track of what professional users actually need - how the statistics are organised and communicated. David Caplan, a former senior ONS staff member and now director of research and statistics at policy analysis firm Belmana, says: "Measuring the economy is tough, but the ONS needs to shift its attitude and understand and address users' concerns."

Sir Charlie says, "Ultimately it should be the needs of users, broadly interpreted, that determine what sorts of statistics should be produced" - leaving the door open for a rethink of what the agency's output should be.

Another large part of the review will cover whether the ONS is making use of all the possibilities of the big data revolution, as well as figures from other government sources. Governance arrangements for economic statistics will also be examined, but Sir Charlie says he regards "the independence of the provision of statistics as a total red line. You only have to look at countries like Greece to realise what can happen if that line gets crossed."

He has established a small team, with officials seconded from the BoE, Treasury and the UK Statistics Authority, to help him conduct the review. The timescale is tight: Sir Charlie will publish his interim report in the autumn and the final report is due before next year's Budget, meaning the chancellor could choose to look again at resourcing for the agency, which has seen cuts of about 20 per cent over the past five years, if the review recommends more money is needed. "They have sent me quite a tough exam with not that much time to do it," he jokes.

Background

From reviews and cuts to web difficulties and errors

1981 Rayner review leads to 25 per cent cut to the Government Statistical Service.

1988 Nigel Lawson sets up the Pickford review, after concerns the strength of the boom had been mismeasured.

1996 Office for National Statistics formed, merging statistical services

2005 Gordon Brown makes ONS independent of government .

2006 After the Lyons review, the ONS moves to Newport, Wales. The next year the BoE warns MPs the relocation "poses a serious risk to the maintenance of the quality of macroeconomic data".

2009 ONS admits it has overstated by 56 per cent the quantity of high street sales since the financial crisis.

2010 Government's statistics budget cut by 17.4 per cent in real terms over next five years. ONS postpones publication of all data on the national accounts for two weeks after it found "potential errors".

2011 New ONS website launched, to an outcry over difficulties in using it.

2013 ONS retains the RPI inflation index , despite accepting its upward bias. Later, the UK Statistics Authority raps ONS for treatment of cash flows from quantitative easing, which flatter net borrowing figures.

2014 John Pullinger, the new national statistician, puts statistics at the top of his agenda for reform at the ONS .

2015 In May, the UKSA warns that UK official trade data will remain vulnerable to errors until the ONS improves systems. In June, errors measuring inflation in the construction sector lead to an upward revision of annual growth in national income in the first quarter. Source: FT research, Royal Statistical Society

Shake-up aims to bring official statistics into internet era;  "Ex-BoE deputy Bean begins review  "Number crunchers put on notice

Sir Charlie Bean, former deputy governor of the Bank of England, will today put the nation's number crunchers on notice that the status quo is untenable, arguing that the internet revolution has rendered Britain's official statistics out of date.

Speaking ahead of the launch of his official review into the state of the nation's economic numbers, he told the Financial Times the current framework for the national accounts "was developed in the aftermath of the Great Depression". While big data, rapid innovations in technology and the rise of the sharing economy had transformed industries around the globe, official -statistics had soldiered along largely unchanged, he said.

"As an economy develops, the traditional ways of thinking about it cease to be so relevant," he said, flagging concerns that official numbers may be incomplete in the internet age, where consumers, for example, book holidays online, bypassing travel companies.

In the 1970s the UK was "probably the world leader in statistics", he said, but it was not "quite the leader of the pack now". He queried whether the UK was making best use of opportunities stemming from the "big data" revolution.

After years of grumbling from policymakers and economists about the quality of the national statistics, the BoE's former chief economist was appointed last month by George Osborne, the chancellor, to lead a root and branch review of the UK's economic statistics.

Sir Charlie believes that the traditional divisions of industrial sectors are increasingly out of date. Citing Rolls-Royce, which the public considers an exemplar of manufacturing excellence, but in fact makes much of its money from its services business, he said talking about manufacturing and services as distinct concepts is "often not a helpful way to think about economic activity".

Central to the review will be the question of whether the Office for National Statistics, which has had a rocky period amid private and public criticism about the quality of its data, can do what policymakers want it to do. Jonathan Athow, the new head of economic statistics at the ONS, said it was "a good opportunity to look to the future and ask ourselves some searching questions about what we should be doing".

Over the past few years, the ONS has been embroiled in a series of controversies - from its accounting treatment of the proceeds of quantitative easing to errors in a range of statistics such as construction and trade.

Sir Charlie said the ONS had been on a "rollercoaster" in the past couple of -decades as it had seen many shake-ups, including its move in 2007 to Newport when it lost most of its experienced staff.

Simon Briscoe, an expert on official statistics, said the review had the "potential to be supremely important".

Markets
Dollar Rises on Interest-Rate Hopes; Investors have been driving the dollar higher in anticipation that the Fed will raise short-term interest rates

The dollar edged higher broadly after a measure of the U.S. service sector surged in July, helping to reinforce recent signals from the Federal Reserve that borrowing costs could rise as early as September.

The dollar rose 0.4% versus the yen to 124.86 in late-afternoon trade, on track for its highest in two months. The Wall Street Journal Dollar Index, which compares the greenback against a basket of widely traded currencies, increased 0.1% to 89.14, its highest level in about five months and just 0.2% from a 12-year high it hit on March 13.

Investors moved into the dollar Wednesday after the Institute for Supply Management reported that "http://www.wsj.com/articles/ism-nonmanufacturing-survey-rises-to-60-3-in-july-1438784012" rose to 60.3 in July from 56.0 in June. The number soared above economists' forecast of 56.1. A reading above 50 signifies an expansion in activity.

In addition, the ISM employment index rose to 59.6 from 52.7, helping to offset a report on Wednesday by Automatic Data Processing and forecasting firm Moody'sAnalytics showing that private payrolls in the U.S. increased by "http://www.wsj.com/articles/private-sector-added-185-000-jobs-in-july-fewer-than-expected-1438778175".

Investors have been driving the dollar higher over much of the past year on wagers that the Fed will raise short-term interest rates for the first time since 2006 as the U.S. economy improves, a view supported by strong labor-market gains. Higher borrowing costs would boost the dollar's allure to investors searching for yield.

But the dollar's advance has mostly been halting since March, as weaker data early in 2015 raised doubts about the timing of the central bank's move, pushing back market expectations toward the latter half of 2015 from midyear, and even into 2016.

The market is looking to nonfarm payrolls numbers for July, which are released Friday morning, to provide more clarity on the state of the labor market and spark a renewed rally in the U.S. currency. Fed officials have recently communicated that the bar is low for a September rate increase, but a move still depends on a strong jobs reports underpinning investor conviction that U.S. labor market gains are holding.

 The scope for dollar gains might be limited ahead of the payrolls number," said Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at the currency brokerage Commonwealth Foreign Exchange, Inc.  A decent number on Friday, say 225,000 and above, keeps September on the table and paves the way for a more meaningful and sustained rally in the dollar."

Economists predict that the U.S. added 215,000 jobs in July, a number consistent with strong job growth. The U.S. has been averaging 233,000 monthly job gains over the past two years.

Dollar bulls got a lift on Tuesday after Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta President Dennis Lockhart told The Wall Street Journal that only a  significant deterioration in the economic picture" "http://www.wsj.com/articles/atlanta-feds-lockhart-fed-is-close-to-being-ready-to-raise-short-term-rates-1438709252".

 Most investors won't make up their minds, and the Fed won't make up its mind, until they see the nonfarm payrolls data," said Daniel Katzive, head of currency strategy for North America at BNP Paribas.  And most price action this week was marking time ahead of Friday's release of those numbers."

In other trade, the dollar slid 0.2% against the euro, as the common currency bought $1.0904.

In Depth: Q&A: Citadel's Ken Griffin in Conversation

By Rob Copeland

Ken Griffin is back the near the top of the hedge-fund world. The billionaire Mr. Griffin has not just rebuilt Citadel from its crisis-era lows, but pushed it to aggressively expand into new areas -- all while he contends with a high-profile divorce that has Chicago's gossip pages hanging on every filing. As he prepares to mark Citadel's 25th anniversary later this year, Mr. Griffin sat for several interviews with the Journal's Rob Copeland to discuss his investing style, the markets today and politics. Condensed excerpts follow:

Q: Your divorce has made public some unflattering allegations about you, many of which you've denied. How do you deal with the scrutiny?

A: Long ago I had to sort of learn to have a thick skin to read some of the things you read in the papers and to also keep my ego in check when you read some really flattering things in the papers. Two-thousand eight was a failure that I had to endure. I didn't foresee the collapse of the U.S. financial system -- I just didn't see that coming -- that the U.S. banking sector would survive only because of the support and lifeline from the U.S. government. I then had to fight it out in the 3 years and 17 days post-08 to make back the losses that we incurred in 16 weeks. So that's a backdrop.

In the last year, it's regrettable that the strategy used by the now-withdrawn opposing counsel was to try to attack my character in my hometown. That didn't work. My actions speak louder than anything else. Let me be clear: All I really care about is my kids know that their parents love them.

Q: Tell me something about yourself that people might find surprising.

A: It drives people nuts that I take them to McDonald's all the time. It's the call from Ken: 'Let's go for a walk.' Everyone knows that is code for, 'We're going to McDonald's.' People have these images of what the successful business person is supposed to act like and be like and so forth.

Q: What is it like to see your personal life, business life and political giving become headline news?

A: For choice, I prefer not to be a public figure. I don't have Tom Cruise's good looks. I don't have a need to be on the front page of fill-in-the-blank. On my political giving, look, there's probably not a week that goes by that I don't realize the sacrifices that our forefathers made for this country. Yes, I'm involved in politics. Because frankly, if not me, who?

Q: You've given millions to back Republican Bruce Rauner for governor of Illinois, yet also boosted Democrat Rahm Emanuel for mayor of Chicago. Where do your politics lie?

A: I can't describe myself as a die-hard Republication or faithful Democrat. The distinction between our two parties in the United States is pretty narrow. We need a mayor who understands how to get through a balance sheet; it was an easy call to get behind Rahm. I want Bruce to be comfortable knowing that he's got my support however he feels it's best to use. Anyone who knows him knows you don't have influence with Bruce.

Q: Where are you leaning in the 2016 presidential race?

A: I love Walker for taking on the entrenched interests in Wisconsin. I want to see how he can do on the national stage. I think Rubio's got a really compelling message and he comes from a background that gives him real insight into the challenges that the middle class faces. I wish Jeb had any last name but Bush, because I think Jeb's track record is really good. As an American, I'm uncomfortable with the idea of family political dynasties. We don't need another Clinton and we don't need another Bush.

Q: How is Citadel dealing with the recent market volatility in China (note: interview conducted before one of the firm's accounts in China was suspended by regulators)

A: When I think about the next 10 years, we are going to have a very meaningful business in China. We've seen the government of China respond very vigorously to the issues at hand. This is the first time they've seen so much wealth disappear so quickly in such a visible way. I think they over-responded but you can understand why they did so. They just haven't experienced this before culturally as a regime. This is a very interesting moment for them. The 10-year story on China is completely intact.

Q: How is the firm doing things differently now than it did five or 10 years ago?

A: We recently hired someone with a machine learning background from Amazon.com, and one of the problems he worked on there was the routing of calls from its call center. What's the applicability of that? Amazon, as you can imagine, has endless calls every day from its customers and if they can route those calls more quickly and more efficiently the customer experience is better. The actual mathematical techniques that Amazon uses to think about that problem we think have applicability to the financial markets. It's neat.

Q: Many of your competitors are shying from calling themselves "hedge funds." Do you have ambitions for Citadel to be something else?

A: Over the years, there have been moments in time where the word "hedge fund" in the popular media has had positive connotations and negative connotations, but the word has a very strong historical anchoring to me. We're here to create wealth for our stakeholders in good times. We're here hopefully to create wealth in difficult times.

Spy Software Gets A Job on Wall Street

FRANKLIN, Tenn. -- Spies are infiltrating Wall Street.

A wave of companies with ties to the intelligence community is winning over the world of finance, with banks and hedge funds putting the firms' terrorist-tracking tools to work rooting out employee misconduct before it leads to fines or worse.

"Both Wall Street and the intelligence world want the same thing: to find unknown unknowns in the data," said Roger Hockenberry, the former chief technology officer of the Central Intelligence Agency's clandestine services and now a partner at the consulting firm Cognitio Corp. in Washington.

"Financial firms aren't looking for terrorists, but good customers and attempts at fraud," he said.

The CIA gave many of these companies their big break: After the terror attacks of September 2001, a private-equity arm of the CIA known as In-Q-Tel began seeding companies that could help it sift through vast repositories of data to quickly identify threats. Those skills have become more valuable on Wall Street as firms try to keep up with rogue traders in increasingly complex and rapidly moving markets.

Of 101 companies publicly seeded by In-Q-Tel , 33 have taken on Wall Street clients in recent years, according to a review by The Wall Street Journal. A spokeswoman for In-Q-Tel declined to comment.

Other companies in this field include Palantir Technologies Inc ., which helps government and Wall Street clients analyze their data; Recorded Future Inc ., which monitors the Internet for coalescing cybersecurity threats and other events; and Domino Data Labs Inc., which provides the plumbing for firms to do data analytics.

Palantir raised $450 million last week at a valuation of about $20 billion. Since 2009, it has received more than $215 million in contracts with the Federal Bureau of Investigation , Defense Department and Department of Homeland Security , according to USAspending.gov, a federal site that publishes government contracts. The company, which got its start working for intelligence agencies, now says more than 60% of its business comes from commercial clients, particularly on Wall Street.

Another firm, a small technology company in Tennessee called Digital Reasoning, has counted Swiss bank UBS Group AG , New York hedge-fund firm Point72 Asset Management LLP and Credit Suisse Group AG as customers of data-combing software the U.S. government has been using to track down enemies of the state.

Tim Estes founded the firm that became Digital Reasoning in 2000 during his last year of college at the University of Virginia , where he studied philosophy.

Conceived as a company specializing in "machine learning," a branch of computer science dealing with programs that can learn from data and make better predictions, Digital Reasoning struggled during its first couple of years.

But one day in 2002, Mr. Estes landed a meeting at a nearby Army base. He demonstrated an early version of the software product that came to be known as Synthesys, showing how the company's systems could read vast amounts of text and extract patterns and links not apparent to the human eye.

That led to a pilot project and an initial government contract in 2004. The system became embedded in Army systems and was used in the field in Afghanistan, according to Digital Reasoning.

An In-Q-Tel investment in 2011 precipitated an even bigger mandate for Digital Reasoning from a wider swath of agencies, including the CIA.

Located in a glassy office block on the outskirts of Franklin, Tenn., the firm's staff of about 100 includes more than 30 employees with top-secret security clearance. Former Wall Street researchers and young technologists shuffle in and out of conference rooms named after locations from the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy.

"We see ourselves as the Darwinian outcome of billions of dollars of intelligence spending post-9/11," said Mr. Estes, 36 years old.

Digital Reasoning's government work is classified but Mr. Estes said it involves things like "figuring out the aliases of certain people that were very hard to find in the data."

Last year, Digital Reasoning raised $24 million from a group of banks led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc . and Credit Suisse . So far, it has publicized contracts to assist the compliance teams of UBS and Point72, the $11 billion firm run by Steven A. Cohen that was formerly known as SAC Capital .

Point72 uses systems from Digital Reasoning in conjunction with those from Palantir to monitor roughly one million emails, instant messages and other electronic communications every week, according to Vincent Tortorella, the firm's chief compliance and surveillance officer.

Systems from the two companies help "read, flag and risk-score emails," which are then reviewed by a compliance group composed of former employees of the CIA, FBI , Department of Homeland Security and the Securities and Exchange Commission , he said.

Mr. Cohen's firm has been caught in regulators' cross hairs in recent years for issues related to its oversight of employees. In 2013, SAC agreed to plead guilty to insider-trading charges, pay $1.8 billion in fines and stop managing money for outside clients. Mr. Cohen is still awaiting the outcome of a civil case for failure to supervise employees later found guilty of insider trading.

UBS , Credit Suisse and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.

In pitching prospective clients, Digital Reasoning often shows a demonstration of how its system responded when it was fed 500,000 emails related to the Enron scandal made available by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission .

After being "taught" some key concepts about compliance, the Synthesys program identified dozens of suspicious emails in which participants were using language that suggested attempts to conceal or destroy information. In some instances the program detected a lack of "business confidence," which in the Enron case was primarily related to accounting practices.

The Synthesys system reads all the text files in a database, capturing metadata and creating links between people and institutions. Words are given sentiment scores to help detect emotion. The end result is an application that can be used to look at the data from many perspectives.

With training, the system can identify situations in which people are using code words for something nefarious, said Matthew Russell , the firm's chief technology officer and a former intelligence officer in the U.S. Air Force .

For example, an extremist group might refer to bombs as wedding cakes and bombings as weddings. In finance, the system might look for "gift-giving" language, such as a discussion of seats at a sporting event or other event. The software might also monitor for attempts to conceal information, phrases that seem to be pressuring someone to do something or expressions of anger. Some institutions search for words or phrases that show a lack of confidence around a decision, which could suggest they are wading into gray area.

Digital Reasoning is already in discussions with financial clients about the next phase of analysis after compliance solutions: increasing revenue.

China's Growth Targets Will Be Met

China's stock-market crash has raised fears of global contagion not witnessed since the 2008 financial crisis. Such fears are misplaced. Dropping share prices, even to the extent seen last week, doesn't mean Beijing won't hit its 7% GDP growth target or will abruptly cease implementing its ambitious monetary and fiscal stimulus programs.

On June 27, the People's Bank of China announced a 25 basis-point interest-rate cut -- the fourth such cut since November. But lowering interest rates is a relatively ineffective way to stimulate the Chinese economy. China's state sector, which still accounts for a large share of economic activity, isn't sufficiently interest-rate sensitive for standard monetary-policy tools to work well.

Rather, it is Beijing's recent moves to ease fiscal policy that will ensure that this year's growth target can be met. Unlike traditional Keynesian stimulus programs, which are typically conducted at the central-government level, in China fiscal easing primarily involves providing additional state-bank money to local governments.

This has a more immediate and powerful effect on GDP growth and job creation, but it comes at a high cost: overinvestment in local projects and the misallocation of capital. China's landscape is littered with unused highways and airports, redundant steel and cement plants, unnecessary municipal office buildings and "ghost cities" filled with empty high-rises and deserted shopping malls.

From 2009 to 2013, "ineffective investment" amounted to a stunning 41.8 trillion yuan ($6.742 trillion), according to research published in 2014 by Xu Ce of China's National Development and Reform Commission and Wang Yuan of the Academy of Macroeconomic Research.

That China is heading down this path again can only mean that it has no other way to reach its growth target. It is also an indication of how little the economic system has changed despite the leadership's much-vaunted reform initiatives and efforts to tackle corruption at all levels of government.

Local governments have been under increased stress since the global financial crisis, when many of them borrowed large amounts to pay for a variety of fixed-asset investments. This spending helped China to keep growing even as year-over-year export growth plummeted to minus 25.7% in February 2009 from 19.2% in June 2008. It also left behind a mountain of debt that many localities have had trouble servicing. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences recently put total year-end 2014 local government debt at 30.3 trillion yuan.

In March the Ministry of Finance announced a plan to alleviate the problem by allowing regional authorities to issue bonds directly for the first time. So far bonds worth 2 trillion yuan have been authorized -- the first trillion in May and a second trillion in June. As of July 15, 1.2 trillion yuan in bonds had already been issued. While not a large percentage of the total amount local governments owe, these offerings will greatly enhance their solvency by providing funds to repay loans due this year.

On May 11 the State Council, China's cabinet, also issued a notification requiring the banks to "actively support" existing local projects. At the same time, a number of ideas for new investment spending are now under consideration. A recent article in the China Securities Times identified 10 provinces that had proposed "economic stability" measures since the beginning of May. These will rely heavily on infrastructure investment, which, as of the first half of 2015, is already up 19.1% year on year.

In addition to infrastructure, the localities are considering investments related to Beijing's "Internet Plus" strategy, which envisages a transformation of the Chinese economy based on cloud computing, big data, mobile applications and the fast-growing connected-devices market known as the Internet of things.

The term Internet Plus was first introduced by Premier Li Keqiang in his report to the annual session of the National People's Congress in March. While there have been many official pronouncements on this subject since then, it is still unclear what the new policy will entail.

A State Council executive meeting on June 24 approved a wide range of priority areas, covering everything from logistics and smart grids to environmental protection and the modernization of agriculture. Officials appear to have been given a broad mandate to invest in practically anything that can be justified as Internet related.

This year local government projects are set to make a major contribution to keeping China's GDP growth on target. Once again, however, much of the new investment will be inefficient, contributing to the country's already considerable stock of underutilized infrastructure while perhaps introducing novel species of IT white elephants as well.

FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - MONEY
Investors take 2.7bn from M&G flagship fund; BOND ASSETS

Underperformance stems from cautious approach

Investors pulled 2.7bn out of M&G's flagship Optimal Income fund in three months after a decline in performance resulting from cautious positioning by its well-known manager Richard Woolnough.

The bond fund, which remains one of Europe's largest, shrank from 23.8bn in March to 20.9bn at the end of June, according to figures from Morningstar. In performance, it ranks 61st out of 79 in its sector over the past year, figures from FE Analytics show.

The underperformance was "primarily because of the short-duration positioning which held back returns at a time when European government bonds saw sharp yield compression," said Jason Hollands, managing director at the wealth manager Tilney Bestinvest.

Performance has recovered more recently, Mr Hollands added. Over the past three months, the fund ranks 34th in its category; over a five-year period, its performance remains top-quartile.

M&G said it would not comment on fund flows.

M&G Optimal Income , an unconstrained vehicle that can rove through global bond markets and can also buy equities, was the UK's best-selling retail fund last year despite a 3 per cent entry fee.

Investors were drawn to its flexibility and strong nine-year record amid uncertain bond markets, but performance suffered in the past year from a decision to shorten duration, or sensitivity to interest rates, in preparation for rate rises that have not yet materialised. This meant the fund did not take part in a government bond rally last year.

The big outflows were partly due to the fund's popularity with continental European retail investors, who tend to move money rapidly in response to performance, said Juliet Schooling Latter, research director at Chelsea Financial Services.

"M&G is suffering more than other strategic bond funds," she added. The M&G fund made up the lion's share of outflows from the strategic bond sector, according to the Investment Association, while investors also pulled 536m from corporate bond funds.

The product has, meanwhile, faced criticism over its ballooning size . Jake Moeller, head of UK and Ireland research at Lipper, said: "Those guys are excellent bond fund managers, but when you've got 1,500 securities in a bond fund, it's too many. You will approach an index position. It becomes much harder to outperform - that's true of any fund."

Mr Woolnough told an interviewer at Fidelity Personal Investing in May: "The larger a fund is, then by definition it makes it harder to add individual stock selection ideas. But it also depends what the purpose of the fund is.

"Investors should be aware that the larger a fund gets, the harder it gets to add value in individual stock selection, and that's something we've faced over the last 10 years."

Mr Woolnough has been identified as the highest-paid employee of Prudential, M&G's parent company, and company documents say he was paid more than 15m in each of the past two years.

WORLD NEWS
Eurozone close to deflation as energy prices remain low; Statistics agency

The eurozone remained on the edge of deflation in July after inflation across the bloc held steady at 0.2 per cent, according to a flash estimate from the EU's statistical agency.

Data from Eurostat show that falling energy prices helped nullify the inflationary effects of the European Central Bank's programme of quantitative easing launched this year.

Core inflation, which strips out volatile items such as energy, accelerated 0.2 percentage points to 1 per cent year on year as the lower euro pushed up the costs of some goods.

Falling energy prices , including the big drop in oil, held back inflation across the eurozone. Energy prices' slide accelerated, declining 5.6 per cent in July compared with a 5.1 per cent drop the previous month.

Elsewhere, inflation in services hit its highest level in a year at 1.2 per cent, with analysts at Barclays suggesting that "technical factors", such as package holidays and airfare bookings, were behind some of this increase.

The overall estimate of 0.2 per cent was in line with expectations, although some analysts had pencilled in a return to very modest deflation this month.

Others were bullish that inflation would creep up. Tomas Holinka, an economist at Moody'sAnalytics, said: "Inflation should gather momentum in coming months as oil deflation eases and food price growth gains ground."

Inflation has been sluggish even in fast-growing economies such as Spain , which this week recorded expansion of 1 per cent quarter on quarter. Consumer prices in the country dipped 0.1 per cent year on year during July.

Unemployment remained stable at 11.1 per cent across the eurozone in June, according to Eurostat. Big falls in unemployment in Spain and Portugal were drowned out by worsening figures in Italy, Belgium and Austria.

Italy's unemployment climbed to 12.7 per cent in June from 12.5 per cent in May, delivering a blow to hopes that the nascent recovery in the eurozone's third-largest economy could bring some relief to its labour market.

Meanwhile, youth joblessness in the country increased to 44.2 per cent, its highest level since 1977 and roughly twice the eurozone average.

The discouraging data could hurt the government of Matteo Renzi , which has been hoping that its aggressive economic reform agenda could start delivering a brighter economic outlook for most Italians. But, so far, only pockets of the Italian economy have benefited from the country's tepid rebound.

Finland endured an even worse performance, with unemployment jumping from 8.6 per cent to 9.5 per cent.

Across the EU as a whole, unemployment remained static at 9.6 per cent in June.

UPS Deal Aims To Fill Up Trucks

By Laura Stevens and Paul Page

United Parcel Service Inc. has agreed to buy Coyote Logistics LLC for $1.8 billion, looking to expand in the burgeoning freight-brokerage business and get a better handle on the peak holiday shipping season.

UPS, which is acquiring the shipping-services provider from private-equity firm Warburg Pincus LLC, said Friday it expects the addition to start contributing to earnings next year, eventually pitching in $100 million to $150 million.

UPS has been contracting with Chicago-based Coyote since 2012 to find extra truck space for the growing flood of holiday e-commerce, UPS Chief Commercial Officer Alan Gershenhorn said in an interview. The delivery giant has been working on reducing costs after tough back-to-back holiday seasons damped profit.

A prized addition to UPS's portfolio will be Coyote's proprietary technology, Mr. Gershenhorn said. The company will use it to make better use of its fleet of long-haul trucks, some of which at times drive empty between warehouses or package-sorting hubs. Filling that space should boost efficiency and revenue. UPS will also offer its customers use of the technology to fill out their own trucks.

Founded in 2006, Coyote was an early entrant into a new world of freight that used the promise of combining technology and analytics to win the business of retailers and manufacturers.

Founder Jeff Silver said Coyote hires young employees with no experience in transportation and trains them on an electronic platform that connects brokers and customers. The software helps spot where shipping needs of customers overlap, allowing brokers to find space on trucks more easily and to offer cheaper prices in buying the capacity, Mr. Silver said.

"We become a network integrator for our customers," he said. "It gets us out of the role of just being a traditional broker."

Coyote's technology has helped it rise quickly in a competitive, yet highly fragmented, market. The company booked $2.1 billion in revenue last year, according to UPS. According to Armstrong & Associates, a research firm, Coyote ranks 17th by revenue among third-party logistics providers, a wider universe of companies that also includes freight brokers. UPS Supply Chain Solutions ranked fourth with $5.76 billion in revenue, though it had largely steered clear of freight brokering before Friday's deal.

In a separate matter, UPS rival FedEx Corp. hit a bump with its planned acquisition of TNT Express NV. The European Commission on Friday opened an in-depth investigation into Fedex's nearly $5 billion deal for the Dutch delivery company, saying it was concerned about the merged company's dominance in international delivery in some markets.

The regulator said it would take until early December to decide whether it will approve the deal or ask for concessions to ease its concerns. The two other large international delivery companies, UPS and DHL Worldwide Express Inc., may not provide sufficient competition to the merged company, the antitrust watchdog said.

On its earnings call in June, FedEx executives said they did "not believe that the transaction faces any competition issues for the Commission." A similar attempt to acquire TNT by UPS collapsed in 2013 when it failed to satisfy European regulators.

TNT Express said in a release that the extended review by the European Commission is customary. Analysts said the review wasn't surprising and had been largely expected by the market.

FedEx said it continues to make progress on regulatory steps, which would allow it to complete the transaction in the first half of 2016. "We will continue to work together with TNT Express to meet the European Commission's need for additional due diligence and are confident that the combination of both companies will increase competition and create benefits for customers," said Patrick Fitzgerald, senior vice president integrated marketing and communications at FedEx.

As delivery companies look for growth, third-party logistics providers like Coyote are becoming more attractive. Revenue from those U.S. logistics providers rose 7.4% to $157.2 billion last year, faster than the 2.8% growth in logistics spending overall, according to research firm Armstrong & Associates.

FedEx acquired logistics company GENCO Distribution System Inc., a company that specializes in product returns, for $1.4 billion earlier this year.

Europe has also become increasingly attractive for growth. UPS has said it is doubling its investment there to nearly $2 billion over five years, while XPO Logistics Inc. earlier this year said it was purchasing French contract-logistics firm Norbert Dentressangle SA in a deal valued at $3.53 billion.

Cohen's Point72 Goes Big on Data

The $11 billion investment firm run by Steven A. Cohen continued its push into the world of big data, hiring the former co-head of research at hedge-fund giant Bridgewater Associates LP to be its new chief market intelligence officer.

Matthew Granade, 38 years old, will oversee Point72 Asset Management LP's data sourcing and analysis efforts. He said in an interview that he decided to join the firm after Mr. Cohen and Point72's president, Douglas Haynes, extolled the firm's efforts in data and analytics.

"Steve explained that this was the way the firm needs to evolve," he said. "My personal feeling is that this is a very exciting time in this space. Investing now isn't just about earnings estimates and 10ks. It's about satellite imagery, sensors and mobile devices. The more you can process those things, the more edge you'll have."

Formerly known as SAC Capital Advisors LP, Point72 has been trying to distance itself from its past since SAC agreed in 2013 to plead guilty to insider-trading charges, pay $1.8 billion in fines and stop managing money for outside clients. The firm also lost much of its senior investment staff, and Mr. Cohen still is awaiting the outcome of a civil case from the Securities and Exchange Commission for failure to supervise employees later found guilty of insider trading.

Mr. Cohen long has been known as a stock picker who makes major decisions on his own, even while the firm invested in new analytical tools. It isn't clear how much these efforts have changed its investment approach.

Point72's dive into data comes at a time of growing interest among Wall Street firms into how to find profit-driving information from torrents of data.

So-called quantitative investment firms, such as $25 billion Two Sigma Investments, long have been big consumers of data. Such firms use mathematics to sift through huge amounts of data for clues about the direction of stock prices or futures contracts. They analyze everything from social-media sentiment to satellite imagery that shows them how many cars are in parking lots of big retailers.

Investment firms that focus on more-traditional measures of companies' health also have sought to increase their use of sophisticated data. Oil investors for years have bought expensive information from companies that fly helicopters over storage facilities with infrared cameras that help detect the volume of oil stored inside.

Mr. Granade said new types of data have been emerging with greater frequency.

For example, after he left Bridgewater Mr. Granade served as an adviser to Orbital Insights Inc., a firm in Palo Alto, Calif., that has designed systems to analyze satellite images for useful information. The company's first clients have been hedge funds.

Point72 has several data teams that develop insights for portfolio managers. Its Aperio group has about 30 people who find different sources of data, analyze it and then give it to trading groups.

Another group, called Canvas, is in charge of more-traditional Wall Street research and conducting surveys. Point72 also has several economists.

Sky-High Tech Valuations Led by Mobile Internet, Sequoia Capital Says; Sequoia Capital China is looking for opportunities in big data  and Internet finance

HONG KONG Rising valuations for Chinese tech startups are being driven by new investors interested in mobile internet, a top venture capital said at the Converge technology conference in Hong Kong.

Neil Shen, founder and managing partner of Sequoia Capital China, said the growth of mobile internet gave some investors a feeling the  sky's the limit."

 A lot of investors who are not particularly active in the Internet space before, started to get into the space," Mr. Shen said.  Clearly there's a supply and demand mismatch."

Over the past year, Chinese tech startups have raised billions from investors to expand into companies offering online deals and services through mobile apps. Companies such as "http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-dianping-valued-at-4-billion-1427962959" Dianping and "http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-meituan-aims-to-raise-more-than-1-billion-1436331512"Meituan have attracted strong investor interest, causing their valuations to soar.

Mr. Shen said investor expectations have started to stabilize as they realize not all of these so-called  online-to-offline" companies can succeed.

Mr. Shen said Sequoia Capital China is finding opportunities in areas such as big data and Internet finance, which he believes have the potential to be bigger in China than in the U.S. market. He said "http://www.wsj.com/articles/alibaba-affiliate-launches-online-bank-despite-regulatory-hurdles-1435230003", so there's room for startups to be competitive.

UK COMPANIES
Melrose disposal raises 2bn for investors; Industrials

Sale of Elster meters business to Honeywell realises 3.3bn

Investors in Melrose Industries are set to receive more than 2bn after the company sold its Elster meter business to Honeywell International of the US for 3.3bn.

The cash sale marks the biggest deal yet for the UK company, which operates a private equity-style model. Its value is 30 per cent larger than Melrose's market capitalisation before the announcement.

Melrose bought Elster for 1.8bn in August 2012, including an infusion of 1.2bn from shareholders, and boosted its operating margins from 12.8 to almost 20 per cent.

Simon Peckham , chief executive, said the price represented "a good deal for both parties". "We've done lots of work to [Elster] but there's more to do," he said.

Melrose's shares jumped to 295p in early trading before falling back to 279p, up 24.7p and a 9.71 per cent gain on Monday's close.

Mr Peckham said Melrose would look for acquisition targets, particularly in North America and northern Europe. "The requirement is good quality industrial businesses that aren't quite fulfilling their potential," he said, without identifying anything specific.

The exact amount that shareholders will receive has yet to be fixed. Melrose plans to pay off some 750m in debt, plus fees and long-term incentives to Elster management. The group also intends to keep some of the purchase price to meet operating expenses.

Analysts at Investec, Melrose's broker, estimated shareholders might receive as much as 2.3bn.

If they do, Melrose board members, who own 3.65 per cent of the company, are set to take home more than 84m on completion, expected in the first quarter of 2016.

A person with knowledge of the deal said Honeywell had been "hovering for some time" but that the acquisition process was "fairly rapid".

Elster employs 6,800 people and operates in 39 countries, with its main operations in the US, Germany, the UK and Slovakia.

Dave Cote , Honeywell's chairman and chief executive, said the acquisition would "generate strong returns for Honeywell's shareholders because it increases our growth profile globally" and Elster's growth can be accelerated.

The sale price implies a valuation of 3.1 times 2014 revenue and 14.3 times 2014 headline earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, according to Melrose.

Mr Cote said Honeywell was attracted to Elster because utility metering was "rapidly evolving as new 'smart' technologies and software and data analytics capabilities are being adopted around the world".

He added that Elster "creates a new platform for acquisition targets for Honeywell".

Melrose's sole remaining asset is Brush Turbogenerators, a manufacturer of generators for steam and gas turbine applications. Melrose cautioned yesterday that "current trading conditions remain challenging for Brush". But it expected a better second half.

Christopher Miller , Melrose's executive chairman, said that in the 10 years since its first investment the company had created more than 2bn of shareholder value. "We look forward to beating that performance over the next decade," he added.

Last year Melrose said it would return 600m to shareholders after it sold five units from its FKI business for 945m. It said then it had more than tripled shareholder value in five years of ownership.

In 2005, it bought McKechnie, along with Dynacast, for an enterprise value of 429m. In the 18 months of its ownership of McKechnie, Melrose estimated the increase in value at nearly 2.5 times.

Dynacast was sold in July 2011 for an enterprise value of 377m, of which 373m was returned to shareholders.

Rothschild was Melrose's lead financial adviser and joint sponsor with JPMorgan also acting for them.

Lone Star Makes Big Bet on London With Quintain Estates Acquisition; $1 Billion buy is latest by North American investor in U.K. capital

LONDON Private-equity firm Lone Star Funds is making a big bet on London's residential market with the acquisition of Quintain Estates & Development PLC, a developer that owns the land around Wembley Stadium, for 700 million ($1.09 billion).

Lone Star on Wednesday said it would pay 131 pence a share for Quintain, representing a 22.4% premium on its closing price Tuesday, and prompting shares in the U.K.-listed business to soar to their highest level in more than seven years.

 The proposed acquisition represents a unique opportunity for Lone Star to gain further exposure to residential and commercial assets in London," said Angus Dodd, managing director at Lone Star Europe.

Mr. Dodd added that the Dallas-based firm would use its funds to speed up Quintain's building plans to take advantage of London's property boom.

Figures released by the U.K.'s Land Registry on Tuesday showed house price growth in the capital continues to outpace the rest of the U.K., with average growth of 1.8% in June compared with 1.1% across the country. Average prices gained 9.2% to 481,820 in the 12 months through June, compared with 5.4% across the U.K.

Quintain is developing an 85-acre site around the storied Wembley Stadium, which hosts the England soccer team, rock concerts, and regular National Football League fixtures.

In a bid to spruce up the formerly shabby neighborhood, Quintain built a retail complex before it started selling apartments, targeting buy-to-let investors and young professionals rather than the richest buyers. Much of the land remains undeveloped. Overall, Quintain, whose board is recommending Lone Star's offer, plans to build around 5,000 homes over the next 10 years.

Lone Star is the latest North American investor to push into the London property market, despite warnings from some analysts that the market looks overheated.

Of the $26.6 billion invested into the U.K. capital from overseas so far this year, around $11 billion has come from the U.S. and Canada, according to Real Capital Analytics, a data firm.

Earlier this year, Qatar's state investment fund and Canadian firm Brookfield Property Partners LP"http://www.wsj.com/articles/brookfield-qatar-fund-take-control-of-londons-canary-wharf-1425407733"in London's Canary Wharf business district, where construction of "http://www.wsj.com/articles/buyers-queue-up-for-canary-wharf-condos-1436866381" is under way.

For Lone Star, the Quintain deal is its second big move in U.K. real estate this month, having earlier said it would bundle 89 U.K. hotels it already owns into a new company, Amaris Hospitality, which it plans to float on the London Stock Exchange.

For Quintain, the deal follows its rehabilitation following the financial crisis, during which it had to issue equity to stay afloat as London's property values plunged. Since then, it has sold a string of assets, including a development project in Greenwich that was acquired by Hong Kong billionaire Henry Cheng Kar-shun, and concentrated its development activity on Wembley.

Analysts at broker Liberum Capital said Lone Star's offer price understates Quintain's long-term earnings potential, but predicted that shareholders would nevertheless seize the chance to cash in before London's property market changes course again.

Global Finance: SNL Financial Deal Is Part of Data Trend

Big data is fetching a bigger price tag.

McGraw Hill Financial Inc. agreed to buy SNL Financial LC for $2.2 billion in a deal announced Monday, nearly five times what the financial-data provider was worth four years ago when private-equity firm New Mountain Capital LLC purchased a 60% stake.

New York-based McGraw Hill outmaneuvered a handful of media and financial-data companies in its pursuit of SNL, based in Charlottesville, Va., according to people familiar with the matter. The pursuers included Hearst Corp., which has a majority ownership stake in bond-rating firm Fitch Ratings, as well as financial-data provider FactSet Research Systems Inc., according to a person familiar with the matter. A Hearst spokesman declined to comment. A FactSet spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for comment.

Investors weren't pleased with the multiple McGraw Hill agreed to pay, driving shares down 5.7%, or $5.99, to $99.59.

Analyst Timothy McHugh of William Blair & Co. said the price for SNL "is probably a little high," in a Monday note to investors. Another, William Bird of FBR Capital Markets & Co., said "the stock reaction seems exaggerated." Mr. Bird estimated the multiple paid by McGraw Hill was more than 43 times SNL's 2015 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of about $51 million.

McGraw Hill Chief Financial Officer Jack Callahan acknowledged SNL "was certainly not cheap" but said his company's sales staff outside of the U.S. could help broaden SNL's reach faster.

McGraw Hill's tie-up with SNL caps a string of pricey deals for data-driven companies as the market for firms selling obscure financial intelligence on banks, commodities and real estate attracts a bigger audience and entrenched firms look to expand.

Carlyle Group LP and other investors last year agreed to acquire Dealogic, a financial-data provider, for about $700 million. In March, a consortium led by Carlyle and Warburg Pincus LLC bought ratings firm DBRS Ltd. for more than $500 million based, in part, on the promise of its ability to sell financial intelligence to banks and other investors. More transactions are expected as other firms rush to meet the data demand.

Financial-data and transactions giants First Data Corp. and SunGard recently filed for initial public offerings, and SunGard has had suitors express interest in an acquisition, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Shares of TransUnion, the credit bureau, are up 10% since their IPO debut last month.

"There's an increasing demand for data, research and analytics in the financial and corporate markets," said Douglas Peterson, McGraw Hill's chief executive and a former Citigroup Inc. officer, in an interview.

Separately, McGraw Hill reported that second-quarter profit grew to $353 million, or $1.28 a share, from $292 million, or $1.06 a share, a year earlier.

So Long Wall Street, Hello Silicon Valley

More top Wall Streeters are California dreaming.

A technology-fueled gold rush is drawing seasoned financial executives with the promise of sunshine, fresh managerial challenges and compensation that can top even the seven-figure paychecks common in the investment world.

Blackstone Group LP said Friday that its chief financial officer, Laurence Tosi, is leaving the private-equity firm to become finance chief at Airbnb Inc., the booming home-rental service. He is just the latest Wall Street executive to move west to take advantage of massive investor interest in fast-growing companies seeking to upend entire swaths of the economy.

Mr. Tosi, 47 years old, has made a good living by any standard since he joined Blackstone following its 2007 initial public offering. He earned about $15 million last year, according to filings, and $33.8 million over the past three years, not including dividends and some other perks, such as proceeds from investments made in the firm's funds.

Yet those sums will likely appear paltry next to his winnings should Airbnb pull off a successful IPO in coming years, as many analysts expect.

Airbnb, a seven-year-old San Francisco company, is working to complete private funding arrangements that value it at $25.5 billion. Mr. Tosi's pay arrangements there aren't known, but he is expected to receive an equity stake in the firm that could be worth tens of millions of dollars following an IPO.

Beyond pay, joining fast-growing technology firms can offer other goodies. Away from the shadows of Wall Street, executives can find a higher profile and increased freedom.

Anthony Noto left Goldman Sachs Group Inc. a year ago and became finance chief at Twitter Inc., the messaging service that the stock market values at $23.7 billion. Ruth Porat traded Morgan Stanley for Google Inc. Vanessa Wittman, formerly of insurer Marsh & McLennan Cos., is at cloud-storage company Dropbox Inc., another business valued in the billions of dollars in private financings.

Ms. Porat was wooed by Google with a compensation package worth around $70 million, including a one-time bonus and new-hire stock grants. That was more than twice what she took home in total during her previous three years at Morgan Stanley, according to securities filings.

The investment appears to be paying quick dividends for the Internet search giant. Strong quarterly earnings released earlier this month jolted its shares, making Google worth $65 billion more overnight. Some analysts partially credited Ms. Porat's May arrival at Google with market-pleasing belt-tightening that was evident in the results.

Google's stock-market value is more than $400 billion, compared with Morgan Stanley's $78 billion.

Technology firms' rise have forced Wall Street to rethink its ways in the name of keeping scarce talent. Some private-equity firms have backed off policies that force their newest hires to obtain M.B.A.s, partly because technology startups and venture-capital firms offer Ivy Leaguers attractive alternatives that often consider expensive business degrees optional.

Several Wall Street firms have adopted rules aimed at reducing the famously long hours spent in the office by their latest recruits to combat burnout and attrition.

Wall Street recruiters and executives say technology companies have boosted competition for workers of all ranks. "There's no border on industries any longer," said Michael Goodman, managing partner of Long Ridge Partners, which recruits employees for investment firms. "Smart is smart."

Still, these moves don't always work out. Greg Smithies decamped for Silicon Valley in 2010, disillusioned with the financial industry after its near collapse. He left Citigroup Inc. to join a venture investing firm. Now, Mr. Smithies is back in New York, working at a three-year-old data analytics firm.

"On the West Coast, you see a lot of news reports of startup founders becoming billionaires before they're 40," the 31-year-old said. "People want to live the dream, but the reality is that you'll end up at a startup and make between $100,000 and $150,000 a year as an engineer, and the startup will go under."

Mr. Tosi's own Silicon Valley gambit isn't without risk. Airbnb's business model, which allows private owners to rent properties for short stays, has met resistance from some lawmakers, and past Internet booms have shown that technology-company valuations can shrivel as dramatically as they balloon.

In part, Mr. Tosi's decision gives him another chance to swing for the fences. He became Blackstone's CFO in 2008, shortly after the firm's stock-market debut, and helped steer its rise to becoming one of Wall Street's marquee firms. Blackstone manages about $333 billion on behalf of pensioners, endowments and the wealthy.

Airbnb began its courtship of Mr. Tosi in the spring, according to people familiar with the matter. It wasn't the first time Mr. Tosi had been approached by a technology company. Apple Inc. made a fruitless attempt to hire him in 2010, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Tosi, who in his 30s was Merrill Lynch & Co.'s CFO, chose Airbnb becuase it is a nascent company that he can help shape, while the other technology companies that have tried to lure him were more developed, like Blackstone, according to a person familiar with his decision.

Known inside Blackstone as "L.T.," he has long had a tech bent and an entrepreneurial streak, Blackstone President Hamilton "Tony" James said in an interview. He introduced back-office technology there and helped develop a pair of financial-data companies in which Blackstone invested, and it was known within the firm that he hoped to someday run a technology company.

"Even though he loved Blackstone, that was his aspiration," Mr. James said. "We accepted that, we managed around it and we built around it."

How Our Days Became Numbered: Risk and the Rise of the Statistical Individual

By Dan Bouk (University of Chicago Press, 28/$40)

The unemployed lumber worker whose 1939 portrait adorns the cover of How Our Days Became Numbered has a "face fit for a film star", as Dan Bouk puts it. But he is not there for his looks. Bouk wants us to focus on his bulging bicep, across which is tattooed "SSN 535-07-5248": his social security number.

The photograph of Thomas Cave by documentary photographer Dorothea Lange illustrates the high water mark of American respect for statistical labelling. Cave was so proud of his newly issued number that he had it inked forever on his arm.

When the Roosevelt administration introduced the federal social security system in the 1930s, it worked out rates of contribution and benefit on the basis of statistical practices already established by life insurance companies. The industry is at the heart of Bouk's history of personal data collection and analysis - because it worked out how to measure and predict the health of ordinary Americans in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Life insurers took a financial grip on US middle classes from the 1830s. Their agents convinced male professionals and businessmen of the "need to replace themselves, at least in a monetary sense, upon their deaths, to ensure that their wives . . . never had to work and that their children would not become orphaned wards of the state," Bouk writes.

To qualify for a policy, the applicant had to submit to an investigation by the agent about his age, habits and finances; to agree to set a value on his life; and to undergo a medical examination. In exchange for economic security, applicants allowed themselves to become "commodified risks". The number of Americans in the insurers' corporate files exceeded 10m by 1900.

By the 1930s life insurance was woven so deeply into the nation's economic fabric that, when the Great Depression bit, many families were prepared to maintain their policies at almost any cost. A popular view, quoted by Bouk, was: "We'll give up everything except our life insurance. We can't let that go."

The industry was in better shape to ride out such an economic crisis than when many companies failed in the downturn following the Panic of 1873. Much of Bouk's excellent work deals with the mathematical and actuarial engineering that insurers undertook between the two depressions to fortify their finances and expand their customer base.

At the heart of the exercise was probabilistic risk assessment: predicting the likely longevity of applicants by combining individual medical histories with population-based statistics. Frederick Hoffman of Prudential Insurance toured 100 cemeteries in the southern states with a portable typewriter, gathering birth and death dates of 100,000 people.

The data analysis led to important conclusions that had eluded academic researchers. For instance, in 1908 Brandreth Symonds, medical director of the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York, warned that contrary to contemporary medical opinion, it was healthier to be thin than fat. Though weight loss was then associated with tuberculosis, overweight people suffered more premature mortality because of their higher rates of heart and kidney disease and diabetes.

Bouk, a historian at New York's Colgate University, brings out the racial tensions intrinsic to the mortality data. Black Americans lived shorter lives, on average, as a result of worse living conditions, and insurers penalised them as a group by offering less favourable terms without regard for individual circumstances. After the civil war, black activists challenged the assumption that past data reliably predicted a group's future mortality. Some states passed laws to stop this sort of discrimination, upon which many companies refused to insure African-Americans at all.

The detailed narrative stops with the second world war, though Bouk includes an epilogue showing how the statistical foundations of risk management, laid down by life insurers and then by government on paper and cards, led later in the 20th century to a " big data " explosion as computers and electronic storage took over. Americans were never again as happy to be numbered and analysed as they had been in 1939.

When the Firm Is Wired but the Office Isn t; New York s quirky old loft buildings make cool offices, but connectivity can be primitive

By now, it is a given in New York City that many companies in the tech and advertising sectors prefer older loft buildings in nontraditional office neighborhoods, where they offer millennial workers must-haves such as coffee bars and Ping-Pong tables.

But finding all that in a building with robust Internet options can be tricky to pull off.

Internet capacity can vary widely from building to building, especially in neighborhoods populated with the funky loft spaces coveted by creative firms, technology consultants and brokers said.

 You can't tell from a pretty lobby or trust somebody's pitch about the building, no matter how earnest that pitch might be," said Arie Barendrecht, CEO and co-founder of WiredScore, which evaluates and rates office buildings for the speed and reliability of Internet connections as well as the choice of Internet providers offered.  There are lots of challenges and variation in connectivity, and not all are obvious."

Some buildings may have limited options from which to choose broadband Internet service providers, and downloading and uploading speeds could be slower than expected. Others may have wiring to the network beneath the street at only one point of entry, with no alternative to serve as a backup if it is damaged. Often the preferred fiber wiring is inside the building but not connected to the tenant's floor.

Among other concerns is the lack of well-managed, centralized places where new tenants can connect easily to provider networks, said Wes Rudes, executive director at real-estate-services firm Cushman & Wakefield Inc. Access fees that some landlords charge Internet service providers can also dissuade them from wiring buildings.

 We want to provide cost-effective services," said Shrihari Pandit, co-owner of Stealth Communications, an Internet service provider.  So it makes it difficult for us to enter buildings who ask us to pay fees."

Anticipating hurdles, tenants like PhotoShelter have become savvy when scouting out new office space.

The 10-year-old company, which offers a digital-archival and management system for large users of photography, plans to give itself plenty of time to find a new office before the lease at its Union Square location expires at the end of next year, said co-founder Jeffrey Arnold. Several years ago, he said, he waited 18 months for the company's Internet-service provider to install a fiber-optic connection.

While the city's modern skyscrapers typically have the high-speed connections PhotoShelter needs,  tech businesses like ours generally don't want to be in those buildings," said Mr. Arnold, whose staff generally resides in Brooklyn and the Lower East Side.  One of the things we use to hire is the quirkiness of the building."

To be sure, many of the city's leading landlords have experience housing large companies with big data needs. They have brought in multiple Internet service providers, carved out space for rooftop wireless connections, and improved their building's cellular networks, real-estate executives said.

A number of those owners highlight their WiredScore rankings in their marketing to set them apart from competitors.

The landmarked Empire State Building has a platinum WiredScore rating the highest level, for its Internet capacity. Completed in 1931, the skyscraper has attracted tenants such as media company Shutterstock Inc. and social-media giant LinkedIn Corp.

 We use all of these different attributes, so tenants have a choice," said Anthony Malkin, chief executive of Empire State Realty Trust Inc., owner of the Empire State Building.  If you only have one service provider, your tenant could be held hostage."

In 2013, WiredScore, which has expanded its service to about 50 cities, including London, opened for business with support from the New York City Economic Development Corp. The company lists the ranked certification levels of New York City commercial buildings on its website for businesses to view.

The Economic Development Corp. also maintains an online map of broadband service at commercial buildings in the city, allowing businesses to submit requests for Internet service to as many as a dozen Internet providers. And recently it announced it is working with two Internet service providers to build a broadband network in four industrial business zones, including the southwest Brooklyn and the Greenpoint and Williamsburg industrial sections.

Over time, commercial-property owners across the spectrum are becoming more aware of tenants' increasing Internet needs.

Brokers now routinely ask about the quality of a building's Internet connections.

 That's how you penetrate the consciousness of owners, because they begin to realize it's a factor in the decision-making process," said Mary Ann Tighe, chief executive of the New York tri-state region for CBRE Group Inc., a real-estate-services firm.

Caspi Development Co. knew reliable Internet service would be important in luring the tenants it wanted for a revamped, seven-story Lower East Side building it bought and renovated last year. Mounted on a wall in the lobby is a street-level roll gate painted by a graffiti artist, and elsewhere are kitchenettes with beer taps.

The company consulted with WiredScore on what it would take to attain a high certification ranking for the property. Caspi then hired Stealth Communications to wire the building with fiber to every floor and install a fiber connection to its Internet network in the street outside. Caspi also plans to add a high-speed wireless connection to its roof.

Not long after the renovations were completed last fall, Caspi signed leases with new tenants, including tech company Kik Interactive Inc.

 The rating system is definitely a vital piece of leasing agents' ability to market a building and gain business," said principal Joshua Caspi.  I don't think [new tenants] would have come to the building without the fiber."

Alibaba conceives online solution to sperm shortage; China: Fertility

Ecommerce group's marketing savvy helps increase donations

Alibaba has used the internet to revolutionise the country's retail, banking and transport markets, and now China's ecommerce juggernaut has turned its attentions to curing a shortage of sperm.

Amid spiralling infertility rates, sperm banks across China have been running dry. Both worsening environmental conditions and hectic work schedules have taken their toll on male fertility in China, experts say.

According to a 2012 study by the China Population Association, a state agency, 12.5 per cent of Chinese couples are infertile, or roughly 40m-50m.

Enter Alibaba, whose Groupon-like website Juhuasuan markets everything from underwear to insurance. The ecommerce group's move into boosting sperm donation features a big banner advertisement boasting a phallic cartoon candle exploding into a white cloud, bearing the Chinese character for "semen" in bold lettering.

"Avid concentration" the ad reads, with a pun on the character jing , which in Chinese means both "mind" and "sperm".

During the donation drive, Alibaba offered men payments of up to $800 for successful sperm donations.

Posted between July 15-17, the banner ads produced 22,000 new registrants for the seven participating provincial sperm banks, equivalent to nearly a year's worth of traffic for some of the centres.

"This exceeded all expectations," said Wang Zhiqiang, director of the state sperm bank for Guanxi province. "On average, we get about 300 donors a year, but during the three days of the Juhuasuan event, more than 1,000 people signed up. Assuming 20 per cent of them donate, that it 200 new donors."

The serious mismatch in supply and demand for sperm has prompted donation centres to overcome many taboos in tradition-bound China. In April, the shortage had become so dire in Hubei province that the regional sperm bank turned to Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, to broadcast: "Under-achievers! This is your opportunity! Hubei Sperm Bank is badly in need of sperm," it said.

The shortage of sperm donations is partly due to stringent requirements for donors - roughly one in five are acceptable - but mainly because men in China have "shyness about such topics", according to Mr Wang.

"We mainly try to get recruits by passing out flyers and holding awareness seminars, but we do not get enough qualified men," he said.

But Alibaba has made a speciality out of taking dysfunctional markets and overcoming everything from supply bottlenecks to onerous government regulations and low demand. It has done so in areas such as finance and taxis.

Matching sellers with the masses of online traffic is the company's speciality, usually combining with a bit of fun, marketing savvy, big data, and most importantly in the case of sperm donation, anonymity.

"People feel shy and embarrassed when we meet them face to face," said Mr Wang.

But he said that marketing via the internet added a layer of privacy that makes previously forbidden topics acceptable.

"Online, when they don't have to face a human being, they are more comfortable, and this is a major reason why this project is a success," he said, adding: "We don't know whether they will actually come in or not."
