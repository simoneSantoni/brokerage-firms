More than 20 years ago, one of my first bosses in journalism proudly told me on my first day in my new job as a political correspondent in the Westminster lobby: "I never drink alcohol." He then paused for effect and added with a mischievous smile: "Or not before 11am in the morning."

So what does this anecdote, one of my favourites in more than 30 years of journalism, have to do with fund management? Rather a lot, if technology developed by a new start-up, which launches this week, becomes popular with traders and fund managers. The start-up, which has the backing of two of the world's biggest investment groups, could also transform the debate over active and passive fund managers in favour of the former, or at least some of the former.

The technology is designed to help fund managers work out when they perform best. Do they make their best trades in the morning after two cups of coffee? Do they function better on their own in a quiet room rather than a big open-plan office, buzzing with people, or do they come back from a liquid lunch invigorated and inspired, ready to make their best decisions?

My old boss was a superb journalist when he was sober before 11am, the copy deadline of the Scottish newspaper he worked for. After that, when he would decamp to the bar, he was totally unreliable, awash with drink. For him, it was a simple matter of writing and filing his stories when he was on top of his game. He avoided even talking to his news editors after that time, when stringing two words together, let alone writing an intro of supreme prose, was often beyond him.

But for fund managers, knowing when you are at your best may not be as simple. This is where Essentia Analytics, the start-up founded by Clare Flynn Levy, a star active fund manager herself when she worked for Morgan Grenfell in the 1990s, may help improve performance, aligning it more closely with skill rather than leaving decisions to chance and pot luck.

Essentia will offer a website that enables fund managers to key in information, from how much analysis they have carried out on a company, to when and where they were and the mood they were in when they bought or sold a particular stock or bond. In theory, this will help them work out how to repeat their successes and avoid their failures. She has already signed up two big clients, Man Group, the world's second-biggest hedge fund, and a US investment group, also one of the largest in the world, with more than $300bn under management.

Niall Gallagher, whose two European equity funds have consistently produced some of the industry's best returns for GAM, the Swiss fund manager, says knowing your limitations and creating the most favourable environment to work in is essential for making the right choices in stock selection. He believes that thoroughly analysing a company is critical. Is it a good business? Does it have a strong balance sheet with low debt levels? But he thinks behavioural, or psychological, factors are important too. For him, this means working in a quiet office with a small team of trusted colleagues. He also puts a lot of store in regular exercise, to keep fresh and motivated.

Most significantly, Ms Flynn Levy's product, if successful, could bolster the case for active fund management over passive , the index funds and trackers that slavishly follow the market. If fund managers can work out the ideal environment and circumstances for top performance, like my old boss, then they should beat their benchmarks. Of course, there will always be winners and losers, as fund management is a zero sum game.

But, if you want to make the most of your money, then this technology might help you pick the right active manager, making that extra fee compared with passive alternatives well worth paying.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
F&C Investment Trust suffers from being too small in Japan; Fund focus

Manager Jeremy Tigue is unsure if emerging markets offer value yet, says Eleanor Lawrie

F&C Investments' Jeremy Tigue, who runs the 2.7bn Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust, has admitted he missed out on the recent surge in Japanese stocks, calling it his "biggest mistake" of the year.

Japan has left other markets standing since last November, when Prime Minister Shinzo Abe began a successful general election campaign with the mandate of introducing a number of monetary-easing measures to devalue the yen and fuel economic growth.

From November 11 2012 to mid-September this year the Nikkei 225 index of leading Japanese shares rallied by roughly 60 per cent, compared with a 25 per cent rise in the MSCI World index of global shares.

But Mr Tigue had a 4.7 per cent weighting to Japan, an underweight position when compared with the 7.2 per cent of the trust's benchmark FTSE All World index, which the trust adopted as its benchmark at the start of 2013.

"I put my hands up and admit I got [Japan] completely wrong," he says.

"That's been my biggest mistake this year."

The manager has delivered returns of 16.5 per cent in the year to date, in line with his peers within the AIC Global Growth sector, according to FE Analytics.

Away from Japan, the manager says he has begun to brace his investment trust for a fall in markets and has removed some of the borrowing, which has contributed to the year-to-date performance.

Mr Tigue says the level of gearing, a form of borrowing that amplifies investment gains or losses, had been reduced to 12 per cent and would fall further to 10 per cent. The trust's board allows a maximum of 20 per cent - a ceiling the manager neared in 2011.

"We are definitely more cautious than we were a year ago, and in September 2011," he says.

"The eurozone was going down the tube [at that time] and US debt had been downgraded, which was a huge deal. But we thought that was ridiculous. Companies were still making a profit so we were pretty bullish and increased our gearing," he says.

He adds: "The opportunities that were there a year ago are not there now."

Mr Tigue's view extends to emerging markets. The manager says he is unsure if valuations have fallen enough to present buying opportunities. Stock prices are still "not that cheap", according to Mr Tigue.

The manager has 8.5 per cent of his portfolio exposed to emerging market stocks, compared with 15 per cent at the end of 2010.

Elsewhere, the manager says his fund would benefit from the expiry in December 2014 of a costly debenture, a 110m loan the trust took out at an interest rate of 11.25 per cent.

Mr Tigue says he and the board were "wrestling" with what to do with the money that will be at the trust's disposal once the debt instrument expires and interest payments stop. A note from Winterflood Securities, the market maker, says the debenture's market value would fall to par in December 2014, adding 15m or 2.5p per share to the net value of the trust's assets.

At AIG, Benmosche Steers a Steady Course

Going into the weekend about five years ago, the American financial system teetered on the edge of collapse as the government realized several major financial firms were "too big to fail" and needed to be rescued.

Robert Benmosche, chief executive of American International Group Inc., says that won't happen again.

"I believe 'too big to fail' has been solved," Mr. Benmosche, who wasn't at AIG's helm in 2008, said in an interview.

Many politicians and even Wall Street executives strongly dispute that, as some of the biggest banks have only gotten larger since the financial crisis. But Mr. Benmosche said his evaluation isn't based on size but his belief that it is virtually impossible for the country's top financial institutions to reach perilous condition, thanks to "stress tests" and other regulatory measures that monitor the biggest risks firms are taking.

In AIG's case, he said, if the firm's traders now tried the strategies that were put in place ahead of the crisis, "you would have whistles going off all over the place: 'This place is going to sink!' "

In one of his most detailed interviews on AIG's response to the crisis, Mr. Benmosche solidified his reputation as one of the most outspoken executives on Wall Street. He reiterated his defense of the bonuses paid to AIG's traders after the bailout, saying critics complained out of "ignorance"; took shots at competitors, including Warren Buffett, who may see AIG as vulnerable; and vowed that the company won't be "intimidated" by regulators.

AIG was taken over by the government in September 2008 in a bailout that committed up to $182 billion in aid, and Mr. Benmosche, former chief executive at MetLife Inc., was brought in the following summer to steady the company and help repay U.S. taxpayers. The last of the bailout was repaid in December, to the surprise of many who had predicted the government would lose big on the package.

In stabilizing AIG, the 69-year-old Mr. Benmosche has stripped it of some of the derring-do that led its now-defunct financial-products unit to make large bets on the housing market. He resisted any suggestion that the company has lost its entrepreneurial energy and boasted of the company's investment in "Big Data" projects that aim to sharpen AIG's underwriting and reduce risk.

"What we're doing is based a lot more on technology and science and less on intuition," he said.

But Mr. Benmosche also drastically shrunk the company to repay the government. Today, AIG is just over half the size it used to be before the crisis, with about 63,000 employees and $65.7 billion in annual revenue. Its core is a world-wide property-casualty insurance operation and a U.S. life-insurance and retirement-services business. In August, AIG announced the reinstatement of a common-stock dividend and a stock-buyback program. The stock price, at almost $50, has more than doubled in the past two years but is still down more than 90% from its precrisis level.

Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is among the companies that have made forays into coverage areas favored by AIG. Mr. Benmosche said he welcomed the competition, saying Berkshire can't match AIG's track record.

To many Americans, AIG still is less known as an insurance powerhouse than as the financial giant that helped to push the economy into a recession.

In some ways, AIG's 2008 problems were analogous to the "London whale" trading debacle that has engulfed J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Both were caused by a small group of employees -- in AIG's case, Mr. Benmosche said, the number of traders was less than 10 -- but the damage at AIG was like "a whole sea of whales. The problem was they were going to eat all the other fish in the tank."

By comparison, Mr. Benmosche said J.P. Morgan's losses posed no systemic risk. He said big financial firms need to use derivatives to hedge risks, and sometimes those maneuvers will go wrong and result in losses of "a billion here, a billion there."

Mr. Benmosche said he believes the government bailout was the appropriate move. "There is no way the financial system would be here today" if the government hadn't stepped in, he said. He remains displeased at some of the measures, in particular, the government's attempt to withhold bonuses for many employees, a move he said came from "ignorance" about how finance professionals are paid.

AIG isn't yet out from under the cloud of the crisis. The New York Department of Financial Services, led by Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky, is scrutinizing whether the company is managing risk properly in disposing of the remaining toxic housing-market bets.

"I believe we've satisfied their requests [for information.] They aren't sure we have," Mr. Benmosche said. The company notes that the Federal Reserve already keeps eight employees at AIG offices. "We are going to do what is right. We aren't going to be intimidated" by competing regulators, he said.

A spokesman for Mr. Lawsky's office said, "It's not necessarily surprising that AIG might want less scrutiny. . .but we have a responsibility to taxpayers to make sure that history doesn't repeat itself at AIG."

U.S. News --- THE OUTLOOK: Rethinking Fannie -- And the 30-Year Loan

By Nick Timiraos

Washington is finally talking seriously about how to replace Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage-finance juggernauts that the government was forced to rescue five years ago. Just don't expect quick action.

The firms are about as unpopular as the Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba -- and they've proved just as hard to shut down. Republicans and Democrats are deeply divided over what to do. On the surface, the disagreements concern what role the government should play in the mortgage market.

But the real debate boils down to this: Should all Americans continue to have relatively easy access to the pre-payable, 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage?

American homeowners love the 30-year mortgage, which isn't available in most other countries. It provides payments that are stable for the life of the loan, which makes finances easier to manage. In many other countries, homes are financed with adjustable-rate mortgages, where payments rise and fall with prevailing interest rates.

The government plays an unusually large role in the U.S. mortgage market because banks don't like holding 30-year mortgages. During the 1980s, many savings-and-loan associations failed when rates jumped because the interest they had to pay to depositors soared above the payments they received on those 30-year mortgages. This is known as "interest-rate risk."

Enter Fannie and Freddie. They don't make loans. Instead, they buy them from lenders, package them into securities, and sell those to investors. They promise to make investors whole when mortgages default. In other words, they take the credit risk.

This middleman role is important. It matches banks with pension funds and other investors that are more willing to take on the interest-rate risk. The companies also set uniform standards that facilitated very liquid securities markets. The 30-year mortgage is available mainly because of government guarantees -- implied before the crisis and explicit since 2008.

Those who want the government out of the mortgage business say the 30-year fixed isn't all it's cracked up to be. Because borrowers pay a lot of interest during the first few years of the loan, it's hard to quickly build equity. This makes the loan less practical in an era where people move, switch jobs, and get divorced more often than in the past.

Defenders, however, say it's the wrong time to push more people into adjustable-rate loans because interest rates are likely to rise over the coming decade.

Wouldn't banks still offer the 30-year fixed mortgage without a government guarantee if it's so popular? Maybe, but they would likely require bigger down payments and higher rates.

It's a math issue. There is nearly $10 trillion in mortgage debt outstanding today with around $4.5 trillion backed by Fannie and Freddie. Scrapping the government's role means finding trillions of dollars ready to absorb the credit and interest-rate risk for new mortgages, since the firms have backed around two-thirds of those made since 2009.

Of course, every overhaul plan calls for more private capital. That goal faces three challenges:

First, private capital had a lousy track record during the bubble. Loans securitized without government backing performed worse than Fannie's or Freddie's, largely because investors relied too heavily on triple-A ratings. Between 2006 and 2012, Fannie, Freddie, and federal agencies suffered $206 billion in mortgage losses, or around 3.9% of all loans they guaranteed, according to data from Moody'sAnalytics. Privately issued securities, by contrast, faced $449 billion in losses, or 20% of all loans.

Second, a mostly private market could further concentrate lending in the largest banks -- exacerbating the "too big to fail" problem. In 2008, the top five banks in Canada, the U.K. and Australia, for example, funded more than half of all mortgages. During the crisis, many European banks were viewed as implicitly guaranteed by the government. In the U.S., pushing more mortgages into federally insured banks also doesn't get the government off the hook, a lesson already learned during the S&L crises of the 1980s.

Third, private capital takes on more risk in good times but exits quickly at the first sign of trouble. This tends to magnify the boom-and-bust nature of real estate. Downturns are worse because credit is hardest to find when it's most needed.

During the bank runs of the Great Depression, panicked depositors pulled their money from banks, afraid that the institutions wouldn't survive. In 2007, the mortgage market faced its own series of runs as investors liquidated their mortgage bonds, unsure over the quality of loans backing their investments. Securitization markets are particularly vulnerable to runs because the first seller suffers the smallest loss.

Several overhaul proposals propose creating federal reinsurance for mortgage-backed securities. Any government guarantee would be explicit and paid for by investors, akin to deposit insurance provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

Government insurance solves some problems while creating others. Chiefly, taxpayers could face losses if capital levels or fees are set too low for this new insurance.

Fannie and Freddie, which held far too little capital to withstand the downturn, had for years argued successfully that higher capital standards translated to more costly mortgages, meaning less homeownership. Today, some worry that the housing industry would eventually make similar arguments for lower fees.

No one said an overhaul would be easy. Ultimately, Washington will have to be honest about what it wants and what that will cost.

Corporate News: Investors Boost Tech IPOs

The last name of Adam Hils, a researcher on cybersecurity technology at Gartner Inc., was incorrectly given as Hills in a Corporate News article on Saturday about technology IPOs.

(WSJ September 25, 2013)

(END)

Shares of Internet security firm FireEye Inc. soared on their first day of trading Friday, benefiting from investor interest in the security sector following some high-profile hacks at companies and government agencies in recent years.

The successful initial public offering comes even as some question whether the market can support so many antihacking companies, many of which rely on similar technology.

Meanwhile, another hot IPO by Rocket Fuel Inc. suggests that investors also are optimistic about some advertising-technology companies.

Both companies' shares more than doubled in early trading Friday, though they gave back some of those gains later in the trading session.

FireEye, a Silicon Valley company led by veteran software executive Dave DeWalt, priced its first round of shares Thursday at $20, raising $280 million. The stock closed at $36, up 80%, giving it a market capitalization of about $4.2 billion.

The valuation might seem high for a company with $83.3 million in revenues in 2012. Mr. DeWalt said the "evil emanating from the Internet" is creating a surge in spending for companies like FireEye. "There's going to be a tectonic shift in spending and someone is going to get that," he said. "We have as good a chance as anybody."

Mr. DeWalt's past exploits include selling McAfee, a bigger security company known for antivirus software, to Intel Corp. for $7.68 billion. Last year he joined FireEye, which was founded in 2004. He now holds stock worth nearly $166 million at Friday's closing price.

FireEye seeks to block the most advanced hackers by observing the behavior of their code, rather than the longtime approach of matching incoming software with known malicious programs. It does this by testing code downloaded onto a computer in a sort of digital petri dish walled off from the rest of the network.

In theory, this allows the company to block dangerous code never seen before -- called a "Zero-Day" attack -- simply because it acts like something up to no good.

However, many larger companies, including Trend Micro Inc. of Japan, Palo Alto Networks Inc. and AhnLab Inc. of South Korea -- use similar approaches and are improving their products, some security experts say.

"It's a bit of a bubble," said Adam Hills, a researcher on cybersecurity technology at Gartner Inc., of the buzz around FireEye. "If they're going to be a viable product company, they need to broaden their portfolio and they're doing that."

"There is a limit to what the market can absorb," said investor Ted Schlein, whose firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers has invested in many security companies.

FireEye has already expanded its offerings, and they work on servers and data centers instead of just individual machines, according to Mr. DeWalt.

For the six months ended June 2013, FireEye reported a $67.2 million loss. Its revenue for the same period more than doubled to $61.6 million.

Like other companies that offer software as a subscription service, FireEye books much of its revenue over time rather than as it cuts sales deals.

Shares of advertising firm Rocket Fuel, meanwhile, shot up 83% to close at $56.10 in its first trading session Friday.

Most ad technology companies operate networks in which advertisers and publishers talk to each other about when and where to place ads. Rocket Fuel, founded in 2008, instead primarily serves advertisers with an artificial-intelligence program that makes rapid decisions about when and where to place ads.

George John, Rocket Fuel's chief executive and co-founder, said that talking about Rocket Fuel's big data use "really helped" with general tech investors on the roadshow. "A lot of people were talking about big data, and a lot of them wanted to know more about the [artificial intelligence] business on top of it," he said.

Should You Hold Alternative Investments?

Finding a decent yield has been tough in recent months, which has made alternative investments attractive for some investors. But is the hype justified?

With this in mind we asked The Experts: Do you recommend individuals hold "alternative" investments? And if so, which ones?

This discussion relates to a recent Journal Report article on whether alternatives have lost their diversification value and formed the basis of a discussion on The Experts blog on Sept. 7.

GUS SAUTER: Alternative funds, such as hedge funds, are more sexy than standard mutual funds. And, for some investors, they might provide some marginal advantage to their portfolio. However, I don't believe they are appropriate for most investors.

First, how will you identify the best funds or managers? While some alts have produced very impressive results, many have not.

How will you get access to the best funds? Several years ago, when I was at Vanguard, a manager of a sovereign-wealth fund asked me how they could identify the best alt funds. My response was to look for the ones that are closed. Remember, you're not Yale or Harvard.

Do you have the ability to invest in an illiquid investment, and in some cases, even pony up more money, as some funds may require?

Finally, alts can be extremely expensive. Let me repeat, extremely expensive. Don't automatically assume that the manager has the ability to earn back excessive fees and provide you with a premium return.

Certainly, there are some good alts, but most investors can't overcome the issues I mentioned above.

George U. "Gus" Sauter is a senior consultant to Vanguard Group Inc. where he was chief investment officer from 2003 through 2012.

MICHELLE PERRY HIGGINS: I believe that "alternative" investments can be a strong choice for certain portfolios. Throughout history, we have seen periods where alternatives have had a low correlation to traditional assets, thus lowering risk and increasing diversification. However, it is important to note that these investment choices are typically more complex, can have higher fees, offer less liquidity and may frustrate investors in good market times. Because these investments are nontraditional by definition, alternatives are not a one-size-fits-all solution. It would therefore take a thorough understanding of an investor's risk tolerance, long-term goals and objectives before making a recommendation.

Michelle Perry Higgins (@RetirementMPH) is a financial planner and principal at California Financial Advisors.

CHARLES ROTBLUT: The overwhelming majority of investors should focus on finding an optimal mix of stocks, bonds and cash that they can stick with during both bull and bear markets. Accomplishing this task will do more to improve investment success than including any other asset class or investment strategy ever will.

But let's say someone has successfully adhered to this basic long-term allocation strategy. Then I would say that allocating a small portion of the portfolio would make sense. Foreign currency funds, gold and preferred stocks can all add alternative return characteristics for considerably less expense than most of the alternative funds being marketed heavily to advisers right now.

Some alternative funds might make sense, but I would take a hard look at their expenses and the length of their histories (many have been formed after the last bear market). Personally, I would use a wait-and-see approach to see how alternative they really are once the next bear market occurs. Even if it is a long wait, which we hope it will be, doing so will give you the opportunity to truly judge these funds' performance without putting your money on the line.

Charles Rotblut (@charlesrotblut) is a vice president with the American Association of Individual Investors.

MATT HOUGAN: No. Most of them are designed to extract higher fees from investors, not to deliver better returns. But if you want VIX-linked-hedge-fund-replicating-Treasury-spread-betting-frontier-markets-momentum-overlay funds, knock yourself out.

Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) is president of ETF analytics and global head of editorial for IndexUniverse LLC.

TOM BRAKKE: Like other investment products, so-called "alternatives" are promoted based upon past performance results and some notion of "risk" that means more to statisticians than it should to investors. Many people have piled into alternatives (basically defined as everything other than traditional stocks and bonds) of late.

There is a faddishness to it, with institutional investors becoming enamored of "the endowment model" (also known as "the Yale model") and advisers and individuals trying to get in on the act, too. It seems the thing to do.

What's striking to me is that there is also a hint of desperation, with those investing in alternatives often saying that "there's no place else to go," that stocks and bonds don't offer an attractive relationship between risk and reward. If you really think that stocks and bonds are that unattractive, cash will probably beat both of them and alternatives, too.

Careful research and selection of alternatives can turn up some attractive opportunities, but that's not the way the game is being played. Money is being thrown at this loose confederation of investments, with fancy fees being paid along the way. My advice: Invest in them judiciously and as cheaply as you can or not at all.

Tom Brakke (@researchpuzzler) is a consultant, writer and investment adviser who specializes in the analysis of investment decision making and the communication of investment ideas.

RICK FERRI: Alternative investment is a contradiction in terms. Alternative is defined as the choice between two mutually exclusive possibilities. This would mean that you're either investing or you're not. I suppose stuffing money in a mattress might be considered an alternative investment, which I don't recommend.

A second definition of alternative is to be different from the usual or conventional. People say that commodities, currencies and real estate are different from the usual stocks and bonds. Yet, trading in commodities, currencies and real estate has existed for thousands of years. Those markets are much older than the alternative and relatively new stock and bond markets.

Enough silliness. I do not invest in any asset that doesn't pay cash flow, or has an expected long-term return that's no higher than the inflation rate. This means no gold, no commodities and no currency trading. The only "alternative" I like is real estate because it generates cash flow from rents. That's why I own a low-cost REIT index fund.

Rick Ferri is founder of Portfolio Solutions LLC and the author of six books on low-cost index-fund and ETF investing. His blog is RickFerri.com.

GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS: I do not recommend "alternative" investments. They are just not worth the inherent risks they carry. They tend to be complex, illiquid, nontransparent, hard to value and very expensive. Will investors be compensated enough to overcome the fees and lack of transparency and liquidity? Maybe, but I certainly would not invest my money in these products, so why would I ever recommend to my clients that they should? Even with those products that bring immediate positive results, the longer out you go, the lower the chance that they will outshine a properly diversified, low-cost, regularly rebalanced portfolio.

Lately I am seeing a lot of efforts by companies to push all kinds of "alternative" investments. I wonder if the reason is the high commissions paid to their salespeople. As a fiduciary adviser I do not sell investment products and I cringe when I hear the enthusiastic pitches about some of them. Next time you are asked to invest in this "opportunity," do yourself a favor and ask how much commission the salesperson will be paid. Ask about one-time and annual costs. Tell them to send you their reply in writing on a single sheet of paper on the company's letterhead. You may never see some of these people again, which is great!

Also, before you buy one of these investments, please inform your CPA. Find out how he feels about it and how much your tax preparation bill will go up. They can be maddeningly complex come tax time and very difficult to do any tax planning around.

Finally, we like to deal with boring investment portfolios that yield as little excitement as possible. In a previous column I advocated that investing should be as exciting as watching paint dry. Investing in any of these alternative products may instead cause sleepless nights and/or heart attacks. No, thank you, we will pass.

TERRANCE ODEAN: No.

With so many investment services geared toward the wealthy, it can be tough for average investors to find decent investment advice.

So we asked The Experts: How can people with limited assets and income get good investment advice?

This discussion relates to a recent Journal Report article on using the internet to find good investment advice and formed the basis of a discussion on The Experts blog on Sept. 6.

GUS SAUTER: There are a variety of ways to get good advice. It may not be customized, or tailored precisely for any particular individual, but as long as one's risk tolerance isn't either extremely conservative or extremely aggressive, an investor can assemble an effective investment strategy.

For investors who are self provisioners and want to create their own portfolio, there is a wealth of education available online. While many people think investing is hard, it doesn't have to be. Just remember three major principles balance, diversification, low cost. And think long term. Many mutual-fund companies provide tremendous education on their websites for do-it-yourselfers.

For those who don't want to be actively engaged in creating an investment plan, there are a number of mutual funds that essentially provide advice in a product. These so called target retirement funds or target-date funds are designed to be one-stop shopping and represent the fund company's best thinking for asset allocation for an investor of a certain age. For example, a 2050 target retirement fund is designed for someone who will turn 65 in 2050, or a year close to that. Such a fund would likely have a pretty aggressive allocation today, reflecting the investor's young age (28). The fund will become more conservative as the investor ages, reflecting the investor's declining ability to take risk as she gets older. These funds can be very effective for investors that don't have large or complex portfolios.

George U. "Gus" Sauter is a senior consultant to Vanguard Group Inc. where he was chief investment officer from 2003 through 2012.

ALEXA VON TOBEL: While it can be hard to distill the "good" information, there is a wealth of investment guidance available online. I would advise people to start by learning the basics of investing. Investing is an industry crowded with complex lingo often designed to be confusing. Before you dive into implementing any advice, it is key to understand the basics (e.g., discount vs. full-service brokerages, ETFs vs. mutual funds).

Next, it is critical (let me repeat, critical) to assess your overall financial situation to see whether you are even in a position to invest. Do you have any debt to tackle first? And do you have an emergency savings account set up with enough cash to cover your living expenses for six-plus months (or more if you have a family)? If your financial foundation is in check and you're looking to invest for the long term, then it makes sense to seek out more active support around investing.

With the rise of fintech companies, there are now affordable fee-only options for investment guidance, which make advice accessible to people at a wide range of asset and income levels. It's important to look for a service that is fee-only (instead of companies that charge for a percentage of assets  which skim a percentage of your potential earnings). It's also important to find an adviser who is not biased, someone whose salary is not tied to your ability to buy the products the adviser may be pushing.

Historically, investment advice has been reserved for the incredibly wealthy. But in order to amass wealth, access to that advice is critical. Average investors should take advantage of the innovation that technology is bringing to the space.

Alexa von Tobel (@alexavontobel) is the founder and CEO of LearnVest.com.

MATT HOUGAN: The good news is you can get better advice and better portfolios at lower costs today than ever before.

My favorite solution? Wealthfront. It's a Silicon Valley startup that offers incredibly well-constructed portfolios through a technological interface at ridiculously low costs. It charges $0 for accounts less than $10,000 and 0.25% for accounts larger than that. For that, you get all-ETF portfolios based on the latest in modern portfolio theory, managed by investing legend Burton Malkiel (author of "A Random Walk Down Wall Street"). The service includes tax-loss harvesting and regular rebalancing, with zero commissions and zero custodial costs. The tax-loss harvesting alone will more than pay for the fee.

You could easily pay a financial adviser 2%, and in 99 out of 100 cases you would get worse portfolios, worse service and worse outcomes (assuming they would even take your call if you didn't have $250k to invest!).

Wealthfront is an incredibly good solution for people with normal bank accounts, and a good solution even for those who are quite wealthy.

(I am not in any way affiliated with Wealthfront I'm just a big fan of what they do.)

MICHAEL KITCES: When you are in the early years of beginning to save and invest, the simple mathematical reality is that the fact you are saving and investing is far more important than how in particular you invest it. In other words, if you've just managed to save your first $2,000 for retirement, the primary benefit is that you actually added a whopping $2,000 to your retirement account, and not trying to generate an extra 1% return (which in the end, will only add up to $20 of "excess" return for the coming year). As your savings and account balance grows, eventually this dynamic begins to shift, and by the final years leading up to retirement the results of your portfolio are dominated by the returns, such that any volatility in the markets can lead to significant "retirement date" risk.

Given this dynamic, then, the best course of action in the early years is actually to focus primarily on getting into the habit of saving, and how to boost your "human capital" by earning more (in fact, when you're young it's often better to invest in your career than your retirement account anyway!), and to maintain a relatively simple portfolio so you can begin to get accustomed to the experience (and volatility) of investing.

That being said, sometimes a little help would be helpful, and there are some resources out there to consider. A number of firms and organizations have personal financial advisers that are specifically targeted at helping newer investors, including LearnVest and NestWise, and the financial planners available through the Garrett Planning Network. There are also a rising number of online tools that can help you get started building your first portfolio one of the simplest and easiest solutions is Betterment.

As your savings and investments grow over time, it will become increasingly important to make sure that you're on track towards your goals, and you may wish to explore a broader range of investment solutions. When you're getting started, though, the real keys are just to keep it simple, keep it low cost, get the help that you want and need and remember that the fact you are saving and continuing to build that habit will be the biggest determinant of your long-term financial success!

MICHELLE PERRY HIGGINS: Certainly The Wall Street Journal and The Experts panel are excellent sources. The Journal provides great financial information, and the investment advice given on this panel is appropriate for every income level and any size balance sheet. If an investor with limited resources came into my office and wasn't a perfect fit for me as a client, I would direct them to an investment firm such as Charles Schwab. These types of companies are easily accessible for most people with limited incomes and have capable financial consultants available to guide them with their investments.

Michelle Perry Higgins (@RetirementMPH) is a financial planner and principal at California Financial Advisors.

MIKE PIPER: Naturally, it depends somewhat on how limited the assets and income are.

As a writer, I am of course thoroughly biased here, but I think books are a good place to look for guidance. The cost of reading a few books is minimal, but the rewards can be significant especially for somebody who is just getting started and who can put the lessons to work over a very long period. If you compare two people at the beginning of their careers, one of whom takes the time to read and fully digest a few good books about investing and the other of whom does not, it's not at all unreasonable to think that the difference in their portfolio values by the time they retire would be a six-figure sum.

If you're looking for a good "getting started" book, you may want to consider "The Investor's Manifesto" by William Bernstein or "The Elements of Investing" by Burton Malkiel and Charles Ellis.

Of course, the drawback of books is that the advice they give is not in any way personalized, so at times it can be a challenge to figure out how to apply the generalized advice to your personal circumstances. If you're looking for personalized advice from a professional, I think one good place to look is the Garrett Planning Network a group of financial planners who do hourly fee engagements and who make a point of striving to be accessible to the middle-income market.

Finally, I can't pass up an opportunity to recommend the Bogleheads investment forum (named after John C. Bogle, the founder of Vanguard). It's an active community of well-informed DIY investors who are happy to share their time and knowledge. Regardless of your income or asset level, this is one resource you don't want to miss.

GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS: There are financial planners out there who specialize in working with people on an hourly consultation basis. Fellow WSJ Expert Sheryl Garrett's firm, Garrett Planning Network, has fiduciary fee-only planners all over the U.S. who do an excellent job, and I often recommend them. I know they put the client first and will not attempt to sell any products. No sales, just quality advice. Paying for a few hours for the help of a good financial planner every year can make a huge difference in financial success.

ELEANOR BLAYNEY: Just about anyone can afford an Internet connection these days. So it's no surprise that the Web is considered the best way for individuals without much money to get the information they need to start investing. Even those with significant income and wealth are attracted by the availability and low cost of financial websites as a primary source of guidance.

But while bursting with a gazillion bytes of information, the Internet cannot make individual eye contact or exercise judgment. For good investment advice, an expert is often needed by low-income, low-net-worth people, as much as by Bill Gates or Oprah.

Just an hour or two with a financial-planning professional can help an individual who is just starting out or has not accumulated significant wealth. With few resources, the individual does not need to consider a lot of investment choices or strategies. He needs advice that is simple, plain-vanilla, sturdy and reflective of his long-term goals. In fact, he may not need investment counsel at all to begin with, but advice on protecting the resources he has before he attempts to grow them.

The financial-planning profession is, I believe, changing to accommodate this need. There are professionals who are moving downstream to focus on those with limited financial means, including younger clients, certain minority groups and individuals in financial crisis, such as divorces.

Eleanor Blayney (@EleanorBlayney) is consumer advocate of the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards.

MANISHA THAKOR: "I don't have much money, how can I get help making what I do have grow?" Historically this has been the ultimate financial "chicken and the egg" conundrum. An adviser has only so many hours in a day to work. If utilizing a percent of assets under management fee structure, applying those hours to larger portfolios maximizes profitability. So larger portfolios are where the industry tended to focus. But thanks to technology and new ways of interacting with clients, there are firms that are cracking the code on how to provide solid investment advice to the mass market.

One of my favorite firms in this space is Betterment, which focuses on my preferred investment strategy the use of low-cost index funds and ETFs. I'd liken this firm to the Southwest Airlines or Target of financial services striving to provide a high-quality, low-cost customer-service-oriented experience to everyone.

In general, when it comes to getting financial advice when you have limited assets, the three things I'd suggest focusing on are: Identify the appropriate asset allocation for your situation, use low-cost investment solutions to implement that plan and, if needed, work with your adviser to adjust your budget to pay off any debt as fast as you can and rejigger your cash flow to live within your means and save for the future. Those three basic steps can go a long way towards putting you on the path to financial nirvana.

CHARLES ROTBLUT: The smaller the amount of wealth, the more resourceful an investor needs to be. Every dollar of expenses accounts for a proportionately larger percentage of assets as the amount of wealth decreases in size. So, the lesser one's wealth is, the more important it becomes to ensure the maximum benefit is realized for every dollar spent on fees and expenses.

This said, a person with lower levels of wealth does have options. There are many websites with various useful free financial and portfolio planning tools. For example, AAII has asset-allocation suggestions, T. Rowe Price has a great simulator for determining when and how to take Social Security benefits, Yahoo has a retirement budget tool, and Mint.com can help you track your spending so you might be able to figure out ways to save more.

Depending on the type of benefits package, a person's employer might have some useful resources. Additionally, some financial planners will work on a fee basis, and it may be worth paying the consultation fee if to get a good long-term strategy.

Charles Rotblut (@charlesrotblut) is a vice president with the American Association of Individual Investors.

RICK FERRI: Go to Bogleheads.org for advice. It's an online organization of knowledgeable investors who are ready to help anyone who asks. The site is operated by a nonprofit organization, so there is no commercialism and no hassles, and here is the best part it's free. You can read without logging on, but if you wish to ask a questions, you'll have to log on.

The Bogleheads site consists of the wiki and the forum. Both were built by volunteers who are dedicated to helping people begin or improve their investing journey through the application of sound investing principles. These values come from the investing philosophy of Vanguard founder Jack Bogle, who strives "to give ordinary investors a fair shake."

You won't find a better investing site on the Internet than Bogleheads.org. I've been an active member of the community for more than a decade.

Rick Ferri is founder of Portfolio Solutions LLC and the author of six books on low-cost index-fund and ETF investing. His blog is RickFerri.com.

TOM BRAKKE: Generally, I think that "people with limited assets and income" need planning advice much more than investment advice. (That's true for almost everyone, actually.) Pay down debt as fast as you can, save as much as you can and resist pie-in-the-sky investment projections and "opportunities."

It is unfortunate that sound financial advice can be hard to find unless you have something more than "limited assets and income." Start at the library and focus on savings and planning books first, rather than investment ones. There may also be charitable and governmental organizations that provide services for free, and some financial planners do pro bono work for those in need.

Tom Brakke (@researchpuzzler) is a consultant, writer and investment adviser who specializes in the analysis of investment decision making and the communication of investment ideas.

TERRANCE ODEAN: There are several online sources of basic investment advice as well as low-cost financial advisers. I don't know enough about any one of these to make recommendations. Good generic advice is to try to save 20% of your after-tax income, invest in low-cost, broad-based equity- and bond-index funds, such as total stock-market index funds or total bond-market index funds. The right mix of equities and bonds depends upon a person's goals, age, income, wealth and psychological ability to tolerate losses. Pay attention to fees. For U.S. equity- or bond-index funds, the expense ratios should 0.20% or less. If you are advised to pay higher fees, find better advice. If you are advised to buy Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), make sure that these funds track broad-based indexes and that you don't pay high commissions when buying them.

Andrew Hill looks at a shortlist that moves beyond the financial crisis

Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In , one of the most talked-about books of 2013, will do battle with a soon to be published history of the rise of Amazon, and an investigation into the impact of the Galleon hedge fund scandal, for the title of business book of the year.

The six finalists emerged from a longlist of 14 titles after an unusually bruising discussion among the seven judges of the Financial Times and Goldman Sachs Business Book of the Year Award.

Iain Martin's Making It Happen (about Royal Bank of Scotland), Neil Irwin's The Alchemists (on central bankers) and Alan Blinder's After The Music Stopped (about the US policy response) tested the panel's resolve not to overload the shortlist with books about the financial crisis. In the end, Blinder's book narrowly missed the cut despite support from several judges.

Lynda Gratton, a professor at London Business School, said Martin's book was as much as anything a "fascinating study of management" at the British bank, which came close to collapse five years ago. The Alchemists was praised by fellow judge and former UK minister Shriti Vadera for "saying something that's not been said" about the US and European central bankers who had to manage the meltdown.

Lean In , the Facebook chief operating officer's prescription for women to play a more active role in business, proved a lightning rod for debate about what one judge described as "the phenomenon" it has unleashed in the wider business and academic community.

Another finalist - Big Data by Viktor Mayer-Schnberger and Kenneth Cukier - was described by one of the judges, Vindi Banga, partner with Clayton Dubilier & Rice, as setting out the issue of how digital information will revolutionise business and society "better than I've ever heard expressed".

Another judge, Jorma Ollila, chairman of Royal Dutch Shell, also praised the "fascinating story" told by Brad Stone in his soon to be published book The Everything Store , about how Jeff Bezos built Amazon to dominate ecommerce.

The sixth shortlisted title was Anita Raghavan's The Billionaire's Apprentice , about the Galleon scandal and the Indian-American business elite. Last year's winner Steve Coll, the author of Private Empire , described it as a "piece of original journalism . . . with real drive".

The robust discussion at the shortlist stage leaves the outcome of the annual competition harder to call than for many years. The award will be presented on November 18 to the book that provides the "most compelling and enjoyable insight into modern business issues". The winner receives 30,000 and the runners-up receive 10,000 each.

Lionel Barber, FT editor and chair of the judges, said the shortlist struck a "good balance between the quality of writing and ability to stir a powerful debate".

The Property Report: Investors Widen Hunt For Europe Real Estate

By Sarah Krouse

Institutional investors in Western European property are getting bolder in their hunt for higher returns, testing new locations and asset classes.

Investors have been buying property in secondary cities and seeking prime real estate in the best locations in economically struggling European countries that, a year ago, were left to the most adventurous.

The volume of European commercial property deals in the first half of the year reached 66.3 billion euros ($88.4 billion), making it the strongest first half since 2008, according to property advisory firm Cushman & Wakefield. The consultancy said this was, in part, because investors have broadened their criteria.

While the focus on prime office or retail space hasn't disappeared, investors are now showing increased interest in car showrooms, health-care properties, logistics space, student housing, regional retailing and budget hotels.

For example, at the end of August, Legal & General Property acquired a portfolio of nine car showrooms in the U.K. on behalf of its UK Property Trust, which were yielding 6.33% at the time of the deal. The GBP 40 million ($63.6 million) deal was the U.K. fund manager's largest in the sector to date. It owns four other car showrooms in the U.K.

Legal & General Property also completed several deals in the student-housing sector this year and is looking for investments in the health-care sector. Parent company Legal & General Group PLC moved into house-building for the first time with its March acquisition of a 46.5% stake in CALA Group.

Simon Marrison, European chief executive officer at LaSalle Investment Management, says regional retail in the U.K. has become increasingly attractive to his firm.

"It's not glamorous retail; it's necessity retail, where you have a poorer catchment [area]-- one that doesn't necessarily have a computer at home, so you're not competing with online retail and a group that doesn't have a lot to do during the day," he says.

The volume of European retail-sector property deals rose more than 30% year-on-year to 16 billion euros in the first half of the year, according to Cushman & Wakefield.

Among the secondary cities that have seen an increase in the value of deals completed in the first half of this year, compared with the same period in 2012, are Hamburg and Hanover in Germany; Lyon and Nice in France; and Leeds, Milton Keynes and Liverpool in the U.K., according to data from Cushman & Wakefield and Real Capital Analytics.

Investors point to the higher yields available for assets in those markets. Higher yields can represent a perception of greater risk.

For example, the average yield on prime offices in smaller U.K. cities is about 6.25% compared with 4% in London, according to estimates from consultancy Jones Lang LaSalle.

In France, prime office yields in Lyon are 5.65%, compared with 4.5% in Paris, a more crowded market.

Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management said in a note to clients this month: "We stress at this juncture that the window for taking advantage of secondary locations in North-Western Europe will not remain open indefinitely."

Rob Martin, director of research at Legal & General Property, said that since the beginning of 2010, 70% of the firm's purchases have been outside London. But he warned that investors need to be selective when dealing in markets with which they aren't familiar.

And not all regional markets are created equal. Some are home to aging properties or don't have the demographics to sustain a recovery that will support property market growth.

"Where I would be hesitant -- and this is a strategy some will go for -- is buying effectively tertiary stock [assets in very remote locations] on the expectation that yields across the whole market will compress," Mr. Martin says. "Even in a recovering economy, I think there are some spaces that will become obsolete and that will still be painful to have," such as older shopping centers in areas where there are newer and more desirable counterparts for people to visit.

The real-estate investment units of two large insurers ventured back into Spain and Italy this year, in a sign that large fund managers are becoming more comfortable shopping for deals there.

Axa Real Estate bought a portfolio of 13 buildings in Barcelona from the Catalan government for 172 million euros in June, marking its first Spanish deal since 2008. It also bought two office buildings in Milan that month. Allianz Real Estate invested in two office buildings, one in Milan and one in Rome, during the summer.

Prime office yields in Milan are 5.1% in Milan and 5.3% in Rome, according to Jones Lang LaSalle, while prime office yields are 6.75% in Barcelona and 6.2% in Madrid.

Deutsche Asset & Wealth Management said in the research note that it had added investments in "prime Eurozone periphery markets" to its recommendations for the coming year, adding that investors prepared to take on additional risk should begin plotting their return to the strongest markets in Italy and Spain by 2015. The firm tipped Italian retail to outperform its Spanish counterpart, but highlighted Madrid's office market as one it expected to outperform relative to others in Europe's more fiscally troubled areas.

FT REPORT - THE CONNECTED BUSINESS
Bank tech expenditure set to rise

The US financial services industry alone is likely to run up an IT bill of at least $74bn next year as regulatory and customer demands impel change, writes Paul Taylor

Banks and other financial institutions are facing up to a new reality. The costs of meeting an expanding roster of regulatory requirements are rising at the same time as an increasingly competitive market is putting pressure on margins. Meanwhile, the need to invest in technologies to respond to changing customer demands, reduce risks and battle cyber crime has never been greater.

Against this backdrop are to be found general IT trends, such as the shift to cloud computing and mobility, the growing influence of social media channels, and the opportunities presented by so-called "big data" analytics. Such topics are expected to dominate discussions among bankers at the Swift International Banking Operations Seminar, SIBOS , in Dubai this week.

"I expect much of the discussion to be focused on the growing cost of meeting regulatory requirements," says Werner Steinmueller, head of global transaction banking at Deutsche Bank. For some banks, he suggests, these costs could consume up to 40 per cent or more of the annual IT budget and make it harder for them to invest in the innovation they need to keep up with customer demands.

Paul Henninger, a director at Detica NetReveal, a specialist financial software provider, says it is not only the case that banks face more regulations, but that these are more detailed and targeted at more critical parts of their business.

An example of this, he says, is the US Foreign Account Tax Compliance act, designed for foreign banks to report on potentially taxable accounts and transaction activities of US citizens. "The FATCA regulation . . . is far more detailed in terms of what is required than previous money laundering regulations . . . the initial burden on banks is many times more complex than the initial release of anti-money laundering regulations over a decade ago."

The implications of this go far beyond tying up bank IT resources. "The focus on regulatory compliance can challenge banks' capacity to undertake customer-centric innovation," says Jean Lassignardie of Capgemini Global Financial Services. "For example, partly as a result of the eurozone debt crisis, European banks are complying faster than originally expected with the Basel III objectives [due to be implemented by 2018], but as a result they have less capacity to focus on innovation."

He says that, for the past few years, most financial services companies have been focused on using technology to cut costs and improve efficiencies. Now they realise that in order to increase revenues they must move to a more customer-centric model and explore the opportunities presented by mobile and online channels.

"They're doing this while simultaneously responding to the trends shaping the industry, such as ever-changing market conditions, the increasing customer demand for new services and rising compliance costs, not to mention managing the explosion of data at their disposal," says Mr Lassignardie.

To put this in perspective, Technology Business Research (TBR), the US-based research firm, estimates that large North American financial institutions alone will spend $73.8bn on IT improvements, including software, hardware and professional services, next year as they switch from IT investments designed to "run the bank" to investments focused on "changing the bank".

"The overall 2014 IT budget growth rate hovers at 2 per cent," notes TBR's Banking and Financial Services Source IT report . "Large banking organisations are increasing investment in multi-channel banking and data management to improve system performance [and] ultimately meet customer demand for improved service and an enhanced user experience."

As part of this trend, banks and other financial services businesses are changing their services delivery models. For example, they are taking services to customers via mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, rather than forcing them to come into bank branches.

"Business requirements will not be the same as they were three or six months ago so, culturally, technology and businesses have to adapt to new methods," says Jon Warren of Rule Financial, a London-based consultancy that serves the global investment banking industry. "Those firms most able to implement internal change are the ones most able to survive a post-regulatory world."

In the meantime, financial services companies must still find ways to streamline their IT operations, cut costs and improve efficiency. However, many banks struggle with this process. "On virtualisation, there is still a fair way to go," says Lou Rauchenberger, chief administrative officer of JPMorgan's corporate and investment bank. "My view is that participants in the industry are in a very difficult place . . . there is a strong pressure to have much more integrated back-office operations, but many are still several years away."

While he believes that banks have a breathing space following an intense period of mergers and acquisitions, he says they are still struggling to consolidate applications and reduce the number of servers in their IT operations. Many still rely on bridges between different system architectures rather than achieving real integration.

Cathy Bessant, Bank of America's chief information officer, agrees. She argues that IT simplification itself is important. "Simpler is always better," she says. "It always offers more stability and higher performance quality. And simpler is always cheaper, so is a worthy objective unto its own.

"For us, we grew up as a company with hundreds - literally - of acquisitions and so, while we always were seamless in the front office, we rarely took that all the way through the hierarchy of the infrastructure of the firm. Simplification for us has meant collapsing multiple systems that do the same functions into one."

Ten years ago, she says bankers typically thought of technology as "the back office", or the infrastructure that kept the institution functioning.

"Today, no good firm thinks of it that way. Technology and the front office are one and the same, and often times we deliver our product - money, capital or payment services - through a technology. The channel and what we are delivering have become one and the same."

She shares the feeling of many other IT banking professionals that the pace of change that has been experienced over the past decade will continue unabated, but that predicting what the next popular trends remains difficult.

"I can only anticipate that the next 10 years will see that same kind of change as the past 10," she says.

Screening masses of data helps beat the crooks, reports Jane Bird

If a New Yorker's credit card is used to buy jewellery in Bangkok, the bank might suspect that it has been stolen.

However, if half an hour before, their partner's card on the same account has been used at a restaurant in the same city, the bank could surmise the couple are on holiday.

Data analytics allows checks such as this to happen in seconds - the time between the card being inserted into an electronic reader and its authorisation, says Paul Eagles, vice-president of product and future payment risk at Visa Europe.

It is a far cry from the situation 20 years ago, when attempting to use your credit card seven times in a day, or spending more than 1,500 on a single transaction, might well have led to your card being blocked.

"Fraud detection needs to be as unobtrusive as possible," says Mr Eagles. "The challenge is not to inconvenience customers."

In addition to speeding up security checks, data analytics improves detection rates by allowing many factors to be considered simultaneously. In the past, financial institutions set "rules" that computers checked to decide whether or not to allow transactions. But this meant predicting what might constitute suspicious behaviour.

Now, rule checking is used in combination with technologies such as anomaly modelling, text mining, predictive modelling, data validation and social network analysis.

This helps banks to spot the tell-tale signs they might never have previously thought of -the"unknownunknowns", as Mike Rhodes, senior fraud consultant at SAS, the software company, calls them.

Data analytics can help assess liquidity and credit risk, and identify illegal trading, rate rigging, mis-selling, and fraudulent loan applications or insurance claims.

Such techniques can examine anything from the frequency, length and geographic location of phone calls, to the words and phrases used in emails and instant messages.

Anomaly modelling, as the name suggests, seeks out the unusual. In investment banking, for example, a high number of calls to a mobile phone registered in Russia could flag up a warning of insider trading. In retail banking, employee emails containing bank account numbers might suggest criminal activity.

Text mining also helps to uncover dubious correspondence. It can look for specific giveaway words and phrases such as "trading illegally", "illicit trade" and "keep it quiet". For example, an alert might be triggered by an abnormally large number of congratulatory remarks, such as "great", "thank you" and "excellent work".

Meanwhile, motor insurance companies are using text mining to identify fraudulent claims. A genuine claimant who has been in a car accident and is recalling an event from memory is likely to describe the experience by reliving what actually happened, for example: "I was walking down the road and a vehicle drove into me."

A fraudster, on the other hand, is more likely to say: "I walked down the road and a car hit me." People using the second form of words are 60 per cent more likely to be fraudulent than the first.

"They are not describing what happened to them but what they imagine inside their heads," says Mr Rhodes. "Anyone using words ending in '-ed' should be on top of the list for investigation."

Scott Paton, a partner in financial services practice at PA Consulting, says financial institutions are under pressure from regulators to invest in social network analysis and other readily available data to understand what conversations are taking place, and "where there is contact with people known to be dodgy".

Investigators can also look at share price fluctuations, Mr Paton says. "When these are outside the norm, they can see who's involved, who they're connected to and what communications are taking place."

In future, the scope of data analytics will move beyond numbers and words to include images, video and voice recognition.

For example, thanks to the increasing use of social media such as YouTube and Facebook, fraudulent whiplash claimants will find it harder to escape detection, especially if the photos or footage they have posted online show they were nowhere near the scene of an alleged car accident.

However, some compliance officers are reluctant to use data analytics for fear of breaching privacy legislation.

"They are very concerned about what they are allowed to do, even using publicly available data on social media," says Mr Rhodes at SAS.

However, he says, their fears are misguided, because this sort of analysis is allowed when it is being used for fraud detection.

Were you alone in a small office after a breakfast of muesli or in an open-plan space nursing a hangover when you made that brilliant trade? Some of the world's leading hedge funds are asking these questions as they turn to psychology to delve into the minds of top fund managers to boost performance and profits.

Man Group, the world's biggest publicly traded hedge fund, is among early adopters of a software program that aims to create the perfect environment to help individual fund managers produce their best trades.

Simon Savage, who runs funds for GLG Partners, a division of Man, said: "This is a groundbreaking development, which we hope will give us that extra edge in an industry that is becoming more and more competitive. Sportsmen and women have used these techniques for years to give themselves a competitive advantage and it makes sense to do it in the office as well."

Mr Savage thinks the technology will revolutionise the way people work and perform, similar to the way diet, psychology and preparation have played a big part in producing the best football teams. Another leading investment group in the US, which does not want to be named, is also taking on the technology.

The software, developed by Clare Flynn Levy, a star fund manager at Morgan Grenfell in the 1990s, allows fund managers to key in a variety of information, from the time a trade was made to the mood the person was in when they made it. Lifestyle factors, such as diet and the amount of exercise a fund manager has, can also be logged.

The technology, to be launched this week, has been developed by Essentia Analytics with the help of psychology and human behaviour experts as well as computer and software specialists. It aims to align performance with skill and as far as possible eradicate luck and chance by working out the circumstances surrounding the best and worst trades. This, in theory, should help fund managers repeat successes and avoid failures.

Ms Flynn Levy said: "Emotions and mood play a big part in performance. As a fund manager, I used to work over the summer until I realised I was better off taking a break and coming back refreshed and motivated."

Crisis Plus Five: Legacy of Toxic Bond Called CWABS 2006-7 Lives On

At the core of the financial crisis was a creature called a subprime mortgage bond, and among the more toxic was one with the bland name of CWABS 2006-7.

Made entirely out of loans from Countrywide Financial Corp., the bond was so battered by delinquencies in 2009 it appeared that nearly all of the thousands of mortgages inside the bond could default.

One might think that today, such a relic of misbegotten lending would be as dead as orbiting space junk. Instead, CWABS 2006-7 is alive and well, a sought-after asset that has made big profits for savvy investors. A senior slice of it now trades at 91 cents on the dollar, having come nearly all the way back.

That has been a boon for firms such as bond giant Pimco, whose stake in the Countrywide bond has helped make one of Pimco's funds a top performer in its category.

At the same time, the bond has affected the lives of struggling Florida homeowners, some unable to make their payments and others, such as Amanda Gavini of Fort Myers, determinedly continuing to do so at above-market mortgage rates.

For others still, such as an immigrant from Russia named Alimzhon Iznurov, the bond and the homes tied to it have spelled an opportunity to snap up housing for their families at a bargain price.

The story of the bond called CWABS 2006-7 -- its borrowers, its investors and others touched by it -- is the financial crisis seen from inside, illuminating complexities that often upended expectations and dealt widely differing fates to its many participants.

The Wall Street Journal, using real-estate records and the bond's financial reports, tracked down three dozen homeowners whose loans are bundled in CWABS 2006-7. Few knew that or were aware of the possible effect this could have on their mortgage.

CWABS 2006-7 appeared in June 2006 as the run-up in home values and Wall Street's mortgage-securitization machine hit peak velocity, fed by newfangled lending that enabled millions of people with spotty credit to become homeowners.

These were the final months before the realization sank in that many borrowers couldn't repay, a notion that undermined subprime-mortgage bonds and set off a chain reaction engulfing mortgage-finance firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, major banks and even the world's biggest insurance company.

Countrywide bundled 5,954 of its subprime loans into the bond, loans carrying interest rates as high as 15% but with an average of 8.5%. Some included special features to accommodate people less able to buy, such as letting them pay only the interest at first. Countrywide offered pieces of the bond for sale, the highest-yielding slices for those willing to bear the most risk and vice versa.

One of the largest initial investors was Freddie Mac, which put up more than $300 million to buy a top-rated slice at 100 cents on the dollar. Part of the rationale for government-sponsored Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae was that such investing helped more Americans afford to become homeowners, securities filings by the mortgage firms said.

A lawsuit later filed by Freddie Mac's overseer, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, said that Fannie and Freddie poured more than $26 billion into Countrywide residential mortgage-backed securities from mid-2005 to early 2008. The bonds were "supposed to represent long-term stable investments,"" said the suit, adding that instead, Countrywide borrowers defaulted at a "staggering" rate.

The suit in New York State Court claimed that Countrywide had doled out loans that people weren't suited for and couldn't afford. Defendants Countrywide and its new owner, Bank of America Corp., dispute the claims in the suit, which is still pending.

In early 2009, as U.S. unemployment rose and home prices fell, "people were starting to consider the possibility that every loan in [the bond] would default,"" said Cory Lambert, vice president of analytics at BlackBox Logic LLC, a mortgage-bond research firm. Delinquencies were rising so fast "there was no telling when or if they would ever level off."

The bond slice owned by Freddie Mac was down more than half in value by the summer of 2009. That was when Countrywide borrower Donald Mudd first started missing his payments.

He and his wife, Patricia Starr, had gotten their loan in March 2006 -- about three months after Mr. Mudd emerged from a personal bankruptcy involving unpaid medical bills.

"I was surprised they approved me right after a bankruptcy," said Mr. Mudd.

The couple received a $171,000 adjustable-rate loan from Countrywide, county records show, and put down $10,000 to buy a two-bedroom house in Port Charlotte, Fla., a retirement haven on the Gulf of Mexico where home values soared 63% from 2004 to 2006. Countrywide put the 30-year, 8% mortgage into CWABS 2006-7.

With his business of selling water-filtration systems hitting headwinds, Mr. Mudd discussed with Bank of America the possibility of changing his loan.

The government had just created a plan called the Home Affordable Modification Program, or HAMP. Mr. Mudd said the bank rejected him because the investor in his mortgage didn't participate in the program.

A spokeswoman for Bank of America said it has no record that was the reason Mr. Mudd was denied a loan modification that year. She said the problem was that Mr. Mudd's approximately $1,200 monthly loan payment in 2009 didn't consume a big enough share of his income.

By this time, the riskiest slices of CWABS 2006-7 had been hammered by loan defaults, and losses were spreading toward senior slices, once rated triple-A, that often were owned by large financial institutions. For banks, the sinking value meant having to hold more reserves against losses, plus a threat of huge losses if they tried to unload the bonds in a crumbling market.

The fate of bonds such as CWABS 2006-7, in other words, was strangling banks' lending ability -- at a time when

||

the economy needed it.

To put a floor under the bonds, the Treasury Department helped firms willing to step in and buy some. It created a taxpayer-funded initiative called the Public-Private Investment Program, or PPIP, through which the U.S. provided debt and equity investments to nine bond buyers, totaling $18.6 billion.

For these investors, the government financing added five percentage points to returns, estimates one participant, New York hedge-fund firm Marathon Asset Management. The government made some unusual requests, including asking Marathon to build a wall in its trading floor to separate PPIP trades from its other business, though Marathon never actually built the wall.

While buying some subprime bonds through the program, Marathon invested in other bonds outside of it, including CWABS 2006-7. The firm invested starting in early 2009 and throughout that year as the price dipped and then started to recover, according to people familiar with the trades.

About 43% of the mortgages in the bond were from California and Florida, hard-hit markets that Marathon figured would have solid recoveries.

Marathon sold its holdings in the bond throughout 2010. The firm declined to say how it made out, but the bond was recovering during this time.

The PPIP "not only established a bottom but it had the effect of facilitating a recovery in the asset class," said Andrew Rabinowitz, Marathon's chief operating officer.

The federal support wasn't the only thing buoying CWABS 2006-7. It also benefited from steady payments by homeowners such as Mrs. Gavini in Fort Myers.

With her husband, she paid $398,000 for their three-bedroom house in April 2006, taking out two Countrywide loans, with interest rates of 11% and 7%. By late 2009, she figured the house was worth only half what she owed on it. But despite being "underwater," she has never stopped making payments on the loans, monthly payments that now total $3,000.

"I wouldn't be able to sleep at night" not making the payments, said Mrs. Gavini, a mother of two young children who works as a sourcing manager for a women's-apparel retailer.

Her resolve to pay is just part of the reason the bond continues to gain from Mrs. Gavini's situation. The bond also benefits because she is stuck with her interest rate, which is 7% in the case of her loan that is in the bond.

After steady repayment for seven years, plus employment, Mrs. Gavini has good credit, so that refinancing at today's low rates into a prime loan might bring her monthly payment down by nearly half, mortgage brokers say. But because they owe more than the home is worth, she and her husband, Stephen Gavini, can't refinance.

There is, in fact, a federal program that lets some borrowers in this fix refinance. Called HARP, for Home Affordable Refinance Program, it allows homeowners to lower their payments by extending the life of the loan or dropping their interest rate.

But to qualify, mortgages must be guaranteed by a government-sponsored firm such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. While those firms could invest in bonds stuffed with subprime mortgages, they didn't guarantee such mortgages. That left out Mrs. Gavini.

"It's not fair,"" she said. "All we want to do is get refinanced."

In its current form, Mrs. Gavini's mortgage is valuable to the investors in CWABS 2006-7, given its interest rate and steady repayment.

In the lingo of the mortgage-bond industry, her high-rate loan is "trapped" in the CWABS 2006-7 bond.

As various other loans have fallen out of the bond -- through foreclosures, sales of the homes and other routes -- the Countrywide bond has become more and more concentrated with loans such as Mrs. Gavini's that are current, enhancing its value.

In some cases, the loans in it are current because of government munificence.

Carolyn Culbreth, the owner of a single-story house near Interstate 95 in the eastern Florida city of Palm Coast, hasn't made a mortgage payment on her own since March 2012.

Unemployed through all of last year, the 62-year-old now earns $9 an hour working at home for a call center offering billing and other customer service for cable, Internet and phone companies. She recently took in her son and grandson to live with her.

In August, Bank of America denied her latest request for a modification of a mortgage that Countrywide made. The reason it gave was that the investors in her mortgage -- the holders of CWABS 2006-7 -- didn't participate in a modification program designed to help unemployed homeowners.

But a government program has covered the payments Ms. Culbreth missed and her most recent ones. The state of Florida has done so through a "Hardest Hit Fund" that funnels federal money to strapped homeowners. The subsidy is technically a loan, but it will be forgiven if Ms. Culbreth stays in the house for 5<frac12> years after the arrival of her last subsidy payment.

That day has come. The program has a maximum benefit, which Ms. Culbreth just hit. She doesn't know how she will be able to afford her $1,451 monthly payment without the subsidy. "I may end up having to walk out of this house,"" she said.

Years of modification attempts and state subsidies don't appear to have changed a basic fact of Ms. Culbreth's homeownership, which is that she can't afford the mortgage Countrywide gave her. Today, she owes more than when she first took out the loan in 2006.

Asked about Ms. Culbreth, Bank of America's spokeswoman said now that she is employed, the bank plans to contact her to see if it can help modify her mortgage.

The rising value of the CWABS 2006-7 has benefited not just from its growing concentration of borrowers current on their mortgages but also from the courtroom success of investors.

In June 2011, Bank of America agreed to pay $8.5 billion to settle investor claims that Countrywide had lent to people who couldn't afford to repay, leading to losses on CWABS 2006-7 and 529 other Countrywide mortgage bonds.

The settlement still isn't final. Some investors say it covered only a fraction of the losses on the bonds. Nonetheless, traders said it has lifted the value of assets such as CWABS 2006-7.

Some of the investors who suffered losses on Countrywide bonds early on, and were part of the lawsuit, spotted opportunity later and quickly got aboard again. Among them giant money managers BlackRock Inc. and Pacific Investment Management Co., the Allianz SE unit known as Pimco.

In mid-2011, as BlackRock and 21 other investors were hammering out their settlement with Countrywide, a BlackRock fund started purchasing a senior slice of the bond, according to research firm Morningstar Inc. By early 2012, after this piece of the bond had risen 44% in value, BlackRock had sold this stake.

As for Pimco, it poured $31 million into CWABS 2006-7 throughout 2012, a period during which the price increased 11%, and still held the investment as of March, according to Morningstar.

The Pimco bond fund that holds part of CWABS 2006-7, Pimco Income A, is in the top 6% of funds in its category over the past five years, according to Morningstar. "Its mortgage stake has been on fire,"" a Morningstar analyst wrote in late 2012.

CWABS 2006-7 has created opportunities beyond big investment firms.

Mr. Iznurov, the native of Russia, spent months sniffing around in Florida for a low-price house. A Muslim, he said he came to the U.S. from Russia in 2005 to escape religious tensions.

He finally found the right property last year in Jacksonville, Fla., a modest ranch house in a development called Summer Trees, which offered him a chance to relocate his wife and two rambunctious children from a cramped apartment.

The loan on the house, part of CWABS 2006-7, was both delinquent and underwater. The loan servicer, or firm that collects mortgage payments, agreed to let the homeowner do a short sale -- a sale for less than the sum owed that is a way to avoid foreclosure and move on.

The bond investors swallowed a loss on the original $121,600 loan as Mr. Iznurov bought the house for $77,000.

The previous owner had a 9%-interest subprime loan. Mr. Iznurov's mortgage isn't subprime. He has a loan insured by the Federal Housing Administration with an interest rate of 3.65%. "That's the market," Mr. Iznurov says. "Somebody lose, somebody win."

Mr. Mudd, the water-filter salesman, fears he could be about to lose. On a rainy afternoon this summer, he sat in his living room in Port Charlotte with the shades drawn and the lights off. A stack of bank documents 13 inches tall was on his kitchen table. The year after being turned down for a loan modification, Mr. Mudd again applied for a modification in February 2010.

A year of back and forth followed. He said he would fax his pay stubs and tax returns, and the bank would tell him they were outdated and ask him to send the documents again. "They would do this over and over and over again,"" he said.

A Bank of America spokeswoman said that Mr. Mudd's experience was "unusual." She added that since then, "we've made significant improvement in our processes."

In February 2011, the bank agreed to lower Mr. Mudd's interest rate to 7.3% from 8.37%. But as often happens with modifications, the change didn't lower his monthly payment. Because the mortgage revision had to cover delinquent past payments, it produced, despite a lower interest rate, a higher monthly bill, $1,323.

In his case, the modification was later canceled when Mr. Mudd didn't keep up with the new, higher payments.

The Bank of America spokeswoman said, "We've been helping Mr. Mudd since 2008, offering him multiple modifications to help him keep his house."

In April, the trustee for the investors of CWABS 2006-7 filed notice in court seeking to foreclose.

On May 29, Mr. Mudd received two more letters from Bank of America. One suggested he consider a short sale.

The other offered him "a Trial Period Plan." This variety of modification would again increase his monthly payment, to $1,688. Making three straight payments would qualify Mr. Mudd for a permanent modification, though the bank hasn't disclosed the exact terms.

He made one of the $1,688 payments in July, but didn't make the August payment.

Mr. Mudd said a housing counselor has suggested that he walk away from the house and find an affordable rental in the area. He hasn't. But, he said, "I am not sure it is worth the fight anymore."

Masters in Management: Birmingham's local hero

When business schools appoint deans, the decisions are usually predictable and often dull. Only rarely is the announcement unexpected, let alone surprising. But surprising is the word for the appointment of George Feiger, a former Californian wealth manager, as dean of Aston, a small school in the UK's industrial heartland, and one fiercely proud of its connections with the Birmingham business community.

Prof Feiger is disarmingly persuasive about why he quit as chief executive of a $3.4bn wealth management company. "I wanted to come back to Britain and I wanted to get back into a more intellectual environment," he says (he once worked in London). "I like being among intelligent people. You are constantly being challenged."

His career has been mostly at blue-chip companies, including senior roles at Bank of America and McKinsey. But he has a Harvard PhD, and has taught on executive programmes at Harvard and Stanford.

Aston's connection to the business community is its appeal. "The university's whole ethos is total practicality, " he says.

The school does two things well, he adds. "It creates employable graduates," and "it does well in research into entrepreneurship. There is also a very strong commitment to quality."

The former is particularly important at masters in management level, says Kathryn Ainsworth, MSc director. "The MSc side of things is really growing, unlike the MBA," she says. "Undergraduates need something to give them a more focused skillset; employers are getting more specific about what they want." That is as much practical experience as students can get, she adds.

The emphasis on rigorous and applied research is endorsed by Ben Clegg, associate dean for business partnerships. "To me this is what business schools are about - not sitting in ivory towers."

While Aston's focus is on helping smaller businesses, this does not rule the school out of the global picture, says Prof Feiger. "Small and medium-sized businesses are the backbone of every economy in the world that is real," he says. "I believe we can get better at helping SMEs and that is a global skill."

The school is one of four taking part in 10,000 Small Businesses, a UK initiative designed to accelerate the growth of high-potential small businesses and funded through the Goldman Sachs Foundation. According to an update report in May, participants reported an annual increase of 23 per cent in employees and a rise of 16 per cent in annual turnover since completing the programme.

"We're not trying to be Wharton and staff Wall Street - they are doing a great job of that," says Prof Feiger. "There is a whole part of the world that depends on SMEs. I don't think of it as being parochial."

The school is focusing on management as well as business skills. "It is much more difficult to teach people to manage people than to teach them analytics. A postgraduate degree should set you up with the framework for later life, not the knowledge."

Prof Feiger is clearly excited about his role. "Aston is better than its reputation, but that means it can catch up," he says. "It's not London, but that does not mean it's not good."

WEEKEND INVESTOR --- The New Basics -- Hulbert on Investing: Will Rising Rates Hit Stocks?

By Mark Hulbert 
914 words
14 September 2013
The Wall Street Journal
J

English
(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

Rising interest rates aren't a good reason to give up on stocks.

That isn't what many investors believe. Indeed, it is so widely assumed that rising rates will eventually threaten the stock market that few ever stop to analyze the historical evidence.

They simply take for granted that rates usually rise because of higher inflation, and that the combination is bad for stocks.

Yet there is no consistent historical relationship between interest rates and the stock market, says Javier Estrada, a professor of finance at the University of Navarra's business school in Barcelona.

Of course, you might have other reasons to think stocks will find it tough going soon -- such as the debt-ceiling fight in Washington, geopolitical uncertainty and the sheer age of the bull market. But you should reconsider your bearishness if it derives solely from concerns that rates will rise.

What does history teach us about the relationship between higher interest rates, inflation and corporate profitability?

Consider inflation's impact on earnings. Cliff Asness, founding principal of AQR Capital Management, an investment firm in Greenwich, Conn., with more than $80 billion under management, analyzed the data back to 1926 and found no statistically significant evidence that higher inflation leads to lower profits.

Still, some investors will argue that even though earnings might rise faster when inflation is higher, stock prices will nevertheless do worse -- because inflation also will lead to higher interest rates and cause price/earnings ratios to decline.

This is a core belief of the so-called Fed Model, which holds that P/E ratios should rise as interest rates decline, and vice versa. The strategy got its name in 1997, following a reference in a Federal Reserve report to the tendency of the S&P 500's earnings yield -- the inverse of its P/E ratio -- to rise and fall with long-term interest rates.

During the 15 years before the Fed made that observation, the U.S. stock market's P/E ratio did indeed tend to be higher when interest rates were low, and vice versa, Mr. Estrada concedes. But, he points out, that relationship hasn't held up as well since then, raising the possibility that the apparent correlation might have been just a coincidence.

Further doubts came when Mr. Estrada analyzed U.S. experience over the 100 years before 1980, as well as the stock markets of 19 other countries. He found no consistent relationship between P/Es and interest rates.

If the Fed Model were correct, then above-average P/Es would suggest an overvalued market only if rates were high -- just as low P/Es would mean the market is cheap only if rates were low.

This isn't what Mr. Estrada found across the 20 countries he studied. High P/E ratios were more often than not followed by below-average returns over the subsequent five years, regardless of where interest rates stood -- just as low P/E ratios were more often than not followed by above-average returns even when interest rates were high.

AQR's Mr. Asness reached a similar conclusion when focusing on returns over the subsequent one- and 10-year periods.

The investment implication: You should resist the temptation to become more tolerant of high-P/E stocks when interest rates are low. By the same token, though, history suggests you don't have to run for the hills now that higher rates appear on the horizon -- especially if you avoid overvalued stocks.

There is no exchange-traded fund that focuses strictly on low-P/E stocks, says David Nadig, president of ETF analytics at IndexUniverse. However, he says, several come close, including iShares Morningstar Large-Cap Value, which charges annual fees of 0.25%, or $25 for every $10,000 invested.

There is an exchange-traded note that relies on a modified P/E ratio to determine sector bets: Barclays ETN+ Shiller CAPE, which uses the cyclically adjusted P/E ratio devised by Yale University Professor Robert Shiller. Its annual fees are 0.45%.

Most investors, though, prefer not to focus only on the P/E ratio, in hopes of avoiding out-of-favor stocks that truly deserve their low valuations. One strategy is to consider only those low-P/E stocks that also are being recommended by advisers with stellar long-term records.

There currently are a handful of stocks with P/E ratios below 12, based on 12-month trailing earnings, which also are popular among those few advisers tracked by the Hulbert Financial Digest who have beaten the stock market over the past 15 years. (The S&P 500's comparable P/E currently stands at 18.6.)

They are insurer Aflac, with a P/E of 8.5; global commercial bank J.P. Morgan Chase, with a P/E of 8.7; Pfizer, the pharmaceutical company, with a P/E of 9.5; oil company Chevron, with a P/E of 10; banking giant Wells Fargo, with a P/E of 11.5; Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold, a mining concern, with a P/E of 11.8; and defense contractor Northrop Grumman, with a P/E of 11.9.

JAKARTA Indonesia's central bank on Thursday announced a surprise increase in its policy interest rate, reflecting its commitment to protect the country's currency, as global sentiment remains fragile.

Bank Indonesia raised its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point to 7.25%, just two weeks after raising it by a half percentage point. It also raised a key money-market rate, known as the Fasbi rate, by a quarter percentage point to 5.50%.

"Defending the currency is a policy priority," said Christian de Guzman, a sovereign debt analyst with Moody's Investors Service.

Indonesia's currency has lately been hurt by an exodus from emerging-market assets, since the U.S. Federal Reserve in May began preparing to wind down its support for the U.S. economy. In recent weeks, the rupiah has continued to fall, even as other hard-hit currencies like the Indian rupee have begun to recover.

Some observers say rate hikes are a quick way to restore investor confidence and cool an economy that has been overheating. Others say tightening policy in a slowing economy is risky.

Anton Gunawan, a Jakarta-based economist at Bank Danamon and one of two people nominated to become a senior deputy governor at Bank Indonesia, said the decision seemed to be intended "just to please portfolio investors."

"It seems that BI is not confident and is still worried about the possible shocks that could happen if the Fed starts tapering," he said.

Others hailed the central bank's move.

"This is exactly what the country requires to iron out its imbalances and get into a position where everyone can once again look forward to a renewed, sustainable recovery," Credit Suisse economist Robert Prior-Wandesforde said.

Central banks in South Korea, New Zealand and the Philippines held rates steady on Thursday, in contrast to the Bank Indonesia move. But in India, the central bank has recently tightened liquidity and taken steps to restore investor confidence in the economy and currency.

In recent years, Indonesia's economy has grown at more than 6% annually on the back of commodity exports to China. As domestic demand expanded, imports of oil and consumer goods boomed. The result was a trade deficit, which hit a record of $2.3 billion in July.

Slowing China demand and higher U.S. interest rates have changed Indonesia's situation. Growth is slowing toward 5%, consumer inflation is moving toward double digits and investors have retreated from Indonesian stocks and bonds.

Some investors have returned to Indonesian assets since the central bank raised rates at an extraordinary meeting Aug. 29. The Jakarta Composite Index has risen about 5.6% since then, but the rupiah has struggled to make up lost ground.

The currency has fallen about 15% so far this year, despite attempts by the central bank to prop it up by spending nearly $20 billion of its foreign-exchange reserves. The rupiah rose strongly after Thursday's rate decision and was quoted at IDR11,350 to the dollar late Thursday, up from IDR11,600 to the dollar a day earlier.

The central bank "aims to regain the initiative over the currency," said Peter Kinsella, a currency analyst at Commerzbank. Bank Indonesia is "prepared to lift rates to help stabilize the currency, even at the expense of growth short-term."

But others say Bank Indonesia should step aside and allow the exchange rate to fall as South Africa recently has done which would boost exports and crimp imports by making them more costly in local-currency terms.

Lars Christensen, head of emerging-market research at Danske Bank in Copenhagen, said Indonesia risked "raising rates at the wrong time," just as economic growth is slowing.

"I do think there's an element of panic, an element of 'we don't want to lose control of the currency,'" he said after the decision.

Raising rates in such a situation could make Bank Indonesia appear to be acting haphazardly, instead of keeping a longer-term focus on fighting inflation, Mr. Christensen said.

Part of the problem is that inflation in Indonesia is difficult to target because of large shocks from agricultural prices. In addition, the presence of an extensive subsidy program blunts the beneficial impact of a weaker rupiah: The weaker currency will help reduce imports but will also blow out the government's budget for fuel subsidies. In June, the government reduced the level of fuel subsidies, a politically sensitive move that has contributed to soaring inflation.

"Raising rates to support the currency has had little effect, which isn't surprising since the selloff stems from disappointment in the pace of structural reform," Moody'sAnalytics wrote in a note to clients Thursday.

Bank Indonesia has won praise for becoming more independent from political interference in recent years. But it also has failed to meet its stated inflation goals. The bank currently has a year-end target of 3.5%-5.5% on-year growth in consumer prices but says it actually expects inflation to come in at almost 10%.

The central bank Thursday cut its economic growth forecast for this year to 5.5%-5.9%, from a previous range of 5.8%-6.2%, which would mark the first year of growth below 6% since 2009. It also lowered next year's growth outlook to 5.8%-6.2%, from 6.0%-6.4%.

Dell Investors Back Buyout Of PC Maker

Dell Inc. said its shareholders approved its $25 billion buyout by founder and Chief Executive Michael Dell and investment firm Silver Lake, ending a bitter contest to take the PC maker private.

"I am pleased with this outcome and am energized to continue building Dell into the industry's leading provider of scalable, end-to-end technology solutions," Mr. Dell said. "As a private enterprise, with a strong private-equity partner, we'll serve our customers with a single-minded purpose and drive the innovations that will help them achieve their goals."

In a preliminary tally, Dell said Thursday that shareholders had passed the vote, an expected result, but it followed months of angst.

Three times the Dell board had delayed this vote as the deal looked likely to fail. But a sweetened bid earned Mr. Dell and Silver Lake a new set of rules that counted only votes cast.

The buyout had about 65% support, according to one source.

Dell stockholders will receive $13.75 in cash for each share of Dell they hold, plus payment of a special cash dividend of 13 cents a share, for total consideration of $13.88 a share in cash. The agreement also guarantees the regular quarterly dividend of eight cents a share for the fiscal third quarter.

The shareholder vote was repeatedly delayed as activist investor Carl Icahn and his partner, Southeastern Asset Management Inc., agitated for a better deal.

Earlier this week, while still criticizing the deal and Dell's board, Mr. Icahn conceded defeat after six months of trying to persuade other shareholders to vote down the deal and instead support his proposal for a so-called leverage recapitalization of the computer maker.

As a result of the buyout, Dell, for the first time since it went public 25 years ago, will largely become a one-man show, just as it was when Mr. Dell started the company in his college dorm room in 1984. He is set to own about 75% of the company and remain CEO, while private-equity firm Silver Lake will be a minority owner.

Now, Dell's success and Mr. Dell's legacy hinge on whether he can recast the company into what the tech industry terms a "solutions" provider, serving as a trusted technical adviser to businesses and providing them with services and software -- not simply shipping them low-price PCs and servers.

Three specific areas are due for more attention, people familiar with Dell's strategy say.

One is security software, which corporations use to prevent unauthorized use of their computing networks or thefts of data. Another is tools to help companies take an analytical approach to business decisions, a software niche known by the term Big Data. The third area is a plan to offer "IT in a box," or all-in-one bundles of hardware and software that companies can cheaply and easily deploy.

Dell executives previously have singled out roughly $3.3 billion in potential cost cuts, but didn't specify in what areas.

A spokesman for the company declined to comment. Mr. Dell has declined interview requests while the buyout is pending.

The company continues to churn out new hardware designs. At an Intel Corp. event on Wednesday, for example, a Dell executive gave a sneak preview of a new line of tablets it plans to formally unveil on Oct. 2.

Yet some former executives and people who work with the company are skeptical. They question the value of Dell's technology assets, its ability to keep pace with the problems facing its business customers and Mr. Dell's own grasp of the firm's challenges.

The planned makeover comes as the PC market is contracting as spending shifts to tablets and smartphones. Moreover, new Asian competitors are winning sales among big website operators like Google Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. The company has managed to hang on to its market share in PCs and servers recently, but largely through price-cutting strategies that have hurt its profit margins.

At the same time, Dell's plan to become a broader provider to corporations faces tough competition from International Business Machines Corp., Cisco Systems Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co., while upstarts are attacking individual technology niches Dell is targeting.

"Dell is stuck," said Matt McIlwain, a managing director with venture-capital firm Madrona Venture Group, which invests in emerging business-tech companies. "They don't have the ear or the wallet of enterprises like H-P or IBM do, nor are they innovative enough to keep pace with emerging tech leaders like Amazon Web Services."

Dell has spent more than $13 billion on acquisitions, but the firm says those businesses have fallen short of financial expectations.

While the company's historic strength is in sales of computing gear to small-and-medium-size businesses, Dell's own internal financial metrics show sales to those businesses has slipped for the last four years, according to board presentations made public in recent months.

PCs have provided a gateway for Dell to sell business customers additional products and software. But its PC revenue slipped about 7% in the six months ended Aug. 2.

Taking the company private won't address the strategic problems, Mr. Dell's critics say. They believe he is mainly reacting to what he sees as years of unfair criticism and Wall Street's failures to appreciate Dell's strengths, according to people who talk to Mr. Dell regularly.

Amid intense scrutiny in recent months, Mr. Dell has stepped up private communications with a network of analysts and other confidantes, sometimes surprising callers with weekend conversations that last up to two hours, according to people familiar with the conversations. In the calls, Mr. Dell has aired his views on deal tactics, or his thoughts on Dell's PC product lines for consumers, these people said.

Mr. Dell also has stepped up his chest-thumping about the company's prospects. Just before rival Hewlett-Packard reported quarterly earnings in August, Mr. Dell emailed analysts and others nine data points showing Dell eating into H-P's sales of computer servers, according to correspondence reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Hours later, he sent another message with more bullet points about Dell's market position versus H-P's.

Dell was the only well-known server provider to gain market share in the second quarter. Dell had about 19% of the server-industry revenue, up from 16% a year earlier, according to research firm IDC. But that was largely due to price-cutting needed to court high-volume server buyers, Dell's operating profit in the division that includes those machines, networking and data-storage gear fell more than 9% in the most recent quarter.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
ETFs: time to call the plumbers? Overview

Amid rapid growth, proponents reject charges of faulty 'plumbing', says Chris Flood

Exchange traded funds are driving a revolution in financial markets and the pace of change is accelerating.

But as ETFs become increasingly popular, more questions are being asked about their risks.

Critics cite a number of recent difficulties in trading ETFs as evidence that problems in the industry's "plumbing" systems flare up in periods of market stress. They complain that the rapid growth of the ETF industry is concentrating risks and could threaten large scale market disruption.

ETF managers vehemently dispute these claims. They say that the critics misunderstand how ETFs perform and the benefits they offer investors.

Mark Wiedman, global head of iShares, the ETF arm of BlackRock, the world's largest fund manager, says ETFs acquitted themselves "with flying colours" in the latest bout of market turmoil in late May and June.

ETF activity tends to rise significantly when market volatility increases. Mr Wiedman says that fact has provided investors with greater confidence that ETFs are robust in periods of stress.

He predicts that "ETFs will play a much bigger role in global capital markets as both institutional and retail investors become more comfortable with advantages offered by this new technology".

Global inflows into ETFs (funds and products) reached $148.5bn in the first seven months of the year, up 13.8 per cent compared with the same period in 2012, according to ETFGI, a consultancy.

The strength of the overall inflows is notable as it has coincided with severe weakness in two previously vital drivers of the industry's growth, gold and emerging markets ETFs, where investors have withdrawn more than $40bn so far this year.

The US ETF market remains the primary generator of growth, responsible for almost 80 per cent of global inflows this year, helped by the S&P 500's rally to an all-time high.

Scott Ebner, global head of product development and research at State Street Global Advisors, says some observers describe the US ETF market as mature but it is still in a growth phase.

Mr Wiedman echoes this, saying ETFs are becoming the preferred vehicle of choice for passive exposures for both US financial advisers and retail investors, outside 401k retirement plans.

"But there is much more growth ahead. With $750bn invested by US retail investors in ETFs compared with their holdings of $10.2tn in US active mutual funds, ETFs still have a lot of catching-up to do," he says.

In the US, ETFs regularly trade more than $60bn on a daily basis, regularly accounting for a quarter of all US stock market activity by value.

"ETFs are attractive to both long-term holders due to their low fees as well as active traders because of their tight spreads," says Phil Mackintosh, global head of trading strategy at Credit Suisse.

Critics argue that ETFs linked to less liquid underlying assets, such as high yield bonds, have not lived up to their expected standards when volatility rises.

But industry participants reject this charge.

"The costs of trading some ETFs may be higher in times of market stress. But ETF trading takes place in a highly competitive environment and the additional utility that ETFs offer via intraday trading is extremely valuable," says Mr Ebner.

Mr Wiedman adds that growing trading volumes in fixed income ETFs demonstrate that more investors want to transact in a public marketplace where prices are transparent rather than via opaque over-the-counter transactions.

The industry's rapid growth is leading to mounting competitive pressures, particularly in the US.

Providers loathe the suggestion that they are fighting a "price war" to secure market share, aware that their profit margins could suffer if they cut charges aggressively without a corresponding increase in asset growth.

Most product launches, however, are competitively priced against established rivals, as demonstrated recently by Charles Schwab's new smart beta range which undercut established rivals.

In Europe, significant changes are also afoot.

BlackRock, already the largest player in Europe, acquired Credit Suisse's ETF operations earlier this year as part of a move to boost its presence in Switzerland. Warburg Pincus, the private equity group, has said it would like to acquire ETF businesses in Europe while Amundi, the French asset manager, has signalled its appetite to act in any consolidation wave.

Vanguard has rapidly accumulated more than $1bn in assets just a year after launching its first European listed ETFs while SSgA's European operations have picked up pace and new entrants such as First State are continuing to target the region.

Deutsche Bank and Lyxor have revamped their business models to respond to these new competitive pressures.

"We expect to see more managers from around the world wanting to enter the European ETF market to offer investors access to a wider range of expertise from within the asset management community," says Matt Johnson, European head of distribution at ETF Securities, the London based provider.

Asian ETF markets, while at a much earlier stage of development, are also developing rapidly, most clearly in China where the process of liberalising capital markets has led to a spate of new products being launched.

But other Asian countries are also innovating, such as the Philippines which has just started accepting listing applications for ETFs.

As the industry develops, it remains unclear just how many of the large existing array of sub-scale ETFs have a sustainable long-term future. A record number of products closed in the first half of the year, suggesting a growing realism among providers that not every launch will prosper.

Mr Mackintosh at Credit Suisse notes that the majority of assets are in ETFs that have an expense ratio less than 30 basis points while trading is heavily concentrated in products with a bid-ask spread less than 3bp, underlining the cut-throat level of competition.

With 4,883 exchange traded funds and products currently available, it might appear that the limits of innovation are being tested, as shown by the sceptical reaction that followed recent proposals for a Bitcoin ETF.

However, as the strong demand this year for currency hedged Japanese equity ETFs has demonstrated, even relatively simple product innovations can generate significant inflows if they meet investors' needs.

Mr Wiedman at iShares points out that fixed income markets remain relatively untapped by ETFs.

"Assets held in fixed income ETFs at just over $300bn make up just a small part of the $100tn invested in bond markets globally. But we expect to see much greater adoption as fixed income ETFs develop greater liquidity and bond-like analytics become more readily available," he says.

Another potentially rich seam for exploitation lies in advanced or smart beta strategies that offer a different balance of risks and returns than that attached to conventional market capitalisation products.

Advanced beta strategies have been long used by sophisticated institutional investors but these mandates were frequently undisclosed. Although the smart beta term is sometimes misused, ETF flows have given such strategies much greater visibility.

Another unexplored area lies with active ETFs. US regulators recently lifted a ban on the use of derivatives in new ETFs, a move which is expected to pave the way for new products

Building momentum among new users in different investment strategies, asset classes and regions, the ETF revolution is really only starting.

Arrow Global set for listing debut

One of the UK's biggest debt recovery companies is set to list on the stock market on Tuesday in a sign of the rapid growth the industry is experiencing as banks attempt to shore up their balance sheets.

Arrow Global, which buys distressed consumer debt from banks and credit card companies, is expected to raise up to about 400m when it floats on the FTSE index.

The company has been majority owned by a fund run by Royal Bank of Scotland since 2009. The RBS Special Opportunities Fund is expected to retain about a third of Arrow's shares, while its management team is expected to hold on to a 15 per cent stake.

Arrow owns and manages about 8bn of soured consumer debt. It buys the debt at deeply discounted prices - typically offering about 10p for every 1 - and attempts to squeeze out the value by reconnecting with borrowers.

Much of its work involves using technology and data analytics to identify and track down debtors after their contact information has been lost by the original lender. Once it has the information it uses third-party collectors to recoup the debt.

The group bought 1.6bn of debt for 121m in the year to June 2013 and collected 109.1m during the period. It expects to use the proceeds from the listing to make further acquisitions.

Analysts estimate that there is about 300bn of unsecured consumer debt in the UK, of which about 3-6 per cent goes into default each year.

Tom Drury, chief executive, said: "We believe that the public markets will provide the right long-term capital for Arrow Global as a leading player in a debt purchase sector that has matured and become a structural component of the credit industry."

Debt management companies are benefiting from a buoyant market as banks are increasingly keen to shed distressed debt that is clogging up their balance sheets and absorbing much-needed capital.

Revenue at Arrow increased more than 50 per cent in the first six months of 2013, compared with a year earlier.

The industry has caught the eye of private equity buyers since the financial crisis.

Earlier this year JC Flowers, the US private equity group, acquired Cabot Credit Management, another debt collector, from Anacap in a deal worth about 500m. TDR Capital, a London-based private equity group, bought Lowell, the third big UK debt collector, in 2011.

Arrow will be chaired by Jonathan Bloomer, a former partner at Cerberus Capital, the private equity group. Sir George Mathewson, former chief executive of RBS, who chairs Arrow, will remain a non-executive director.

Encore (A Special Report): Financing Your Future --- How to Maximize Your Social Security Benefits: A growing number of online tools can help you figure out an optimal 'claiming strategy'

When is the best time to claim Social Security?

Would-be retirees are turning to a growing number of online programs to answer that question and squeeze the maximum from their Social Security benefits. For couples, the claiming decision can be especially complicated because of the availability of spousal benefits and the need to consider the financial security of the survivor.

We decided to test five of these services, from AARP, the lobbying group for older Americans; T. Rowe Price Group Inc., the Baltimore-based investment manager; and three websites started by academics -- SocialSecuritySolutions.com; MaximizeMySocialSecurity.com, from Economic Security Planning Inc.; and SocialSecurityChoices.com, from SocSec Analytics LLC. The AARP and T. Rowe Price programs are free; the others charge a fee.

At each site, we entered data for a fictional couple, Bob and Wendy, each age 65. At age 66 -- their full retirement age -- Bob and Wendy are eligible for monthly Social Security benefits of $2,182 and $815, respectively. The two believe they will both live to age 85.

The challenge: Identify a claiming strategy likely to yield the most money over both spouses' projected life spans.

Easy and Educational

In the end, all five programs generated similar claiming strategies and similar numbers, with projected lifetime benefits ranging from $763,222 to $773,500. (All figures are in 2013 dollars.) Each tool has advantages and drawbacks, but all of them educate users about claiming strategies that many people don't know are available.

For instance, an individual who first claims Social Security at his full retirement age might have a choice of benefits: one based on his own earnings record, or a spousal benefit. If he selects the spousal benefit, he can switch at some future date to his own benefit, which will have grown larger thanks to his delay in collecting it. Steps like these can help maximize a claimant's lifetime payout.

All five programs proved relatively easy to navigate. Within a few minutes of prompting a user to enter his or her date of birth and estimated monthly Social Security benefit, as well as those of a spouse, each generates clear recommendations.

While all five tools provide help for both single and married people, T. Rowe Price doesn't currently handle projections for widows, widowers, divorced people or spouses more than six years apart in age.

SocialSecuritySolutions.com, MaximizeMySocialSecurity.com and SocialSecurityChoices.com will offer recommendations for couples after one has already started claiming benefits, and can help those with government pensions calculate and potentially mitigate the resulting reductions to their Social Security benefits. AARP, MaximizeMySocialSecurity.com and SocialSecuritySolutions.com also account for Social Security's earnings test for individuals who work while collecting benefits before reaching their full retirement age.

Two Favorites

The best tool? Two programs -- SocialSecuritySolutions.com and MaximizeMySocialSecurity.com -- take into account the widest variety of household configurations and the impact on Social Security of a higher number of other sources of retirement income, and thus allow for greater customization.

SocialSecuritySolutions.com gets our vote for the most user-friendly. Its colorful screens make it easy to get a handle on complex topics, including how much of your benefits are likely to be taxed and how a specific strategy will perform over different life expectancies. Those willing to pay more can also get a consultation with an adviser.

MaximizeMySocialSecurity.com will appeal to those who want maximum control over the inputs and assumptions that go into their results. It also lets users rerun the numbers using a variety of scenarios at no extra charge.

AARP Social Security Calculator

"http://www.aarp.org/socialsecuritybenefits"

Price: Free

Recommendations:

-- Bob applies for his benefit at 66 so Wendy can apply for a spousal benefit, but he suspends his benefit so that it will be larger when he starts collecting it.

-- Wendy files for a spousal benefit at 66.

-- Bob resumes his benefit at 70, with Wendy continuing to take the spousal benefit.

Cumulative benefits: $767,148

Comments: Identifies the way to claim the highest monthly -- rather than lifetime -- benefit. That usually means one spouse putting off receiving benefits until age 70. One result is that you may collect a higher lifetime benefit if you live longer than expected, but possibly a lower cumulative benefit if you don't live many years past 70. Also, if the higher-earning spouse waits until 70 to claim and then dies first, the surviving spouse will collect more benefits than if the deceased had started earlier.

This tool also calculates how much of your monthly expenses Social Security will cover, assuming you pay average prices for items including food, housing, transportation and health care. (It also allows you to input the amounts you actually spend.)

MaximizeMySocialSecurity.com

Price: $40

Developer:Laurence Kotlikoff, Boston University

Recommendations:

-- Wendy begins her benefit at 66.

-- Bob files for a spousal benefit at 66.

-- Bob switches to his benefit at 70.

-- Wendy switches to a spousal benefit at 70.

Cumulative benefits: $769,780

Comments: Currently requires you to input or import (from Social Security's website) your earnings history, but soon plans to allow the use of estimated full retirement benefits instead. Asks you to estimate your future earnings, the rate of return you expect to earn on your investments, and whether Uncle Sam will reduce future benefits -- and provides defaults for those who aren't sure. Allows you to rerun numbers using different scenarios at no extra charge.

Price: $39.95

Developers include:Russell Settle, former professor at the University of Delaware

Recommendations:

-- Wendy begins her benefit at 66.

-- Bob files for a spousal benefit at 66.

-- Bob switches to his benefit at 68.

-- Wendy switches to a spousal benefit at 68.

Cumulative benefits: $768,216

Comments: Generates a 14-page report with advice under three scenarios: "normal" life expectancies of 82 for men and 86 for women; "long" life expectancies of 88 and 92; and life expectancies you specify. Report includes a grid telling how much you would forfeit by pursuing suboptimal claiming strategies. A downside: Users generally can't rerun numbers without buying a new report.

While many investors are afraid of volatility in the stock market, clear strategies for dealing with this fear can seem few and far between.

So we asked The Experts: For investors who can't stomach much stock-market volatility, what do you recommend?

This discussion relates to a recent Journal Report article on an unusual investment approach known as risk parity and formed the basis of a discussion on The Experts blog on Sept. 5.

GUS SAUTER: One of the most common mistakes investors make is not thinking holistically about their portfolio. Instead, they examine each individual investment and overreact to the ones that are performing poorly or experiencing volatility. Many times, perhaps even most of the time, this is a serious mistake that can disrupt the effectiveness of an investment plan. Frequently, this occurs after a bear market and the investor sells their stocks at the bottom of the market.

One way to overcome this urge is to invest in a balanced fund. The combination of stocks and bonds in the fund should reduce the volatility and help the investor maintain a reasonable allocation to equities without being able to diagnose the full impact of equities in a difficult market.

If this doesn't work, stop reading your statements and just keep dollar-cost averaging.

George U. "Gus" Sauter is a senior consultant to Vanguard Group Inc. where he was chief investment officer from 2003 through 2012.

ELEANOR BLAYNEY: Let's make one thing perfectly clear: Being overly risk-averse is a luxury most individual investors simply cannot afford. Whether they can stomach it or not, they are likely to need a healthy dose of stock-market volatility in their portfolios.

As a CFP professional, my job is to acclimate them to the amount of risk they should accept in order to meet their long-term goals, as opposed to accommodating their finicky appetites for risk particularly if this means sacrificing their futures to enable them to feel safe and comfortable today.

I have two antacids for investors with sensitive stomachs:

First: Put down your iPhone and let go of your mouse, and you won't get hurt. In other words, turn off the streaming noise and squawk of short-term stock-market moves. Even a smooth line looks rough and jagged under a high-powered lens; so, too, will the price fluctuations of a given stock or sector when inspected using daily or hourly magnification. Behavioral economists have, in fact, shown that the less frequently you take stock of the value of your investments, the more risk tolerant you become.

Second: Get educated about capital markets and asset classes. The more you understand about how investments work, the better you'll be able to accept, tolerate and manage investment risk. In fact, education is a great antidote to fear on one hand, and rashness on the other. With respect to investment decisions, women tend to be underconfident, while men are inclined to be overconfident. But when the two genders become more educated about investing, their behavisor tends to converge. Women gain confidence, and men become less overconfident.

Eleanor Blayney (@EleanorBlayney) is consumer advocate of the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards.

CHARLES ROTBLUT: When I speak in front of investor groups, I show a slide entitled, "What If You Are Nervous?" with three suggestions:

As I show this slide, I tell the audience that whenever they find themselves unnerved by the market, they should shut off CNBC, stop reading The Wall Street Journal, and stay away from Yahoo! Finance. They should do whatever it takes to get themselves back into a calm state of mind. Only then should they make decisions about what to do with their portfolios. Until they return to a state of calm, they should refrain from making any investment decisions.

I also remind investors that their biggest risk is not price volatility, but inflation. Over the long term, stocks are the only asset that will deliver returns high enough to offset the devastating impact of inflation. No other asset will accomplish this.

I realize investing in uncertain times is scary, but when was the last time investing in stocks wasn't scary? The reason large-cap stocks have realized annualized returns of 9.9% since 1926 is that it is Mr. Market's way of saying, "I'm sorry for putting your emotions through the wringer."

Charles Rotblut (@charlesrotblut) is a vice president with the American Association of Individual Investors.

GEORGE PAPADOPOULOS: I recommend building a bunker in the backyard, hiding gold bars in several strategic well-hidden locations around the property (bank safe deposit boxes? No way!), and stashing a monthlong supply of ready-to-eat meals (MREs) and water along with guns and lots of ammo. On a serious note, I tell prospects that portfolios with less than 30% in stocks or more than 70% in stocks are both risky. Less than 30% means that inflation will punish you; more than 70% means that fluctuations (this means down fluctuations; everyone loves up fluctuations!) can and will be dramatic. I also ask what percentage of their portfolio and what dollar amount of money they can afford to lose on a month-to-month basis. Everyone underestimates this number! When everything hits the fan, it is interesting to watch how each person's risk tolerance changes.

Still, some people cannot deal with seeing the value of their portfolio go down at all. I tell them the only way to avoid the resulting emotional turmoil is to just stick the money in the bank in laddered CDs and a few U.S. government bonds, perhaps adding a municipal bond fund or individual bond to hold to maturity, and then save like there is no tomorrow. No reason to lose any sleep if you cannot take this volatility. But for those with weak stomachs who nevertheless want to invest, the services of a skilled financial planner are crucial to fully explain the available choices and help each investor create a comprehensive financial plan that fits his or her temperament. Unfortunately, most investors have no plans and their emotions get the best of them.

George Papadopoulos (@feeonlyplanner) is a fee-only wealth manager in Novi, Mich., serving affluent individuals and families.

MICHELLE PERRY HIGGINS: First, I'd have to say it's impressive that they recognize they're risk averse. Typically, investors fool themselves into believing that they can handle more risk until a correction occurs. That's when they reveal their true colors and then a knee-jerk response usually takes place out of fear. I would advise investors to respect their risk level and don't try to deviate too much from their true nature.

5 basic tips for the risk-averse:

1. Don't talk about the stock market around the water cooler. Listening to others venting about their investments or giving financial advice will only stir up your nervousness and doubt.

2. Get your advice and guidance from a financial planner. They are there to help you navigate the stock-market cycles.

3. Don't look at your portfolio daily. You might find once a month or every other month is more comfortable for you. Checking performance on a daily basis will only cause more anxiety and prevent clear thinking.

4. Maintain your equity investments with a time horizon of at least seven years. If you can't handle that duration, stay in fixed income or cash.

5. Continuously educate yourself by reading the newspaper finance section, but don't overdo it by having the business news in the background 24-7.

Michelle Perry Higgins (@RetirementMPH) is a financial planner and principal at California Financial Advisors.

GREG MCBRIDE: The fact is that investors who cannot stomach stock-market volatility really can't stomach volatility in any asset class, and any asset class with any kind of return is going to entail some volatility sooner or later.

Moving out of equities altogether is not the answer. Instead, rebalancing your portfolio back to its intended allocation, or dollar-cost averaging which is investing a set amount at regular intervals can be particularly beneficial. When rebalancing, you're forcing yourself to buy low and sell high, which is really the whole idea in investing, isn't it?

With dollar-cost averaging, you're buying more shares when prices are low and fewer shares when prices are high. In this case, focus on how many additional shares you're picking up because of the investment made at the now lower price.

These habits can help investors discipline themselves to use market volatility to their advantage and resist the urge to do the worst thing, which is bail out and head for the hills.

Greg McBride (@BankrateGreg) is a senior financial analyst and vice president for Bankrate.com, providing analysis and advice on personal finance.

MATT HOUGAN: Don't look.

There are two kinds of people who can't stomach stock-market volatility. First, there are people who depend on the money for income and have no way to wait out volatility or recover from losses. These people should own bonds, preferably with short durations and limited credit risk.

Then there are the people who panic when the market falls and sell stocks at the bottom. These people should only look at their investments once a year, and then only with a financial professional looking over their shoulder. They should forfeit control of their investments to people with steadier nerves and a bigger-picture outlook.

Other options, like creating low-volatility portfolios, are interesting and can help. But in major market crises, even those low-volatility portfolios will crash. It's better if you just keep your hands off the trigger.

Matt Hougan (@Matt_Hougan) is president of ETF analytics and global head of editorial for IndexUniverse LLC.

MANISHA THAKOR: "I love you but I hate you." It's the understandable refrain of volatility adverse investors. So how can you fight inflation by investing in stocks for the long run without experiencing vertigo in the short run?

I recommend the asset allocation "cha-cha-cha." Think of this as a dance you'll do with three distinct moves. First, you identify how much money you need to know is "safe" in order to sleep well at night. For some people this may be a year of living expenses and for others it may be every major expense you know is coming due in the next five years (think: new car, wedding, home down payment, college tuition, home repairs, etc.). Put this money in CDs or a money-market fund. Now you can sleep.

Step two is to now identify the right asset allocation for the remainder of your funds (i.e. the split between stock and bonds). A rough rule of thumb popularized by Vanguard founder John Bogle that I just love: The percentage of your long-run investment portfolio that should go in bonds equals your age. The rest goes in stocks.

Step three is to remind yourself that the nature of your stockholdings by definition is volatile. As you can see in the attached chart, in a very high percentage of calendar years when the market had positive performance, there was at least one quarter where the decline could take your breath away. That's why step one was the cash buffer. You now know no matter what happens in any individual quarter (or even a string of bumpy quarters) that your day-to-day life will not be affected because you've already set aside the necessary cash.

Manisha Thakor (@ManishaThakor) is founder and chief executive of Santa Fe, N.M.-based MoneyZen Wealth Management LLC.

TOM BRAKKE: There isn't a pat answer for that question without knowing more. That said, while it is important to try to make good decisions for the future, your investment approach should not make you miserable. Life is too short to chase returns if you are unhappy along the way.

Tom Brakke (@researchpuzzler) is a consultant, writer and investment adviser who specializes in the analysis of investment decision making and the communication of investment ideas.

MIKE PIPER: A single occurrence of panic-selling in the depths of a bear market is more than enough to wipe out the relatively higher returns that typically come from stock investing. So, in short, my suggestion for investors with a low risk tolerance is indeed to use a conservative portfolio.

Of note, however, is that "conservative" doesn't necessarily mean 0% stock. Adding a very modest stock allocation to an otherwise-bond portfolio often improves returns without adding dramatically to the portfolio's overall volatility.

Also, it's important to accept the fact that low-risk portfolios do tend to earn lower returns than high-risk portfolios. So if that's what you're signing up for, you're likely going to have to modify the conventional investment advice somewhat.

First, you should plan to use a higher savings rate (or a lower spending rate, if you're already retired) and perhaps plan to work until a later age.

Second, you'll have to be especially attentive to the costs your portfolio incurs. Unnecessarily giving up 1% per year via mutual-fund expenses is a bad idea in a stock portfolio, but it's a disaster for a bond portfolio that might have an after-inflation yield of just 1% to 2% in the first place.

Third, it will be important to get every ounce of yield that you can get for a given level of risk. For example, if you shop around for CDs with good rates and low penalties for early withdrawal, it's often possible to get a higher yield with less risk than you would get with a comparable portfolio of Treasury notes.

Finally, a point of caution: Be careful about going out of your way to avoid stock risk, only to end up with a portfolio of high-risk bonds. If you're not comfortable with stock-market volatility, you probably won't like the volatility of long-term bonds or high-yield corporate bonds either.

Mike Piper (@michaelrpiper) is a Missouri-licensed CPA and the author of the blog ObliviousInvestor.com. He is also the author of several personal finance books, including his latest, "Social Security Made Simple."

RICK FERRI: The simple answer is to own less in stocks. If your tolerance for financial risk is below your current equity allocation, then sell down to a level that's palatable and then stay there. This isn't a sign of weakness; it's a sign of intelligent decision making.

You're better off having a lower allocation to equity and maintaining it through good times and bad than running the risk of panic selling in a bear market. Finding the blend of stocks and other assets that fits both your financial needs and emotional DNA gives you the highest probability for earning your fair share in the markets.

European Stocks Advance Modestly; ECB Says Easy-Money Policy Will Continue

European stocks advanced modestly Thursday after the European Central Bank reiterated that its commitment to an easy-money policy would continue for an extended period.

The benchmark Stoxx 600 index rose 0.7% to 304.55. The U.K.'s FTSE 100 index gained 0.9% to 6532.44, Germany's DAX advanced 0.5% to 8234.98 and France's CAC-40 added 0.7% to 4006.80.

While the ECB decided to keep its benchmark interest rate at 0.5%, the central bank's President Mario Draghi said the governing council had discussed cutting rates because downside risks to the economy remained.

Mr. Draghi reiterated that the bank's policy stance was "geared toward accommodation" and that key interest rates would remain at present or lower levels for some time to come.

"Mario Draghi came across as dovish in his news conference, despite the euro zone exiting recession, although he clearly was influenced by a desire to combat rising money market rates," said Howard Archer, chief European & U.K. economist at IHS Global Insight.

"The ECB could very well be prompted into action to counter a further rise in euro zone market rates, particularly if they spike up when the U.S. Federal Reserve starts to taper" its bond-buying program.

The bank lowered its growth forecast for next year to 1% from 1.1% it predicted in June.

U.S. stocks were also modestly higher after a batch of positive economic reports, but high-yielding sectors lagged behind as Treasury yields rose.

In 4 p.m. trading in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 13 points, or 0.1%, to 14944. The S&P 500-stock index rose three points, or 0.2%, to 1656, and the Nasdaq Composite Index climbed 12 points, or 0.3%, to 3661.

The number of U.S. workers applying for jobless benefits fell to 323,000 in the latest week, the Labor Department reported, below the 330,000 expected. Also, Automatic Data Processing and Moody'sAnalytics reported that 176,000 new private-sector jobs were created in August, nearly matching expectations for 178,000 new jobs.

Also, the ISM's nonmanufacturing purchasing managers index rose to 58.6 in August from 56.0 in July, confounding expectations for a slowdown.

Utilities and telecommunications shares took a hit as the data pushed benchmark Treasury yields near the 3% mark. The 10-year yield rose to settle at 2.977%. Treasurys have been selling off on expectations the Federal Reserve will begin to roll back stimulus as early as this month as the labor market shows signs of strengthening.

The euro slumped against the dollar and sterling. Late in New York, the euro was at $1.3118 from $1.3207 late Wednesday. The dollar was at 100.13 from 99.75, while sterling was at $1.5592 from $1.5624.

The U.K.'s 10-year government bond yield rose to 3%, the highest level since July 2011. While the Bank of England left its benchmark interest rate and bond-buying program unchanged, as expected, it refrained from issuing a statement to explains its decision. Some analysts felt there was a chance the central bank would take the opportunity to express concern over the rise in market interest rates.

European car makers lent support to the equities markets. The Stoxx 600 autos & parts index rallied 2.4%, led by Bayerische Motoren Werke, which surged 6%.

Reports on Wednesday showed U.S. car sales soared in August and BMW noted sales of its luxury cars and sport-utility vehicles rose 36% over a year earlier. An equity rating upgrade to "buy" from "neutral" by Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch also gave BMW shares a boost.

Peugeot rallied 5.4%, Renault gained 5.8%, Daimler advanced 1.4% and Volkswagen added 1.3%.

In London, Marks and Spencer Group rose 3.4% after HSBC upgraded its recommendation on the stock to "overweight" from "neutral." EasyJet gained 1.7% after announcing upbeat traffic figures for August.

GlaxoSmithKline slipped 0.8% after company's experimental cancer vaccine MAGE-A3 failed to achieve an important trial milestone.

Among commodities, light, sweet, crude for October delivery rose $1.14, or 1.1%, to $108.37 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Gold for September delivery fell $16.80, or 1.2% to $1,373.10 a troy ounce on the Comex division of the Nymex.

INVESTMENT COMPANIES

An investment vehicle backed by City heavyweights including Michael Spencer, the chief executive of Icap and former Conservative party treasurer, is planning to create a specialist listed lender to shake up the invoice finance industry.

Tungsten - run by Edmund Truell , founder of private equity house Duke Street Capital - is set to file an intention to float on the London stock market as early as today after homing in on two separate takeover deals.

It will ask equity investors for as much as 160m to help pay for an electronic invoicing services group whose clients include BP, GlaxoSmith-Kline and Tesco, which it plans to combine with a bank.

"We want to disrupt the supply-chain finance market," said Mr Truell, who last year stepped back from Pension Insurance Corporation, the bulk annuity specialist he founded.

"The opportunity to grow this is vast."

Tungsten is poised to buy OB10, an electronic invoice processing company whose shareholders include Fleming Family & Partners, the aristocratic investment office run by relatives of James Bond creator Ian Fleming.

The soon-to-be-listed vehicle is set to acquire the UK arm of First International Bank of Israel, which will give it a UK banking licence subject to regulatory approval. The remaining monies that shareholders invest in Tungsten will be used to provide capital to the new lender and fund an invoice analytics business. The invoice finance, or "factoring", sector has already attracted interest from non-traditional lenders, which are seeking to steal market share from mainstream banks. However, Mr Truell argued that the incumbent operators charged high and opaque fees.

He said that Tungsten aimed to create "the world's largest cloud-based global trading network" by combining invoice financing with electronic services.

OB10 has a network of more than 140,000 suppliers, operates in 42 countries and processed more than 100bn worth of invoice transaction value last year.

The acquisition of OB10, subject to Tungsten's successful flotation on Aim, will result in a payday for its private shareholders, including the former Visa employees who set up the business 13 years ago.

OB10 shareholders, which also include Azini Capital, will receive about 68m in cash but take about 30 per cent of the total sale proceeds in Tungsten shares.

Canaccord Genuity is acting as financial adviser, broker and bookrunner and Charles Stanley as Nomad.

How insurers can master the digital revolution

Digital technologies are changing customer expectations. Insurance companies that integrate digital across the business could improve their bottom line by more than 30 per cent.

At a time of increasing one-click servicing and 'always on' communication, insurance customers no longer have the patience to flip through pages of documentation or squeeze in an appointment with an agent during working hours. Access and convenience are the name of the game.

Carriers, of course, have not had their heads in the sand. Digital interactions already play a significant role in some parts of the industry. More than half of the motor insurance business in the UK, for instance, has gone direct. In continental Europe, only one-third of customers plan to purchase their next policy solely by interacting with an agent. The remainder will use digital channels to do everything from comparing price and coverage options to directly purchasing policies.

The drive to digital brings substantial profit implications for insurers. McKinsey & Company's research suggests that around 30 per cent of net profit could be at stake. Carriers that apply digital technologies at scale across the organisation have the potential to add between 31 per cent and 38 per cent to net profit over the next five years, whilst dabblers, or those that take no action at all, could see as much as 30 per cent of their profit at risk.

Opportunity (and risk) exist across the entire value chain. In product management, for example, digital has helped launch innovations, such as pay-as-you-go products. In marketing it has enabled more targeted advertising, which our analysis of the UK. market shows could add 9 to 11 per cent of net profit.

Opportunities in sales and distribution are even greater, with digital giving carriers the ability to sell to underserved segments - markets that would be too costly to serve without the help of technology. Digital is also helping insurance companies roll out mobile sales support apps that make it easier for agents and brokers to win business, and to turn customer data into insight that can help increase cross-selling opportunities.

This will not be news for most insurance companies since many already have digital on their radar. Somewhat surprisingly, however, the majority lack a comprehensive digital strategy. Most limit their activity to piloting digital elements on the consumer-facing side and in their marketing, such as arming the sales force with iPads, creating a snappy online app to compare policy options, or upgrading their website capabilities.

That may make the insurer look 'cool' in the eyes of consumers, but an additive approach to digital comes at a cost. By bolting new features on to the existing carrier backbone and business model instead of thinking through a holistic digital transformation of their operations, insurers face much higher investment and operating costs. Incumbents can ill-afford that kind of additional spend, especially at a time when aggressive new entrants freed from legacy infrastructure constraints are using digital to deliver products and services at a significantly more competitive price point.

By putting digital investments to work in a more integrated fashion across the business, traditional insurers cannot only get more bang for their buck, they can g row net profit in a more sustainable fashion. Very few insurers, for example, come even close to achieving the cost savings that can accrue from capturing data in digital formats and using that to speed process flow and efficiency, something that has delivered operational cost savings of up to 40 per cent in industries such as banking.

To get there, our research shows that carriers should focus their efforts on digitally enabling three areas: multi-channel interaction with customers and partners, advanced analytics, and greater process automation.

Taken together, these three areas open opportunities that can positively impact an insurer's bottom - line. For example, some insurers have come to realise that digital channels do more than expand the distribution network; they play a big role in improving customer service, too, by allowing consumers to connect with an insurer at any time, from any location, and track the progress of a claim, much in the way one does with a package delivery.

Other insurers are beginning to tap into the benefits that advanced analytics enables. One UK-based insurer, for instance, identified more than 20m in fraudulent claims by cross-referencing new claims against its database of previously filed claims as well as against external social networks.

This helped them spot suspicious data relationships, such as multiple claims with the same mobile telephone number or 'friendship' relationships between different parties in an accident. Advanced analytics also helped a US insurer improve its loss ratio by a couple of percentage points by adding externally sourced underwriting variables to their pricing model.

Finally, the volume of digital or digitisable data within the claims function, combined with the growing number of potential policyholders in emerging economies, is pushing insurers to embrace automatic, 'straight-through' claims processing. Some insurers have already succeeded in automating over 30 per cent of their claims processing in this way. Such automation not only sharply reduces the load on the insurer's staff, it also reduces turnround time and speeds payout, elements that benefit both cost performance and customer satisfaction.

Whilst these are just a few examples, they illustrate the performance break troughs that can come when digital is used across the business. Other innovations stand to take digital even further. In one European country, for instance, leading players in the motor insurance market are considering creating an industry-standard claims app that will let consumers submit claims over their smartphone.

The app will automatically capture claims information, such as location, time and date. It will also let customers submit photos or videos of the damage, and make it easier for them to exchange data with other parties, letting them 'bump' devices to exchange information for instance, and automatically alerting the closest preferred garage to arrange for a pick-up. Insurers can then aggregate that claims information into an industry database to identify possible fraud. Such advances have the potential to significantly improve both operational costs and customer service.

At a time of sluggish growth in the market, digital can provide a much-needed boost. By extending the scope of multi-channel interactions, the use of analytics capabilities, and exploiting the automation potential inherent in digital data, insurers can unlock greater value from their existing markets. With as much as 30 per cent of net profit up for grabs, most insurers would do well to quickly get their act together to master the digital revolution.

Petropavlovsk was among the sharpest small-cap fallers this week after record production from the Russian gold miner failed to translate into earnings. Its shares lost 14.5 per cent as cost pressures and lower gold prices resulted in a wider than expected interim loss and a rise in net debt to $1.15bn.

While new hedging agreements appeared to make it less likely that Petropavlovsk might breach debt covenants , analysts at JPMorgan Cazenove forecast that the group faced a funding gap on $380m of convertible debt due next year.

Shares in Wandisco, the "big data" computing specialist , climbed 12.8 per cent after the group strengthened its management with the appointment of executives from BT and two of its leading sector peers, CollabNet and MapR.

Antibody developer Oxford BioMedica enjoyed a 13.5 per cent rise in its share price after receiving a $1m milestone payment from licensee Pfizer, triggered by the US group beginning trials of a cancer therapy.

Aim-listed penny stock Premier African Minerals showed a gain of 142 per cent after it set out plans for its tungsten mine in Zimbabwe.

"We have to suspect that at least some temporary speculative mining share trading and investment interest has returned to the market," said VSA Capital. "It is just possible that it is more than temporary."

"We have to suspect that at least some temporary speculative mining share trading and investment interest has returned to the market," said VSA Capital. "It is just possible that it is more than temporary."

Sweett

Shares in Aim-quoted Sweett - the UK's only listed quantity surveyor - jumped 17 per cent to 44p yesterday after Michael Henderson, chairman, said profits for the year to March 2014 would be better than expected, writes Kate Burgess.

Analysts raised pre-tax profit forecasts to 3.5m last month following upbeat first-quarter trading.

Yesterday, they raised them again to 4m, putting Sweett on a price/earnings ratio of 8.3.

The group suffered in the downturn, making a loss in the full year to March 2012. But Mr Henderson said business had been strong in Asia, the Middle East and Europe, and the group would be turning over 100m, with margins of 7 to 8 per cent, by 2015.

In June, the shares fell to 19.5p following allegations of improper business conduct three years ago by a former employee in the Middle East. An investigationis continuing

Vislink

It is 10 years since John Hawkins was ejected as chief executive of Anite, after making more than 30 acquisitions in four years. But his latest efforts at consolidation appear to be going down rather better, writes Henry Mance.

Shares in Vislink - the communications technology company Mr Hawkins has run since 2011 - reached a five-year high of 46.5p this week, after it bought Amplifier Technology for 4m including earnouts.

The deal, the second under Mr Hawkins, adds phone signal jammers to Vislink's portfolio of products for police forces.

Bulls were also heartened by Vislink's orders of 33.6m in the first six months of 2013, up a third from a year earlier. The company reiterated its goal of 80m in revenues and 8m of profits next year.

Vislink shares are up 50 per cent since June, but trade on 16 times full-year earnings, well below the sector average of 47.

Plus500

Online trading platform Plus500 thanked its new investors this week by announcing a dividend equivalent to more than half of its net profit from the first half of the year writes Vanessa Kortekaas.

The Cyprus-domiciled company raised $75m last month in its initial public offering, which one analyst described as a "well-timed float on the back of a buoyant market".

On Tuesday, the company said its revenues for the six months to June 30 had risen 47 per cent year-on-year to $44.7m, butadded that trading activity has been "subdued" since then. Plus500 now has plansto grow internationally.

Shares in the group closed at 131.5 yesterday. Their post-IPO peak was 140p on August 6.

At this level, they trade on 9 times earnings estimates for 2014, compared with a multiple of 14 times for IG Group, the market leader in spread betting.

U.S. Strike on Emerging Nations

A looming war in the Middle East, the lingering legacy of a recent U.S. recession and very low interest rates suggesting the next move must be upward. Summer 2013, yes, but also summer 2002. For emerging markets, the outlook is darker this time.

Emerging markets have been melting in the summer heat. This week, with the Indian rupee and Turkish lira hitting record lows against the U.S. dollar, the focal point is expected U.S. military action in Syria.

By injecting fear into oil markets, Syria does exacerbate a problem facing several emerging markets: energy costs. Priced in dollars, Brent crude still is 2% below its 2008 peak. But in rupees, for example, it is around 25% above the 2008 high point. Higher energy import bills widen current-account deficits menacing several emerging markets. Meanwhile, the threat of war encourages foreign investors to withdraw to safe harbors, draining away the portfolio flows required to plug the gap.

The real threats to emerging markets, though, lie not in Damascus but in Washington and at home. The MSCI Emerging Markets index underwent an initial correction of 12% in the month following U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's indication on May 22 that the central bank could start scaling back its bond buys in September.

Foreign capital that helped plug current-account deficits in several emerging markets is being called home by the prospect of higher rates. Some $23 billion has flowed out of emerging-markets bonds since May 22, not too far short of the $30 billion that had flowed in since mid-2012, according to Barclays. This, in turn, raises local funding costs and stokes inflation via falling exchange rates.

Back in 2002, rumblings of a much bigger U.S.-led war were in the air and the federal-funds target rate, at 1.75%, didn't look like it could go much lower. Emerging stock markets were selling off, centered on worries about South America.

As it turned out, though, the MSCI index bottomed in October of that year. The Fed actually did go lower: The target rate was cut to 1.25% in November and to 1% in June 2003. Despite the Iraq War kicking off in March 2003, emerging markets began a spectacular bull run, quadrupling by October 2007 -- even as oil prices surged and the Fed pushed the target rate back up to 5.25%.

Despite the echoes with that similarly fevered time a decade or so ago, the world has changed. For one, the commodities boom that boosted large emerging markets such as Russia and Brazil has petered out. Even if oil spikes on Syrian conflict, the experience of recent years indicates this will undermine demand, either by crimping economic growth or accelerating the drive toward greater fuel efficiency or oil substitution.

Beneath this lies a more fundamental change. In 2002, investors could look forward to a five-year period in which emerging markets' economic growth averaged five percentage points more a year than developed markets. Today, looking ahead five years using International Monetary Fund estimates, the gap looks set to have shrunk to 3.5 percentage points.

What has changed is that, following the financial crisis, the developed world's ability to suck in imports from emerging markets, funded by credit, is greatly diminished. Rising U.S. interest rates will serve to keep a lid on that.

Without that tailwind, the structural challenges facing emerging markets are resurfacing, such as India's barriers to investment and Brazil's inadequate investment in infrastructure. The confused policy response to recent pressure on currencies, be it India's imposition of capital controls or Turkey's convoluted interest-rate corridor, heightens the sense that emerging markets are struggling in this new environment.

Barclays points out that while emerging-market sovereign yields fell during the last Fed-tightening cycle, as the next one looms, they have risen by around a percentage point on average already.

Syria adds to the pain, but emerging markets are fighting a different war already.

Taking the Wrong

Mortgage Route

So much for skin in the game. No- or low-money-down mortgages helped fuel the U.S. housing bubble and subsequent crash. Following the crisis, there were understandable calls for a return to more prudent practices, where borrowers would be required to make some sort of down payment for a mortgage, typically equal to 10% or 20% of a loan's value.

As part of that push, bank regulators included a 20% down-payment requirement in proposed rules that would determine whether banks had to retain for a period of time mortgages that they planned to package and sell on to investors. On Wednesday, regulators backtracked in the face of stiff opposition from the real-estate industry, members of Congress and many banks.

In an unusual revision, the regulators dropped the down-payment requirement. The fear is that, with lending standards tightened significantly after the crisis, lower-income and other borrowers would find it tougher to get mortgages.

That risk looms large in regulators' minds given the importance they, and in particular the Federal Reserve, have placed on trying to revive housing as a means to speed up economic recovery.

Yet it also is worth remembering that lax lending standards were what got the economy into a mess in the first place. Regulators themselves acknowledge down-payment levels "are significant factors in determining the probability of mortgage default."

Requiring borrowers to have sufficient equity also gives added comfort to credit investors that they face less risk of loss. Over time, that could help to actually reduce the cost of credit.

Granted, the rules don't say that lenders can't require certain levels of down payments or mortgage insurance. And there are other safeguards built into the proposal.

All this potentially sets the stage for some sort of compromise that would see a 10% down-payment requirement, notes Karen Shaw Petrou, of Federal Financial Analytics.

Failing that, regulators may once again be putting hopes for short-term economic gain ahead of the need to build a safer housing market.

-- David Reilly

Mark to Market Isn't Working

U.K. markets aren't backing down. Investors were looking for a signal from governor Mark Carney on Wednesday that the Bank of England meant business on its guidance that interest rates would remain at 0.5% potentially well into 2016. But Mr. Carney simply reiterated what the market already knew, sending sterling and market interest rates even higher. The standoff may be protracted.

The BOE's guidance says the Monetary Policy Committee won't consider tightening policy until unemployment falls to 7% from 7.8% -- which it thinks might not happen until late 2016. But markets have priced in a rate rise early in 2015. Mr. Carney failed to win them over: After he spoke, the pound jumped a cent against the dollar and two-year gilt yields rose as high as 0.48% from 0.4%, a big move.

Short-term interest-rate contracts now price in rates rising by 0.32 percentage point by March 2015, compared with 0.27 point before the speech, according to Royal Bank of Scotland.

Mr. Carney offered plenty of verbal reassurance that rates would stay low, including reiterating that unemployment reaching 7% didn't mean an automatic rate increase. But two factors counted against him.

First, Mr. Carney declined to say what the MPC would do in the face of market expectations of rates that it has previously said aren't warranted by the economic outlook. With the MPC already split on the merits of further government-bond purchases -- one tool to force yields back down -- and a rate cut looking very unlikely, that gave markets the green light to push rates higher.

Second, he announced a relaxation in the requirement for U.K. banks to hold highly liquid assets such as government bonds, which might free up GBP 90 billion ($139.9 billion) to be reinvested elsewhere. That should help the economy, but also hit gilts since banks might start selling their holdings.

Mr. Carney seems more focused on sending a message to U.K. companies and households on rates at present. He has had some success there. A survey by Markit in mid-August showed 40% of households expecting a rate increase in the next two years, down from 53% in July. But he has a long way to go to bring the same sort of certainty to investors. If U.K. data continue to impress, gilt yields will continue to rise.

Colony

Books Into

C-Suite

At Accor

When all else fails, do it yourself.

French hotelier Accor has churned through three chief executives in the eight years that U.S. private-equity firm Colony Capital has been an investor. When it came to naming a fourth, the board couldn't do better than Colony's head in Europe, Sebastien Bazin: He was unanimously voted in as CEO and chairman Tuesday.

Accor wants to overhaul its business by owning fewer of its hotels directly. The company has a 2016 target of managing and franchising 80% of its estate, where profit margins are far higher, compared with 58% in June. But investors hoping for a quick makeover could be disappointed: The new CEO is working with a limited tool kit.

True, Mr. Bazin's appointment could mark an end to political infighting between departments. It also should mean a better relationship between management and Accor's board, which became increasingly frustrated during the former Chief Executive Denis Hennequin's tenure.

But Accor's problem still is growth. To open more hotels, more quickly, it needs access to other investors' capital, either as Marriott International did when it demerged its real-estate portfolio or by finding owners or franchise operators like InterContinental Hotels Group does. Neither is straightforward for Accor.

Some investors might hope for a spinoff of the real-estate portfolio, as Accor did with its vouchering business Edenred in 2010. Since then, Edenred's shares have risen 74%, compared with a 13% gain at Accor. But that requires improved performance. Despite a 1.8% increase in like-for-like sales in the first half, operating profit fell 14.7%. Accor has been spending more to try to reduce its reliance on third-party online booking sites where it pays big commissions to fill rooms.

Instead, Accor may need to stick with its current strategy, aping InterContinental. But to reach its 2016 target, it needs to sell or exit from leases on 800 properties, Nomura says. That seems increasingly unrealistic: Accor managed to shed just 24 owned and leased hotels in the first half.

In the near term, Accor shares might continue to benefit as investors bet on Europe's improving economic outlook. But at 17 times forecast 2014 earnings, in line with Marriott and at a premium to InterContinental, investors should be wary. There are no quick fixes.

Global Finance: Regulators Ease Mortgage Securities Rules --- Housing Lobby Scores a Victory, But Critics Warn of Possible Return of Risky Loans That Led to Real-Estate Meltdown

WASHINGTON -- Federal regulators retreated from a proposal that would have toughened rules for the mortgage securities market, a defeat for advocates of tighter standards and a victory for the housing lobby.

Six regulators -- including the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Securities and Exchange Commission -- on Wednesday issued proposed rules that would require banks and other issuers of mortgage-backed securities to retain 5% of the credit risk of the bonds on their books, as mandated by the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law.

However, the proposal carries an exemption so broad it wouldn't apply to securities containing most mortgages made under today's stricter lending standards, which are of relatively low risk. Rather, the rule would apply to the types of higher-risk loans that were popular before the 2008 financial crisis. The rule effectively sets boundaries for what kind of loans might be offered, and on what terms, once lending standards relax.

Had the rule been in effect last year, at least 98% of loans would have been covered by the exemption, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sAnalytics.

The decision by regulators represented a major concession to the real-estate industry and consumer groups that had worried the 5% requirement would hurt the housing recovery by limiting credit.

The proposed rules still would severely limit the types of toxic loan products, such as loans with low "teaser" rates that reset at higher levels, that contributed to the financial crisis. The rules effectively prohibit "a number of the problematic practices that contributed to the recent mortgage crisis," said FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg.

The move was a disappointment for backers of rules that are even tighter than today's standards. They had said that during the housing boom, lenders made too many risky loans without regard for borrowers' ability to repay them because the lenders could quickly resell the loans to Wall Street.

SEC Commissioner Daniel Gallagher issued a 3,000-word dissent, saying the proposed exemption was "unrealistic and dangerously broad" and would impede the development of securitized lending with risk retention.

"We are delivering exactly the type of implicit endorsement that led to the massive expansion of subprime" mortgage-backed securities before the crisis, he wrote in his dissent.

The proposal would affect the market for mortgage-backed securities -- pools of loans that are packaged by banks and sold to investors. During the crisis, the value of those securities dropped as millions of homeowners lost their homes to foreclosure, sending shock waves through the financial system. That market has been slow to recover, with most securities issued through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and other government entities.

The new proposal drops the regulators' earlier plan to exempt only those loans with at least a 20% down payment. Instead, the new rules largely adopted a separate mortgage definition put forward earlier this year by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that outlines steps banks must take to demonstrate that a borrower has the ability to repay a mortgage.

Under the new proposed rules, banks would have to retain 5% of the risk for many of the types of loan products that fed the housing bubble, such as those in which borrowers only make interest payments or allow the principal balance to increase. They also would require banks to ensure that borrowers' total monthly debt doesn't exceed 43% of their income.

Regulators sought comments on the proposal by Oct. 30. They also asked for comment on an alternative definition that would add a 30% down payment to the exemption requirement.

Government officials have become more concerned in recent months that the combined weight of mortgage regulations could further constrain lending at a time when mortgages still are available only to the most creditworthy borrowers. Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve dropped a separate proposal to require banks to hold more capital for certain mortgages with low down payments.

The change in the risk-retention plan reflects concern "there is just too much uncertainty around how risk retention would have worked in this already credit-constrained market," said Jim Parrott, a former White House housing policy official now with the Urban Institute.

AgBank's Profit Rises; Clouds Loom --- First-Half Income Increases 15%, but Chinese Lender Warns of Slowing Growth and Tighter Margins

BEIJING -- Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. reported a 15% rise in its first-half profit, but executives warned that the banking sector overall faces slower profit growth, narrower interest-rate margins and rising risks over the rest of the year.

The nation's third-largest bank by assets also disclosed Wednesday that it played a key role in stabilizing the interbank market during a June credit crunch, pumping a net 840 billion yuan ($137.17 billion) into the market where banks borrow and lend to one another.

The bank said its own net profit for the six months ended June 30 was 92.4 billion yuan, up from 80.50 billion yuan in the first half of last year, as interest income rose 7.1% and fee income jumped 22%. That topped the average 89.35 billion yuan forecast of analysts polled by Thomson One Analytics.

But the outlook for the sector was clouded by slower economic growth -- which could mean fresh bad loans from struggling customers -- and an effort by Beijing to give banks more freedom to set interest rates.

The easing of state controls on interest rates will raise funding costs for banks as they compete for customers by offering higher interest on deposits, while the removal of controls on lending rates could eventually push those rates lower. Beijing has removed the floor on lending rates and indicated it is looking at deposit-rate revisions.

"With interest-rate liberalization moving ahead, banks' net interest margins will narrow and banks will face increasing asset quality pressure," said Zhang Yun, bank president.

"We estimate Chinese banks' profits will continue to grow, but the growth rate will slow," he told a news briefing.

China's largest rural lender said its net interest margin -- the difference between its cost for funds and the interest on loans -- narrowed to 2.74% from 2.85% a year ago, due to easing controls on interest rates. Bank executives said they expect this to stabilize in the second half.

The bank's own nonperforming loan ratio fell to 1.25% at the end of June from 1.33% at the end of December.

Bank executives also gave a glimpse of the role that the Agricultural Bank -- and most likely other big state banks -- played in easing a credit squeeze in June that briefly sent overnight interest rates soaring to a whopping 30% a year on the interbank market. That spilled over onto the stock market, briefly sending prices tumbling before the central bank stepped in to boost liquidity in the banking system.

"Agricultural Bank, as a big bank, played a stabilizing role for the market in June," said Lou Wenlong, vice president, speaking at a news briefing.

He didn't say whether the action was taken at the request of the central bank.

Banking officials have blamed the lack of liquidity on a combination of factors, including reduced inflows of foreign capital as well as regulatory requirements and tax payments. A mismatch of long-term lending and short-term funding also played a role.

Chinese Bank Faces 'Hidden Crisis' --- Overdue Loans Increase Rapidly From a Year Earlier at China Construction Bank as Economy Cools

BEIJING -- China Construction Bank Corp. encountered a surge in overdue loans during the first half and could face a "hidden crisis" if the situation worsens, its top official warned on Monday.

The comments from Chairman Wang Hongzhang underscore rising concern in China about heavy debt and the increasing potential for sour loans as economic growth slows.

At a news briefing, Mr. Wang said nonperforming loans remain a small portion of outstanding total loans. Still, he said, nonperforming loans at CCB had risen rapidly compared with a year earlier.

At the end of June, China Construction Bank held 90.4 billion yuan ($14.77 billion) in overdue loans, accounting for 1.12% of the lender's outstanding loans. The overdue loans were 13.4 billion yuan higher than at the beginning of the year, the bank said.

"Though our nonperforming-loan ratio has been held below 1%, we still face big pressure from rising bad loans," he said. There has been "a big rise in overdue loans, and that is a hidden crisis for nonperforming loans."

Loans are generally classified as overdue before a bank categorizes them as nonperforming.

Vice President Pang Xiusheng said the bank would write off more loans this year than last year. He didn't provide an estimate. CCB said in its interim earnings report Sunday that the rise in overdue loans was mainly attributable to the slowing economy.

Investors, analysts and industry watchers have warned that China's banks could face worsening problems if the slowing economy hurts borrowers' ability to pay back their obligations. Chinese banks report low levels of nonperforming loans, at 1% or even lower, but critics say many have resorted to extending maturing loans to avoid defaults.

China Construction Bank is the first of China's four big state-run banks to report results, and investors will be watching to see how China's economic slowdown affects their loan books. One smaller bank, China Merchants Bank Co., reported 29.5 billion yuan in overdue loans by the end of June, accounting for 1.41% of the total loans, and 8.1 billion yuan higher than at the beginning of the year.

China Construction Bank said first-half net profit rose 13% from a year earlier to 119.71 billion yuan, boosted by higher interest income and commissions. The result was slightly higher than the average forecast of 118.07 billion yuan among four analysts surveyed by Thomson One Analytics.

The bank reported that nonperforming loans remained steady at 0.99% of loans outstanding at the end of the first half, but it also said it had stepped up efforts to write off bad assets. In the first six months of the year, the bank wrote off 5.38 billion yuan in bad loans, more than four times the 1.17 billion yuan a year earlier.

Executives told reporters at the briefing that the bank didn't transfer any bad loans to asset-management companies in the first half, but that they couldn't rule out doing so later in the year. In 1999, China set up four state-owned asset-management companies to take bad loans from the Big Four state banks, allowing them to clean up their balance sheets before they publicly listed their stock.

CCB executives said nonstandard wealth-management products accounted for about 30% of total wealth-management products outstanding at the end of the first half, lower than the 35% limit imposed by regulators. Wealth-management products are typically high-yield investments that offer a popular alternative to traditional bank deposits.

The proliferation of such products, a lack of disclosure about them and the fact that they are riskier than bank deposits have prompted regulators to tighten rules on the sector.

Regulators have expressed particular concern about so-called nonstandard products, which aren't traded on exchanges and have no fixed trading units. They want wealth-management products backed by standard investments, such as bonds and money-market instruments, to account for a bigger share of banks' offerings.

China Construction Bank executives also said 18.51% of loans during the first half were at interest rates below the central bank's benchmark, and 41.08% were above the benchmark. The benchmark rate for one-year loans is 6%.

Alibaba throws down gauntlet to China banks; BANKS

News analysis

The ecommerce group is taking on traditional lenders with its fund management service, writes Simon Rabinovitch

When Jack Ma vowed in June to shake up the established order of Chinese finance, the country's slowmoving, risk-averse banks had every reason to be nervous.

His ecommerce group Alibaba, with its 500m registered users, has already reshaped the landscape in China's retail industry. With its first foray into banking - a micro-loan business - growing quickly, Alibaba's outspoken founder and chairman let it be known what he thought of banks.

"China's finance industry, especially the banking industry, only serves 20 per cent of clients. I see the 80 per cent of businesses that have not been served," Mr Ma wrote in the People's Daily. "The financial industry needs disruption . It needs outsiders to come in and transform it."

Mr Ma is targeting two specific areas in the industry. Alibaba has encroached on banks' deposit franchises with a new fund management service called Yu'e Bao, meaning "extra treasure" in Chinese, which allows Alibaba users to directly invest online cash in money market products.

It is an attractive alternative to traditional bank accounts. The annualised interest is about 4.5 per cent, more than 10 times the 0.35 per cent rate on current deposits in banks but just as liquid: funds can be withdrawn at any time. Yu'e Bao notched up 2.5m users with Rmb5.7bn ($931m) of investments by the end of its first month.

Now, Mr Ma is turning Alipay , China's PayPal-like online payments service, into an intermediary for the fund industry. Alibaba announced this month that registered users of Alipay will be able to invest with 37 different fund companies. It is a small move but one that gives Alibaba a stronger foothold in the world of online finance.

But just how big a threat is Mr Ma to China's banks?

Alibaba's lending book is growing quickly but it is starting from a very small base. In China's ocean-sized banking sector, Alibaba is still a minnow. AliFinance, its small-loan company, has issued more than Rmb100bn ($16bn) of credit since its founding three years ago - an impressive start but only about 0.1 per cent of the total issued by China's banks.

That small size is working to its advantage, as regulators so far are giving it something of a free pass.

China Entrepreneur magazine has noted that rules on leverage for small-loan companies should have limited AliFinance to about Rmb2.4bn of loans based on its registered capital; instead it has grown roughly 40 times as big. If AliFinance did actually achieve any scale, Alibaba would have a whole new set of considerations, from capital adequacy ratios to deposit reserve requirements, measures that make traditional banks safer but inevitably slow them down.

Alibaba declined to comment for this article.

"They are doing this online lending business through small credit companies. They have shells to make the business legitimate under the current system," said a bank analyst, who asked not to be named since he was not authorised to speak to media. "The problem is how scalable their current model is. Regulators will pay more attention when they get bigger."

Given its reach and reputation in ecommerce, Alibaba is already having an impact on Chinese finance. With its huge base of clients and extensive transaction records, Alibaba is leading the way in China in applying " big data " analysis techniques to lending decisions.

The country's biggest banks have taken notice. Alibaba used to provide transaction data from its ecommerce site toChina Construction Bank so that China's second-biggest lender could make better-informed decisions when allocating loans. That relationship broke down in 2011 when Alibaba tried to charge more for its credit information, according to a person familiar with the matter. CCB's response was to take on Alibaba at its own game, establishing an online mall that would allow it to collect transaction data.

Even without ecommerce, banks have rich troves of customer data and simply have to get better at harvesting it. May Yan, a banking analyst with Barclays. says: "If they made good use of this data, they could be a lot more targeted in meeting their customers' demands. Banks have been slow, so it's good to have this challenge."

There are also clear limits to what Alibaba, or any online-only bank, can do. Analysts say attracting bigger and more stable clients requires providing, among other things, custodial services, currency settlement and face-to-face advice.

All this suggests that to really build a presence in banking, Mr Ma would have to co-operate more closely with the established order that he so badly wants to overturn.

Until then, Alibaba will at most be a disruptive adjunct to China's financial ecosystem.

China Construction Bank Sees Bad-Debt Risk; Chairman Sees 'Big Pressure' as Overdue Loans Increase

BEIJING China Construction Bank Corp. encountered a surge in overdue loans during the first half of the year and could face a "hidden crisis" if the situation worsens, its top official warned on Monday.

Vice President Pang Xiusheng said the bank would write off more loans this year than last year. He didn't provide an estimate. CCB said in its interim earnings report on Sunday that the rise in overdue loans was mainly due to the slowing economy.

Investors, analysts and industry watchers have warned that China's banks could face worsening problems if the slowing economy hurts borrowers' ability to pay back their obligations. Chinese banks report low levels of nonperforming loans, at 1% or even lower, but critics say many have resorted to extending maturing loans to avoid defaults.

China Construction Bank is the first of China's four big state-run banks to report its results, and investors will be watching keenly to see how China's economic slowdown affects their loan books. One smaller bank, China Merchants Bank Co., reported 29.5 billion yuan in overdue loans by the end of June, accounting for 1.41% of the total loans, and 8.1 billion yuan higher than at of the beginning of the year.

On Sunday, China Construction Bank said first-half net profit rose 13% from the same period a year earlier to 119.71 billion yuan, boosted by higher interest income and commissions. The result was slightly higher than the average forecast of 118.07 billion yuan among four analysts surveyed by Thomson One Analytics.

The bank reported nonperforming loans remained steady at 0.99% of loans outstanding at the end of the first half, but it also said it had stepped up efforts to write off bad assets. In the first six months of the year, the bank wrote off a total of 5.38 billion yuan in bad loans, more than four times the 1.17 billion yuan total from the same period last year.

China Construction Bank executives told reporters at the briefing that the bank didn't transfer any bad loans to asset-management companies in the first half, but that they couldn't rule out doing so later in the year. In 1999, China set up four state-owned asset-management companies to take bad loans from the Big Four state banks, allowing them to clean up their balance sheets before they publicly listed their stock.

CCB executives said nonstandard wealth-management products accounted for about 30% of total wealth-management products outstanding at the end of the first half, lower than the 35% limit imposed by regulators. Wealth-management products are typically high-yield investments that offer a popular alternative to traditional bank deposits.

The proliferation of such products, a lack of disclosure about them and the fact that they are riskier than bank deposits has prompted regulators to tighten rules on the sector.

Regulators in particular have expressed concern about so-called nonstandard products, which aren't traded on exchanges and have no fixed trading units. They want wealth-management products backed by standard investments, such as bonds and money-market instruments, to account for a bigger share of banks' offerings.

China Construction Bank executives also said 18.51% of loans during the first half were at interest rates below the central bank's benchmark, and 41.08% were above the benchmark. The benchmark rate for one-year loans is currently 6%.

BEIJING -- China Construction Bank Corp.'s first-half net profit rose 13% from a year earlier as a result of higher interest income and commissions, it said on Sunday.

Net profit attributable to shareholder for the six months ended June 30 was 119.71 billion yuan ($19.6 billion), up from 106.28 billion yuan, the country's biggest mortgage lender said.

The result is slightly better than the average 118.07 billion yuan forecast among four analysts surveyed by Thomson One Analytics.

Net interest income rose 11% to 187.66 billion yuan from 169.69 billion yuan, while net fee and commission income rose 13% to 55.52 billion yuan from 49.24 billion yuan, the state-run bank said.

The bank, one of China's four largest lenders, said its net interest margin remained steady at 2.71%, while the nonperfoming-loan ratio remained at 0.99%.

Deal of the Week: Corus Buyer Scores Big Win

By Robbie Whelan

When a group led by veteran investor Barry Sternlicht paid nearly $2.8 billion in 2009 for the assets of failed commercial-real-estate lender Corus Bank, which went under during the financial crisis, many of his competitors were sure he had overpaid. Turns out they were wrong.

Last week, Mr. Sternlicht's group agreed to sell four high-end apartment buildings to Winthrop Realty Trust, a Boston-based REIT, for $246 million. It was a small transaction but it represents one of the final steps in unwinding the Corus investment -- one of the highest-profile real-estate deals of the downturn. Mr. Sternlicht says he has doubled the value of the $1.4 billion investment made by his Starwood Capital Group and its partners.

Mr. Sternlicht's trade shows how real-estate investors who put their chips down during the darkest days of the downturn, which at the time seemed highly risky, are starting to cash in their bets as the market improves.

"We're starting to see the first waves of flips from investors who bought distressed deals in 2009," said Dan Fasulo, a managing director at Real Capital Analytics, a New York research firm. "It's nice to see them harvesting some of the gains from that purchase."

The Winthrop deal is the first portion of a 13-building portfolio of rental apartment buildings that the Starwood group is selling. Mr. Sternlicht says that once all 13 buildings are sold, all that will remain of the Corus portfolio will be $300 million in real estate assets.

"This has been a great, great risk-adjusted trade for everyone," Mr. Sternlicht said. The group his company led, which included private investment firms TPG Capital, Perry Capital LLC and WLR LeFrak, bought the Corus portfolio in October 2009 using about $1.4 billion in equity and about $1.4 billion in interest-free debt from the federal government.

Corus, which was one of the nation's leading lenders to condominium developers, was seized by federal regulators in September 2009 after more than half of its condo construction loans fell into nonaccrual or foreclosure.

Its deposits were assumed by another bank, but the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. took control of its $4.5 billion loan portfolio. The FDIC, in turn, established a joint venture to own the loans, and later that year, Starwood and its partners won the bid to buy 40% of that venture. Under the terms of the regulator's structured-sale program, the FDIC held on to the other 60%, meaning that the federal government also will take 60% of the Starwood group's gains.

At the time, Starwood's bid scared off the competition; it was 20% higher than the next-highest amount offered by any of the other bidders, including Santa Monica, Calif.-based Colony Capital LLC and New York's Related Cos.

"When they acquired the Corus portfolio, there were two or three groups that were hotly bidding on it, and people said they overpaid," says Michael Ashner, Winthrop's chief executive. "I really don't think they did. They're going to make a very good return."

In late 2009, Starwood established a property asset-management firm, ST Residential, to help it relaunch stalled apartment towers and sell individual condos on a retail -- or one-by-one -- basis. In South Florida, where Corus had lent money on some 2,300 condos and where a recent wave of cash from foreign investors has driven condo prices to nearly $350 per square foot -- close to what they sold for during the boom -- only 25 units from the portfolio remain, Mr. Sternlicht said.

Now, with most of Corus's condos sold, the Starwood group has moved on to selling its rental-apartment portfolio in bulk. In last week's deal, Winthrop signed a contract to buy four luxury apartment buildings in Phoenix, Houston, Los Angeles and Stamford, Conn., representing 761 rental units.

In a regulatory filing, Winthrop said the four buildings -- 44 Monroe in Phoenix, Highgrove in Stamford, Conn., Mosaic II in Houston and the San Pedro Lofts in Los Angeles -- are all between 87% and 95% occupied, and loaded with the type of luxury amenities typical of high-end condo towers built during the boom, including spas, club rooms, yoga studios, infinity pools, and sun decks with barbecues and outdoor fireplaces.

"What we're selling now -- these are assets that we rented, because we didn't think there would be a for-sale market for them," Mr. Sternlicht said. "It's quicker and more efficient to sell them off as rental properties."

Winthrop's Mr. Ashner said the deal isn't typical for Winthrop, which is best known for buying distressed real estate, renovating it and selling it for a profit, rather than buying fully leased luxury apartment buildings.

WEEK AHEAD
Further clues sought on QE policy in the US; Economic outlook

This week could prove crucial for the US Federal Reserve's future quantitative easing policy.

After last week's "taper tantrum" sell-off in response to growing expectations of an early wind-down, markets will be looking for any further clues. The release of the Fed's July meeting minutes on Wednesday will be the next piece in the jigsaw.

Fiscal cuts are looming in the autumn as the congressional stalemate over sequestration rumbles on. This could threaten consumers' confidence, which has so far been driving the recovery. It might also dent the likelihood of the Fed launching its tapering plan next month.

"The US housing recovery has stalled and as tax hikes, higher oil prices and mortgage rate increases hit, the overburdened US consumer cannot be expected to continue to carry the recovery," says Eimear Daly, of Monex Europe.

Others are more optimistic. "Leading indicators remain firm, and with consumer confidence continuing to be driven higher by rising employment and wealth gains from property and stock markets, we suspect underlying demand remains firm," says James Knightley, of ING. "However, the recent spike in Treasury yields has resulted in rising mortgage borrowing costs, and this is likely to provide something of a headwind but will not be enough to reverse the improvement in market conditions."

At the end of the week, the economic policy symposium takes place at Jackson Hole . Fed chairman Ben Bernanke is not expected to attend, but other delegates' remarks could still move the markets.

China's flash manufacturing PMI , released on Thursday, will be scrutinised for indications of whether the country's recent growth stutter is continuing. "Analysts [will be] looking for clues as to just how severe and entrenched [China's] slowdown is, after July data signalled an increased rate of contraction of the world's largest manufacturing economy," says Chris Williamson of Markit.

Flash manufacturing and services PMIs will also be published for individual eurozone countries and the area as a whole.

The German figures may indicate that last week's positive economic growth will be sustained into the second half of the year. Household spending is being supported by wage growth and low unemployment, with industrial production driving investment.

However, weak external demand from the eurozone and Asia is keeping a brake on German exports. This means producer price inflation figures tomorrow are likely to remain subdued.

The detailed figures for Germany's strong second-quarter GDP performance will be published on Friday. "Stable private consumption combined with increased investment likely powered German growth," Petr Zemcik, of Moody'sAnalytics, says.

In the UK, the second estimate of second-quarter GDP on Friday will provide detail of consumer spending and investment, which may firm up views that the economy is firmly on to a recovery track.

Last week's very strong retail sales data were just the latest in a string of evidence for this. This week's manufacturing orders and mortgage lending may further the trend.

"Despite austerity, households can point to a few bright spots, including the housing market recovery and looser credit conditions," Mr Zemcik says.

Public sector borrowing figures may bring good news for the chancellor as he struggles to erode Britain's budget deficit.

"We wouldn't be surprised to see the UK's fiscal position improve this week, primarily through stronger tax revenue figures," Mr Knightley says.

Elephant in the Room to Weigh on Growth for Oracle, Teradata

What do you get when you cross Google with a toy elephant? A threat to sales growth for some big technology companies, and a new breed of promising IPO candidates.

In developing its powerful search engine, Google cracked one of the toughest "big data" nuts: figuring out how to make a copy of the Internet, digest what it means, and then use that information to answer a seemingly infinite number of user questions in nanoseconds. A decade later, Google's innovations have spawned new open-source projects such as Hadoop named after a toy elephant belonging to the son of one of its creators.

Today, Hadoop is used by Google rivals like Yahoo, Facebook and Apple to help make sense of the flood of data generated by the digital revolution. It is also challenging tech heavyweights like Oracle and Teradata. Their core database technology is too expensive and ill-suited for typical big data tasks.

Startups that support Hadoop users, including Cloudera and Hortonworks, are growing quickly and gearing up for initial public offerings. Hortonworks gets paid to support free Hadoop technology; Cloudera has its own paid version.

Traditional databases organize easy-to-categorize information. Customer records or ATM transactions, for example, arrive in a predefined format that is easy to process and analyze. These so-called relational databases are the kind offered by Oracle and Teradata among others, and the market for them runs to an estimated $30 billion a year, according to IDC estimates.

The Internet, though, is messy. Companies now also have to make sense of and store the mass of data being generated from tweets, Web-surfing logs and Internet-connected machines. Hadoop is a cheap technology to make that possible, and it was born of Google technologies detailed in academic papers.

The first challenge in making sense of the chaotic Web is that there is no single computer large enough to handle the job. So Google designed a file system to store data across thousands of inexpensive computers engineered to behave like one big one. It is cheap and it can grow as the amount of data grows, a necessary feature to deal with any big data problem today.

Another challenge is bringing order to the chaos. Google created an operating system of sorts, called MapReduce, to run programs needed to do so.

Hadoop was built on these and other innovations, including subsequent ones also published by Google. The technology has become so integral to Sears, for instance, it now has a consulting arm called MetaScale to sell its expertise.

As for the threat to database heavyweights like Oracle and Teradata, Hadoop won't cause companies to abandon the kind of relational database products they offer. These remain the standard for processing easily organized data.

But Hadoop may slow their pace of growth. That is because companies could increasingly divert spending into Hadoop or similar technologies.

IDC analyst Carl Olofson, for example, estimates the market for Hadoop software will be worth around $800 million in 2016 versus $77 million in 2011. But that forecast may understate the technology's likely adoption rate.

Because it is open source, for every user paying a company for support, there are others that use free versions. And to the extent that any user finds it less necessary to boost spending on traditional databases, that will have a negative impact on those offering such products.

Oracle, Teradata and other large technology companies have their own Hadoop products, but these are likely to account for just 5% to 10% of the market, estimates Mr. Olofson.

Google benefits from these technologies in ways that go beyond its core search engine. It rents space on its massive world-wide "computer." It also sells software tools, delivered as a service over the Internet, to help companies analyze the data they collect. Over time that could become a business to rival Amazon's successful Web-services unit.

Meanwhile, in Silicon Valley's war for talent, publishing papers such as those that led to the creation of Hadoop can help with recruiting, showing potential recruits "that you're working on good problems," says Google Fellow Jeff Dean.

Ironically, besides Google itself, it was search rival Yahoo that may have benefited most, at least early on, from the development of the system that became Hadoop. Doug Cutting, Hadoop's early co-developer with Mike Cafarella, joined Yahoo in 2006, bringing his open-source project with him. A year later, after its own development work, Yahoo made it the basis of an upgrade to its own search-engine technology.

Though Yahoo has since handed off its search function to Microsoft, the work it did on Hadoop led to the spinoff of what is now Hortonworks, in which Yahoo retains a minority stake. Meanwhile, Mr. Cutting left for another Hadoop startup, Cloudera.

Both companies support clients using Hadoop, are growing quickly and are targeting IPOs. Cloudera is seen as further along in this process. Hortonworks is thought to be targeting an offering by 2015.

It seems these leavings from Google's table may make a rich technology feast for others.

WEEKEND INVESTOR --- Wealth Manager: Still Hope for Bond Funds

By Liam Pleven

The Wall Street Journal

Many investors are fleeing bond funds. Those who have stuck around this long might be better off staying put.

Investors yanked more money out of bond funds in June than they put in, removing $68 billion -- the first monthly net outflow in nearly two years, according to investment researcher Morningstar. They took out another $8 billion in July.

Sharply rising yields have pushed down prices, which move in the opposite direction, spurring the exodus amid signs of an improving economy and speculation the Federal Reserve will soon shrink its bond-buying stimulus program. Nervous municipal-bond investors still are weighing the fallout from Detroit's July bankruptcy filing.

The yield on 10-year Treasurys climbed from below 1.7% in early May to above 2.8% Friday. Investors who got out before rates spiked and prices dropped likely dodged some losses.

But not everyone is bailing. Before giving up, bond investors should consider that rates could well go back down. Furthermore, bonds offer protection to long-term investors by diversifying a portfolio.

"Don't necessarily panic," says John Lonski, chief financial-markets economist at Moody'sAnalytics. "Wait and see whether the U.S. economy is strong enough to shoulder Treasury yields at current levels."

The safer bet for nervous bondholders may be to boost holdings of shorter-term bonds that weather rate rises better and to rebalance portfolios to their usual bond allocation, experts say.

Some forecasters see the recent rise as a sign the decadeslong bull market in bonds is starting to turn. In an Aug. 6 research note, Pat McCluskey, a senior fixed-income strategist at Wells Fargo, said "the markets are beginning to move in anticipation," and predicted higher yields.

Yet interest rates are notoriously difficult to predict. There have been other sharp moves in recent years as the U.S. economy struggled to repair damage from the financial crisis and break free of the Fed's extraordinary support.

The 10-year rate could climb above 3% if the Fed signals its intent to taper bond purchases soon, Mr. Lonski says. But the job and housing markets could be too weak to support higher borrowing costs, which could pull rates down again, he adds.

"There's a possibility that we've seen Treasury rates rise too far, too fast," he says. "They could retreat to, say, 2.25% to 2.5%."

Though investors removed money from bond funds in July overall, they put money into funds with less exposure to rising interest rates, such as funds that invest in floating-rate loans to corporations, according to Michael Rawson, a fund analyst at Morningstar.

Investor withdrawals also are a weak indicator of future rate spikes and price drops. August 2011 was the last time investors logged net withdrawals from bond funds, according to Morningstar.

That was the month Standard & Poor's downgraded the U.S.'s triple-A credit rating, which threatened to push up borrowing costs and undermine confidence in the U.S. economy. By the end of September, however, the rate on the 10-year Treasury had fallen, and it ended the year even lower. Investors who sold bonds missed out on accompanying price gains.

Bond funds have logged some losses in this year's spike, but the pain has been limited for investors with diversified portfolios of stocks and bonds.

Someone who at the beginning of the year invested $500,000 split evenly between the Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index and the S&P 500, for example, would have gained 9.4% this year, and have $546,859, according to Morningstar. The same portfolio split 40% in bonds and 60% in stocks would have gained 11.7%, and be worth $558,649.

The urge to sell when prices are dropping is human nature, says Allan Roth, a financial planner in Colorado Springs, Colo. "It hurts," he says. "The way to make it stop is to sell."

Instead, he recommends investors determine the appropriate percentage of their portfolio to allocate to various asset classes and stick to it. He says he has had to talk a few clients out of selling bonds this year.

Jeffrey Cooper, a 67-year-old physician from Newtown, Pa., one of Mr. Roth's clients, says he was tempted to flee bonds this spring, but resisted.

"What I'm trying to do is fight off the emotion," he says. He plans to buy more bonds if prices fall further.

For investors, there also are ways to play defense against additional rate increases. One of the most obvious is to hold more intermediate- or short-term bonds, because longer-dated bonds lose more value if rates leap.

Mr. McCluskey, of Wells Fargo, favors bonds with a duration of about 4.25 years, and prefers corporate bonds, which he says haven't benefited as much as government bonds from Fed intervention.

Mr. Lonski says investors who hold longer-term bonds and want to limit their risk can look for opportunities to sell them if rates dip. One such opportunity may come, he says, if President Barack Obama nominates a new Fed head who markets see as a dove on interest rates to succeed Chairman Ben Bernanke.

China Merchants Bank Posts 12% Rise in Profit;

SHANGHAI Midsize Chinese lender China Merchants Bank Co. said its first-half net profit rose 12% from a year earlier, sharply slower than the same period last year, as China's financial institutions feels the effects of a weaker economy.

The results announced Friday came one day after China Merchants said China's securities regulator approved its plans to launch a rights issue in Hong Kong, as the bank joins others in China moving to shore up their capital base.

China's financial institutions have posted massive profit growth in recent years, providing the bulk of the capital that fueled economic growth that has consistently exceeded 10% annually. But growth has now slowed, with some economists questioning whether growth this year will reach Beijing's target of 7.5%.

The 12% profit growth far exceeds that of banks in most developed economies. But big profit growth could be behind China's banking industry, with excess production capacity in some industries and some local governments struggling to find the resources to repay loans.

China Merchants Bank, China's sixth-largest bank by assets, said net profit for the first six months of the year ended June 30 totaled 26.27 billion yuan ($4.29 billion), up from 23.4 billion yuan a year earlier.

The result was higher than the average 25.94 billion yuan net profit forecast of four analysts polled earlier by Thomson One Analytics.

The bank said the increased profits were driven by growth in net interest income and higher fees. In the first half of 2012, profits rose 26% from a year earlier.

The bank's net interest income rose 8.7% on year to 47.44 billion yuan in the first half of the year, while net fee and commission income soared 46% to 14.16 billion yuan on year.

Its net interest margin, a primary measure of a bank's profitability from lending, dropped to 2.72% from 2.96% at the end of June 2012, as a result of rising interest costs.

China Merchants Bank which is listed in Hong Kong and Shanghai also reported a 0.71% nonperforming loan ratio as of June 30, up from 0.61% at the end of 2012.

On Thursday, China Merchants Bank said it would issue up to 680 million Hong Kong-listed shares. Its Hong Kong shares closed at HK$14.38 on Friday.

China Merchants isn't the only Chinese bank planning to beef up its capital base. The country's four largest lenders by assets Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank Corp., Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. and Bank of China Ltd. recently won board approval to issue up to a total of 270 billion yuan ($44.1 billion) in securities in the next two years. The figure is bigger than the total amount of issuance by the big four in the past two years.

The extra capital will allow the banks to continue lending, while preparing for a rise in bad loans following the massive expansion in lending the banks have pursued following the global financial crisis.

China's major banks don't issue their earnings for another week, with China Construction Bank leading the big four on Aug. 25.

Politics & Ideas: Clear Choices on Housing-Finance Reform

Given all the praise that Americans and their political leaders have for homeownership, the U.S. record has been comparatively unimpressive. A recent survey of homeownership rates in 42 countries (all the members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and European Union, plus Singapore) found that the U.S. ranks 34th. Countries such as Canada have achieved higher homeownership than the U.S. with lower levels of default, taxpayer exposure and systemic risk.

The centerpiece of the Canadian system is mortgage insurance that imposes strict criteria on borrowers and requires private capital to bear the first tranche of losses before the public backstop kicks in. A bipartisan bill drafted by Sens. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.) and Mark Warner (D., Va.), and recently endorsed in principle by President Obama, broadly tracks the Canadian model.

It would phase out Fannie and Freddie, with private financial institutions taking their place. The government could back the securities that private lenders issue in return for a fee, but private lenders would be required to absorb a loss of 10% before the public insurance is triggered. A new independent agency, the Federal Mortgage Insurance Corporation, would enforce the rules, insure eligible securities, and draw on the fee-based insurance fund in case of catastrophe, much as the FDIC does for insured deposits.

Corker-Warner would not be cost-free. Mark Zandi of Moody'sAnalytics calculates that the increased private capital reserves the legislation makes necessary would increase interest rates for average borrowers by 50-75 basis points -- about $75 per month, enough to price some would-be borrowers out of the market. In 15 years, after the insurance fund builds up to adequate levels, this would shrink to about 35-55 basis points, according to Mr. Zandi.

Although Corker-Warner has received a favorable reception in many quarters, some liberal legislators and activists remain worried that getting rid of Fannie and Freddie will fatally weaken policies that promote affordable housing. Others on the left acknowledge that Fannie and Freddie cannot be sustained, but they want much stronger affordable-housing funding and guarantees in return for their elimination.

On the right, many conservative think-tanks and elected officials insist that, as much as possible, the government should get out of the conventional mortgage business. That means not only shutting down Fannie and Freddie, but also not providing backstop public insurance guarantees against catastrophic loss. Last month, the House Financial Services Committee, led by chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), approved the Protecting America's Taxpayers and Homeowners (PATH) Act, which closely tracks the conservative critique.

Analyzing the PATH proposal, Mr. Zandi identified some important advantages over current policy. PATH would increase incentives for prudent mortgage lending and would insulate taxpayers against the costs of future bailouts. But the downsides are considerable: Access to 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages would be significantly diminished. Interest rates for average borrowers would increase by 90 basis points; and the mortgage-backed securities market would be vulnerable to "investor runs" during times of financial stress, just as banks experienced depositor runs before the creation of the FDIC.

The 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage has been the mainstay of the U.S. housing market for decades, and no doubt Mr. Obama speaks for the public in insisting, as he did recently, that it must remain so. But this kind of mortgage, which is unusual by world standards, contains credit and interest-rate risks that few private investors would be willing to take on at anything like current rates -- unless there is some kind of public catastrophic insurance. That is the logic behind Corker-Warner, and that is why this proposal should be the point of departure for the efforts to reform housing finance.

Critics of the Corker-Warner approach must decide whether they want a bill or an argument. If the left is willing to accept the phaseout of Fannie and Freddie, it can probably negotiate strengthened affordable-housing guarantees. (A letter to Messrs. Corker and Warner from the Center for American Progress and two dozen housing and civil-rights groups would serve as a good basis for these talks.) If the right is willing to acknowledge, as Alan Greenspan famously did during the financial crisis, that markets are not perfectly self-regulating, then a House-Senate conference could probably negotiate a backstop public-insurance guarantee that minimizes the risks of political manipulation and taxpayer exposure.

There are real trade-offs, and the public deserves to know what they are. Conservatives who want to shrink government and eliminate taxpayer risk should acknowledge the consequences: diminished access to 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages for the middle class and to affordable housing for low-income families. Moderates and liberals who want to preserve government's backstop role should acknowledge that taxpayer risk has been reduced, but not ended. Then Congress can decide between the Corker-Warner and Hensarling approaches without further weakening public trust in government.

Markets
Blackstone to Buy Stakes in Apartment Complexes From GE Unit; Blackstone has agreed to buy majority stakes in about 80 apartment complexes from the financing arm of GE.

Private-equity firm Blackstone Group LP is making one of the biggest bets on rental apartments since the financial crisis.

The New York firm has agreed to buy majority stakes in 80 apartment complexes from the financing arm of General Electric Co. in a deal that values the portfolio at $2.7 billion, according to people familiar with the agreement. The apartment buildings, with roughly 30,000 units, are in Dallas, Atlanta and other parts of Texas and the Southeast.

It isn't clear how much equity Blackstone is putting up for the transaction, but it is expected to be close to $1 billion, these people said. A spokesman for Blackstone and a spokeswoman for GE declined to comment.

With the investment, Blackstone is wading into a debate in the real-estate-investment world over the future of the rental market. Apartment buildings have been the hottest real-estate sector since the downturn because of strong demand from people unable or unwilling to buy homes. Rents and occupancy rates have been rising while the prices investors have been paying for apartment complexes have moved into record territory.

But in recent months, some analysts and investors have begun to worry that the party is coming to an end. They have warned that the recovery of the single-family-home market will erode demand for apartments and that competition is increasing from new supply being developed in many parts of the country. "I would expect multifamily rent growth to begin decelerating because of the new construction," said Tad Philipp, director of Moody's Investors Service's commercial-real-estate research.

Some big-name investors believe that the outlook remains bright. Earlier this year, AvalonBay Communities and Sam Zell's Equity Residential paid $6.5 billion in cash and stock to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. for Archstone Inc. That deal, which valued Archstone at $16 billion, including debt, was closely watched partly because auditors cited Lehman's investment in Archstone as a big contributor to that firm's bankruptcy filing in 2008.

The apartment sector is being boosted in part because most of the recent job growth has benefited people 34 years old and younger, according to Richard Campo, chief executive of Camden Property Trust, a Houston-based real-estate investment trust that owns and operates apartment buildings. "Those are our customers," he said.

Investors who purchased apartment buildings early in the downturn have enjoyed sharp increases in value. Moody's apartment index, which tracks the national average price of multifamily rental buildings, is up 59% from its 2009 lows, compared with a 35% gain for its National All Property Index.

The rise in values has been propelled by rent increases of 2.3% in 2010, 2.4% in 2011 and 3.8% in 2012, according to Reis Inc., a property-research firm. Vacancy rates, which hit a 30-year high at 8% in 2009, are now at 4.3%, a 12-year low.

In Houston, for example, average apartment rents increased to $799 a month in the second quarter, up 4.4% from the second quarter of 2012. In Seattle, rents were up 6.2% in the same time frame to $1,096.

The big question now hanging over the market is whether or not these trends will continue to push values higher.

In the past year, investors in real estate investment trusts have been getting increasingly wary. The compounded return for the apartment sector declined 3.23% in the past 12 months, compared with an 8.76% increase for all equity REITs, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts.

But others point to a number of market forces that could keep renters in place longer than they otherwise stay during an economic recovery. Despite low mortgage rates, many would-be homeowners are finding that they can't qualify for a mortgage because lending standards remain tight or because they don't have enough regular employment to qualify for a loan. Others have dings on their credit or have struggled to save for a down payment.

At the same time, the supply of homes for sale remains constrained, putting a crimp on sales. While home prices have been rising, they still are down sharply from their 2006 peak in many parts of the country and many owners have been unwilling to sell at these levels.

Investors bullish on the rental apartment sector also note that lending is plentiful thanks to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which have been providing financing to owners of apartment buildings. Buyers of other kinds of commercial real estate have had a more difficult time getting loans for their deals.

Mr. Campo said that while construction of apartment building is picking up, it slowed considerably during the downturn when new supply fell from an average of 250,000 units a year to 75,000 units a year in 2009 and 2010. Builders are only now starting to address that imbalance, says.

"It will take at least three or four years to fill that deficit," Mr. Campo said. "Everything today is being built to meet new demand."

Blackstone's apartment purchase from General Electric is its largest U.S. real estate investment in two years, as it continues to buy from a record $13.3 billion global real-estate fund it recently raised.

In the past couple of weeks, Blackstone has gotten attention for its plans to sell high-profile property and hotel companies. The New York firm recently tapped four banks to prepare Hilton Worldwide Inc. for what could be a multibillion-dollar public offering, and it has taken steps to sell or take public two other hotel companies and a retail-property company.

But in the property market, Blackstone's latest major acquisition shows that one of the biggest private-equity firms isn't making a one-directional bet.

Blackstone has come relatively late to the rental apartment sector but it has been betting on the housing market in other ways. The firm has invested more than $5.5 billion to buy more than 30,000 single-family homes in about one dozen major U.S. markets. The strategy is to rent those homes out for now and sell them as home prices rise.

For GE, the sale is part of an effort to sell down its real estate portfolio. GE boosted its equity investments in commercial property in the years before the financial crisis, but its portfolio suffered during the downturn. The company has since taken steps to sell down its real estate holdings, which may have made it made it a motivated seller of the large portfolio.

It's unclear if Blackstone plans to renovate these buildings, or how it intends to get the high-teen to 20% returns it usually seeks. Initial yields on apartment buildings nationwide are around 6%, and lower in popular markets, according to Real Capital Analytics Inc., a real estate data firm.

It's also not clear how much equity Blackstone is putting into the transaction, but the firm typically relies on debt for about two-thirds the value of properties or portfolios it acquires. By that measure, Blackstone would be investing roughly $900 million in the GE transaction.

WEEKEND INVESTOR --- The Dark Side of Higher Yields --- Income-hungry investors have flocked to energy-focused master limited partnerships and MLP funds this year; Yet risks are rising, and taxes can be hazardous; Here's how to protect yourself

Master limited partnerships, the publicly traded energy firms offering the steady high income many people crave, have been hotter than a wellhead fire.

Investors should proceed carefully, however, or they might get scorched.

Lured by generous quarterly cash payouts, investors poured nearly $8 billion into mutual funds and exchange-traded products specializing in MLPs in the first half of 2013, according to Morningstar, the investment-research firm. More than one-quarter of the roughly $26 billion in the total assets at these funds has arrived since Dec. 31.

MLPs' returns have been strong. Over the decade ended July 31, MLPs generated an average total return, or income plus price changes, of 16% annually; U.S. stocks overall, as measured by the S&P 500, returned an annual average of 7.6%.

The Alerian MLP index, a widely followed benchmark, has a yield (income divided by price) of 5.7% -- more than double the interest income on 10-year U.S. Treasury debt and nearly triple the dividend on the S&P 500.

Many analysts expect those yields, already extraordinary in a world of rock-bottom interest rates, to rise steadily over time as the energy boom picks up speed.

MLPs also provide a regular stream of cash payments that have kept up well with inflation and often are largely exempt from current income tax. Historically, MLPs haven't moved in sync with the S&P 500 -- enabling investors in these firms to reduce the riskiness of an all-stock portfolio.

Yet even bullish analysts are worrying that risk has begun rising among MLPs as money pours in, driving up valuations and pushing down the quality of some offerings. An earlier generation of MLP investors lost most of their money in the mid- to late-1980s when oil prices collapsed, recalls James Murchie, founder and portfolio manager at Energy Income Partners in Westport, Conn., which manages $4 billion.

"If you wanted to launch an MLP in the 1990s, you had to be Albert Schweitzer wrapped up inside Albert Einstein," he says. "But now, so much money is flowing in that mistakes are easier for investors to make."

Expectations have climbed so high that small missteps can send an MLP tumbling. This past Wednesday, Southcross Energy Partners, a Dallas-based natural-gas MLP, plunged 5% when it reported lower-than-expected cash flow.

Mutual funds or exchange-traded funds holding a basket of MLPs also can cost you dearly; the average MLP mutual fund charges 1.44% in annual expenses, or $144 per $10,000 invested, while the average ETF charges 0.82%, according to Morningstar. Meanwhile, investors can own a conventional ETF holding energy stocks for as little as 0.14% annually.

MLPs' yield is vulnerable to rising interest rates, too. That is especially true at smaller firms that fund operations with debt and thus would be hurt as rising rates raised their borrowing costs, says Ethan Bellamy, an analyst specializing in MLPs at Robert W. Baird & Co., a Milwaukee-based brokerage and investment bank.

Above all, MLPs and funds specializing in them are riddled with tax complexities that can weigh on returns, especially for people with less than about $250,000 to invest in the sector.

The tax hazards of buying individual MLPs include large tax-preparation costs; the inability to deduct current losses against other income; and the risk of generating taxable income even within a tax-free individual retirement account or Roth IRA.

These issues are the drawbacks of MLPs' tax-favored status. Although they are publicly traded, MLPs are very different from the corporations that dominate the stock market. As partnerships, they "pass through" net income directly to their "limited partners," or investors, who owe tax at the individual level. Thus there isn't a corporate-level tax for individual MLPs.

Because the cash flow distributed to investors by MLPs often is largely sheltered by depreciation and other tax breaks they are allowed by law, investors often can defer paying income tax on the payouts almost until the position is sold. "The longer the holding period, the greater the tax benefits," says Simon Lack, managing partner of SL Advisors, an asset manager in Westfield, N.J.

But MLP payouts aren't tax-free -- just tax-deferred. To keep track of what is deferred, partnership investors receive annual K-1 reports at tax time instead of fairly simple 1099 forms from a broker. These reports often require multiple state tax filings and expensive tax-preparation help.

Selling a holding sometimes triggers large unexpected payments to Uncle Sam involving arcane items such as depreciation recapture.

"We've had clients sell MLPs after their adviser told them they had no significant gain or loss," says Jim Oliver, a certified public accountant in San Antonio. "But the actual result was a large ordinary gain and a large capital loss" -- a bad tax outcome.

In an effort to circumvent some of these issues and satisfy demand from smaller investors, many firms are offering MLP funds -- but these present other hazards, including high fees, credit risk or an extra layer of tax.

"Some MLP funds severely compromise the tax efficiency they tout," says Robert Gordon, head of Twenty-First Securities in New York, a tax-strategy firm.

For example, many funds devoted to MLPs are unlike regular mutual funds and ETFs that pass through income. Because of their special holdings, they owe taxes as a C-corporation would -- so they owe taxes of 35%, unlike individual MLPs. This means that "$1 of MLP income turns into 65 cents before investors receive it," he says.

Such taxes often are deferred until later, but they are subtracted from the fund's net asset value so that all investors in the fund will bear them equally.

As a result, the reported expense ratio of such MLP funds can vary widely as their returns go up and down. In a boom year, the funds will accrue a whopping deferred tax liability. Recently, for example, the charge -- which is passed along to investors in addition to the fund's expenses -- has been equal to 3.07% of assets at the Global X MLP ETF and 4% at the Alerian MLP ETF.

This added cost also means that the funds' returns can vary widely from those of their benchmarks, with Alerian underperforming by roughly nine percentage points so far this year and Global X trailing by approximately 10 points. Conversely, in a falling market the deferred taxes will be added back to returns, helping these funds beat their indexes.

"You're going to see these things perform so differently from their indexes that investors will mostly be disappointed," says Dave Nadig, president of ETF analytics at IndexUniverse, a fund-research firm in San Francisco.

Jeremy Held, director of research at ALPS Advisors, which distributes the Alerian MLP ETF, says that such ETFs open the market to investors who otherwise couldn't afford to buy a sufficient number of MLPs to build a safe portfolio.

"We're very explicit in trying to explain [a tax liability] that is complex," says Bruno del Ama, chief executive of Global X.

The upshot? "There's no perfect vehicle for owning MLPs," says Nathan Kubik, an adviser at Carnick & Kubik in Greenwood Village, Colo. Instead, investors should weigh the pros of cons of each option.

Here is a guide to five ways to invest in MLPs.

Individual MLP Units

There are more than 100 energy-related MLPs with a combined stock-market value of more than $400 billion, according to the National Association of Publicly Traded Partnerships.

These can be a highly tax-efficient structure for investors with taxable accounts, but they often require complex record keeping.

Mr. Oliver, the San Antonio accountant, estimates that each K-1 annual report "could easily" add $150 to $200 in tax-preparation costs per year, or double that amount if the holding is sold, because of possible multistate filings.

Examples of individual MLPs include such well-regarded firms as Enterprise Products Partners, Magellan Midstream Partners and Plains All American Pipeline. Unlike with other investments, putting individual MLPs in a tax-favored retirement plan such as an IRA or Roth IRA won't resolve tax issues. That is because MLPs typically have more than $1,000 of unrelated business taxable income, which generates taxable income within an IRA and requires complex record keeping.

MLP I-Units

These MLP investments can offer tax efficiency to individual holders willing to forgo what some consider the chief attraction of MLPs, which is cash payouts. Two firms offer them: Kinder Morgan Management and Enbridge Energy Management, allied with MLPs Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and Enbridge Energy Partners, respectively.

Originally designed to attract tax-exempt institutions such as pension funds, these publicly traded corporations hold MLP units and make distributions to investors in the form of more shares instead of cash.

According to Mr. Gordon, the tax strategist, the corporation issuing I-units pays little to no U.S. income tax, and the payouts to investors aren't taxable until shares are sold. Profits on shares held longer than a year count as long-term capital gains, which are taxed at favorable rates.

The tax reporting for MLP I-units also is relatively simple in that taxpayers get a 1099 form when they sell shares, instead of a K-1 tax report.

MLP Funds Taxed as C-Corporations

This category includes ETFs, mutual funds and closed-end funds. Such funds offer diversification, tax-deferred or qualified dividend payouts, and relatively easy record keeping in the form of annual 1099 forms. If shares are held in a retirement account, there is no issue with unrelated business taxable income.

As described earlier, however, such funds incur a corporate-level tax of 35% on net income. It is borne by investors and can greatly increase annual expenses and make costs hard to predict.

In addition to the ETFs mentioned above -- Alerian MLP and Global X MLP -- options include ALPS/Alerian MLP Infrastructure Index A, a mutual fund, and First Trust MLP and Energy Income Fund, a closed-end fund. The Alerian ETF charges annual management fees plus deferred taxes that total 4.85%, or $485 on a $10,000 investment; total costs for the Global X ETF are 3.52%, while ALPS/Alerian MLP Infrastructure charges up to 1.85% and the First Trust closed-end fund charges expenses of 1.37% and has a deferred tax expense of 15.7%.

MLP Funds That Aren't C-Corporations

These MLP funds are like conventional mutual funds, offering diversification and generating 1099 tax reporting forms instead of K-1 reports. But they also are tax-efficient because they don't owe corporate-level taxes, and they pay out income and gains to investors as mutual funds do.

To maintain this tax-favored status, however, no more than 25% of such funds' assets can consist of direct MLP holdings. Some funds in this category have dealt with this constraint by making further MLP investments through subsidiaries.

In early August the Internal Revenue Service challenged such indirect holdings. This past week the sponsor of one closed-end fund in this category, Salient MLP & Energy Infrastructure Fund, said that if the IRS's proposal is adopted, it will comply by changing its holdings. Other funds in this category include Tortoise MLP & Pipeline Investor and Famco MLP & Energy Income.

The Salient fund charges annual fees of 2.25%, while the Tortoise and Famco funds cost 1.35% and 1.50%, respectively.

MLP Exchange-Traded Notes

These products, which include JPMorgan Alerian MLP Index and Credit Suisse MLP Index, aren't MLP funds at all. Instead, they are unsecured debt instruments designed to replicate the return of an MLP index.

As such, they are a simple way to get MLP exposure, because they issue 1099 forms and pose no problems in retirement accounts. The caveat: They aren't tax-efficient. The payouts are all ordinary income, taxed at federal rates of 43.4% for top-bracket investors, plus state taxes.

The J.P. Morgan and Credit Suisse notes charge annual fees of approximately 0.85%.

In addition, ETNs can be expensive to buy or sell and differ from other MLP investments because they expose holders to the credit risk of the issuer. Although this may seem a remote concern, it is a real one -- as holders of Lehman Brothers' structured notes discovered.

According to Craig McCann, an economist with SLCG in Fairfax, Va., a financial consulting firm, in the aftermath of Lehman's demise in 2008, $18.6 billion worth of such notes were worth pennies on the dollar.

The legacy of the financial crisis still shapes the longlist, writes Andrew Hill

"Thou Shalt Remember That People Forget" is the first commandment from economist Alan Blinder's After The Music Stopped , an analysis of the financial crisis and one of a few titles on this year's business book of the year longlist that tries to cement the memory of what went wrong.

Making It Happen , Iain Martin's soon-to-be published account of the rise and fall of Royal Bank of Scotland, Anita Raghav-an's The Billionaire's Apprentice , about the Galleon insider trading case and its impact on the Indian-American elite, and Neil Irwin's sweeping history of central banking, The Alchemists , also offer cautionary tales from the credit crunch.

Two of the longlisted books explicitly draw a line under the attitudes and approaches that dominated the pre-crisis business world. Moiss Nam declares The End of Power , analysing the consequence of leaders' decaying pot-ency across the business, economic and political spectrum. Rita Gunther McGrath, meanwhile, challenges Michael Porter's theory that companies can secure enduring dominance in The End of Competitive Advantage .

Among the trends testing corporate strategy are: the proliferation of so-called Big Data, analysed in the book of the same name by Viktor Mayer-Schnberger and Kenneth Cukier; the fierce competitive edge of growing east Asian economies, covered by Joe Studwell in How Asia Works ; and the rapid adaptability of internet-based companies such as Amazon, whose rise Brad Stone explores in The Everything Store .

Will the changes wrought by these trends mark a definitive end to cycles of damaging financial, economic and business turmoil? Almost certainly not. Blinder's conclusion, for instance, is that "high leverage, sloppy risk management, shady business practices and lax regulation" will be back.

But, five years on from the low-point of the crisis, the longlisted books also contain the seeds of change. Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer and author of Lean In , argues that a rising generation of female executives - and their enlightened male counterparts - are challenging establish-ed business norms.

In Scarcity , Sendhil Mullainathan and Eldar Shafir contend that improved understanding of how lack of time, cognitive "bandwidth" and money affect behaviour could temper financial excess and even relieve poverty. Angus Deaton's The Great Escape traces advances in wealth and health that offer hope of an exit from historic human inequality. Ray Fisman and Tim Sullivan, in The Org , even find grounds for optimism in the mundane functioning of offices and corporate bureaucracies, which facilitate collective achievement.

Finally, Adam Grant's Give and Take suggests why and how a generous attitude can repay the giver, in business and life.

Obama sees private lending at heart of homeownership

Barack Obama called for the protection of the 30-year mortgage, a fixture of the "American dream" of home ownership since the Great Depression, whose future is uncertain amid calls for the government to minimise its role in housing finance.

"We should preserve access to safe and simple mortgage products like the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage. That's something families should be able to rely on when they make the most important purchase of their lives," the US president said in a speech in Phoenix, Arizona, a city devastated by the mortgage crisis.

Mr Obama endorsed a bipartisan effort in the Senate to wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage giants bailed out in 2008, and called on private investors to take a bigger role in the market.

"I know that must sound confusing to the folks who call me a raging socialist every day," he said. "But I believe that while our housing system must have a limited government role, private lending should be the backbone of the housing market."

There is a rare political consensus among Democrats and Republicans in the Senate on the need for the US to allow the private sector to take the lead in accepting mortgage risk. But the question dividing lawmakers is the extent to which the government should serve as a backstop to provide catastrophic reinsurance on some mortgages in the event of a crisis.

The 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage has been a staple of home ownership for decades, but some economists are warning that a fully privatised system could sharply reduce its availability and raise its costs.

Because Fannie and Freddie shoulder the default risk on home loans, mortgage-backed securities are viewed as close to risk-free instruments, like Treasuries. Almost $5tn of these securities are held by investors in the US and abroad.

"If you went to a purely private market, I am not sure there would be anywhere near sufficient dem-and for the 30-year fixed rate," said Barbara Novick, a vice-chairman for BlackRock, the world's largest money manager, with almost $4tn in assets. She welcomed Mr Obama's intervention as a potential "inflection point" that could finally spur congressional action on reform.

In testimony before Congress last month, Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sAnalytics, said a privatised mortgage market would come to look like most other countries' markets, with adjustable rate deals the most prevalent kind of home financing.

Deal of the Week: Koreans Look to the U.S.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may unwittingly be playing a bit part in some of this year's bigger real-estate deals.

Take the recent sale of Washington Harbour, a mixed-use Washington complex on the banks of the Potomac River in the capital's elegant Georgetown neighborhood. The property was acquired last month for $373 million by a group of South Korean investors via a unit of Principal Financial Group.

The seller was a venture of Rockpoint Group, a private Boston real-estate-investment firm.

The deal came together in the spring as rising tensions between North and South Korea flared. In March, North Korea's saber rattling escalated as it declared invalid the Korean War Armistice. The U.S. and South Korea have had strained relations for decades with North Korea and some played down the moves by Kim Jong Un as a calculated attempt to prove himself as a new leader.

But the situation may have spooked investors in South Korea, who are moving billions of dollars into real estate outside of the region. Traditionally, turmoil in Asia, the Middle East and elsewhere prompts investors to buy properties and businesses in the U.S., Canada and Europe, which are typically perceived to be more stable and safe from major political unrest.

Real-estate-services firm Jones Lang LaSalle says that world-wide, South Koreans have spent $5.4 billion on real estate outside their home market in the first half of this year, already more than double the $2 billion spent the previous year. This is a record since JLL began keeping records in 2006.

So far this year, South Korea has become the biggest foreign investor in real estate world-wide, followed by Canada and Singapore respectively, according to JLL. Year to date, South Koreans are the fourth-biggest real-estate investors in the U.S., according to Real Capital Analytics, a New York real-estate-research firm.

"There's a mix of reasons, but with the whole blowup between North and South Korea . . . they started to put their money down," said Steve Collins, international director with JLL.

Real-estate professionals say South Koreans first began buying glitzy offshore properties several years ago after restrictions on South Korean pension funds investing abroad eased. But the buying has accelerated.

This spring saw a string of U.S. property purchases by South Koreans, accounting for 39% of South Korea's capital outflow into global real estate, according to JLL.

For example, Mirae Asset Global Investments Co., a South Korean financial-services firm, paid $218 million for an office tower in Chicago, and JLL said South Korean investors were part of a group that agreed to acquire a Houston office tower.

South Korean investors first gained notice when they bought a number of high-profile properties in Europe and Australia immediately after the financial crisis.

In 2009, the National Pension Service of South Korea, one of the world's largest pension funds, paid more than $1 billion for HSBC Holdings PLC's office tower in London and bought the Sony Center in Berlin in 2010.

The Washington Harbour deal reflects a South Korean taste for upscale properties with strong cash flows. The 1980s-era property has been compared to a sand castle because of its curvy design that overlooks the river. It has an outdoor skating rink. It was designed by Arthur Cotton Moore, who is known for his renovation of part of the Library of Congress.

Its 558,000-square-feet of office and retail space are 96% occupied through long-term leases to such tenants as law firm Foley & Lardner LLP and restaurants like Tony & Joe's Seafood Place. It is expected to yield a return of about 5.5%. HFF Inc. marketed the property for the seller.

Some analysts are watching to see if the South Koreans can sustain this pace.

Troy Stangarone, senior director at the Korea Economic Institute of America, a Washington think tank, expects South Korean investors to remain a force in the global property market.

He sees a push to invest abroad as part of a longer-term structural shift for South Koreans now ramping up as world economies stabilize following the financial crisis.

But others say rising interest rates and an easing of tensions at home could reduce the South Korean appetite for foreign real estate. "If tensions ease in northeast Asia, obviously the risk premium goes down," said Dan Fasulo, a managing director at Real Capital.

North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may unwittingly be playing a bit part in some of this year's bigger real-estate deals.

Take the recent sale of Washington Harbour, a mixed-use Washington complex on the banks of the Potomac River in the capital's elegant Georgetown neighborhood. The property was acquired last month for $373 million by a group of South Korean investors via a unit of Principal Financial Group.

State Farm Is There: As You Drive

By Leslie Scism

(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

As soon as Ed Scharlau of Austin, Texas, pulls out of his driveway in his Ford Expedition, a computer starts keeping score. It keeps track of how fast he accelerates, how abruptly he brakes and how far he drives.

The prize if he scores high enough: a substantial discount on his car insurance.

"This is a step in the right direction," the 74-year-old former manufacturing executive said. "How I drive should affect my insurance premium."

Mr. Scharlau is on the leading edge of a revolutionary shift in how insurers price car insurance, one that has tantalized the $167 billion industry for more than a decade.

But what many insurers see as a smart application of Big Data, some customers and privacy advocates view as a worrisome encroachment by Big Brother.

The idea is to use small telematic devices -- in Mr. Scharlau's case, one that plugs into his Expedition's diagnostic port -- to compile and analyze data on driver behavior.

The programs are voluntary, and better drivers qualify for discounts. In general, insurers say those who fall short aren't charged higher rates, but instead pay no more than what they already are paying, based on conventional pricing methods.

The insurers embracing telematics are gambling that the incentive of discounts and data-based feedback will produce better drivers, and thus fewer claims -- and higher profits. With efforts generally in early stages, it is too early to know if this is true. For customers, this "usage-based insurance" is pitched as a can't-lose -- at least for those who can stomach the privacy concerns.

Mr. Scharlau is an early customer of State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co.'s "Drive Safe & Save" program, which it plans to promote across most of the U.S. later this year.

Adoption of the technology by the country's biggest auto insurer "is going to push this to a whole other level," said Brian Sullivan, who runs Risk Information Inc., a publisher of insurance-industry newsletters.

The pioneer in telematics, Progressive Corp., began experimenting with the technology more than a decade ago and has tried to maintain its edge with patent-infringement lawsuits in federal court, including one against State Farm. Those are currently stayed as the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reviews the patents. "For now, they are presumed valid," said Dave Pratt, a Progressive general manager. State Farm declined to comment on the litigation.

Allstate Corp., which resolved legal disputes with Progressive in 2011 with agreements that included licensing patents to each other, expects its "Drivewise" program to be available in most states by the end of this year. Progressive, meanwhile, in recent months has discussed licensing use of its patents with about two dozen other insurers, it told investors in May.

The conventional methods for pricing car insurance involve pooling customers on the basis of characteristics such as age, gender and history of speeding tickets and crashes, all of which actuaries have correlated with loss potential. Insurers acknowledge those methods are imprecise. "We know that 16-year-old drivers have a whole lot of accidents . . . but not every 16-year-old is a lousy driver," said Scott Bruns, who heads a telematics unit in State Farm's property-casualty actuarial department. Basing rates in part on actual behavior is a "big advantage in being able to price appropriately."

More than 1.4 million drivers have signed up for Progressive's "Snapshot" program since 2008, and the insurer said discounts of up to 30% have topped $125 million. State Farm's discounts run as high as 50%.

Still, the programs have critics because of the voluminous data they collect on customers.

"It's a slippery slope," said Paul Stephens, an official with the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, speaking generally. While insurers say they don't track routes driven, Mr. Stephens fears that as programs expand and get more commonplace, insurers may wind up with "a very detailed log of your whereabouts throughout the day."

And the data, he said, might be obtained by law-enforcement authorities for criminal probes and parties in civil litigation.

Allstate, State Farm and Progressive said they share data as required by law and that they disclose this to customers. Allstate and Progressive said their devices don't have Global Positioning System functions. State Farm said it receives information "about the broad geographic areas" in which a vehicle is driven, measuring about 40 square miles, but not "the exact vehicle location."

Brent Allen, who is Mr. Scharlau's State Farm agent, said some clients have no interest in the program because of "the Big Brother thing," but others are eager for discounts.

Mike Hatch, a Minneapolis lawyer who is a former Minnesota attorney general, said more consumers should be wary. "People ought to be more cautious" about allowing such inroads into privacy, he said.

It remains to be seen whether it is possible to offer discounts to more customers, keep rates the same for everyone else and still maintain profit margins. At its May presentation, Progressive told analysts and investors that it is an open question if usage-based programs will remain "discount-only" models.

But insurers are convinced that their feedback will lead to fewer accidents.

One day recently, Mr. Scharlau logged onto his State Farm account to learn he so far had earned "A+" grades for left-hand turns and for not topping 80 miles per hour, but only "B+" for braking, acceleration and time of day his Expedition was on the road.

Mr. Scharlau said he and his wife now find themselves chatting "about our own driving and what we see around us: 'Oops, did we just lose points?'"

Nearly every investor will be affected in some way when the Federal Reserve starts to ease up on its bond purchases, a move Fed watchers expect sometime in the next year, depending on the economy's strength. The various effects, and opportunities, are likely to be so widespread, we decided to put the question -- what should investors do? -- to The Experts, an exclusive group of industry and thought leaders who engage in in-depth online discussions of topics raised in the Investing in Funds & ETFs report. The Experts this month also offer financial advice to newlyweds and tips on how to simplify your financial affairs. Here are edited excerpts of their comments. Read more at WSJ.com/WealthReport.

What would you advise investors worried about rising interest rates?

Time for Some to Take Their Medicine

It is difficult to come up with a blanket recommendation for how to proceed. It depends on your portfolio and your risk tolerance. If you are overexposed to yield plays, you should consider taking your medicine and reducing your risk profile. The big wild card is that rates have been going down for so long that we don't know where the excessive risks have been taken. Some strategies and some firms could face more intense pressure. And if rates keep rising, it's likely that the stock market will show greater weakness.

-- Tom Brakke, consultant, writer and investment adviser

Strike a Middle Ground

Fund investors should seek out intermediate-term bond funds. These are funds with durations of around five years. If rates rise a full percentage point, funds with this level of duration will lose about 5% of their value. Funds holding high-quality corporate bonds or high-quality international bonds can offer diversification benefits as well. Investors willing to own individual bonds should build a bond ladder. This means buying bonds maturing at different dates. When yields rise, proceeds from a maturing bond can be reinvested in a higher-yielding bond.

-- Charles Rotblut, vice president with the American Association of Individual Investors

Try a Fixed-Income Ladder

Rising rates can help fixed-income investors who have been strapped for yield for years. For fixed-income investing, I'm a fan of laddered CDs, individual bonds and possibly fixed annuities. With laddering, you won't be 100% right, but you won't be dead-wrong either, no matter what happens with rates. Equity investors, minimize debt, and watch the debt load of the companies in which you invest.

-- Sheryl Garrett, founder of Garrett Planning Network Inc.

Go for Shorter Duration

If you are sensitive to volatility, look at shortening the duration -- a measure of interest-rate sensitivity -- of your bond portfolio. While we're likely a couple of years away from the Fed hiking short-term interest rates, longer-term bonds will continue to be volatile as investors digest incoming economic data and size up what that means for the Fed's quantitative-easing program.

-- Greg McBride, senior financial analyst and vice president for Bankrate.com

Hurry Up and Refinance

If you haven't already done so, refinance your mortgage. Shift your bondholdings toward shorter average duration.

-- Terrance Odean, professor and chairman of finance group, Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley

Stay Short

Rising rates aren't all bad. If you stay with instruments (CDs and very short-term fixed income), when those papers mature, you can reinvest at higher levels. So while there is understandably some fear, you'll want to remember there are also some opportunities!

-- Manisha Thakor, founder and chief executive of Money Zen Wealth Management LLC

What financial suggestion would you give to newlyweds?

Communicate Early and Often

In the spirit of Benjamin Franklin's wise observation that "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure," newlyweds will increase the likelihood of marital harmony by communicating early and often about their consumption habits. As consumption increases, the ability to save and invest decreases.

-- Rafael Pardo, Robert T. Thompson Professor of Law at Emory University

Get on the Same Page

While you are still in that state of euphoria, write out a financial plan. Ideally, you should take care of this prior to the wedding or shortly thereafter. Evaluate your budget, spending patterns, savings needs, debt, income expectations (dual or single), insurance and much more. It is critical to have this type of full disclosure early on and make sure you are both on the same page with regard to your new financial future.

-- Michelle Perry Higgins, a financial planner and principal at California Financial Advisors

Build a 'Dream' Together

Spend a weekend building your "financial dream" list together. My partner and I took a couple of days to draft our financial dream plan together. How many kids did we want? How often and where would we vacation? How would we handle the fact that one of us had enough for a small down payment on our first house, and the other had no savings at all? We also decided to go the joint and separate account route: The joint account pays for most everything, including the house, cars, kids, the college fund and taxes. The joint account also contributes to our retirement accounts. Then we each get a small monthly allowance transferred into our separate accounts, which we use as we wish.

-- Olivia S. Mitchell, professor of business economics and public policy at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania

Make a Vow of Frugality

You know the thought you're having now? About all the things you could have done with the money you spent on that wedding? About how much they charged for those centerpieces? Remember that feeling when the time comes to buy a car. Skip the baby Audi, buy a six-year-old Corolla and take a great vacation, fund your retirement, save for a house instead.

-- Matt Hougan, president of ETF analytics and global head of editorial for IndexUniverse LLC

Talk Money With Your Honey

Time and again money is cited as one of the top causes of fights in relationships and causes of divorce. In my world I've observed that often this is because financial opposites (i.e., a saver and a spender) attract. There is a body of academic work that suggests this is because there is something intoxicating about "financial otherness" in the early stages of courtship. Alas, when that initial novelty wears off, fights can begin.

-- Manisha Thakor

Start Saving

Start saving 20% of your after-tax income now (including 401(k) savings, contributions to a defined-benefit pension, etc.).

-- Terrance Odean

---

What is one move that could help investors simplify their finances?

Set the Right Asset Allocation

Time and again, academic studies have shown that asset allocation trumps security selection in terms of what contributes the most to your long-run returns. Given this evidence, I believe the single most important move that an investor can make is to set -- and execute on -- the right asset allocation for their specific situation. A simple rule of thumb popularized by the legendary John Bogle is to put your age in bonds and the remainder in stocks.

-- Manisha Thakor

Keep It Simple

I often recommend to have one checking account set up for direct deposit and paying bills, one savings account to hold the emergency cash fund and short-term goal savings and one brokerage company to hold all investment accounts.

-- George Papadopoulos, fee-only wealth manager in Novi, Mich.

Rein in Stray Accounts

If you have stray accounts here and there -- old brokerage accounts, 401(k) plans from previous jobs, etc. -- you should investigate whether there are valid reasons to keep them open. That includes looking at the investments within the context of your overall holdings, but also considering the fees that are being charged on those accounts and the extra time you have to spend keeping track of them.

-- Tom Brakke

Make Two Crucial Moves

Consolidate any and all investment accounts, excluding retirement plans with your current employer, with one discount brokerage firm. Automate all your monthly savings and investments and the payment of your regular expenses.

-- Sheryl Garrett

Write a Succession Plan

Write instructions on how you would want your financial affairs managed if you were suddenly unable to do so yourself. It forces you to think about how you are managing your finances. And it allows someone you trust to step in on your behalf. By empowering them with clear instructions, you give yourself peace of mind that your affairs will be properly managed.

-- Charles Rotblut

Stop Buying Individual Stocks

Going forward, don't buy individual stocks. Buy (and hold) a few well-diversified, low-cost mutual funds (e.g., an all-U.S. equity index fund, an international equity index fund, a broad-based bond fund). Look for low fees, don't chase past performance. If the tax implications of selling your stocks are potentially large, consider getting professional advice before taking action.

-- Terrance Odean

It's Easy as Cake

Creating a portfolio is like baking a cake. Start with the three essential ingredients: A total bond market index fund, total U.S. stock market index fund and total international stock index fund. How these three funds are blended together will determine the portfolio's level of risk.

-- Rick Ferri, founder of Portfolio Solutions LLC, author and blogger

Investing in Funds & ETFs: A Monthly Analysis --- Exchange-Traded Funds: Available: Another Data Point on ETFs* --- * But this information just might be more confusing than illuminating

By Ari I. Weinberg

Investors in exchange-traded funds know they can use a fund's ticker symbol to check the price before buying or selling.

But each ETF also has a similar ticker symbol that is less well known and sometimes hard to find. It's one that investors can use to learn the approximate per-share value of a fund's holdings, as calculated at 15-second intervals throughout the trading day.

This second ticker may provide helpful information about the reasonableness of an ETF's market price -- if that price differs greatly from the value of the fund's holdings, it may be wise to hold off on a trade. Or the second ticker may just be confusing. It all depends on market conditions and the type of securities a fund holds, which can render the extra information "not so useful," says Samuel Lee, an ETF analyst for Morningstar Inc. in Chicago.

To understand the second trading symbol, it's easiest to start by thinking of traditional mutual funds. These funds don't have a second ticker symbol. It's unnecessary for them because their shares change hands only once a day, based on the funds' end-of-day net asset value, or NAV -- the per-share value of the underlying holdings.

In contrast, ETF shares are traded all day long, at prices that are set by the market and can vary from the value of the underlying holdings. Investors can get an idea of that variance by checking the second ticker, which is known most commonly as the INAV, for indicative net asset value. It is also sometimes called the IIV, for intraday indicative value, or IOPV, for indicative optimized portfolio value.

(ETFs also have an official daily NAV, which mostly affects institutional investors who can create or redeem ETF shares at that value.)

Generally, the INAV ticker is the ETF ticker with ".IV" added at the end. While the INAV ticker is provided to investors by every ETF sponsor, INAV figures can only be found on a few websites, including Yahoo Inc.'s finance.yahoo.com and the reuters.com site of the Reuters Group unit of Thomson Reuters.

But INAV is imperfect. For instance, in fast-moving fixed-income markets, seen most recently in late May and early June, ETFs can trade throughout the day at higher ranges above or below INAV than is customary. But those unusually wide gaps can be somewhat deceiving, because they aren't based entirely on trading activity.

They happen because some of the prices going into INAV are just price approximations for bonds that haven't actually traded.

For these bonds, the prices for INAV generally are calculated based on assumptions about how much the yields of the bonds typically exceed those of U.S. Treasury securities, says Phil Bak, managing director for exchange-traded products at NYSE Euronext.

"In a fast-moving market, it's possible for the trading of the fund to lead the INAV," says Mr. Bak -- that is, for the fund's price to be the most timely indication of the market value of the bonds it holds.

It isn't just in fixed-income ETFs that INAV is imprecise. For funds holding international equities whose daily trading closes before or during U.S. market hours, the prices that go into INAV may be stale.

"The lag can be almost one full day," says Dave Nadig, head of ETF analytics for research firm IndexUniverse LLC.

For instance, for ETFs holding Asian or Australian stocks, INAV is based on closing prices from markets where trading ends during the overnight hours for most U.S. investors. In calculating INAV, those prices may be adjusted for currency shifts, but generally aren't adjusted for news that broke after those markets closed that could significantly affect the value of the stocks.

International markets also observe different holidays, meaning that a stock might not trade for several days even while an ETF that holds it is trading in the U.S. -- leaving even more time for events that could result in a significantly different price when the stock starts trading again.

So should ETF investors even care about INAV?

The utility of INAV was hotly debated recently by the editors at IndexUniverse, which closely watches the ins and outs of the ETF market -- resulting in no consensus. But some investment pros find INAV useful.

Chris Greene, a financial adviser and owner of the ETF Replay portfolio-tracking service, says he looks at INAV when it is time to make a trade, as a sanity check on activity in the market.

"A small premium [or discount] for a long-term investor is hardly going to matter relative to overall portfolio movement," he says.

But the bigger gaps between INAVs and market prices that happen in fast-moving markets serve as a warning. In these markets, "the [ETF] price on the screen isn't the price you're going to get anyway," Mr. Greene says. "Avoid trading these markets."

Business
SEC Examines IBM's Cloud-Computing Sales; Company's Filing Offers No Details; Challenges in a Major Growth Area

Regulators are probing the way International Business Machines Corp. reports sales in its cloud-computing business, the company said in a securities filing Wednesday.

IBM said it learned in May that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was "conducting an investigation" into the way the company reports cloud revenue, according to a filing detailing its second-quarter results. IBM said it is cooperating with the agency.

The filing offered no details of what practices in particular the SEC might be questioning. IBM's defended its standards, saying its reporting is the result of a rigorous and disciplined process.

"We are confident that the information we have provided has been consistently accurate," the company added.

An SEC spokeswoman said the agency doesn't discuss whether companies are under investigation.

News of the probe comes as a growing number of information-technology and telecommunications companies build new offerings in cloud computing, which lets clients cut costs by renting space on machines they don't own and then accessing them over the Internet.

The trend is a challenge to IBM's big technology-services business, which has made billions of dollars installing, maintaining and upgrading computer systems for clients.

IBM itself is banking on cloud computing as a major growth area. In 2011, the company projected that cloud services would generate $7 billion in revenue by 2015, of which $3 billion would be new revenue. It didn't break out its cloud revenue when it reported earnings this month, but said it was up 70% in the first half.

In an effort to beef up its capabilities in cloud computing and take on market leader Amazon.com Inc. more directly, IBM paid $2 billion in July to acquire SoftLayer Technologies Inc., a privately held company that rents out computer power that clients access over the Internet.

Accounting standards for cloud-computing revenue are "pretty established" by now, according to Ray Wang, principal analyst at Constellation Research. The issue can get more complicated at a large company like IBM, however, where sales of cloud-computing services might be combined with other non-cloud products, such as hardware and routine service fees.

"It gets tricky, because you're not just buying the software," he said. "You might be bundling different products together and you might have discounts for a deal of a certain size. It's very important how you break it out."

IBM spokesman James Sciales said the company reports all its cloud revenue in line with generally accepted accounting principles, the most common standard used by companies in the U.S. "IBM accounts for 'cloud' transactions exactly the same way as it would account for those transactions if they were not cloud in accordance with GAAP," he said in an email.

The company's shares closed down 97 cents at $195.04 in Wednesday trading.

IBM has said it offers more than 100 types of software delivered over the Internet that help companies to manage business functions such as marketing, procurement and online stores, among other things. It also recently began offering its "Jeopardy"-playing artificial-intelligence technology Watson as a cloud-based service.

South Korea 's economy recorded its strongest quarterly growth for more than two years in the three months to June, as consumer spending rebounded and the new government boosted state expenditure .

The economy expanded a seasonally adjusted 1.1 per cent in the second quarter from the first three months of the year, the Bank of Korea said yesterday. That marked its strongest performance since the first quarter of 2011. Compared with the same period a year earlier, gross domestic product grew 2.3 per cent.

"This is a great result, and one that has also come from left field," said Matthew Circosta, an economist at Moody'sAnalytics. "Indicators up to May had suggested slower not faster growth in Korea."

Weak consumer spending, stuttering industrial production and concerns about the outlook for exports had prompted the government to cut its annual growth forecast from 3 per cent to 2.3 per cent in March.

In May, it announced a supplementary budget of Won17.3tn ($15.5bn) to compensate for shortfalls in tax revenue. It also included measures to create jobs and boost the property market.

Raymond Yeung, an economist at ANZ, said tax exemptions introduced in April sparked a sharp rise in property transactions.

The BoK has cut rates by 25 basis points on three separate occasions since July last year, with the most recent cut coming in May .

But Ronald Man, HSBC economist, said the second-quarter figure was flattered by comparison with a weak first-quarter performance.

PhillipCapital Cuts India Growth Outlook; Joins Moody's Analytics , Nomura, Deutsche Bank in Lowering Forecast

NEW DELHI There's more bad news for the Indian economy.

On Wednesday, PhillipCapital, a brokerage, slashed its growth estimate on the South Asian economy to 4.0%-4.5% in the current fiscal year from a previous estimate of 5.5%.

It flagged weak investment sentiment and political uncertainty ahead of numerous state polls and the general election which must be held by May for the worsening prospects.

The cut in outlook by PhillipCapital is the severest of brokerage downgrades of India over the past week.

On Friday, Nomura and Deutsche Bank AG"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324448104578617250768097968.html"for the current fiscal year ending March 31 to 5.0%.

India's pace of economic expansion slowed to a decade-low of 5.0% in the last fiscal year as investments choked amid fading demand and diminishing business confidence due to a slow pace of policy reforms.

Several key legislative proposals, such as to ease foreign-investment restrictions in insurance and pension-fund management and reform the country's complex land-acquisition process, have been awaiting parliamentary approval.

Prospects have particularly taken a beating since the Reserve Bank of India this month put "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323829104578623702725078278.html". Analysts say this would lead to higher interest rates in the economy and hurt growth.

Moody'sAnalytics also cut India's growth forecast Wednesday.

It predicted 5.5% growth in 2013 and 6.0% in 2014, but didn't say what its previous estimates were.

"Nothing in recent history or on the horizon appears likely to lift the current tepid pace of business investment," Sydney-based economist Glenn Levine wrote on India in a research note.

Short Sellers Keep the Pressure on China Banks

HONG KONG -- Short sellers are sticking to heavy bets against China's banks a month after a cash crunch gripped the country's banking system, reflecting their belief that there is more stress to come even as banking shares rebound.

The wagers by hedge funds and others started building in Hong Kong in June as a sudden shortage of cash among mainland lenders spooked investors. Banks scrambled to raise money to meet a range of funding demands, dumping short-term bonds, pushing interbank rates up to as high as 30% and sending the Shanghai benchmark stock index to a four-year low.

The distress is still readily apparent in valuations across the sector. Just three of China's nine major banks currently are trading above book value -- what the assets on their balance sheet are worth -- according to FactSet Research.

Bearish bets against China's biggest state-run banks have cooled after the central bank injected funds and sought to soothe fears over the nation's financial system. But short positions -- bets that a company's share price will fall -- against midsize banks remain at high levels. The belief is that they have far less cash at their disposal and could face further trouble after aggressive lending earlier in the year to boost profits in the face of slowing economic growth.

China Minsheng Banking Corp., which isn't state-owned, suffered the most during last month's turmoil, falling 20%. While the stock has rebounded around 3% this month, bets on further declines remain at high levels. Analysts say the bank is most at risk because of heavy exposure to risky wealth management products. The company declined to comment.

Data from SunGard's Astec Analytics shows that borrowing of shares in Hong Kong-listed China Minsheng currently stands at a record 930 million shares, more than triple the roughly 300 million shares that had been borrowed as of early June. The borrowing of shares often is used as a proxy measure of short selling, in which a short seller borrows shares owned by someone else and then sells them, hoping to buy them back when the price falls.

One other indicator shows heavy bearish bets. The percentage of China Minsheng's shares available for lending that have been borrowed hit 100% last week and has held near there since, "suggesting this increased demand to borrow for short selling has soaked up almost all the available Minsheng shares for loan," said Karl Loomes, a market analyst with Astec.

Concerns are running high about the worsening quality of assets on banks' balance sheets. Andrew Maynard, global head of trading and execution at Hong Kong-based brokerage CLSA, said that while some investors have closed their short positions on Chinese banks, "most remain with that position on." Shorting has been accompanied by selling from long-only investors, he said.

Other banks are also in the crosshairs of market bears. Borrowing of shares of Bank of Communications Co. Ltd. -- China's fifth largest lender by assets -- also remains unusual at 52 million shares after doubling over a three-week span in June, according to Astec data. Shares dropped to near a two-year low earlier this month. The company didn't respond to a request for comment.

Bearish bets haven't been exclusive to mainland banks. The borrowing of shares in Bank of East Asia Ltd. -- one of Hong Kong's largest local banks and one that has made a strong push for mainland business in recent years -- also rose significantly last month and has yet to decline, according to Astec. A bank spokeswoman didn't respond to a request for comment.

Bearish bets against China's largest banks, though, have cooled. Short sales declined when China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, stepped in to provide liquidity to the banking system. It was widely believed that the central bank allowed the squeeze to occur to teach the financial sector a painful lesson about the risks of too much lending. "In terms of how the short-sellers like to trade -- when there is a lack of clarity -- I think that time has probably passed," said Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG Markets in Melbourne. "Right now, the damage has been done in the credit market and we know the PBOC is happy to add to liquidity."

Investors quickly cut their short exposure to China's major lenders largely because their huge deposit bases provide ample liquidity and it is widely believed that the government would come to the aid of these banks before they faced serious trouble.

With the midsize banks, though, investors are worried about their smaller deposit base and dependence on interbank lending, though they are also confident the government will come to their aid.

Leadership In Corporate Finance (A Special Report) --- CFOs Ignore Big Data  at Their Peril

By Maxwell Murphy

Big data seems tailor-made for finance chiefs. So why aren't more of them using it?

Many chief financial officers say big-data technologies -- which use high-performance computing to organize and analyze impossibly large volumes of information -- would make their jobs more complicated and might not be worth the extra cost. They say their existing tools, mainly sophisticated financial dashboards that can crunch an organization's numbers in real time, are adequate for their financial-planning needs.

But experts say the CFOs who haven't embraced big data are missing out on opportunities to speed up and improve some of their more difficult and time-consuming tasks. With the power of massive data sets and advanced analytics, they say, financial executives could better anticipate customer and supplier demand, predict sales and profits under hundreds of different scenarios, detect fraud and drastically cut the time it takes to close the books at the end of each quarter.

Chevron Corp., for instance, is tapping big-data technologies to transform the audit function. The oil giant can run audit tests on all of its accounts-payable transactions instead of the small sample it used to analyze before. This enables the finance department to better understand various business risks and adjust audit coverage to the areas that pose the greatest risks. At the same time, it reduces the time spent on auditing by about 15%.

"This offers a combination of much better quality for notably higher efficiency and lower costs," says Chevron CFO Patricia Yarrington.

Big data can also help companies identify the risks in entering new markets. When International Business Machines Corp. considers expanding operations beyond the more than 170 markets it already serves, it can combine internal data -- payment trends, expense-to-revenue ratios and currency exposure -- with external metrics such as growth in gross domestic product, currency risks and inflation. The system then produces a scorecard of potential risks. The result "allows IBM to take early action to protect its financial position," says Carlos Passi, IBM's assistant corporate controller.

Most companies have dedicated substantial time, money and resources to compiling their own internal data over the years, and now each has a "whole spaghetti mess" of technologies and systems that combine to produce the data dashboards that many CFOs are comfortable with and find sufficient, says Brian Hopkins, an analyst with Forrester Research Inc. This likely means companies will adopt big data slowly, as their old systems become obsolete and as rivals who deploy big data begin to outperform, he says.

Moreover, many big companies have cut the costs of their finance functions to an average of 1% of revenue or less, says Andy Rusnak, a partner with Ernst & Young LLP. With finance budgets so lean, CFOs may be reluctant to try to justify large big-data investments to their chief executives and boards without more demonstrable evidence that it can do to finance what it can to operations and marketing, he says.

Regulator Is Turning Up The Juice

By Rebecca Smith and Tennille Tracy

A federal regulator established in 1920 to oversee hydropower projects is sending shock waves through Wall Street.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission moved this week to fine Barclays PLC a record $435 million over its trading activities in California's electricity market. The regulator is negotiating with J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. on a settlement in a similar case that could be even bigger. Barclays this week said it will contest the fine. J.P. Morgan has declined to comment.

Some people familiar with its enforcement operations think the commission is just getting started as it scrutinizes the once obscure world of electricity trading.

The commission's objective is to stop bad behavior "before it becomes chronic and pervasive," said Nancy Saracino, general counsel of the California Independent System Operator, one of five regional organizations that run daily electricity auctions and report to FERC.

Led by a 64-year-old Nevada lawyer who cut his teeth as a consumer advocate and backed by a beefed-up enforcement staff, FERC now has fines of $1 million a day per violation in its arsenal, up from $10,000 per infraction a decade ago.

The regulator's newly aggressive stance has support from some public officials in the Western U.S. who think it didn't do enough to nip illicit trading by Enron Corp. and others that helped cause the energy crisis in California a dozen years ago.

But a federal court in March imposed a curb on FERC's enforcement agenda when it said the agency overstepped its bounds when attempting to fine a former natural-gas trader $30 million for alleged market manipulation. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said FERC invaded the regulatory turf held by another federal agency, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

With Barclays vowing to fight FERC on this most recent set of charges, the courts are likely to have another opportunity to further define the extent of the agency's powers.

"There's no guarantee that these cases FERC put together hold up in court," Christi Tezak, a managing director at ClearView Energy Partners, said.

The commission has raised its profile over the past three decades, as natural-gas and electricity markets have been deregulated, bringing about the greatest change since the 1935 Federal Power Act was passed.

Until the mid-1990s, electricity pricing was mostly in the hands of state utility commissions who reacted to proposals from companies that generated and delivered electricity to homes and businesses. It is still that way in about half the U.S.

But some of the most populous states, including California, Texas and New York, have since authorized utility participation in centralized markets on which large amounts of electricity are bought and sold each day, with prices set by market forces.

In general, generators able to furnish the cheapest power are tapped each day. But the big increase in the trading of electricity created new profit-making opportunities for companies like the big banks.

FERC began to get more aggressive during the California energy crisis of 2000-01, when wholesale power costs soared. The regulator imposed price caps in the summer of 2001 but only after the state's biggest utility had gone bankrupt. Critics said it moved too slowly.

Ultimately, the state of California was forced to intervene and buy power for utility customers, incurring costs that consumers still are paying off.

Over the past decade, FERC and federal investigators put together cases accusing power traders and generation owners of manipulating the California wholesale electricity market, reaping large judgments and settlements.

Congress moved to beef up the policing powers of FERC under a 2005 law, the Energy Policy Act.

The goal was to empower FERC to perform like the Securities and Exchange Commission and CFTC, which police Wall Street and the commodities markets.

The commission expanded its enforcement office to about 200 lawyers, investigators and economists, up from 20 or so at the time of the energy crisis.

Former federal prosecutor Norman Bay, who joined the regulatory agency as head of enforcement in 2009, has added lawyers with extensive experience representing big banks and trading companies, as well as former federal investigators.

Mr. Bay declined to comment.

FERC Chairman Jon Wellinghoff, who has served since 2006, added a new unit of what he called "geeks and quants" to its enforcement office that focus exclusively on market analytics.

"These folks are the number crunchers that sift through the data," looking for patterns of behavior that suggest attempts to game the market, said Susan Court, who worked at FERC for three decades and was the first head of the enforcement office.

The commission has imposed $291 million in civil penalties since 2007 in 78 enforcement actions apart from this week's fine of Barclays. It has clawed back $164 million in profits.

Marc Spitzer, a former FERC commissioner now at law firm Steptoe & Johnson LLP in Washington, said there will always be flaw in market rules, "but FERC wants to create a deterrent so people who see a flaws, like smart traders, will perhaps be more reluctant to exploit it."

Patrick Wood III, a former chairman of the commission, said its mission in recent years has been to "find out what the hell was going on in the markets," when the energy crisis exposed deficiencies. Mr. Wood said the agency recently has been looking for complex trading schemes that involve physical markets and futures markets overseen by the CFTC.

SAP lowers forecasts on Asia weakness

SAP lowered its sales forecasts for this year after several big Asian markets disappointed Europe's largest software company by revenues in the second quarter.

The German group said full-year revenues from software and software-related services would grow at least 10 per cent at constant currencies, compared with previously offered guidance of 11-13 per cent.

Co-chief executive Jim Hagemann Snabe said: "In the short-run, the reduced growth rates in China are impacting not just China but all the countries around it."

SAP's operating profits grew 7 per cent in the second quarter to  988m on an IFRS basis, while total revenues grew 4 per cent to  4.1bn.

In the Asia-Pacific region, revenues from software and cloud subscription services fell 7 per cent, despite growth in southeast Asia and India.

Daud Khan, an analyst at Berenberg Bank, said: "The biggest piece of weakness is actually in Japan. It's similar to what the commentary has been from Oracle and Accenture.

"The question is whether the slowdown is shortlived."

The company removed its guidance for software and cloud subscription revenues.

Sales of SAP's flagship big data software, Hana, grew 21 per cent year-on-year in the three months to June to record revenues of  102m. The company expects the product will finish the year with sales of  650m- 700m.

"The last shoe to drop would be if they couldn't achieve their Hana numbers," added Mr Khan, adding that investors were waiting for SAP to announce high-profile, "big reference customers" for the service.

SAP, which has its headquarters in Walldorf, has spent several billion dollars on acquisitions to strengthen its presence in cloud-based services.

SAP's shares were down 0.5 per cent at  57.38 in early afternoon trading in Frankfurt.

Asians Turn To Smaller Properties In the West

After years of splurging on pricey condos and mansions in the West, Asia's rich now are buying small office buildings, retail shops and branded hotels in Europe and North America, searching for stable returns and diversifying away from home markets they view as increasingly risky and volatile.

In the first six months of this year, Asian private investors poured $1.9 billion into U.S. commercial properties, according to data from Real Capital Analytics. That total already dwarfs the $551.4 million worth of U.S. commercial real estate purchased by Asian private investors in 2012.

Trophy assets still draw attention, including such deals as Chinese developer Zhang Xin's acquisition of a minority stake in the General Motors Building in New York in June. But real-estate insiders around the world say they are seeing a surge of interest by less-wealthy Asians for deals worth less than $30 million, which are typically the domain of local, private investors.

Real Capital added that its figures are likely underreporting the trend, because the firm doesn't track transactions of less than $2.5 million. Moreover, the firm can't account for investments foreign investors made through a local partner and through third-party entities such as an unlisted real-estate-investment trust. As well, the firm admitted it doesn't capture all the flows into the U.S. via the popular EB-5 investor-immigration program, which grants five-year visas to those who invest as little as $500,000 in a business -- most often, real-estate projects -- that create jobs for U.S. workers.

"It's very difficult to track all the capital flow," said Dan Fasulo, managing director at Real Capital Analytics. "We know we're undercounting the amount of capital that's coming into the U.S. by the billions."

"The biggest change is the emergence of new private investors," said Alastair Meadows, the Singapore-based head of the international capital group at Jones Lang LaSalle. "There's great depth and interest in deal sizes between $30 [million] and $80 million. That range falls above domestic private investors but below institutional investors. It's the sweet spot."

Many wealthy Asians who made their fortunes in real estate in their home countries, are flush with cash and looking to diversify out of their native lands. They are attracted to the long, stable rents of more-mature Western markets, which often offer better returns than the ultrahot real-estate markets of Hong Kong and Singapore, the main destinations for offshore Asian investment. An average lease term for an office in Asia is just three years, compared with 15 or 20 years in a market like London or New York. Moreover, rental yields for prime office buildings (calculated by taking the annual rental income divided by the price of the property) are in the 5%-to-6% range in those cities, higher than the 3%-to-4% range in Hong Kong and Singapore.

"They're taking profits in Asia and making them work in Western markets where the yields are better and the markets are more stable," said Marc Giuffrida, executive director of international capital-markets at brokerage firm CBRE.

London is an especially popular destination for Asian money, and the city has also seen a new type of investor: smaller in net worth, though still eager to buy. Two years ago, the <pound>288 million ($435 million) sale of the Aviva tower to Southeast Asian palm-oil tycoons Kuok Khoon Hong and Martua Sitorus was the typical transaction. Recently, deals to Asian investors have included the sale of an office building on Clerkenwell Road in central London for <pound>7 million to a private Chinese investor.

"This used to be the domain of just the top, richest Asian families. But now, there's a lot of midtier families" buying lower-priced properties, Mr. Giuffrida said.

Brokers working on smaller deals in lesser-known markets also are seeing a flood of Asian cash. Elliot Medoff, a broker at Cushman Wakefield in Toronto, said he has increasingly fielded calls over the past two years from Chinese clients looking for retail properties on busy Toronto streets in the one million to five million Canadian dollar (US$959,000 to $4.8 million) range.

The majority of the deals are in "core properties," real-estate parlance for prime buildings in central locations, brokers say. But real-estate insiders say investors are increasingly adventurous.

For example, Gao Yunfeng, a Chinese businessman who built a fortune in laser technology, bought two hotels in Switzerland, including the lake-side Frutt Lodge in the mountain village Malchese-Frutt, about 56 miles south of Zurich for $55 million, according to data from Real Capital Analytics.

In Toledo, Ohio, Chinese investors spent $5.1 million on a 92-acre parcel of waterfront real estate in 2011 with plans to redevelop it.

More than a decade after acquiring it, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. sold a majority of its REDI trading technology group as hedge funds and other money managers increasingly demand trading systems that are open to as many brokers as possible.

Goldman will retain a minority stake in REDI. Other investors, all with at least 10% stakes, include Bank of America Corp., Barclays, BNP Paribas, Citadel LLC, and Lightyear Capital.

The sale has been in the works for more than a year. In early 2012, Goldman began approaching other banks and trading firms about taking outside stakes. REDI, an acronym for Rapid Execution Dot Interface, designs the software and desktop systems that allow Goldman's hedge fund and other clients to trade a variety of securities across multiple markets.

Currently, 5,000 hedge funds, money managers and broker-dealers use the system. Goldman acquired it in 2000 through its $7 billion acquisition of Spear Leeds & Kellogg L.P.

Lightyear Capital, the only private-equity firm in the investor group, specializing in taking stakes in financial firms. It was founded in 2000 by Donald B. Marron, the former chairman and chief executive officer of Paine Webber Group Inc. and later chairman of UBS America.

Technology like REDI was once seen as a huge competitive advantage as big Wall Street banks courted hedge funds and big institutions as trading customers. Rivals flooded the space. Citigroup Inc. bought Lava Trading in 2004 and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. bought Neovest the same year. Lehman Brothers bought Townsend Analytics, maker of RealTick, in 2005.

One of the issues with a single-broker system, however, is the concern that the broker is gleaning an advantage from the data passing through its pipelines. Traders want "to make sure their relationship with their brokers isn't biased by the technology choice," said Thomas Chippas, Barclays' head of prime services execution.

Hedge funds and investment managers are reducing the number of software systems they use and are demanding that firms make systems open to as many brokers as possible, said Rishi Nangalia, previously the co-manager of Goldman Sachs Electronic Trading business development group, who is now REDI's chief executive officer.

Systems like REDI also need constant upkeep and investment, and Wall Street firms have been cutting costs. "The buy-side and the sell-side would rather buy than build the technology and focus on their core businesses," Mr. Nangalia said in an interview.

Citi sold Lava to TradingScreen in 2009 and another trading system, ColorPalette, to FlexTrade Systems Inc., in 2010. Barclays sold RealTick to ConvergEx Group in 2010.

REDI, previously part of Goldman's vast securities division before the deal, is now an independent technology company based in New York with regional offices in Boston, San Francisco, Chicago, London, and Hong Kong.

Another location will open near Dallas in the coming months.

Representatives from each of the new investors will join REDI's board. The sale doesn't include other parts of Goldman Sachs Electronic Trading, including other trading systems and algorithms the firm offers.

Terms of the transaction weren't disclosed.

Corporate News: Insurers Seek Right Balance Of Risk, Reward

In the insurance business, some customers are more desirable than others -- and insurers will be seeking to woo them in preparation for the health law's new marketplaces.

Customers not only bring revenue in the form of the premiums they pay. They also come with costs, since the insurer will be on the hook for medical expenses. Traditionally, that has made healthier people the best insurance risk. Insurers often could decline to sell plans to people with health problems, or charge them more.

Now, the health law is changing the rules of the game. Under its requirements, insurers must sell plans to all comers, and the rates can't be tied to customers' health. Less obviously, the law includes mechanisms that are designed to ensure that individual companies aren't punished if they draw a mix of sicker consumers.

Young and healthy people will still be needed to help balance out the costs of sicker customers. But, in addition, some people who weren't sought after in the past may become profitable because of the law's payment structure. Among them: people who have chronic conditions such as diabetes, but who can keep their diseases managed and avoid big costs such as hospital visits, said Shubham Singhal, a director at consulting firm McKinsey & Co. That is because insurers can be paid more to cover consumers based on their diagnoses.

Since insurers can no longer pick and choose their customers, they will employ a range of subtler tools, including marketing campaigns and carefully designed plans aimed at the customers the insurers most want.

"They want to attract the right risk," said Siva Namasivayam, chief executive of SCIO Health Analytics Inc. His firm helps insurers identify customer types, such as "entry-level singles" and "healthy baby boomers," each with projections on likely costs. The firm pinpoints, by ZIP Code, where the different types tend to live, so the insurer can target its marketing geographically.

Highmark Inc., a Pittsburgh, insurer, said it has around 100 targeted campaigns aimed at particular types of consumers, including recent college graduates and retirees not yet eligible for Medicare. It sends walk-in tractor-trailers to college campuses and sets up booths at community events such as charity walks. "We have to be more one-to-one than we were historically," said Steven Nelson, a senior vice president at Highmark.

Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island also plans to aim at certain populations, including young men. Last year, the insurer promoted one of its low-cost plans with a campaign that included posters on the walls of men's bathrooms in bars. "You don't need beer goggles to fall in love with this health plan," one slogan said.

Fund focus

Franklin Templeton believes fears over the US scaling back QE are overdone, reports Nick Reeve

Franklin Templeton's Michael Hasenstab believes the fear that US tapering of its quantitative easing programme will disproportionately hit emerging markets is overdone.

Mr Hasenstab, who runs the group's huge $49.2bn Templeton Global Bond fund, says the Federal Reserve's intentions to scale down and ultimately stop QE would be driven by better economic fundamentals, which would be beneficial for the rest of the world.

"I think this fear of liquidity being pulled out of emerging markets due to the Fed ending its bond purchasing programme is overstated as we do not believe there would be a massive contraction of liquidity out of emerging markets," he says.

"Our view is that this is likely to be more of an entry point for investors as opposed to an exit."

Mr Hasenstab adds that because interest rates are likely to stay low for an extended period even if quantitative easing were scaled back, it would mean overall monetary policy in the US would still be loose.

He notes other countries are still "flooding the market with liquidity". Japan has begun a programme of QE that will pump roughly $1tn into financial markets - a similar amount to that put in by the Fed.

Mr Hasenstab says: "As the US begins to taper, Japan is beginning to ramp up. In our view, it doesn't really matter whether the Fed prints or Japan prints or Europe prints. If it's printed, it's going to flow out."

The manager argues that emerging economies no longer rely on inflows of foreign capital to the same extent as a decade ago, due to larger reserves and balanced government accounts.

The fund's single biggest geographic weighting is to South Korea , in which Mr Hasenstab has invested 15.1 per cent of the portfolio, according to its latest fact sheet.

The manager continues to hold significant weightings in Irish and Hungarian government bonds, and has been widely reported to control a significant proportion of the total market in these bonds across his fixed income portfolios. His 8 per cent position in Irish government bonds in the Templeton Global Bond fund is roughly equal to $3.9bn.

Elsewhere, Mr Hasenstab says the recent losses experienced across fixed income funds were due to "short-term volatility rather than the potentially permanent losses that can come from a rise in interest rates".

"We would urge investors to consider a longer investment horizon and be prepared for periods of short-term volatility," he adds.

He urges investors not to panic too much about recent events in China, where the government has taken action to contain "undisciplined" lending in the shadow banking sector.

"When a sector gets too hot, it is necessary to pull it back, and the People's Bank of China has taken a tough line of action to discourage shadow banking activities and control the credit supply," he says.

"For example, in the case of China's real estate sector, when prices in some of the big cities began to get out of control, fairly blunt instruments were used to correct [them] fairly dramatically and fairly quickly

"But I think this is the right decision. It's better to resolve the problem before it gets too out of hand."

The Templeton Global Bond fund ranked in the second quartile of the IMA Global Bond sector in the five years to July 2, with a return of 60.2 per cent, according to FE Analytics. The fund's benchmark, the JPMorgan Global Government Bond index, gained 64.8 per cent in this period.

What is the most important financial advice for newlyweds? The Wall Street Journal put this question to The Experts, an exclusive group of industry, academic and other thought leaders who engage in in-depth online discussions of topics from the print Report. This question relates to a "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324577904578555900694987858.html" that discussed financial tips for couples tying the knot and formed the basis of a discussion in The Experts stream on July 10.

The Experts will discuss topics raised in this month's Investing in Funds & ETFs Report and other Wall Street Journal Reports. Find the finance Experts stream, watch recent interactive videos and explore a host of other exciting online content at "http://online.wsj.com/public/page/journal-report-wealth.html?mg=inert-wsj"

Christian Magoon: Understand Each Other Before A Major Decision Is Needed

Finances are often one of the most divisive areas in a couple's relationship. This is because attitudes and preferences about money are deeply personal and therefore strongly held. Newlyweds should focus on trying to understand each other's financial beliefs and experiences before the pressure of a major financial decision occurs.

Christian Magoon ("https://twitter.com/ChristianMagoon") is founder and chief executive of YieldShares, an income-focused ETF sponsor.

Manisha Thakor: Learn to Talk Money With Your Honey

My financial advice to newlyweds is &learn to "talk money with your honey." Time and again money is cited as one of the top causes of fights in relationships and causes of divorce. In my world I've observed that often time this is because financial opposites (i.e. a saver and a spender) attract. There is a body of academic work that suggests this is because there is something intoxicating about "financial otherness" in the early stages of courtship. Alas, when that initial novelty wears off, fights can begin.

A really basic way to start to get on the same page financially is to commit to sitting down at least once a year and reviewing the following pieces of financial information: (1) your income, your expenses, and the difference, which ideally is your savings, (2) your assets, your liabilities, and the difference, which is your net worth, and (3) your credit scores and credit reports so all debt is transparent. I liken these stats to the basic blood work drawn at your annual physical. They are pieces of data that can help you see if you are on course or need to work as a team to make adjustments.

One caveat: I'm not suggesting these conversations are going to be easy. For millions of people, talking about money brings up emotions ranging from guilt to shame to embarrassment. Couples who pay attention to their financial well-being the same way they would their physical, spiritual, or intellectual well-being put themselves on a path for much lower levels of financial stress.

Manisha Thakor ("https://twitter.com/ManishaThakor") is founder and chief executive of Santa Fe, N.M.-based MoneyZen Wealth Management LLC.

Matt Hougan: Make a Vow of Frugality

You know the thought you're having now? About all the things you could have done with the money you spent on that wedding? About how much they charged for those centerpieces?

Remember that feeling when the time comes to buy a car. Skip the baby Audi, buy a six-year-old Corolla and take a great vacation/fund your retirement/save for a house instead.

Matt Hougan ("https://twitter.com/Matt_Hougan") is president of ETF analytics and global head of editorial for IndexUniverse LLC.

Terrance Odean: Start Saving

Start saving 20% of your after-tax income now. (Including 401(k) savings, contributions to a defined-benefit pension, etc.)

Terrance Odean is the Rudd Family Foundation professor and chairman of the finance group at Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley.

Olivia Mitchell: Build a Joint 'Financial Dream' List

Particularly since few have much money, financial disputes drive many divorces. Too many couples today begin their lives together holding seemingly overwhelming student loans, car loans, credit-card debt and more. So when the honeymoon's over, the money quarrels start: "Why did you spend so much on clothes? We're supposed to be saving for a house down payment, so why are you buying such an expensive computer? Just because I'm the homemaker, why don't I deserve some spending money of my own?"

So my advice is to spend a weekend building your "financial dream" list together. That will give you much to look forward to, after the passions cool and before the money squabbles have time to set in.

Prior to walking down the aisle, my partner and I took a couple of days to draft our financial dream plan together. How many kids did we want? How often and where would we vacation? How would we handle the fact that one of us had enough for a small down payment on our first house, and the other had no savings at all?

That was probably the most important discussion of our lives together, since we hashed out priorities and pre-settled arguments that we wouldn't have to have later.

We also decided to go the joint and separate account route: The joint account pays for most everything, including the house, cars, kids, the college fund and taxes. The joint account also contributes to our retirement accounts. Then we each get a small monthly allowance transferred into our separate accounts, which we use as we wish. Separate and joint credit cards are attached to each account.

All this seems like a lot of work, but it has helped us avoid arguing about money (for the most part!). And we're still living out the financial dream we drafted together, 31 years ago.

Olivia S. Mitchell is a professor of business economics and public policy at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where she focuses on pensions, household finance and risk management.

Greg McBride: Save for a Rainy Day

Build an emergency savings cushion as quickly as you can. Money is the number one issue that married couples argue over, but having that rainy-day fund will give you financial peace of mind and alleviate a lot of potential stress in your marriage.

Greg McBride ("https://twitter.com/BankrateGreg") is a senior financial analyst and vice president for Bankrate.com, providing analysis and advice on personal finance.

Michelle Perry Higgins: Get On the Same Page Early

Marital bliss can be so intoxicating that it is sometimes hard to see through the fog and imagine that you could ever have financial challenges. So while you are still in that state of euphoria, it's a great time to write out a financial plan. Ideally, you should take care of this prior to the wedding or shortly thereafter. During the financial-plan review you will evaluate your budget, spending patterns, savings needs, debt, income expectations (dual or single), insurance and much more. It is critical to have this type of full disclosure occur early on and make sure you are both on the same page with regard to your new financial future.

Michelle Perry Higgins ("https://twitter.com/RetirementMPH") is a financial planner and principal at California Financial Advisors.

Rafael Pardo: Communicate Early and Often About Spending Habits

When couples marry, they often become a single economic unit, pooling their assets and income and sharing responsibility for their debts. Prior to marriage, couples may have already begun the shift from an individual financial identity to a collective financial identity. Regardless, in the spirit of Benjamin Franklin's wise observation that "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure," newlyweds will increase the likelihood of marital harmony by communicating early and often about their consumption habits. When one partner's consumption preferences are not closely aligned with the other's preferences, the mismatch can negatively affect the couple's ability to achieve its financial goals. As consumption increases, the ability to save and invest decreases. If from the outset couples do not sign on to the same game plan (i.e., budget) for achieving their financial goals, they very well may encounter difficulty in buying a home, saving for retirement, saving for their children's education, and so on and so forth. And if one partner perceives the difficulty to stem from the other partner's consumption habits, disapproving and acrimonious feelings will likely follow. Newlyweds can stem such discord by the simple expedients of discussing how their spending will affect their financial goals and having that discussion inform their collective financial decision-making.

Rafael Pardo ("https://twitter.com/bankruptcyprof") is the Robert T. Thompson Professor of Law at Emory University, where he specializes in bankruptcy and commercial law.

George Papadopoulos: Get on a Healthy Financial 'Diet'

Have a financial plan in place. Max out on retirement savings; the sooner you start, the better. Have an adequate cash emergency fund and get in the habit of saving for short-term goals. Ignore advice to buy more house than you can afford. Diversify your investment portfolio with low-cost index funds and ETFs and rebalance it at regular intervals. Invest in yourself by getting more education and continuing to add to your skills. Does this sound similar to the advice given to people who want to lose weight (eat healthier, exercise more)? If it was that easy, most people's finances would not be in such a mediocre state today! For some people it makes sense to hire a good fiduciary financial adviser who will prevent them from making mistakes and keep them disciplined to follow a prescribed financial plan.

George Papadopoulos ("https://twitter.com/feeonlyplanner") is a fee-only wealth manager in Novi, Mich., serving affluent individuals and families.

Sheryl Garrett: Make a List of Lifetime Goals

Finances are often a subject that squelches any romantic conversation, however it is essential that new couples recognize that they are not only a romantic and domestic partnership, they are also a financial partnership.

I use one exercise that helps couples get to know more about one another, their individual and shared goals and their most important desires in their financial lives. I've used this exercise with couples who've been together two months to 20-plus years, and new information is always revealed. It's simple, fun and can be very enlightening.

Start by listing on a piece of paper the first 30 things that come to mind that you'd like to do, see, become or accomplish in your lifetime. This is your personal list. Have your partner do the same thing. Coming up with 30 things is not easy. It causes people to really dig deep, far beyond the stereotypical financial-planning goals. For example, my list includes visiting all of the parks in the National Park System and learning to speak conversational Chinese. Once you've made your list of 30 things, next place an A, B or C next to that item. Place an A next to the things that you "Must Do", a B next to the things you'd "Love to Do" and a C next to the things that "Would be Nice to Do". Now, share your list with your partner and spend some time absorbing and discussing their list. You'll find many things will overlap but you will also learn of many other subjects that are important to your partner at this time. With this as a background, a very healthy and collaborative financial partnership can develop.

Rick Ferri: Two Financial Takeaways for Newlyweds

I have two pieces of advice. First, live below your means. Second, start saving for your kids' college education before you even have children!

Rick Ferri is founder of Portfolio Solutions LLC and the author of six books on low-cost index fund and ETF investing. His blog is "http://www.rickferri.com/blog/".

Charles Rotblut: Communicate and Adapt as Needed

Communicate frequently and be prepared to be flexible.

Talk about what you want to save for, what you want to buy and how much you are currently spending. If you are the person who regularly pays the bills (and for most couples, it seems one spouse does this routinely), talk to your significant other about what and how much the bills are. If you actively invest, tell your spouse what you are doing. If there is a big upcoming purchase, tell your spouse. Whatever the financial decision or event is, communicate.

Communicating is not only the right thing to do, it can also help you make smarter decisions. I can tell you personally that I don't spend my money on anything that I'm not willing to tell my wife about. If I think she'll object or have reservations, we'll talk about it in advance.

At the same time, realize your spouse may have very different attitudes toward money or very different financial behaviors. What seems like a rational purchase or investment to you may not seem like that to your spouse. Alternatively, your spouse may want to spend money on something you don't think is a justifiable purchase. So have some flexibility and allow for some leeway. If you find yourself butting heads over spending, set up separate "my money" accounts accounts set aside for spending on whatever you each want to buy without question. Just be sure to agree on the amount and the source of the money that goes into those accounts.

Finally, I would strongly advise approaching finances with a large amount of forgiveness. There is a reasonable chance one or both of you will make a big financial mistake (and probably many mistakes). You are both human and it happens. No matter how mad you get, stop and ask yourself whether the mistake is really big enough to warrant ending your marriage over.

The Wall Street Journal put this question to The Experts, an exclusive group of industry and academic thought leaders who engage in in-depth online discussions of topics from the print Report. This question relates to a "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324188604578541751270494278.html" about how IRA payments may avoid state income tax and formed the basis of a discussion in The Experts stream on July 11.

Terrance Odean: Don't Hold On to Your Own Company's Stock

What is the biggest mistake people make with their 401(k)s? Buying and holding their employer's stock in a 401(k). If your company gives you stock, by all means take it. But sell it soon after you are allowed to do so. If your company does great, you may regret not having loaded up on its stock, but not as much as you will regret losing your life savings along with your job if your company folds (as happened to some Enron employees who had 100% of their 401(k) plan invested in Enron stock).

Terrance Odean is the Rudd Family Foundation professor and chairman of the finance group at Haas School of Business, University of California, Berkeley.

Manisha Thakor: Act According to Your Age

The biggest mistake I see with 401(k)s is being too conservative in their investment approach when they are young and too aggressive with their investment approach when older.

It's understandable. When you first start investing in a 401k the $50, $100 or more that you are contributing a pay period feels like a huge bite out of your paycheck. Thus a natural tendency is to want to protect that hard-earned money. Yet because this money is intended not to be accessed until you are at least 59 years old, your early years are exactly the ones where you should be taking the most risk. When a person is in their 20s, 30s and early 40s I like to see them as close to 100% in equities as they can stomach in their 401(k).

Conversely, I notice individuals in their late 40s and into their 50s often panicking that they did not save enough early on, so they try to make up for lost time by increasing the aggressiveness of their portfolio holdings. A better option would be to save more and plan to work a wee bit longer. The compound effect of those two activities, statistically speaking, will give you greater odds of getting where you want to go versus swinging for the fences with a hyperaggressive allocation when you don't have the years to make up for a significant loss of principal.

Manisha Thakor ("https://twitter.com/ManishaThakor") is founder and chief executive of Santa Fe, N.M.-based MoneyZen Wealth Management LLC.

Sheryl Garrett: Stop the Excuses and Save More

There are many common mistakes we see; however, I'd have to say that the biggest one is lack of sufficient savings. If you haven't been saving at least 10% of your gross income since your 20s, you're probably not saving enough for retirement.

Some people fear that the market is too volatile or risky for them to invest. Others argue that they just can't afford to save or save much right now. Well folks, it rarely gets any better. If you can't afford to save for your future now, what's going to change? When you're in the accumulation phase, volatility can work to your advantage. Time becomes your enemy as the power of compound interest can't work for you.

Start or increase your savings rate by 2%. You'll hardly notice it. After three to six months, bump it up another 2%. Over time, you'll get your savings rate up to the place it needs to be. Give yourself some time, but be persistent.

Sheryl Garrett ("https://twitter.com/SherylGarrett") is founder of the Garrett Planning Network Inc.

Tom Brakke: Different Features, Different Pitfalls to Avoid

It really depends on the features of a particular 401(k) plan. Some people put too much into their company stock, for example. Borrowing against the plan can inhibit the building of a long-term nest egg. Often, people invest in too many different investments, usually based upon past performance figures. All of those approaches are problematic.

The right strategy will depend on the available options in the plan, which are determined by the plan sponsor rather than the investor. Too often, the options have fees that are too high. A simple, cheap index-fund approach is probably the best for most people, but many plan sponsors don't provide that alternative. That's unfortunate.

Tom Brakke ("https://twitter.com/researchpuzzler") is a consultant, writer and investment adviser who specializes in the analysis of investment decision making and the communication of investment ideas.

George Papadopoulos: Maximize Contributions as Early as Possible

With so many potential mistakes to choose from, it is no easy task to pick the biggest: undercontributing, not signing up for the plan because "we cannot afford it" (you cannot afford to not afford it!), picking high-cost funds (sometimes the fund lineup does not have any low-cost funds), not diversifying, not rebalancing at least once a year, borrowing from the plan to pay off other debts, not rolling over the plan to an IRA after switching jobs, and on it goes. If I must pick one, I think the biggest mistake is not maximizing contributions at the earliest possible time to take full advantage of the compounding and tax savings.

Christian Magoon: Apathy Is Not the Answer

401(k)s are often treated as second-class citizens by investors when it comes to monitoring performance, fees and asset allocation. This might be explained by the fairly painless contributions that workers make to 401(k)s or the mind set that accessing 401(k) funds is years, if not decades, away. Whatever the case, many investors allow apathy to be the primary investment strategy in these retirement engines. Sadly, for many workers 401(k) assets will be the primary source of income in their golden years.

Rafael Pardo: Capture the Full Benefits of Your Employer's Matching Contribution

People often make the mistake of failing to contribute the amount required to trigger the maximum amount of matching contributions that their employer will make to their 401(k) retirement accounts. Many employers will match an employee's 401(k) contributions up to a certain percentage of the employee's regular salary in stepwise increments. For example, consider an employer whose retirement plan provides that the employer will match up to 5% of the employee's regular salary in the following manner: By matching with a 2.5% contribution for the first 2.5% of regular salary contributed by the employee and by matching with another 2.5% contribution for the second 2.5% of regular salary contributed by the employee. Based on this example, an employee who contributes 2% of regular salary would fail to trigger any matching contribution by the employer. And an employee who contributes 4% of regular salary would trigger only a 2.5% matching contribution by the employer. By failing to contribute more, both employees end up leaving a significant amount of money on the table: As I've previously written in this column, "http://on.wsj.com/ZMIsox". If you don't capitalize on the full extent of your employer's matching contribution, you make the journey toward retirement security more of an uphill climb than it needs to be.

Greg McBride: What Seems Safe Is Risky

People don't save enough and don't invest aggressively enough in their retirement savings. Investing too conservatively compounds the problem of not saving enough because the meager savings will not grow into a sufficient nest egg when hunkering down in conservative, low-return investments. Over the long haul, what is considered safe cash and bonds is actually quite risky, while what is considered risky equities is actually a much safer bet to get you to your long-range financial goals. Especially for young people, it is urgent to harness the power of compounding provided by higher return investments. But even those on the cusp of retirement may need this money to last a quarter century or more, so a healthy allocation to equities is warranted.

Greg McBride ("https://twitter.com/BankrateGreg") is a senior financial analyst and vice president for Bankrate.com, providing analysis and advice on personal finance.

Michelle Perry Higgins: Hands Off That Account!

What is the biggest mistake people make with their 401(k)s? Tapping into their funds today, thinking they won't need them tomorrow. I've seen so many people try to rationalize that pulling out retirement funds to meet immediate pressing needs is OK. I completely understand how challenging it is for Americans to pay their bills on a monthly basis. Everything from the mortgage to their children's sports activities is a drain on finances, and that makes things difficult. It can sometimes be easy to justify present wants as being more important than future needs. However, you must make your retirement savings a priority and don't procrastinate in adding to your 401(k) account. Most importantly, do not withdraw your retirement savings until you are well into your golden years. If you can do that, I promise that you will thank me later.

Matt Hougan: The Secret's In the Saving

Mistake 1: Not saving enough.

Mistake 2: Being too conservative (you probably need more equity exposure than you think).

Mistake 3: Having a concentrated position in company stock. (Your job is tied to the company's success; isn't that enough?)

Mistake 4: Did I mention not saving enough? That's really the only mistake that matters.

Matt Hougan ("https://twitter.com/Matt_Hougan") is president of ETF analytics and global head of editorial for IndexUniverse LLC.

Charles Rotblut: No Second-Guessing

There is a large amount of evidence showing that people do not manage their 401(k) plans in a disciplined manner. Rather, they choose funds at the time they start the plan and then panic and sell those funds when they see a 401(k) statement during the midst of a bear market. Compounding matters is that many people do not even truly understand what they are investing in.

The reality is that with a little effort and discipline, a person with even nominal knowledge of investing can significantly increase the long-term performance of his 401(k) plan. Using an asset-allocation model from a reputable source (such as the one we have on "http://www.aaii.com/asset-allocation") can help you determine which asset classes you should be invested in. Then pick the lowest-cost funds for each asset class. Once a year, review your allocations and adjust your portfolio back to target if each fund's allocation has strayed five percentage points or more off target (e.g., your target large-cap stock allocation is 30%, but large-cap stocks now only account for 24% of your portfolio's value).

Alternatively, you can buy a target-date fund maturing near the year you turn 65 or 70. This fund handles all of the allocation decisions for you and is meant to be held into retirement. It may be more costly, but it requires less effort on your part.

Most importantly, do not second-guess your choices, especially during a bear market. The average holding period for a mutual fund is less than four years, according to research firm DALBAR. This short holding period causes the average equity-fund investor to realize a return about half of what they would have earned if they had just stayed invested and not second-guessed their decisions.

Charles Rotblut ("https://twitter.com/charlesrotblut") is a vice president with the American Association of Individual Investors.

Rick Ferri: Diversification Isn't Always the Answer

Oddly, 401(k) participants can be hurt by overdiversification. If a 401(k) plan has index funds, then they are the only investments needed in each asset class. If a plan doesn't have index funds, plan participants shouldn't overdiversify among several actively managed mutual funds within each asset class because this strategy actually lowers the probability for success.

In ""http://www.rickferri.com/WhitePaper.pdf"," a newly released white paper I co-wrote with Alex Benke of Betterment, we show that a portfolio holding one actively managed fund in each asset class has a low probability of outperforming a similar portfolio holding only index funds. The odds get worse when an investor selects two or more actively managed funds in each asset class, which is often the case with participants in 401(k) plans. People do this because they believe they are diversifying their holdings, but this strategy actually lowers their probability for success.

The strategy with the highest probability for success is a portfolio of all index funds. However, if you don't have index funds in a 401(k) and must select from actively managed funds, then pick one actively managed fund per asset class and hope for the best.

News analysis

A data-based attack on suspicious trading is already bearing fruit, writes Brooke Masters

Set a thief to catch a thief, the adage goes. When it comes to catching insider traders, the UK financial watchdog has not gone quite that far, but it is turning to traders' tools.

Under the leadership of Patrick Spens, a former Citigroup and hedge fund manager, the market monitoring division of what is now the Financial Conduct Authority has launched a data-based attack on suspicious trading.

First, the FCA stepped up the pressure on City banks and brokers to do a better job of getting information to the regulator both about ordinary trades and those that looked suspicious.

Under UK law, banks and brokers must report every single transaction in a regulated security to the FCA every day. But many groups fell short of their responsibilities until the watchdog fined Barclays and eight other companies a combined 8m and forced them to go back and re-report everything they had missed.

Now the watchdog gets 13m detailed transaction reports every day with details of who bought, who sold and for how much. It is thought to be the most comprehensive regulatory database in the world.

Next, Lord Spens stepped up the pressure on banks and brokers to live up to their duty to flag up unusual trading. After much prodding of companies, the watchdog also received 1,018 "suspicious transaction reports" last year, nearly double the previous total.

But data are only as good as the ability to interpret them, so the FCA hired a team of quantitative analysts and set them to work writing algorithms. Some of these "technologists" come from industry; others have PhDs in maths or statistics. Bolstered by the latest in high-end analytics servers as well as commercial surveillance software from Nasdaq OMX , the quants are writing programmes to comb the transaction data alongside news feeds to identify timely trades and unusual patterns.

For Lord Spens, who oversaw the building of Citi's trading algorithms a decade ago, the FCA's task is a familiar one. "Using experience born from trading algorithms intellectually is no different from looking for abusive behaviour in the markets. Both rely on huge data sets where you are looking for patterns and anomalies," he says.

The quants represent a small share of the 60-person market monitoring programme and their special project budget is in the millions of pounds. They have been at work for close to 18 months and their programmes are being gradually introduced into a variety of securities markets.

It is still early days, but the efforts are starting to bear fruit with a stream of alerts that are probed for obvious explanations - such as a news report or a matching trade that makes clear the lucky one was a hedge. The rest are then referred on to the enforcement division for possible investigation.

Over time, Lord Spens predicts, the surveillance system will only get better as results from the computers are compared with STRs sent in by the companies.

"By marrying the algorithms with the STRs received we can self-police the quality of STR submissions and create a virtuous circle of surveillance," he says.

Enforcement cases take years but knowing someone is watching appears to be having a deterrent effect. Suspicious trading before UK mergers and acquisitions fell to the lowest level in more than a decade last year.

Investing in Funds & ETFs: A Quarterly Analysis --- Income Investing: A Smarter Dividend Strategy --- Amid interest-rate worries, look to sectors that are likely to boost payouts over time

By Jonathan Burton

A recent bout of rising U.S. interest rates has beaten up on dividend-paying stocks, rattling shareholders who had been enjoying regular income and higher prices from these so-called defensive equities.

But the end of rock-bottom rates shouldn't be the death of dividend strategies. Indeed, some market professionals say investors just need to be more selective about the types of dividend stocks they pursue.

"Dividends are a good long-term theme," says Russ Koesterich, chief investment strategist at BlackRock Inc. But, he adds, changing conditions just mean investors will have to look a little harder for opportunities.

The Federal Reserve in the past two months has made statements indicating it plans to begin unwinding its massive bond-purchasing program, perhaps later this year. That's why dividend stocks stumbled in May and June, and why investors can expect more volatility should Treasury yields continue on an upward trajectory.

Higher bond yields make the lower interest rates on older bonds less attractive -- and similarly eat into the appeal of stocks that were bought largely for their dividend yield.

"People see other alternatives and withdraw money from dividend stocks," says Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices.

But dividend stocks as a group have, on average, outperformed non-dividend peers during periods when the Federal Reserve nudges interest rates higher, though not by much. A study by Ned Davis Research in Venice, Fla., found that dividend payers in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index returned 2.2% annualized during such times, while non-dividend stocks in the index gained 1.8%. (By contrast, dividend stocks trounce non-dividend shares in "neutral" or "easing" periods when interest rates decline.)

Here are strategies and suggestions from market professionals who argue there is still room for growth in the right kinds of dividend stocks:

Highest Isn't Best

For starters, some say, avoid the highest-yielding stocks. The yield-rich utilities sector of the S&P 500, for example, lost 2.7% from the beginning of April through June, compared with a 2.9% gain for the benchmark itself.

"High dividend yield doesn't give you a place to hide in an environment that doesn't favor equities," says Sharon Hill, head of equity quantitative research and analytics at Philadelphia-based portfolio-management company Delaware Investments, a member of Australia's Macquarie Group Ltd.

Despite their high yields, utilities, telecommunications and other bond-like areas of the stock market tend to be slower-growing and debt-laden. Their dividend issuance relative to earnings -- the "payout ratio" -- is often extremely high, leaving little room for increases.

Think About Sectors . . .

Focus on companies in sectors closely tied to economic health and whose earnings and dividend payouts are growing. Technology, industrials, health care and other economically sensitive sectors fit this bill. In an improving economy, these cash-rich companies will be able to raise their dividends to keep pace with inflation. Accordingly, they're a better hedge against rising rates than more financially constrained businesses.

"Tech companies are paying good yields," says Charles Rotblut, vice president at the American Association of Individual Investors. Among his favorites: Qualcomm Inc., Texas Instruments Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc., which recently sported yields ranging from about 1.8% to 2.5%.

. . . And Economic Cycles

Cyclical stocks have been the market's best performers during lengthy periods of rising rates. Research firm Birinyi Associates studied nine such cycles since 1962 and found that the technology, industrial and materials sectors averaged double-digit gains in the six months after interest rates started to rise, while the utilities and telecommunications sectors lost ground and consumer staples lagged behind the benchmark S&P 500.

Given that history, investors using exchange-traded funds and mutual funds that invest in dividend-focused stocks should be mindful of whether the overall portfolio is cyclical or defensive.

Challenge for Funds

A climate of higher rates will challenge more than just individual investors. Many mutual-fund managers and other investing professionals have never experienced a prolonged stretch of rising yields, and not all will rise to the occasion.

Dividend-growth funds with a high concentration of cyclical technology stocks are particularly suited to the times. By contrast, many other dividend funds emphasize higher current income and are skewed toward consumer staples, utilities, telecom and other high-yield, defensive sectors.

The popular iShares Dow Jones Select Dividend Index exchange-traded fund, which includes dividend growth in its stock-selection criteria, had almost 30% of assets in utilities and only 3% in technology at the end of June.

In contrast, the WisdomTree U.S. Dividend Growth ETF divides about 60% of its portfolio equally among technology, industrials and consumer-discretionary stocks.

An actively managed mutual fund with expenses comparable to the WisdomTree ETF and even cheaper than the iShares Select Dividend ETF is Vanguard Dividend Growth. The $15.3 billion fund, which recently yielded about 2.1%, had committed 13% of assets to technology stocks and less than 2% to utilities as of May 31.

Says BlackRock's Mr. Koesterich: "Dividend strategies need to shift. People need to become more selective." Otherwise investors may find that instead of changing with the times, the times change them.

Few areas are more confusing for investors these days than saving for college and choosing among the bewildering array of exchange-traded funds. And few things are more frightening than being blindsided by an event that wasn't even on your radar. For insights into these issues, The Wall Street Journal turned to The Experts, an exclusive group of industry, academic and other thought leaders who engage in in-depth online discussions of topics from the print Report. Here are edited excerpts of their comments. Read more at WSJ.com/WealthReport.

Are 529 plans the right choice for all families saving to send their kids to college?

Not in Every Situation

I'm a big fan of 529 college-savings plans because of the tax-free growth and withdrawals for money used for college expenses. I hesitate to characterize anything as right for everybody, and one instance where the benefits of a 529 may not have time to accrue is for those that are looking at very short investment horizons -- such as one year -- before beginning to take withdrawals. The benefit of tax-free growth is very limited over such a short period in low-return, no-risk investments, and could be offset by investment expenses or plan fees in the short run.

-- Greg McBride, a senior financial analyst and vice president for Bankrate.com

The Key: Start Early

Parents' top concern should not be the type of account, but regularly contributing to college. The earlier one starts saving and the longer they continually contribute to a properly allocated portfolio, the greater the chance they will have enough in savings once the child enters college.

-- Charles Rotblut, a vice president with the American Association of Individual Investors

No Slam Dunk

A 529 savings plan is definitely a top contender in the college-savings choices. But this plan is not a slam dunk for all families. Before opening a 529 plan or any college-savings account, it's important to evaluate the pros and cons of each plan and then decide which plan, if any, best aligns with your family goals. For more details: "http://www.irs.gov/uac/529-Plans:-Questions-and-Answers", "http://www.collegesavings.org", "http://www.savingforcollege.com" and "http://www.scholarshare.com".

-- Michelle Perry Higgins, a financial planner and principal at California Financial Advisors

Too Many Restrictions

A 529 plan is still a great choice for most parents, but I must admit that I am not a big fan. I find the restrictions in changing investments, the limited investment options and the steep penalties if the money is not used for college to be substantial drawbacks. I prefer to first maximize the contributions to a Coverdell Education Savings Account, which can be held at any discount broker and which gives you complete freedom to invest the funds as you see fit. Unfortunately, that maximum contribution is only $2,000 per year.

-- George Papadopoulos, a fee-only wealth manager in Novi, Mich.

Go for Low Expenses

Not all 529 plans are alike. I recommend selecting a plan that has low fees and the ability to invest in low-cost index funds.

-- Rick Ferri, founder of Portfolio Solutions LLC, author and blogger

What are the biggest changes likely to hit the ETF market in the next five years?

Actively Managed Funds

There have been filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission from various companies, raising expectations of ETF offerings from mutual-fund companies. I think these preliminary actions will eventually result in new actively managed ETFs. The exact timing is uncertain, however, because of various issues surrounding disclosure. A big hurdle is that ETFs are transparent and the transparency could empower hedge funds to anticipate moves by active managers. This, in turn, could hurt the performance of the actively managed funds.

-- Charles Rotblut

Competition and Consolidation

I am actually concerned that ETFs may be getting too popular. Last year alone, 180 new ETF products were introduced. The continuous slicing and dicing of them has reached ridiculous levels. Therefore, I predict more consolidation in the ETF-provider market as they continue to compete against each other. The intense competition will accelerate the trend toward lower fees.

I am not a fan of active ETFs. I think their existence defeats the whole purpose of low-cost passive-investment management.

-- George Papadopoulos

Old-Line Offerings

Many old-line mutual-fund companies will aggressively enter the ETF market. A long list of traditional fund companies plan to launch multiple ETFs. These include Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price, Legg Mason, J.P. Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and even USAA. These companies are primarily interested in issuing actively managed strategies through an ETF platform.

-- Rick Ferri

More Active Funds -- and Failures

The large mutual-fund families will continue to introduce actively managed ETFs, in an attempt to establish a presence in the ETF world. However, I would expect that many of the products will fail. The biggest names and best performers might be able to generate critical mass, but many of the fund families don't have a natural competitive edge in establishing new ETFs.

-- Tom Brakke, consultant, writer and investment adviser

A Race to the Bottom

ETFs served consumers best in their original manifestation: as simple, good-for-you investment fare that works as a staple in just about everyone's portfolio. Today's ETF providers seem to be racing to the bottom in an effort to create new and esoteric ETF products that may dazzle, but don't nourish, the average retail investor.

-- Eleanor Blayney, consumer advocate of the Certified Financial Planner Board of Standards

What is the No. 1 thing investors should be worried about over the next few years?

It's All About Savings

For the vast majority of people, the most important thing you can do is simple: Spend less money. Max out your 401(k). Save into that 529 college-savings plan. Build that nest egg. Invest at low costs. You'll be glad you did.

-- Matt Hougan, president of ETF analytics and global head of editorial for IndexUniverse LLC.

Think About the Long Term

As an investor, you can stay up all night worrying about what could happen, or you can simply focus on managing your portfolio for the long term. The only thing a person can control is how he manages his portfolio. Long term, stocks will reward investors for putting up with the short-term worries.

-- Charles Rotblut

Don't Worry, Be Ready

First, make sure you have a well-diversified portfolio that can weather the corrective periods of a typical stock-market cycle. Second, have a strong financial plan in place and revisit it at least annually to evaluate your progress. Finally, take up a hobby so you can release any excess worry that may creep into your life.

-- Michelle Perry Higgins

Watch Out for Ghosts

The No. 1 thing investors should worry about is worrying too much about everything and doing nothing by leaving their money in the bank. Record-low interest rates, high stock valuations, crazy Federal Reserve policy and inflation lurking in the shadows are just some of things investors worry about. Like ghosts in a closet, these thoughts can hinder rational thinking and hurt portfolio performance. Don't let ghosts manage your money.

-- Rick Ferri

It Depends on Your Age

For younger investors (under age 40), the primary "worry" is whether they have sufficient exposure to emerging markets, which are likely to have higher growth rates and higher returns. Middle-age investors (age 40-50) need to worry about adequate diversification and beginning to dial back on equity exposure. Near retirees (age 50-65) need to further reduce their equity exposure, while maintaining good diversification. Finally, retirees need to maintain a very modest exposure to equities (10% to 20%) but find good sources of income in a diversified portfolio.

-- Larry D. Zimpleman, chairman, president and chief executive of Principal Financial Group

Look in the Mirror

History shows us that investors lose far more money as a result of their own actions than markets lose for them.

-- Eleanor Blayney

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Canadian pension plans provide a good model

Talking head

SCOTT MACDONALD

"Brand Canada" is very much in the news of late; Mark Carney 's tenure as governor of the Bank of England began last week on the same day Canadians around the world celebrated the country's national holiday: Canada Day.

Canada's profile has also been raised in another area. Across the UK, Europe and Australia, large Canadian pension plans are making headlines as they continue to snap up infrastructure assets - from the Bullring shopping centre in Birmingham and the European airports division of Germany's largest construction company, to various Australian real estate assets.

While perhaps overlooked in the past, the Canadian pension sector is garnering significant recognition and respect globally. The shift is partly due to the country's solid economy and stable performance throughout the financial crisis, which continues today. But are there other factors behind this success story that global pension plans can draw on?

Based on analytics from RBC Investor & Treasury Services' Canadian all-plan universe, with total assets of $460bn, Canadian defined benefit plans returned 4.4 per cent in the first quarter of 2013, bringing 12-month returns to an impressive 9.4 per cent. According to Towers Watson figures, Canadian pension assets grew 6.8 per cent between 2007 and 2012 and outperformed UK and Dutch assets, which grew 0.4 per cent and 1.8 per cent respectively.

While Canada's economy has been relatively resilient over this period, home-country strength alone does not account for such performance. Canadian pension funds have taken advantage of the 2005 repeal of the foreign property rule that restricted investments outside Canada to 30 per cent. As a result, plans are more actively managed and there are greater opportunities to diversify by both asset class and geography. Global equities were the top performer for defined benefit plans in the RBC Canadian all-plan universe in Q1 2013.

Many Canadian plans have also adjusted to protracted low growth by boosting allocations to alternative assets as a means to better match their long-term liabilities. Real estate and infrastructure have historically provided relatively competitive and consistent returns over the long term and are less correlated with other assets.

What is most eye-catching is the willingness of Canadian plans to embrace alternatives, and how both large and smaller plans are carefully increasing exposure levels in alignment with their risk-tolerance frameworks.

Several of the largest plans have leveraged their significant capital and in-house investment management expertise to buy bridges and shopping malls of their own accord. This often extends to overseas opportunities, such as the London Stock Exchange headquarters or the UK's High Speed One rail line, but it is also common for big plans to own office buildings outright in large Canadian centres.

The larger the plan, the greater the possibility of "insourcing" the investment research and management processes. This is an increasing trend in Canada and has had a positive effect on costs, as well as enabling plans to better leverage their scale and gain greater efficiencies when looking at assets.

The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan, for example, which covers more than 300,000 retired and working teachers, had $28.7bn invested in real assets at the end of 2012, according to its annual report. This included property, infrastructure and timberland - a segment which returned 14.7 per cent last year.

Australian plans are also active infrastructure investors but UK plans are generally not yet significant investors despite government initiatives aimed at encouraging it. As Canadian plans demonstrate, there are opportunities.

Smaller plans around the world may believe that there are many barriers limiting their ability to invest in alternatives, including lack of sufficient scale and expertise, liquidity concerns, access to global opportunities and overcoming plan governance. But, like their Canadian counterparts, smaller schemes still have access to alternative assets through a variety of structures, from fund vehicles such as open-ended funds, to public-private partnerships and managed consortiums.

In the Netherlands, the trend towards consolidation has created fewer, larger plans that could have the scope and scale to make such investments. At a time when there is debate about combining London's local government pension plans, many Canadian plans have already gone through the process of establishing co-operation and partnerships.

Despite the focus on Canada, this approach to managing pension plan investments should be seen as an option for funds in many countries. The pooling of assets and resources by funds in countries outside Canada is on the rise and governments are looking at overhauling pensions markets. With their strong foothold, expertise and experience, Canadian pension plans should prove a model to follow.

What is one move that could help investors simplify their portfolios and/or their financial affairs? The Wall Street Journal put this question to The Experts, an exclusive group of industry, academic and other thought leaders who engage in in-depth online discussions of topics from the print Report. This question relates to a "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323566804578551793835572924.html" that discussed simple portfolios that consist of just three funds and formed the basis of a discussion in The Experts stream on Monday, July 8.

The Experts will discuss topics raised in this month's Investing in Funds & ETFs Report and other Wall Street Journal Reports. Find the finance Experts stream, watch recent interactive videos and explore a host of other exciting online content at "http://online.wsj.com/public/page/journal-report-wealth.html?mg=inert-wsj"

Also "http://on.wsj.com/170cXfy" investment adviser Tom Brakke ("https://twitter.com/researchpuzzler"), blogger Mike Piper ("https://twitter.com/michaelrpiper") and University of California, Berkeley Professor Terrance Odean in an interactive video chat that aired on July 8 in which they discussed strategies for coping with market volatility.

Michael Kitces: Consolidate. If Not, Aggregate.

The easiest way to start simplifying your financial affairs is to just get everything gathered together in the first place which is often no small feat in a world where investments are often scattered among multiple brokerage, retirement and bank accounts, each often split with multiple vendors. As we add new investments, and life and circumstances change, we have a tendency to create new accounts, but rarely take the time to get rid of the old ones; after enough years and decades, it can become quite a mess.

So the first step to simplification is to consolidate. In today's world of increasingly flexible financial services firms that can accommodate a wide range of accounts, there is often little reason to have multiple brokerage and retirement-account providers. In some cases, you can even use the same provider for your checking and savings accounts as well.

On the other hand, it isn't always possible to consolidate. Perhaps there is a unique investment that really does have to be held at a certain location. Perhaps your bank and brokerage accounts are at different providers, can't perform the services of the other, and you want to keep both. Perhaps there is a current retirement plan that just can't be moved while you're still working there.

For those scenarios, the next best option is to aggregate the financial information together, using one of the emerging crop of personal financial-management tools. The most popular by far is Mint, but there are "http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2407617,00.asp". All give you the ability to log into one central dashboard and, after securely entering your login information once for your other sites, draw together the information to give you a simple report so you know where you stand. You can even pull in your credit card, mortgage, and other debts, as well, so you get a full picture of "http://www.kitces.com/blog/archives/198-Why-Is-It-Risky-To-Buy-Stocks-On-Margin-But-Prudent-To-Buy-Them-On-Mortgage.html".

So commit to spending an hour or two gathering everything together, and beginning the process of transferring it all to one centralized provider to the extent possible, and then set up an aggregation account to track the pieces that are left. It will make life much simpler.

Terrance Odean: Stop Buying Individual Stocks

Going forward, don't buy individual stocks. Buy (and hold) a few well diversified, low-cost mutual funds (e.g., an all-U.S. equity index fund, an international equity index fund, a broad-based bond fund). Remember, look for low fees, don't chase past performance. If you currently hold high-fee funds, sell them and buy low-fee funds. Whether or not it makes sense to sell current individual stocks and buy funds depends upon how underdiversified you are and whether you are holding stocks for gains or losses. In general, sell your losers and sell winners for which you can offset capital gains. If the tax implications of selling your stocks are potentially large, consider getting some professional advice before taking action.

Michelle Perry Higgins: Don't Scatter Your Accounts

If I had to pick one way to simplify financial affairs, I would say consolidation of your accounts. Having multiple accounts, especially when they are at different banks, needlessly complicates things. For example, I have seen investors with four checking accounts and three savings accounts, all at different banks. This adds up to more statements, more tracking, more documentation and more stress. If an investor wasn't over the FDIC limit, I would question the need to have multiple accounts. My advice is that if you are under federal thresholds, think about combining your accounts to make life simpler.

Charles Rotblut: Write Down Your Financial Plan

Write instructions on how you would want your financial affairs managed if you were suddenly unable to do so yourself (e.g. because of an accident or a severe illness).

Doing so serves two important functions. The first is that it forces you to think about how you are actually managing your finances. Are you doing so in a disciplined manner or do you lack a clear plan? Is your strategy simple enough to explain to another person or is it overly complicated? If you are like many investors, writing down directions for managing your portfolio will reveal weaknesses in your current process. It also gives you the opportunity to correct them, as well as a disciplined process to follow going forward.

The second function is that it allows someone you trust to step in on your behalf. Your spouse, your significant other, your son or your adviser will be able to promptly step in and manage your affairs. By empowering them with clear instructions, you give yourself peace of mind that your affairs will be properly managed.

Matt Hougan: The Less You Work, the Better Off You Are

Do less.

Investing is awesome. It's one of the few places in life where, the less you work, the better off you are.

Imagine if that were true at your job? Or with your kids? Or working out? We'd be doing cartwheels.

But with investing, it's absolutely true &and yet we spend so much time and money pretending it isn't.

Every study shows: If you study the market in-depth, watch charts on six different screens, and go chasing after the latest hot manager, you're almost guaranteed to underperform. If you buy simple, low-cost mutual funds, and rebalance once per year, you'll outperform the vast majority of investors.

Want some advice? Buy one global total market equity index fund. Buy another total market bond index fund. Rebalance.

Spend the time and money you save at the gym.

Rick Ferri: It's as Easy as Cake

Creating a portfolio is like baking a cake. Selecting the right ingredients, using the right amount and baking it for the right time at the right temperature results in a tasty treat. The recipe for a good portfolio is the same. Start with the three essential ingredients: A total bond market index fund, total U.S. stock market index fund and total international stock index fund. How these three funds are blended together will determine the portfolio's "temperature" or level of risk. Next, hold the portfolio for an appropriate time based on your needs. Don't take it out of the oven too soon! This makes for a winning portfolio.

After that, it's all icing on the cake. You can also add a little flavoring using a real estate index fund (REITs) or a small-cap value index fund if you wish. "http://www.portfoliosolutions.com/totaleconomyportfolio/" for more information.

Eleanor Blayney: The Best Plan Is to Have One

Make an investment plan, stick to the plan, and rebalance to the plan.

Just think what these three steps (really one) could eliminate:

 " Worry about where the market is or where it's going (a good plan will build in market risk);

 " Indecision about where to invest extra cash or savings, or where to find funds for life events (the plan's asset allocation will have the answer); and

 " Impulsive and usually costly behavior, such as buying hot and selling cold (your plan will have parameters for when to buy or sell).

In other words, a properly prepared investment plan can save you time, money and ulcers.

Christian Magoon: Know What You're Aiming For

Imagine trying to plan a vacation but not knowing how long you are staying or what your budget is. Most of us wouldn't even attempt to make plans without those numbers, but too often investors are doing just that when investing. The generic investment goals of "college savings" or "retirement" are being made every day. These goals aren't specific enough to be measured properly, thus making portfolio assessments and decisions much harder. Investors need specific investment goals that have numbers representing time and money at minimum. In the context of these numbers, many investment decisions will become less complicated.

Sheryl Garrett: Two Crucial Moves

Consolidate and automate! OK, that is two moves. Consolidate any and all investment accounts, excluding retirement plans with your current employer, with one discount brokerage firm. Next, automate all of your monthly savings and investments and the payment of your regular expenses. I like to have my monthly savings and investments withdrawn directly from my paycheck before it's automatically deposited into my checking account. From there my mortgage payment, taxes, insurance, and many utilities are automatically deducted each month. Then, whatever is left over is mine to spend as I see fit.

Tom Brakke: Rein in Stray Accounts

If you have stray accounts here and there old brokerage accounts, 401(k) plans from previous jobs, etc. you should investigate whether there are valid reasons to keep them open. That includes looking at the investments within the context of your overall holdings, but also considering the fees that are being charged on those accounts and the extra time you have to spend keeping track of them.

It might seem like there are diversification benefits from having your assets located in multiple places. That may be true in some situations, but often those extra accounts aren't providing any diversification, just hassles.

George Papadopoulos: Simple Is Always Better for Long-Term Results

It is difficult to choose just one move that could help investors simplify their portfolios and/or financial affairs as it is usually a combination of small moves that can achieve this. Having said that, if there was one move I usually recommend, it is the consolidation of financial accounts. Clients usually come to us with too many open accounts in different institutions and the amount of paper (and/or emails) generated is a frequent contributor to wasted time and stress. I often recommend having one checking account set up for direct deposit and paying bills, one savings account to hold the emergency cash fund and short-term goal savings and one brokerage company to hold all investment accounts. These accounts are linked online and the goal is to not have more than enough cash necessary sitting in the checking account, while easily funding the savings and the investment accounts regularly (preferably monthly). Please avoid adding more layers in your finances. You don't need XYZ hedge fund, nontraded REIT, master limited partnership etc. no matter how fantastic they sound. Simple is always better for long-term results because you will understand it and you will spend much less time handling and worrying about it. And you will sure spend less in fees for that investment manager to take shots with your money with his/her "proprietary" investment strategies.

Manisha Thakor: Set the Right Asset Allocation

When it comes to investing, time and again academic studies have shown that asset allocation trumps security selection in terms of what contributes the most to your long-run returns. Given this evidence, I believe the single most important move that an investor can make is to set and execute on the right asset allocation for his or her specific situation.

If unsure what your target asset allocation should be with your long-term investment funds, a simple rule of thumb popularized by the legendary John Bogle is to put your age in bonds and the remainder in stocks. If you are 50 years old, this means with your five- or 10-year-plus funds (NOT your emergency funds) you would put 50% in bonds and 50% in stocks. To me, the simplest way to execute on that allocation is through the use of low-cost index or "passive" mutual funds, such as those offered by Vanguard or Dimensional Fund Advisors or related low-cost ETFs.

While this may sound incredibly basic, I find that most people are unsure of the three most important factors when it comes to their investments: their asset allocation, their fees and how their current portfolio balance relates to their long-term goals. Spending some time with a qualified adviser (ideally one held to a fiduciary, versus a suitability, standard) to identify and implement the right asset allocation and learn about the other two factors is one move that can really help simplify your portfolio and your financial affairs.

Data security co Varonis plans $150m NY IPO; The company has chosen underwriters for the offering, which may be held before the end of 2013 at a company value of $500 million.

Big data company Varonis Inc. is planning to raise $100-150 million at a company value of $500 million in a Wall Street IPO. The company has chosen the underwriters for the offering, which may be held before the end of this year.

Varonis is one of the more interesting and successful Israeli high-tech companies in recent years. Headquartered in New York City, and with its development center in Herzliya, the company's quiet conduct over the years has resulted in an air of mystery around it. Varonis was founded in 2005 by president and CEO Yaki Faitelson and CTO Ohad Korkus. It targets one the less handled sides of security - access authorization to an enterprise's files. The company's solution allows enterprises to manage and control access to information files with an emphasis on sensitive information, and prevent its unauthorized distribution.

Varonis has raised only $30 million over years, from Pitango Venture Capital, Evergreen Venture Partners, and Accel Partners, and also secured a strategic investment from EMC Corporation (NYSE: EMC). The low investment means that the investors and entrepreneurs will make a respectable return on the exit.

Varonis's solutions belong to the same category as those of Imperva Inc. (NYSE: IMPV), which is currently traded at a p/e ratio of 8-9. Varonis is profitable and had $55 million in sales in 2012. It has 450 employees.

Varonis was in acquisition talks a year ago with IBM Corporation (NYSE: IBM) at a company value of $450 million. Although no deal was reached, no one will be surprised if Varonis, like other companies in its field, ultimately ends up as part of IBM or another computer giant.

Security co Seculert raises $10m; "The current concern about cyber threats helped the fundraising," Seculert CEO Dudi Matot told "Globes."

Seculert Ltd. has announced its second financing round exactly one year after its previous round. Sequoia Capital, a new investor, led the $10 million round, alongside Norwest Venture Partners, which invested in the previous round. The company has raised $16 million to date, mostly from YL Ventures, which did not participate in the current round.

Seculert was founded in 2010 by CEO Dudi Matot, CTO Aviv Raff, and COO Alex Milstein. It develops a security service which seeks to deal with the rapid innovations in viruses which are not updated in real time by standard anti-virus software. The company targets what it calls "advanced persistent threats" (APTs), which in practical terms are sophisticated Trojan horses implanted in computer systems by "establishment" hostile parties, such as foreign countries and terrorist and criminal organizations.

"The current concern about cyber threats helped fundraising," Matot told "Globes". "The security problem is real. Traditional security products from the 1990s, which Check Point Software Technologies Ltd. (Nasdaq: CHKP) led 20 years ago, no longer meet today's threats and there is also a market waiting for solutions because organizations realize that anti-virus no longer does the job."

In the past year, APT has become the leading solution for information security and the contemporary application against cyber threats. Seculert uses the cloud, crowdsourcing, and big data analytics to identify malware and new hacking, or changes in the activity patterns of existing viruses. The solution is installed at an a server farm away from the enterprise, where it tackles threats that are inserted into information systems for the long term, and which are not felt immediately, and not only protects against the initial damage from malware.

Sequoia and Norwest are involved in the world's top two security start-ups MobileIron Inc. and FireEye Inc., both from California. Matot says that their investment in Seculert demonstrates its potential. "The funds identified Seculert and the possibility of creating a big company that will go far," says Matot.

Sequoia Capital partner Gili Raanan joined Seculert's board of directors, following the investment, where he will serve along with NVP partner Dror Nahumi of NVP, YL Ventures' Yoav Andrew Leitersdorf, and industry veteran Benny Schnaider.

"With our seed investment in 2010, Seculert established itself as a leader in cloud-based threat protection. In the current round, the company will keep and develop its status," Leitersdorf told "Globes".

Oil and gold backfires for PSigma

Bill Mott has doubled up on his aggressive bet on companies that would benefit from higher inflation. This is in spite of these stocks' "dull to outright shocking" returns that have dragged him down the performance tables.

The PSigma Income fund manager has seen his holdings in what he terms "inflation-hedging" sectors - such as mining - cause him to underperform in the past year.

The fund ranks in the bottom decile of the IMA UK Equity Income sector in terms of its returns in the year to June 27, according to data from FE Analytics, thanks largely to the pro-inflation bets.

Mr Mott admits that his gold mine holdings, including Barrick Gold, African Barrick Gold and Newmont Mining - which accounted for 2 per cent of the portfolio a year ago - had lost half their value in the past 12 months, wiping 1 percentage point off the fund's performance.

Another contributor has been a "much bigger bet than my peer group" in oil companies, which he views as beneficiaries of inflation.

"In spite of the oil price being stable, the performance of the oil stocks has varied between dull and poor," says Mr Mott.

"There's not really much explanation for why oil stocks have been so poor. I thought the Arab spring would create higher oil prices, but that has not translated through to good performance from oil shares, and they have been left behind as other higher yielding equities have been re-rated."

Many commentators predict that the wave of monetary easing launched in response to the global financial crisis will result in high inflation in developed economies in future, but there is no consensus on when that will take place.

Mr Mott says he thought the chances of an inflationary scenario had increased in the past year, adding that he was raising the already 25 per cent weighting in his portfolio to the inflation-hedging companies.

He has been buying miners such as battered Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Glencore Xstrata in recent months.

Perhaps counter-intuitively, the fund also includes a basket of stocks that Mr Mott expects would benefit if there were a deflationary scenario. "People should manage money being aware of a variety of outcomes," he says.

But the manager says that while the risk of higher inflation has increased, he continues to believe the most likely outcome will be that economies would walk a "tightrope" between inflationary and deflationary pressures.

"We think the risk and reward profile is very appropriate for the variety of possible outcomes that confront us. It is not about being top of the charts for any particular period, it is about risk versus reward," he adds.

The fund has returned 15.8 per cent in the past year, underperforming both the average return of 21.3 per cent from the IMA UK Equity Income sector, and the total return on the FTSE All-Share index of 18 per cent. It is in the third quartile of its sector for performance in three years, five years and since launch.

In spite of this, the fund remains on the Hargreaves Lansdown Wealth 150 list of preferred funds.

Richard Troue, investment analyst at the group, said: "The most frustrating thing for us is [Mr Mott] talks a lot of sense on the economy but stock selection has let him down. Exposure to larger stocks did him no favours in 2012 and oil and gold mining as an inflation hedge has not done well at all."

FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - MONEY
Best of the recovery is behind us

Markets tumbled in the last weeks of June. It happened mostly because Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, stated the obvious. He said quantitative easing would have to be tapered and would one day end . Mr Bernanke hedged it by saying this would only happen once the Fed was satisfied the recovery was well set and is sustainable.

The bears got to work and soon the press was peddling visions of interest rate increases, falling property and share prices and an end to recovery as high interest rates did their worst. The markets sought to concentrate in a few days trading a process which should take several years to unfold. I sat tight, watched as my notional fund went down, and have been relieved to see it rising a few days later.

After the June big dipper, the fund is up by just over 4.5 per cent this year, and has produced a decent return of 5.3 per cent since inception last November, according to figures from FE Analytics. Its objective is to deliver annual returns three percentage points above consumer price inflation.

The idea behind a balanced fund is that the diverse asset classes owned give you some respite from a market collapse, with some assets holding up when others disappoint.

The June rout was not like that. Bonds, property-related assets and ordinary shares all went down together. After all, the sellers said, all these assets would be damaged by high interest rates, and all had benefited from the plentiful supply of cheap money, especially from the US. I have been avoiding gold, which is meant to be a haven in times of trouble. I was glad I had left it out of the portfolio so far, thinking it looked dear. Despite being considered a non-correlated asset, it has plunged with the rest of the markets , and is one of the worst performers for the year so far.

So what should we make of the situation now that the markets have rallied a bit? The sell-off was too extreme, given the fact that nothing in the US had really changed. The UK stopped quantitative easing some time ago with no adverse market consequences. The US will stop in due course, but hikes in official interest rates are still a long way off. The world has been enjoying a plentiful supply of cheap dollars, and that will reduce at some point, but the US recovery will need to be at a decent pace for QE to end.

Halting extraordinary measures should be better news than the markets thought last month. The idea is that as official creation of dollars ends, the commercial banks carry on the process of expanding the money supply at a sensible pace to facilitate recovery. It's not the end of the world as we know it. It's more the restoration of the world as it was before the crisis.

Along with the general sell-off, there has been a deterioration in the outlook for some emerging markets. We have been forcefully reminded of the political risks in countries as diverse as Egypt , Turkey and Brazil . The Chinese authorities have decided to pressurise aggressive financial institutions and banks more than the market thought comfortable . The sharp declines in some commodity prices, on the back of lower anticipated Chinese growth, worsen the outlook for commodity producers. South Africa, for example, will suffer from the much lower gold price affecting mining profits and employment.

In these conditions, I have reduced the fund's exposure to the emerging market areas, by selling half the holdings in iShares Emerging Markets (minimum volatility) and half the iShares Asia Pacific Dividend, and reinvesting proceeds in the HSBC MSCI World ETF.

So far, the advanced market shares and the property in the US and the wider developed world have been star performers, while the bonds have lost on capital what they have earned in income. I expect markets to make more progress, but it does feel as if we have seen the best of the recovery from the slump of 2008.

We should expect returns to be lower than in the recovery phase. For investors, that means keeping investing costs down is more important if returns overall are low.

From Mr Matthew Wesley.

Sir, Many thanks to Sarah O'Connor (" Note and notability ", FT Money, June 29) for her "heads up" regarding Jane Austen potentially becoming legal tender. While I would not like to debate the relative merits of Agatha Christie versus Katie Price, I believe that Miss Austen would be a worthy candidate, as of course would the Bronts (especially en bloc): but would the Bank of England then include brother Branwell? And, if not, why not? And has the Bank's Court of Directors (or whichever venerable committee is entrusted with these decisions) really given due weight to the likes of, say, Mary Shelley ( Frankenstein ); Mrs Gaskell ( Cranford , North and South etc); or George Eliot ( Middlemarch etc)? We need to be told!

All produced groundbreaking work which continues to resonate to the present day and, without wishing to be invidious, my own vote would probably be for Miss Eliot (or, rather, Miss Evans): a novelist whose insight and social consciousness rivalled - if not wholly surpassed - that of Charles Dickens (previously on the 10 note), and whose scholarship and international outlook irrevocably transformed the English novel and gave it an intellectual rigour that it had previously lacked (see, inter alia , F.R. Leavis's The Great Tradition ).

Or, if lady novelists don't cut it, why doesn't the Bank look further afield? How about Ada Lovelace, who advised Charles Babbage on his analytical engine and was one of the very first - if not the first - to consider the possibility of artificial intelligence? Or Rosalind Franklin, co-pioneer of DNA? Or, at the more picaresque end of the spectrum, why not choose Aphra Behn (17th-century playwright, courtier and spy) - or even Nell Gwyn? Why not indeed?

Don't misunderstand me: I have no wish to deny Sir Winston his legitimate place in the sun, but I do think it would be a great shame if this had to come at the expense of any of the multi-talented ladies mentioned above. For that matter, if we're on to ex-PMs, why not Clem Attlee rather than WSC? Or, if it has to be both an ex-PM and a lady, why not the late Baroness T?

Matthew Wesley,

London SE22, UK

From Ms Helen Quigley.

Sir, Your item " The List " (Life & Arts, June 29) claimed that the Queen is now the only woman to feature on a British banknote.

Not so - Mary Slessor is still happily circulating on the Clydesdale Bank's tenners.

INSIGHT
Stop worrying and breathe the zeitgeist in America

A couple of weeks ago Mark Cliffe, chief economist at ING, the Dutch banking group, attended a design conference in the US. It left him reeling. Over in Europe, as he says, corrosive pessimism has become so deeply ingrained it is barely even noticed any more; gloom is the new norm, particularly in the dismal science of economics.

Not so in the US design community. "The most striking thing for me was the contrast between the optimism of the tech crowd and the prevailing pessimism of many economists about productivity growth in general, and technology in particular," Mr Cliffe recalls.

It is a contrast I have just witnessed too. Last week I attended the Aspen Ideas Festival, an annual gathering of (mostly) American business leaders, scientists, artists and politicians, similar to the World Economic Forum in Davos. Like any talking shop, the week-long meeting - in the rarefied, beautiful mountains of Colorado - was replete with rhetorical posturing. Moreover, the audience was notably elite.

Yet, even allowing for those caveats, the zeitgeist was striking. In sharp contrast to Europe - and to earlier Aspen gatherings - nobody was talking about banks or financial regulation. Nor was there much backward-looking debate about the 2008 crisis, or recriminations about the credit bubble. Instead, the focus was forward-looking. There was obsessive interest in technology and big data. There was strong interest in educational reform and medicine. And there was extensive debate about the nature of the American political system, geopolitics and the state of the energy sector.

Not all the discussion was optimistic. Men such as Eric Cantor, House majority leader, decried the lack of bipartisan dialogue. Jack Lew, Treasury secretary, warned that sequestration was undermining growth. Hedge fund luminaries muttered that central banks were creating more market bubbles. US diplomats, military officials and Middle East leaders warned about instability in Syria, Egypt and Iran. Men such as David Rubenstein, head of Carlyle, and Bob Rubin, former Treasury secretary, noted the debilitating impact of high US unemployment and political gridlock.

But what was equally noticeable was that every note of gloom was offset by a flash of cheer. Thus, delegates heard Eric Lander, a Harvard professor, declare that a dramatic decline in the cost of human genome research is sparking medical breakthroughs. They also were told how the revolution in shale gas was cutting energy prices and sucking US manufacturing back "onshore". They listened as Andy McCaffee, a MIT professor, predicted that technology would continue to double in power every 18 months for the next few years, and as Dick Costello, Twitter chief executive, explained how social media was helping to fuel a striking - and unexpected - renaissance in quality television.

There was even optimism on the economic front. For while men such as Rubin and Rubenstein bemoaned the low pace of US growth, nobody in Aspen seemed to doubt that an expansion was taking place. Though there was hand-wringing about public debt, there was also optimism that the US could dodge the next set of debt ceiling dramas. There was a sense that sequestration and political gridlock had lost their power to shock. "There are a lot of signs that there is a real recovery under way," Mr Lew declared. Or as Mr Rubin observed, echoing a frequently expressed view: "I would rather invest in the US in the long term than any other major economy in the world."

Now this zeitgeist, it should be stressed, is that of an ultra privileged elite - and one that is increasingly detached from the poorer parts of America, as economic polarisation grows. As such, it might seem temptingly easy to dismiss. But there again, as Mr Rubin says, "markets are psychological phenomena".

And the mood swing is not found only in this rarefied air: a survey released during the meeting suggests that the public's anxiety is declining too. Although only 38 per cent of people think the US economy is "heading down the right track", this is up from 26 per cent two years ago, according to the Aspen Institute. And only 33 per cent of the public consider jobs and economic growth to be the biggest challenges today. Last year it was 52 per cent.

So, while none of this may come as any comfort to frazzled European politicians, there is a bigger message here. Sometimes investors and policy makers alike need to widen their lens, and listen to mood music from a different world. Perhaps the optimism in Aspen will turn out to be misplaced. Maybe Mr Cliffe's own sudden conversion to techno-excitement is overblown. Either way, the point to remember - as Mr Cliffe notes - is that history shows that "pessimism is cyclical"; even if the turning points are usually impossible to spot at the time.

Gas revenues have fed the Middle Eastern state's voracious appetite for acquisitions, but as the global economy recovers the state must decide whether to pursue riskier opportunities or accept that the days of sky-high returns are over

On a visit last year to Qatar Holding's headquarters, a Gulf banker stepped inside a boardroom, intrigued by what he glimpsed as he walked past. His attention fixed on a set of whiteboards, each scrawled with the names of an array of global companies. This, he suspected, was a shopping list.

Some of the companies, including Valentino, the Italian fashion label, had already been bought by other Qatari investors. So had a stake in Germany's Siemens, which was also on the boards. Printemps, a French department store, would be snapped up months later.

"It was as if there was no company that doesn't interest them," the banker says.

The wish list illustrates the seemingly unlimited ambition - and resources - of Qatar , a small Arab state that in just a few years has parlayed its enormous gas riches into an extraordinary investment portfolio. For Qatar's cash-rich sovereign wealth fund, the financial crisis proved to be a buying opportunity.

"We have cash," Ahmad al-Sayed, who on Tuesday was promoted to chief executive of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, remarked in 2009. "Cash is king."

Qatar put that cash to work securing some of the biggest deals in recent years , from the multibillion-pound capital-raising of Barclays in 2008 to last year's $76bn takeover by Glencore, the commodity trading house, of Xstrata, the mining company . And Qatar's name has popped up as a potential investor in countless other transactions, consummated or not.

The state flexed its financial muscle through a wide range of corporate and royal investments . But it is Qatar Holding, the vehicle of its sovereign wealth fund, the Qatar Investment Authority, that has upturned the investment world. As its clout increased, the QIA negotiated alongside some of the world's most powerful business and political leaders, among them Tony Blair, former UK prime minister, and Nicolas Sarkozy , France's ex-president, during sensitive transactions.

Since 2009, Qatar Holding received $30bn-$40bn a year from the state, lending it such astonishing financial power that normal rules of investing did not apply; losses could be easily absorbed and big gambles taken. It also was able to extract unusually favourable terms.

"They were providers of liquidity in an illiquid world. The opportunities for them were different from other institutions," says a western adviser. "And you don't take an idea to them without a significant return."

Yet the unique market conditions that allowed the QIA to build its investment portfolio have passed. Stock markets have rebounded strongly since the depths of the crisis and economies have stabilised. As investor confidence returns, the privately negotiated deals, generous terms and big discounts that Qatar demanded and often received may become a thing of the past.

"What happens when the world becomes more normalised? You can do deals in higher-risk countries or you have to moderate your return requirements or not spend as much money," says a western banker.

There are momentous changes within Qatar, too. It has a new emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani , who assumed power last week after his father abdicated. And growth in Qatar's liquefied natural gas exports is slowing.

Months before the dynastic transition, Qatar Holding brought in consultants including McKinsey and PwC to conduct an extensive internal review of how it operates. It was led by Mr al-Sayed, the 37-year-old lawyer who has overseen the fund's growth since 2009. The review appears to be a recognition that the young fund needs to adapt to become a more robust institution - less of an extremely well capitalised start-up and more like the investment arms of established peers in Abu Dhabi and Kuwait.

'HBJ'

But the big changes at Qatar Holding have already begun.

When Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani handed power to his 33-year-old son, it rattled the investment banking community. But it was not the emir's abdication that worried the bankers, who have raked in millions from Qatar Holding's frenzied dealmaking. Instead, they were concerned about the fate of Hamad bin Jassim , the long-time prime minister and foreign minister who resigned at the same time as the emir. They had reason to fret. Within a week, HBJ, as the billionaire is often referred to by foreigners, was out of the QIA.

HBJ set the style and tone of Qatar's investment drive. "Personalities have much more of an impact at the QIA," says a Gulf banker, comparing the fund with other sovereign vehicles in the region. "When you're setting up something new, you're setting the tone, the culture."

Sheikh Tamim, the new ruler, has long been the chairman of the QIA. His statement last week that he wanted to avoid behaviour that appeared arrogant was taken as a veiled reference to HBJ's brash style, both in politics and finance.

Some bankers worry that HBJ's departure will mean a slowdown in the pace of external investment. HBJ was the principal generator of deals, using his impressive roster of political, business and banking contacts. (Credit Suisse, in which Qatar Holding has a minority stake, has been used more than most.) Qatar, in fact, has seen "every good deal in the world almost directly", as one private equity manager puts it.

HBJ's brinkmanship, along with a diplomatic mediation by Mr Blair, clinched Glencore's takeover of Xstrata, the miner in which Qatar Holding had a stake. But the deal was completed only after Doha squeezed out a higher price.

The grandson of a pearl trader, HBJ is a contrarian and a consummate dealmaker. "With HBJ, you have seven minutes to tell him the circumstances of a deal and he'll give you a reaction in seven seconds," says a person who has done business with him. "He judges how good a deal is by how far he can push you . . . it's a culture that goes through the organisation. They leave nothing on the table."

At times, he invested personal funds in Qatar Holding deals, an example of the blurring of roles in the autocratic Gulf state.

Long-time observers in Doha say that HBJ's outsized power and his personal wealth - he is thought to be richer than the outgoing emir - made other members of the royal family uncomfortable and hastened the transition to Sheikh Tamim. It is an open secret in Doha that HBJ and Sheikha Moza , the new emir's mother, have not been on the best of terms. Analysts say that HBJ's departure was linked to the emir's abdication, giving the younger ruler the room to assert himself.

Even before the dramatic events in Doha last week, HBJ was stepping back from the fund. Although the bankers close to him will be disappointed, his departure clarifies the lines between political leaders and the state's sovereign wealth fund. This could accelerate the fund's evolution into a more professional institution.

That Mr al-Sayed, a protg of HBJ, should have replaced him came as a surprise to the financial community in Doha and beyond. It was assumed that another prominent member of the al-Thani family would be handed the job. Like his mentor, Mr al-Sayed is known for a tough negotiating style, often leaving his counterparts guessing about whether he will close a deal until the last minute.

But he is also a tireless worker and loyal servant to the al-Thanis, part of a new generation of Qataris now being promoted by the young emir. According to one person who has done business with Qatar Holding, Mr al-Sayed has also played his cards well, helping Sheikh Tamim in some private acquisitions.

Mr al-Sayed earned a master's degree in banking and financial law from Boston University. Promoted from legal counsel to chief executive of Qatar Holding in 2009, he came in, as one banker says, "on the ground floor" and rode the recovery cycle. People close to the fund say that it has delivered upward of 17 per cent a year in average returns since 2009.

But gauging the success of Qatar Holding's deals is not straightforward because their financial structures are often not disclosed. Bankers say that a majority of its investments are not the high-profile deals but in undisclosed trading of shares.

Some of the fund's biggest investments have done very well, including its participation in the Barclays cash calls of 2008, which netted about 1.7bn after the staged sale of its warrants in the British bank, according to Reuters estimates. The fund still holds 6.7 per cent of Barclays.

Its bet on the merger of Glencore and Xstrata has also paid off. The value of its stake has more than doubled, according to Financial Times calculations.

However, some of its other deals do not look so bright. Shares in Iberdrola, the Spanish utility, are down 22 per cent since March 2011 when the fund took a 6.2 per cent stake. Its stake in Hochtief, the German construction group, may have also lost value as the shares have sunk more than 13 per cent since it declared its 9.1 per cent stake in December 2010.

Mr al-Sayed's future is now secure. "He's the guy who for the last four years has been leading it day-to-day, so his promotion means continuity, no disruption, particularly as Sheikh Tamim has been the chairman of QIA," says a senior western banker. "Now Ahmad has to go only to Tamim. In a way it will make things smoother."

The Doctor

People who have had dealings with the fund say the top job at Qatar Holding was slated to go to Hussein Ali al-Abdullah, a QIA board member in his 50s. In investment circles, he is known simply as "the Doctor" and was also a mentor to Mr al-Sayed. He is considered to be the founder of Qatar's sovereign wealth fund, arguing for the need for a nest egg for Qatar's 300,000 nationals - and to prepare for when the gas riches run out.

Considered a calm, wise hand, Mr al-Abdullah has preferred to maintain an oversight role rather than thrust himself into the daily management that keeps Mr al-Sayed busy until late into the night. He too is staying on as a board member of the QIA.

It was the Doctor who declared last year that the investment strategy of Qatar Holding could be summarised in two words: "No strategy". The statement encapsulates perfectly the fund's single-minded pursuit of deals.

To a large extent, the fund's investments have been driven by a simplistic rationale.

Qatar Holding made its mark in London in part because it is a market in which the royals feel comfortable. The same could be said for the Volkswagen-Porsche deal in 2009 that put Qatar Holding on the map.

Goldman Sachs was the first to suggest that Qatar buy into Porsche in the spring of that year as the car company was engaged in a heated feud with VW. But HBJ's interest is thought to have already been piqued by a meeting with a member of Porsche's board.

As with London property, there was a personal magnetism at work. HBJ loved Porsche cars, as does Mr al-Sayed, who led the negotiations on the transaction. As the battle between Porsche and VW raged on, Credit Suisse, Qatar Holding's adviser, suggested a bolder plan: that the two companies merge. The idea captured HBJ's imagination.

He travelled to Germany for high-level talks, including a meeting with Angela Merkel, chancellor, while Mr al-Sayed negotiated with provincial officials and company executives.

"They [the Qataris] took a gamble on recovery, and they won - they rode out the storm and are now making money hand over fist," says a banker who was involved in the deal. In June this year, Qatar Holding sold its 10 per cent stake in Porsche back to the owning families, rounding off the Qatari role in the complex merger.

The VW-Porsche deal reflected the image of Qatar that the al-Thanis were looking to project - that Arab hydrocarbons wealth could be deployed shrewdly.

It is a matter of national pride that Qatar Holding has taken board seats at big companies, from the owners of Heathrow and Canary Wharf in the UK to Credit Suisse and Volkswagen, making decisions that are relevant to some of the world's most prominent companies. The board seats are seen as a way to groom the next generation that is now taking over.

Hard bargaining

Qatar Holding's hard bargaining worked at a time when there were few other investors looking to take on risk. But the fund has also developed a reputation as a difficult partner that would be best avoided - particularly when it comes to property deals. When the fund bought buildings directly, it was criticised by other property investors for over-negotiating and bullying sellers.

"They don't buy property like anyone else; they treat it like corporate M&A," says the head of one of the world's largest property fund managers. "Everyone negotiates hard but there are very few deals when one party literally walks away hoping they never see the other again."

Qatar's drive for higher yield may also have drawn attention for the wrong reasons. In the UK, the Serious Fraud Office is investigating certain "commercial agreements" between Barclays and Qatar Holding in 2008. (The fund denies any wrongdoing).

In France, where it has widespread real estate investments, Qatar's dealmaking has stirred political controversy. In 2008, Mr Sarkozy, then president, pushed for a law exempting Qatari real estate investments from capital gains taxes, so eager was Paris for more Qatari funding. But when Doha sought to invest in the capital's suburbs, there was an outcry that the Gulf state was buying influence among France's restive Muslim youths.

The Qataris met their match while haggling over Harrods, one of London's great brands. The fund spent a year negotiating for the 1.5bn purchase of the luxury retailer from Mohamed al-Fayed, the Egyptian tycoon . This time, it was Mr al-Fayed who threatened to pull out.

Mr al-Fayed tried to sell the store without the underlying real estate, a proposal dismissed by the Qataris. He attempted to throw his Fulham Football Club into the mix but the Qataris wanted the Ritz in Paris instead.

"The Harrods negotiation was tough and mercurial throughout. They - al-Sayed and Fayed - were both mad as mongeese," says one banker who was involved in the deal.

Even within the oil-rich Gulf, where sovereign wealth funds from Kuwait to Abu Dhabi are powerful international financiers, Qatar Holding and its parent, the QIA, are unusual vehicles. It is now in the midst of the internal review to move on to what a person close to the fund calls "the next stage."

The fund needs to determine exactly what kind of investment group it wants to be. Qatari officials hate being described as having "deep pockets", saying it insinuates that they are willing to overpay for assets. (Some bankers say this is true in some cases.) Instead, says one former staff member, the objective is to be thought of as a big private equity group, such as a Blackstone or a KKR.

There are some similarities. Although Qatar Holding says it had no debt at the end of 2012, bankers say it used debt in some deals to maximise returns and manage liquidity. "Sometimes they use it to hit a mythical returns number. They just like to use other people's money," says one banker.

Qatar Holding has often asked its bankers to assemble deal structures with ample downside protection, whether through warrants, debt funding from the banks or companies targeted for acquisition or high yielding convertible bonds.

The long game

Compared with other Gulf funds, the QIA's size, agility and investment style seem like a private equity group. The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority is a 1,400-strong bureaucracy and invests the bulk of its assets in externally managed index-tracking funds; it acts more like a pension fund. The Kuwait Investment Authority has a staff of about 475 across Kuwait, Beijing and London.

In contrast, Qatar Holding is exceedingly thin, with only 40 professional staff even though it has accumulated more than $100bn in assets during the past four years.

But Qatar Holding has an advantage over private equity firms. It is, in essence, accountable only to one shareholder - the emir - and it can act as a longer-term investor.

Staying lean has worked well for the fund so far. But for all the advantages of not having to get approval for deals through a chain of bureaucracy, as at ADIA, there are signs it is time for Qatar Holding to create a more formal structure.

At Qatar Holding, decision making is so centralised that its bankers never call the shots. And like many employees in Qatar their movements in and out of the country are controlled by their employers in an archaic labour system.

"You can't get a piece of paper signed without Ahmad deciding, which creates bottlenecks," says a senior banker. "But that's the system, it's not a democracy," he adds.

Anthony Armstrong, a high-flying American banker at Credit Suisse, was seconded to the fund after advising Qatar Holding on the complex VW-Porsche acquisition. He came to Qatar expecting to oversee some of the biggest deals of the financial crisis. But, according to people close to him, he felt powerless and could not wait for his 18-month stint to finish.

Frustrated, Mr Armstrong took a business trip home and never returned. He was not available for comment. But he is one of several people who left the fund in the early stages, reflecting what they said was an internal chaos that undermined the fund's potential.

People close to Mr al-Sayed dismiss such criticism, arguing that he might be a hard-driving manager but that the atmosphere in Qatar Holding is friendly and staff turnover low. But management is waking up to calls for a more institutionalised fund. Qatar Holding is seeking a rating that would bring a measure of transparency. It is also expected to focus more on infrastructure and commodities investments, hoping to generate steady streams of cash flow.

The biggest challenge, however, could be a shift in the investment climate. Having dominated the inward investment market for London property since the start of the financial crisis, Qatar has been overtaken in the past six months by a new wave of sovereign wealth interest, most notably from Norway and Malaysia.

In banking too, Qatar recently discovered, with its stake in Russia's VTB, that it is in a different position from a few years ago. The Qataris had hoped to finance all of VTB's capital needs but their allocation came second to Norges, the Norwegian pension fund.

For most investors, navigating through the financial crisis was a struggle for survival. For cash-flush Qatar Holding, it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Only today, with the combination of a stronger global economy and the waning influence of its dominant figure, HBJ, will it face its real test.

But for a small state that realises that the source of its success is finite, there is no question that it will continue to scour the globe for places to put its cash. As one Qatari official once put it: "If we spend all our money in Qatar, every Qatari would have a house on the moon."

The Shard

A vanity project that soars empty above London's skyline

In financing The Shard in 2008, Qatar achieved one of its main goals: recognition .

A potent symbol of intent in any market, western Europe's tallest skyscraper - built in the depths of the financial crisis - became one of the world's most talked about properties before the first storey was complete. Financed by a consortium of state-backed Qatari funds, it was, many argued, little more than a vanity project; an economically flawed blight on the London skyline .

Today, almost a year after completion, The Shard, right, is giving its critics reason to feel vindicated: costing about 1.5bn, the glassy spire rises empty but for a scattering of mostly Qatari-backed tenants.

It is because of this, and similar deals that have done more to raise profile than returns, that the tiny state is desperate to shake off its image as a deep-pocketed trophy hunter.

The push towards commercialisation reflects Qatar's need to distinguish itself from the wash of sovereign wealth funds that have poured into the property market in the past three years.

In 2011 Qatar was the largest overseas investor in UK property, spending more than 1bn on a spread of deals that included buying almost 1,500 apartments used to house athletes during the London Olympics. By the end of 2012, spending just 680m, it had slipped behind the newly aggressive sovereign wealth funds of Norway, Malaysia and China, according to data from Real Capital Analytics.

"In their heyday, when the rest of the investment world was lying down, they were a young fund with a lot of ambition and firepower to match," says a person who has worked on Qatar-funded deals. "They had the market to themselves . . . but the investment case was as much to do with political gain as commercial logic."

Those close to Qatar suggest the slowdown in spending is symptomatic of the peninsula's transition towards becoming business-minded.

Apart from reining in dealmaking, its ruling officials are looking at centralising the property investing process.

The move, which would mark a departure from the complex network of investment vehicles it has used to trade property, was given added credence by the announcement this week that Ahmad al-Sayed, the head of Qatar Holding, the state's direct investment arm, will also run the Qatar Investment Authority, its parent.

"They are evolving, but as the world becomes more efficient, they are having to rethink the kind of deals they want to do and the kind of image that they want to present," says an investment banker close to the QIA.

The team steering the QIA

Sheikh Tamim, 33, is the second son of the former emir and Sheikha Moza. Educated at Sherborne and Sandhurst, the new emir's career grew from the military into local roles in sports, technology and education. Sheikh Tamim is expected to refocus attention away from international affairs back on to Qatar's domestic scene.

Ahmad al-Sayed, 37, QIA chief executive. The new CEO was promoted to the role after steering Qatar Holding, its direct investment arm, through the financial crisis. He is a technocrat who has ascended the ranks from his role as a legal adviser. Mr al-Sayed studied banking and financial law at Boston University and also has an executive MBA.

Sheikh Abdullah bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, 25, QIA vice-chairman. His appointment marks another promotion for the second son of the former emir's third wife. Three years after graduating from Georgetown's Doha campus, the low-profile royal runs the ruler's court and has taken several board positions, including with Vodafone Qatar.

Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim al-Thani, 53, former chief executive of the QIA. He has been the former emir's right-hand man since aiding the palace coup of 1995. As foreign minister and prime minister, his business acumen and diplomatic savvy raised the country's profile as a go-to investor and regional mediator. But his interests also stirred disgruntlement.

Hussain al-Abdulla, 56, QIA board member. Known as "the Doctor" - a nod to his PhD - he has dedicated his long career to Qatar's public finances. Gaining a foothold at the QIA as an executive board member under the former chief executive, he came through the government bureaucracy, starting in the economics department of the emir's office in the early 1980s.

Ali Sherif al-Emadi, QIA board member. As chief executive of Qatar National Bank, the US-educated Mr Emadi served as an understudy to Youssef Kamal, the experienced finance minister and QNB chairman. Mr al-Emadi's brother is also married to Mr Kamal's daughter, making the transition to a younger generation another family affair.

But gauging the success of Qatar Holding s deals is not straightforward because their financial structures are often not disclosed. Bankers say that a majority of its investments are not the high-profile deals but in undisclosed trading of shares.

Some of the fund s biggest investments have done very well, including its participation in the Barclays cash calls of 2008, which netted about 1.7bn after the staged sale of its warrants in the British bank, according to Reuters estimates. The fund still holds 6.7 per cent of Barclays.

Its bet on the merger of Glencore and Xstrata has also paid off. The value of its stake has more than doubled, according to Financial Times calculations.

However, some of its other deals do not look so bright. Shares in Iberdrola, the Spanish utility, are down 22 per cent since March 2011 when the fund took a 6.2 per cent stake. Its stake in Hochtief, the German construction group, may have also lost value as the shares have sunk more than 13 per cent since it declared its 9.1 per cent stake in December 2010.

Mr al-Sayed s future is now secure.  He s the guy who for the last four years has been leading it day-to-day, so his promotion means continuity, no disruption, particularly as Sheikh Tamim has been the chairman of QIA,  says a senior western banker.  Now Ahmad has to go only to Tamim. In a way it will make things smoother. 

The Doctor

People who have had dealings with the fund say the top job at Qatar Holding was slated to go to Hussein Ali al-Abdullah, a QIA board member in his 50s. In investment circles, he is known simply as  the Doctor  and was also a mentor to Mr al-Sayed. He is considered to be the founder of Qatar s sovereign wealth fund, arguing for the need for a nest egg for Qatar s 300,000 nationals   and to prepare for when the gas riches run out.

Considered a calm, wise hand, Mr al-Abdullah has preferred to maintain an oversight role rather than thrust himself into the daily management that keeps Mr al-Sayed busy until late into the night. He too is staying on as a board member of the QIA.

It was the Doctor who declared last year that the investment strategy of Qatar Holding could be summarised in two words:  No strategy . The statement encapsulates perfectly the fund s single-minded pursuit of deals.

To a large extent, the fund s investments have been driven by a simplistic rationale.

Qatar Holding made its mark in London in part because it is a market in which the royals feel comfortable. The same could be said for the Volkswagen-Porsche deal in 2009 that put Qatar Holding on the map.

Goldman Sachs was the first to suggest that Qatar buy into Porsche in the spring of that year as the car company was engaged in a heated feud with VW. But HBJ s interest is thought to have already been piqued by a meeting with a member of Porsche s board.

As with London property, there was a personal magnetism at work. HBJ loved Porsche cars, as does Mr al-Sayed, who led the negotiations on the transaction. As the battle between Porsche and VW raged on, Credit Suisse, Qatar Holding s adviser, suggested a bolder plan: that the two companies merge. The idea captured HBJ s imagination.

He travelled to Germany for high-level talks, including a meeting with Angela Merkel, chancellor, while Mr al-Sayed negotiated with provincial officials and company executives.

 They [the Qataris] took a gamble on recovery, and they won   they rode out the storm and are now making money hand over fist,  says a banker who was involved in the deal. In June this year, Qatar Holding sold its 10 per cent stake in Porsche back to the owning families, rounding off the Qatari role in the complex merger.

The VW-Porsche deal reflected the image of Qatar that the al-Thanis were looking to project   that Arab hydrocarbons wealth could be deployed shrewdly.

It is a matter of national pride that Qatar Holding has taken board seats at big companies, from the owners of Heathrow and Canary Wharf in the UK to Credit Suisse and Volkswagen, making decisions that are relevant to some of the world s most prominent companies. The board seats are seen as a way to groom the next generation that is now taking over.

Hard bargaining

Qatar Holding s hard bargaining worked at a time when there were few other investors looking to take on risk. But the fund has also developed a reputation as a difficult partner that would be best avoided   particularly when it comes to property deals. When the fund bought buildings directly, it was criticised by other property investors for over-negotiating and bullying sellers.

 They don t buy property like anyone else; they treat it like corporate M&A,  says the head of one of the world s largest property fund managers.  Everyone negotiates hard but there are very few deals when one party literally walks away hoping they never see the other again. 

Qatar s drive for higher yield may also have drawn attention for the wrong reasons. In the UK, the Serious Fraud Office is investigating certain  commercial agreements  between Barclays and Qatar Holding in 2008. (The fund denies any wrongdoing).

In France, where it has widespread real estate investments, Qatar s dealmaking has stirred political controversy. In 2008, Mr Sarkozy, then president, pushed for a law exempting Qatari real estate investments from capital gains taxes, so eager was Paris for more Qatari funding. But when Doha sought to invest in the capital s suburbs, there was an outcry that the Gulf state was buying influence among France s restive Muslim youths.

The Qataris met their match while haggling over Harrods, one of London s great brands. The fund spent a year negotiating for the 1.5bn purchase of the luxury retailer from Mohamed al-Fayed, the Egyptian tycoon. This time, it was Mr al-Fayed who threatened to pull out.

Mr al-Fayed tried to sell the store without the underlying real estate, a proposal dismissed by the Qataris. He attempted to throw his Fulham Football Club into the mix but the Qataris wanted the Ritz in Paris instead.

 The Harrods negotiation was tough and mercurial throughout. They   al-Sayed and Fayed   were both mad as mongeese,  says one banker who was involved in the deal.

Even within the oil-rich Gulf, where sovereign wealth funds from Kuwait to Abu Dhabi are powerful international financiers, Qatar Holding and its parent, the QIA, are unusual vehicles. It is now in the midst of the internal review to move on to what a person close to the fund calls  the next stage. 

The fund needs to determine exactly what kind of investment group it wants to be. Qatari officials hate being described as having  deep pockets , saying it insinuates that they are willing to overpay for assets. (Some bankers say this is true in some cases.) Instead, says one former staff member, the objective is to be thought of as a big private equity group, such as a Blackstone or a KKR.

There are some similarities. Although Qatar Holding says it had no debt at the end of 2012, bankers say it used debt in some deals to maximise returns and manage liquidity.  Sometimes they use it to hit a mythical returns number. They just like to use other people s money,  says one banker.

Qatar Holding has often asked its bankers to assemble deal structures with ample downside protection, whether through warrants, debt funding from the banks or companies targeted for acquisition or high yielding convertible bonds.

The long game

Compared with other Gulf funds, the QIA s size, agility and investment style seem like a "http://www.ft.com/indepth/privateequity". The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority is a 1,400-strong bureaucracy and invests the bulk of its assets in externally managed index-tracking funds; it acts more like a pension fund. The Kuwait Investment Authority has a staff of about 475 across Kuwait, Beijing and London.

In contrast, Qatar Holding is exceedingly thin, with only 40 professional staff even though it has accumulated more than $100bn in assets during the past four years.

But Qatar Holding has an advantage over private equity firms. It is, in essence, accountable only to one shareholder   the emir   and it can act as a longer-term investor.

Staying lean has worked well for the fund so far. But for all the advantages of not having to get approval for deals through a chain of bureaucracy, as at ADIA, there are signs it is time for Qatar Holding to create a more formal structure.

At Qatar Holding, decision making is so centralised that its bankers never call the shots. And like many employees in Qatar their movements in and out of the country are controlled by their employers in an archaic labour system.

 You can t get a piece of paper signed without Ahmad deciding, which creates bottlenecks,  says a senior banker.  But that s the system, it s not a democracy,  he adds.

Anthony Armstrong, a high-flying American banker at Credit Suisse, was seconded to the fund after advising Qatar Holding on the complex VW-Porsche acquisition. He came to Qatar expecting to oversee some of the biggest deals of the financial crisis. But, according to people close to him, he felt powerless and could not wait for his 18-month stint to finish.

Frustrated, Mr Armstrong took a business trip home and never returned. He was not available for comment. But he is one of several people who left the fund in the early stages, reflecting what they said was an internal chaos that undermined the fund s potential.

People close to Mr al-Sayed dismiss such criticism, arguing that he might be a hard-driving manager but that the atmosphere in Qatar Holding is friendly and staff turnover low. But management is waking up to calls for a more institutionalised fund. Qatar Holding is seeking a rating that would bring a measure of transparency. It is also expected to focus more on infrastructure and commodities investments, hoping to generate steady streams of cash flow.

The biggest challenge, however, could be a shift in the investment climate. Having dominated the inward investment market for London property since the start of the financial crisis, Qatar has been overtaken in the past six months by a new wave of sovereign wealth interest, most notably from Norway and Malaysia.

In banking too, Qatar recently discovered, with its stake in Russia s VTB, that it is in a different position from a few years ago. The Qataris had hoped to finance all of VTB s capital needs but their allocation came second to Norges, the Norwegian pension fund.

For most investors, navigating through the financial crisis was a struggle for survival. For cash-flush Qatar Holding, it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Only today, with the combination of a stronger global economy and the waning influence of its dominant figure, HBJ, will it face its real test.

But for a small state that realises that the source of its success is finite, there is no question that it will continue to scour the globe for places to put its cash. As one Qatari official once put it:  If we spend all our money in Qatar, every Qatari would have a house on the moon. 

The Shard: A vanity project that soars empty above London s skyline

In financing "http://the-shard.com/" in 2008, Qatar achieved one of its main goals: recognition.

A potent symbol of intent in any market, western Europe s tallest skyscraper   built in the depths of the financial crisis   became one of the world s most talked about properties before the first storey was complete. Financed by a consortium of state-backed Qatari funds, it was, many argued, little more than a vanity project; an economically flawed blight on the London skyline.

Today, almost a year after completion, The Shard is giving its critics reason to feel vindicated: costing about 1.5bn, the glassy spire rises empty but for a scattering of mostly Qatari-backed tenants.

It is because of this, and similar deals that have done more to raise profile than returns, that the tiny state is desperate to shake off its image as a deep-pocketed trophy hunter.

The push towards commercialisation reflects Qatar s need to distinguish itself from the wash of sovereign wealth funds that have poured into the property market in the past three years.

In 2011 Qatar was the largest overseas investor in UK property, spending more than 1bn on a spread of deals that included buying almost 1,500 apartments used to house athletes during the London Olympics. By the end of 2012, spending just 680m, it had slipped behind the newly aggressive sovereign wealth funds of Norway, Malaysia and China, according to data from Real Capital Analytics.

 In their heyday, when the rest of the investment world was lying down, they were a young fund with a lot of ambition and firepower to match,  says a person who has worked on Qatar-funded deals.  They had the market to themselves 	. 	. 	. 	but the investment case was as much to do with political gain as commercial logic. 

Those close to Qatar suggest the slowdown in spending is symptomatic of the peninsula s transition towards becoming business-minded.

Apart from reining in dealmaking, its ruling officials are looking at centralising the property investing process.

The move, which would mark a departure from the complex network of investment vehicles it has used to trade property, was given added credence by the announcement this week that Ahmad al-Sayed, the head of Qatar Holding, the state s direct investment arm, will also run the Qatar Investment Authority, its parent.

 They are evolving, but as the world becomes more efficient, they are having to rethink the kind of deals they want to do and the kind of image that they want to present,  says an investment banker close to the QIA.

Corrections & Amplifications

Apple Inc. sold 136 million iPhones in 2012. A Heard on the Street column Tuesday incorrectly said it sold 261 million iPhones in the year.

(WSJA July 2, 2013)

(END)

Where Apple's Next Big Leap Forward Will Emerge

Apple is yet to tap the world's biggest pool of potential iPhone buyers: China Mobile's customers. That is set to change. When and how will help determine whether the U.S. technology company's flagging stock can regain momentum.

At about $395 at the end of last week, Apple's shares had fallen 44% from an all-time high last September. Once the most valuable company in the world by market capitalization, it recently ceded that crown back to Exxon Mobil. Adjusted for net cash, its market cap also has just been surpassed by archrival Google.

A big concern for Apple is that the tailwind from increasing distribution for its most lucrative product has dissipated. When the iPhone launched in 2007, it was sold by just one carrier, AT&T, in just one country, the U.S. That is up to 275 carriers in 114 countries, says Strategy Analytics.

The most glaring omission is China Mobile, the world's largest wireless carrier with more than 700 million subscribers, including about 80 million wealthier ones that can afford Apple's pricey smartphone, estimates HSBC analyst Tucker Grinnan. And of that elite group, more than half may be likely buyers of the iPhone, considering Apple's market share of high-end smartphone sales in China is 55%, according to HSBC. Indeed, more than 20 million of China Mobile's customers already use "unlocked" versions of the iPhone on the carrier's aging 2G network.

For Apple, which sold 261 million iPhones in 2012, those extra tens of millions of potential unit sales represent a big opportunity. Pressure is increasing, too, as Apple's market share for all smartphones in China, high- and low-end, fell to 9% in the first quarter, from 13% a year earlier, according to Strategy Analytics.

So Apple investors have anxiously awaited some sort of deal, especially since the fall 2012 launch of iPhone 5, which is the first model that is compatible with China Mobile's 3G network technology.

One reason a deal hasn't been struck may be that China Mobile's controlling shareholder, the Chinese government, doesn't want the company to offer the iPhone yet. Allowing the biggest fish in China's telecom sector to carry Apple's popular device might lead to further market concentration. A problem on Apple's side, meanwhile, may be that it doesn't want users subjected to a relatively poor experience. China Mobile's version of 3G technology, called TD-SCDMA, is less reliable than those supported by smaller rivals China Telecom and China Unicom.

Still, several factors suggest the companies will strike a deal eventually. First, China Mobile is planning to rapidly roll out its next generation "TD-LTE" network. The iPhone is compatible with that technology as well, which will offer much faster data speeds for users. And Beijing wants to promote the technology world-wide because Chinese companies like Huawei sell supporting equipment. With a $31 billion capital-expenditure budget for 2013, nearly as much as AT&T's and Verizon Communications' combined, China Mobile already is a big buyer of TD-LTE equipment. Getting the iPhone onto that standard would give it additional momentum.

Meanwhile, the risk of fostering additional market concentration may be mitigated later this year if, as some expect, Beijing allows consumers to keep their numbers when they switch networks.

One potential sticking point in formulating a deal is high smartphone subsidies. To date, Apple's significant market power has enabled it to extract sweet deals whereby carriers subsidize much of the iPhone's cost. They do so because they can get subscribers locked into expensive wireless plans.

But the big financial hit that Apple's terms appear to have inflicted on rivals won't have been lost on China Mobile. China Unicom was the first Chinese carrier to get the iPhone, in late 2009. But its accounts show that from that year through 2011, while absolute operating profit in its mobile business rose, the margin fell to 27% from 37%. And China Mobile likely has a strong negotiating position due to its size and Apple's need to reignite momentum.

A wild card is the lower-end iPhone that Apple is working on. This could actually help the two companies reach a deal because it would enable China Mobile to attract customers in the fast-expanding lower end of the market while likely not breaking the bank in terms of subsidies. For Apple, the profit impact is less clear because it also may eat into sales of more lucrative high-end devices, eroding margins.

So how important is China Mobile to Apple? It has historically made percentage gross margins on the iPhone in the mid-50s, says Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi. Even assuming Apple makes only a 40% gross margin on iPhones sold through China Mobile, taking into account the latter's potential negotiating leverage, selling 25 million more iPhones in the first year could mean an extra $6 billion of gross profit. Analysts forecast Apple's gross profit at $69 billion for the year ending in September 2014.

With technology and strategic aims increasingly aligned, for the iPhone and China Mobile, it still is a question of when, not if. A revolutionary new product could always be in the works at Apple. But a deal in China represents one of its biggest potential profit bumps on the immediate horizon.

Defensive Stocks Won't

Shield Investors in U.S.

A rising stock market has always been a sign investors are taking on more risk. What made the recently stalled rally odd are the types of stocks where that risk-taking was concentrated. From the start of the year to its peak on May 21 -- the day before U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke intimated that the central bank might begin to scale back its bond-buying program this fall -- the S&P 500 rose 17%.

But stocks that traditionally have been regarded as safe did better. A market-weighted index of defensive sectors of the S&P 500 rose 19.2% over the same period. An index of the remaining, more cyclically sensitive companies rose just 16.4%.

Usually in bull markets, investors get enticed into cyclical stocks because these are companies that, as long as the economy is growing, are seen as having a much better chance of generating big earnings gains.

This time, partly on concerns about how well the economy would weather tighter fiscal policy, and partly because of a hunger for alternatives to low-yielding bonds, investors piled into defensive stocks.

In the process, those stocks got less safe. Indeed, a Credit Suisse HOLT analysis shows when Mr. Bernanke spoke, defensive stocks were trading at some of their stiffest premiums to their more cyclical counterparts, on the basis of future projected cash flows, in the past 20 years. Small wonder, then, that they fell more sharply. Through Thursday, defensives fell 3.9% since the market peak versus a 3% drop for cyclicals.

Yet, looking at relative implied discount rates -- which help put a price on expected future cash flows -- the Credit Suisse analysis implies investors are paying a 1.57 percentage point premium for defensive stocks relative to cyclicals, versus a historical average of 0.36 point. It is hard to see that situation continuing if, as seems likely, the economy gains ground in the year's latter half.

If the economy does improve, the Fed in all likelihood will begin moderating its bond purchases. That might not provoke another sharp leg up in long-term rates. But it certainly suggests that the days of the 10-year Treasury yielding less than 2% are a thing of the past. Income-oriented investors' need to find some alternative to bonds has, in turn, gotten a little less intense.

So the two things propping up defensive stocks -- worries about economic growth and ultralow long-term interest rates -- are getting kicked away, setting up a rotation into more cyclical stocks. It is time to play offense.

Banking is heading towards its Spotify moment

Banks are changing dramatically amid an avalanche of regulatory change and widespread debt reduction. They will be safer and, sadly for users of bank services, costlier as a result. Yet, all of this may soon seem somewhat irrelevant, because technology could transform the way banking works far more profoundly.

Banking is very " digitisable ". Cash is the only part of the industry that is inherently physical and that is a tiny part of what a bank does. The rest is really about transferring and modifying property rights and information of various sorts, all of which can be digitised. Of course banks have invested huge sums in technology - automating processes and enabling customers to bank online - but we have not yet seen the fundamental transformation of business models that have taken place in other sectors, such as music.

It will happen and when it does, it will have a huge impact. Some of the consequences are clear from other industries. Intermediaries disappear or get marginalised unless they discover new ways of adding value. Look at what has happened to recorded music companies or book shops. Banks are the primary intermediaries of the financial world, so their margins will fall unless they reinvent what they offer their customers and how they work.

In the digital world, things work differently. Scale and network effects drive competitive advantage. Winners tend to take all, as Google and eBay demonstrate. Discrete products get turned into bundled services. Customers of Spotify, a music service, do not buy recordings of individual songs - they buy a subscription to a cloud-based archive.

Perhaps surprisingly, the transparency of the internet does not always lead to the disaggregation of bundles and the disappearance of cross-subsidies. Things get pulled apart and put together in different ways. Monetisation, costs and customer value can be even more often disconnected than in the physical world. New business models will emerge, as we have already seen: Lending Club's peer-to-peer model is changing personal lending. Some will thrive, many will fail.

Above all, customers will benefit enormously. Greater transparency will mean better prices for customers. Digital delivery will mean never having to go to a branch. More information and more flexible service configurations will put the customer in control.

Why is it happening so slowly compared to other industries? Part of the answer lies in the banks themselves. Contrary to what many believe, banks are extremely risk-averse. They do not like failing - and it is almost impossible to innovate unless you are prepared to fail. In a context where trust is so important, and where there is increasingly little tolerance of any kind of failure, that is extremely difficult.

But regulation is an even more powerful impediment - and not only because "financial innovation" is a four-letter word in banking supervision circles. Technology-driven innovation that leads to big winners and big losers, that replaces established products with flexible service bundles, that overturns established business models and blurs the boundaries of banking, and that sometimes fails to deliver quite what was intended, does not fit well with today's regulatory zeitgeist.

To be fair to the regulators, it is not like banks are straining at the leash. Mostly they are investing in technology to meet ever-increasing regulatory demands, or to reduce costs. There is relatively little investment in innovation that offers major changes in customer experience. The prevailing "zero tolerance" environment is toxic to new ideas. Moreover cybersecurity and privacy issues are becoming ever more acute. The more finance becomes digital, the more important it is to prevent intrusion, disruption and digital theft.

Yet, despite such challenges, and whether they like it or not, banks and their regulators are going to have to embrace technology-driven innovation. Otherwise it will simply happen by stealth, driven by players outside the industry. We have already seen examples such as M-Pesa, the mobile payments solution pioneered in Kenya, the ubiquitous PayPal or most recently Bitcoin - the online currency. Given the scale of customer benefits, and the scope to seize competitive advantage, there are huge prizes for those who can innovate successfully. Too much of the debate about banking is about not repeating the mistakes of the past. We risk missing the opportunity to make banks much better in the future.

We are stepping up the pace of innovation at the bank I run: generating more ideas, implementing them more swiftly, being quicker to discard the ones that do not work. By making everything digital, exploiting the power of big data and the ubiquity of mobile communications, we see huge opportunities to enhance the value to our customers, to increase efficiency and to manage our risks more effectively. The upsides are huge, and the downsides are stark. That is why accelerating technology-driven innovation is a top priority.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Putnam keeps faith with risk; Fund focus

Despite a drop, the asset manager continues to back its Total Return strategy, says Matthew Jeynes

Putnam Investments has suffered sharp short-term losses on its Total Return strategy, which aims to deliver a positive result regardless of the state of global markets.

The US-based asset manager, which is part of Canada Life, the insurer, has offered the Putnam Total Return fund to global investors via its Dublin-based fund range since June 2006.

Six months ago the group's UK-based Canada Life Investments unit also launched a CF Canlife Total Return product as a "feeder fund" into the Dublin-based "absolute return" strategy.

Data from FE Analytics show that fund, which aims to beat cash by 5 percentage points a year, reported a loss of 4.5 per cent in the month to June 20.

The Total Return strategy typically holds more than 500 individual stocks as part of a complex risk-focused investment process.

Jason Vaillancourt, co-head of global asset allocation at Putnam Investments, says the fund has a large weighting in global high-yield bonds, reflecting a positive view on credit. He says the team also has a weighting in emerging-market bonds.

Last month, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, sent global markets into a tailspin by announcing that the central bank is considering scaling back its quantitative easing bond-buying programme by the end of 2013.

Mr Bernanke also said the Fed's current QE programme of buying up assets to pump money into the economy could be halted entirely next year.

Coupled with recent jitters over the Chinese economy , the announcement sent risk assets such as credit into the red.

However, Mr Vaillancourt says global high-yield investments remain attractive and he continues to believe that US monetary policy will remain supportive for investors.

"The last time spreads were like this, the cash flow, balance sheets and leverage of the companies was much worse," he says.

The manager expects the Fed's QE programme to continue in some form due to fears of disinflation, which he says can be seen "if you look at core consumer price index numbers".

Recently, US data showed that the rate of inflation in the year to May was 1.4 per cent, higher than the 1.1 per cent recorded in April, but still below the Fed's 2 per cent target.

The last time inflation hit 2 per cent was in February, and it has been below target for 10 of the past 13 months.

Mr Vaillancourt says: "If you look at implied inflation in the [inflation-linked] market around the world, these assets are trading at the top end of the range that we have seen them in the past 10 years or so, but quantitative easing has been focused on trying to stave off deflation, given the indebtedness of governments and households."

The Putnam team has been concentrating on stockpicking - selecting quality investments rather than focusing on macroeconomic newsflow - in the equity portion of the portfolio.

Mr Vaillancourt adds: "We have put more risk into the stockpicking in the fund because correlations in the market have started to decline quite a lot in the past six months or so.

"We have tended to favour the US, and we are underweight emerging markets, but we follow a bottom-up stockpicking strategy, so we have no real sector preferences."

Regulators Reach a Capital Accord --- Fed, FDIC and OCC Agree to Boost Leverage Measure After Months of Dispute; Votes Expected Soon

By Michael R. Crittenden

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve will vote next week to finalize capital rules for U.S. banks after regulators agreed to resolve a separate issue that had delayed action.

After months of dispute, officials at the Fed, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency have agreed to increase one measure of the biggest banks' ability to operate in times of stress. Banking regulators soon will propose requiring banks to increase the amount of equity they hold against assets, known as the "leverage ratio."

The issue has divided U.S. officials, delaying action on broader international capital rules agreed to by global regulators in 2010 and revised in 2011.

Some officials at the FDIC have been pushing for a much higher leverage ratio than Fed officials believed necessary. The debate has been complicated by the uncertain status of Richard Cordray, who heads the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and also is a member of the FDIC's five-member board. Mr. Cordray was installed by President Barack Obama in a recess appointment, and recent legal challenges have raised the specter that his appointment, and any votes he casts at the FDIC, could be invalidated.

That has given more bargaining power to the FDIC's two Republican members, Thomas Hoenig and Jeremiah Norton, who favor a higher leverage ratio than the 3% originally proposed by regulators. The FDIC has used the need to get Messrs. Hoenig and Norton on board as a bargaining tool in its discussions with the Fed.

Regulators have broadly agreed on a higher leverage ratio and are expected to soon propose a ratio of between 5% and 6% from the current 3% level, according to people familiar with the talks.

That agreement breaks an impasse that has made the U.S. one of the last major international players to implement the international capital framework agreed upon by regulators, generally known as Basel III. The FDIC and OCC are expected to follow the Fed's move in finalizing the rules in the next few weeks.

The fight over the leverage ratio has been an "absolute battle royale," said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics, which advises banks on policy matters. "They really do want a higher leverage ratio, and I think they'll move very quickly on it," Ms. Petrou said.

The Fed's vote Tuesday is important in part because it helps fulfill U.S. international commitments. While U.S. banks are generally better capitalized than many foreign banks, the fact that the U.S. hasn't put in place the latest round of Basel standards has allowed foreign officials to balk at U.S. calls for more stringent financial regulation.

The proposed rules would generally require banks to hold more and better quality capital as a buffer against times of stress, a concern of regulators in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

In addition to varying the amount of capital a bank must hold based on the riskiness of its assets, the proposal would require banks to hold higher amounts of loss-absorbing capital and could limit dividend payouts and share buybacks if banks don't meet certain thresholds.

While not slated to take effect until 2019, the proposed capital rules have come under attack from the banking industry, particularly smaller community banks that were surprised to be swept into many of the requirements when the proposal was floated last year. There also has been political pressure from lawmakers to ease some of the provisions for smaller banks, and Fed officials have signaled that some changes would be made.

Markets
Weak Links Mar Investing in China; Stocks Trail the Rest of the Economy as State-Owned Companies Get Preferential Treatment for IPOs

The selloff in China's stock market abated on Tuesday, but a key issue for investors remains: The country's financial system puts state-owned companies ahead of private businesses.

The Shanghai Composite Index fell 0.2% on Tuesday after tumbling 5.3% on Monday, its biggest one-day percentage decline since August 2009, on worries about a credit crunch. Chinese shares initially began trading on Tuesday with another sharp drop, but recovered after Chinese central-bank officials sought to soothe investors.

Analysts and investors say that for the rebound to gain any traction, China needs to revamp a system that gives state-owned enterprises preference when granting approval for initial public offerings. More-profitable companies often must wait years to tap the stock market, which is composed mostly of domestic investors, because of strict quotas on foreign ownership of stocks.

"The IPO system is one of the key problems," said Eddie Chow, portfolio manager at Templeton Emerging Markets Group. Mr. Chow's team manages around $50 billion.

Many investors cite the government's policies as the main reason Chinese shares rank among the world's worst performers since the financial crisis, even as China has posted some of the fastest growth rates.

The Shanghai index is down 14% this year, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 13%, even after recent turbulence caused by investors fretting about the withdrawal of Federal Reserve stimulus measures.

More than half of the companies listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange are state-owned, the direct result of the government's preference for them as IPO candidates. The State-owned Enterprises 100 Index on the Shanghai Stock Exchange has fallen 40% since it was launched in July 2009. The bourse's Private-owned Enterprises 50 Index has declined just 1.2% since its debut on the same day.

In that period, the overall market has fallen 34%.

"The stock market has failed to reflect China's good economic prospects because these [state-owned enterprises] aren't very profitable," said Shawlin Chaw, Asia strategist at Discern Investment Analytics, a brokerage in the U.S. "A lot of employment is being provided but it doesn't necessarily mean they are making profit."

Many investors expected stock-market changes to kick in last year. But now they say they are resigned to delays after China's chief markets regulator was replaced in March during a political reshuffling.

Even foreign investors, who have clamored to get a piece of the tightly controlled quotas that allow them to invest inside China, are backing off.

According to data from EPFR Global, which tracks money flows, $3.13 billion left the Chinese stock markets between June 1 and June 21, compared with peak inflows of $4.4 billion in December.

Analysts say the favoring of state-owned companies over private businesses effectively undercuts the stock market's role as an efficient allocator of capital.

Shandong Jinchuang Co., one of China's largest privately-run gold producers, has been applying to list its shares since 2007 and has been rejected several times despite years of consistent profits, a key regulatory requirement.

The opaque listing process is one reason some of China's most profitable and innovative private companies bypass the domestic stock exchange in favor of overseas listings. A unit of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Chinese Internet company Tencent Holdings Ltd. both turned to Hong Kong, while microblogging provider Sina Corp. chose New York's exchange.

Many investors in China have given up.

They are pouring their savings into property and risky trust products that promise high yields, prompting the government to try to rein in those markets. Trading volume in stocks has dropped 42% from a peak in 2010, while dormant trading accounts have risen by more than half since 2008.

"I am told the stock market is a barometer of the economy. What kind of barometer is that here in China?" said Li Zhiliang, a 57-year-old retired taxi driver who holds shares in auto makers, military-equipment firms and pharmaceutical producers. "The rallies in our stock market never seem to last. Whenever it goes up, it will fall the next day."

FT REPORT - THE CONNECTED BUSINESS
Answers are just a call away

Mobile devices

Analysis is now available to anyone, anywhere, reports Bede McCarthy

Technologies such as big data have transformed business intelligence from the stuff of stodgy analyst reports to an instant stream of information that helps everybody from sales reps to chief executives.

Such data are often most useful in the field, which is why many companies are equipping employees with business intelligence applications for mobile use.

Companies have always used data in live situations - in mining and geology for example - but it was often tied to laptops and required specialist skills to interpret.

But the rise of affordable cloud solutions for analytics, coupled with the arrival of smartphones and tablets, made it possible to use mobile intelligence without a large investment in servers or staff training.

"The barriers to entry have changed," says Ian Cohen, group chief information officer at Jardine Lloyd Thompson, the risk, insurance and employee benefits specialist. Mr Cohen says JLT equips its consultants with mobile analytics so they can work with clients to deal with issues on the spot, rather than gathering information and taking it back for analysis. The key difference is presentation.

"It's a visualisation of data in a way that people can see, touch and move. The days of analysts sitting behind screens in big offices crunching data have gone," Mr Cohen says.

The technology can benefit almost any business. Retailers can see sales figures from the shop floor. In Colchester in the UK, an NHS hospital is tracking the efficiency of its accident and emergency service.

Vendors say such tools are popular with executives, who want updates while travelling or to access data in meetings without having to request it.

So it is no surprise that mobile business intelligence is now a $13.1bn market. According to Gartner, the IT research company, spending on business intelligence, information management and analytics software rose 6.8 per cent last year, and 17 per cent the previous year.

This coincides with a rise in demand for staff who can interpret business data in the field - a skill, Mr Cohen says, is in short supply.

He says: "The person you have at headquarters crunching data might not be the same one you want to put in front of a client at their office. You need to have people who are more adept at data, who know what they're looking for and ask the right questions."

The sector is dominated by traditional vendors such as SAP, Oracle and IBM. But the shift to mobile has provided an opportunity for small cloud-based companies such as Salesforce in the US and Sweden's QlikTech to gain a foothold.

"The new companies have gained huge traction by virtue of their simplicity, visualisations and dashboards [multiple screens], so that other more traditional analysis-driven companies are being challenged to keep up," says Mr Cohen.

Sean Farrington, managing director of UK and Ireland for QlikTech says: "We always demo on a mobile device, because we have seen that is an expectation of senior executives - they don't want to access information any other way."

Mr Farrington says QlikTech has 28,000 customers because of good data visualisation and allowing users to inspect it with simple questions. "It's that question-based method rather than delivering information in a standard formatted report. When you're a busy chief executive, you don't want to spend the time or haven't the patience to learn a tool."

Carrying sensitive data on mobile devices can leave companies vulnerable if devices are stolen or lost.

However, Mr Farrington says the web-based nature of products means such data need not necessarily be stored on phones or tablets. "That's why we deliver via a browser, so if you lose your mobile device there are no data on it."

FT REPORT - IGNITES: INVESTING IN PASSIVE FUNDS
Fund staff sell active idea but invest passively; Ignites poll

Many overlook active management when investing personalassets,says Danielle Sottosanti

A high number of fund industry professionals appear to be touting the advantages of active management as part of their jobs, while investing a sizeable portion of their personal assets in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and other passive products, an Ignites poll finds.

Two-thirds of mutual fund professionals polled by Ignites have a meaningful portion of their investments managed passively, including 45 per cent who say they have a "significant" portion in passive products. Another 22 per cent report having a "moderate" amount of their investments managed passively. Commenting on the poll, John Rekenthaler, vice-president of research for Morningstar, says it is telling how many fund professionals have a meaningful exposure to passive products

"Probably two-thirds of their companies also offer an index fund of some type. But in most cases not enthusiastically, nor do those funds have many assets," he says. "It appears that about half of fund professionals are eating rather differently than the diets prescribed by their companies."

Roughly one-third are largely eschewing passively managed strategies. This includes 14 per cent who have only a "nominal amount" invested passively and 20 per cent who have none at all.

Industry experts are not surprised that fund professionals are investing their personal assets in passive products, even though these same fund professionals may advocate active management.

Andy Klausner, founder and principal of AK Advisory Partners, says it "seems reasonable" that nearly 70 per cent of industry participants have at least some assets in passive investments. Still, it is "hard to know exactly what per cent of their personal assets are in passive investments," he notes.

Indeed, acceptance of passive investing has grown not only among investors, but also within the fund industry itself, points out Doug Dannemiller, principal at research consultancy Dannemiller Analytics & Consulting.

"The perception of index investing has improved greatly over the past 15 years," he notes, attributing the change in sentiment largely to indexing's cost-savings benefits.

"Active funds have the potential for alpha, but many funds don't actually beat their index, providing negative alpha."

At the same time, including index or passive products in fee-based offerings "has provided a way to include financial advisers in the distribution of passive investments. In most cases, passive investments have a more straightforward fee scheme," he explains.

However, given some professionals' personal preference for active management, experts do not expect many of those who are now abstaining from passive to sway in the future.

Both Mr Klausner and Mr Dannemiller anticipate that the percentage of assets fund professionals invest in passive products expressed in the poll will stay about the same over time.

Since 1998 the number of US index mutual funds has more than doubled, from 156 to 373 at the end of 2012, according to data from the Investment Company Institute, a trade group. Over the same period, assets held in those products have swelled from $265bn to $1.3tn.

The poll attracted responses from 1,001 Ignites readers, who work within the US mutual fund industry.

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
Bernanke Rides the Bull

898 words
20 June 2013
The Wall Street Journal Europe
WSJE

English
(Copyright (c) 2013, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

It's Ben Bernanke's economy, and everyone else is along for the ride. That reality has been clearer than ever in recent days, as financial markets lurched while awaiting the U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman's next monetary intimation, and now with President Obama's Monday hint that he may not reappoint Mr. Bernanke to another four-year term.

The recent market turmoil follows Mr. Bernanke's suggestion to the U.S. Congress last month that the Fed could start reducing its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases later this year if growth is strong enough. There's a lot of wiggle room in "could," but the market reaction has nonetheless been sharp. The 2013 rally in stocks took a pause, bond yields have climbed, and capital has flowed out of emerging markets. All of this reverses what happened when Mr. Bernanke announced his open-ended bond buying last year.

This is a portent of what is likely to be continuing ferment when the Fed finally unwinds its extraordinary monetary interventions. The biggest question about the Fed's policy of near-zero interest rates and unlimited quantitative easing has always been: What happens when the music stops?

Mr. Bernanke's answer is that the Fed has the "tools" to unwind, and it will use them when the economy is healthy enough. The Fed says this means a jobless rate of 6.5% or lower (from 7.6% today) and presumably a durable housing recovery. With some "open-mouth operations" to signal its intentions, the Fed thinks it can manage a gradual adjustment that avoids inflation or bursting asset bubbles. We all wish it will be so.

But as the central-banking proverb holds, it is easier to get on the bull than to get off. The eternal problems are timing and political will. Knowing when to get off is hard enough when the only major variable is the traditional fed funds rate. It is harder still when the variables include a promise of near-zero rates into mid-2015 and a Fed balance sheet that has nearly quadrupled in five and a half years to $3.4 trillion.

A crowd will always form in Washington and on Wall Street to say it's too soon to stop, and those voices urged the Fed not to signal any reduction in bond buying at this week's Open Market Committee meeting. They say there may be a housing recovery, but it isn't solid enough. The U.S. jobless rate is falling, but not fast enough. And with little sign of inflation (0.1% in May, 1.4% over the past year), we're told that any reduction in purchases runs the risk of falling prices.

The deflation fear can be especially beguiling, as Mr. Bernanke knows. In 2003 Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan and a certain new Fed Governor named Ben Bernanke cited deflation risks to justify holding the fed funds rate at 1% for an entire year even as the economy was accelerating to a nearly 4% growth rate. This was the original sin that did so much to produce the housing bubble and financial panic.

Our view is that the sooner the Fed begins to unwind, the better. Its interventions were necessary amid panic and recession in 2008-2009. But the U.S. recovery reached its fourth anniversary this month. And while growth remains subpar, it isn't clear that monetary policy can do more to increase it.

The Fed can't repeal ObamaCare, which is a deadweight burden on job creation. It can't repeal the tax increases that hit in January, notably on small businesses. And it can't repeal the waves of new regulation that the Obama Administration continues to impose across the economy. The miracle is that American growth is as strong as it is, which speaks to the private innovation that continues to take place in energy, biotech, digital devices, big data and more.

Meanwhile, the longer QE and near-zero rates continue, the more risks accumulate. The longer investors scramble for yield, the greater the risks of misallocated capital and bubbles we may not see until it is too late. Savers have been punished for a half decade already, while low-interest rates have made it easier for politicians to spend with too little consequence.

Which brings us to Mr. Bernanke's future when his second term expires in 2014. Mr. Obama told Charlie Rose of PBS on Monday that the Fed chief "has already stayed a lot longer than he wanted or he was supposed to." This suggests that Mr. Obama may prefer to name a new Chairman, and the pressure within his party is great to choose Fed Governor and economist Janet Yellen. She would be the first woman Fed chief and is known to favor even more expansionary monetary policy than Mr. Bernanke does.

The political virtue of choosing Ms. Yellen is that Mr. Obama would have a loyalist in the job and thus no ability to dodge responsibility if the Fed gets it wrong. On the other hand, Mr. Bernanke made the decision to hop on this bull and ride it for more than four years. There would be rough justice in seeing if he really can manage a smooth dismount.

SOFTWARE

The company behind a computer program for recording environmental and safety incidents has been bought by venture capitalists for 20m, in the latest sign of investors' interest in cloud-based technologies .

Rivo Software was founded eight years ago in the belief that Excel spreadsheets were an inefficient way to record accidents.

Based at the University of Warwick's Science Park, it has about 150,000 individual users worldwide, including staff at multinationals from Burberry to BP.

The acquisition by Kennet Partners and Fidelity Growth Partners values the company at about 10 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation last year, and will seek to give the software a greater global presence.

"People need to be informed about what's going on and how it affects their business and ultimately their share price," said Steve Husk, an angel investor associated with Kennet, who will join Rivo as executive chairman.

Rivo could be used for "everything from what happens when someone loses a finger in the back of a dustcart to things being said about people on Twitter," he said.

The software, whose sales reached about 10m last year, is now part of a range of cloud-based services aimed at providing analytics to executives. Other platforms include Datasift, which digests relevant chatter on social media.

"In the past, large organisations were putting a lot of time into capturing data, and producing reports that they knew were wrong," said Simon Cook, Rivo's chief executive.

"A lot of our clients, often having grown by acquisition, find some relatively simple things, like reporting an incident, become complex because of multiple locations, differing legislations and different cultures."

Rivo began by selling big companies services that were not business critical. It now has about 50 employees, mostly in the UK.

"Our goal would be to grow this to a 40m-50m company," said Mr Husk.

"We think it can have a footprint of 250-300 people worldwide in the next five years."

Ken Baxter, managing director of Rivo, said it could exploit a fragmented market. "There's no real lead player in governance, risk and compliance. It's a huge market."

OpTier Ltd. which provides infrastructure management software information systems for organizations is firing 20 of its 150 employees, sources inform "Globes." Over the past year the company's emphasis has shifted to the US market and the company has reduced its workforce by half at its Israel R&D center. Now the number of employees is set to shrink by another 10-20.

OpTier Ltd. was founded in 2005 by chairman Israel Mazin and his brother vice chairman Ori Mazin and was for many years considered one of Israel's most promising start ups. The company raised close to $120 million from investors including Pitango Venture Capital, Carmel Ventures, Lightspeed Ventures, Morgan Stanley and Cisco Systems Inc. (Nasdaq: CSCO). The last financing round was some years ago though it could be in the midst of a new round.

Last year Mark Thompson, a former senior executive at CA, replaced Israel Mazin as CEO.

Over the past year, OpTier has also changed the strategic emphasis of its products towards big data analytics.

OpTier said in response, "Since its establishment the company has adapted its manpower to market requirements and unique areas of activity. The company does not respond regarding increases or decreases in its number of employees."

Personetics, which provides predictive interaction solutions for the banking industry, today announced that it has closed its series B funding of $11.5 million. Lightspeed Venture Partners led the financing with previous investors Sequoia Capital and Carmel Ventures.

Personetics will use the proceeds to increase sales and enlarge operations to meet the growing demand for predictive solutions that transform the digital experience for banking customers. Following the funding, Lightspeed Venture Partners partner Yoni Cheifetz will join the Personetics board.

Personetics CEO David Sosna said, "Personalizing the customer experience is a key initiative for banks as they look for ways to fully realize the benefits digital channels provide."

Personetics' predictive banking solutions leverage customer data and crowdsourcing analytics to create a real-time, robust customer view that can accurately predict customer intent and offer personalized services and recommendations.

Cheifetz said, "We engaged with Personetics and its existing investors because we were impressed with their technology, the high level of expertise the Personetics' management team brings to the table, and their ability to deliver a solution to the financial sector that provides immediate value to their customers while reducing customer services costs."

The company was founded in 2010 by Sosna and general manager Israel David Govrin.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Investors must decide whether M&G's Optimal Income is too big to perform; Fund focus

Nick Reeve finds the fund has grown dramatically in size

Richard Woolnough, M&G's star bond manager, has told investors to make up their own minds whether his 15bn Optimal Income fund is too big.

The fund has grown dramatically in size, from 5.7bn at the start of 2012, driven by its increasing popularity in Europe as well as strong performance.

Mr Woolnough says: "It is up to clients to decide if a large fund like this is the place to be or if it is too detrimental. As a fund manager, we look at the size of the marketplace, what is going on within it, and the size of the fund."

He emphasises that the fund's flexibility to alter duration - its sensitivity to interest-rate movements - and ability to invest up to 20 per cent in equities meant it was still able to perform in spite of the inflows.

The manager also highlighted the expansion of the fixed income dealing team and the recent hire of Andrius Isciukas, the US bond specialist, as an example of "counteracting the disadvantages of size with the resources of size".

His comments come after M&G said last summer that it was taking action to reduce inflows into Mr Woolnough's Corporate Bond and Strategic Corporate Bond funds amid concerns that their size was beginning to hamper performance.

Within the Optimal Income fund, Mr Woolnough says he had recently started adding to his high yield exposure, having been "too bearish" last year and missing out on a rally in the asset class.

But he maintains that, in many cases, equities were preferable. This was reflected in the fund's record high allocation of 12.5 per cent to equities and record low allocation of 22 per cent to high yield bonds.

Elsewhere, the manager has sold the fund's entire exposure to index-linked government bonds as they were "no longer as cheap as they were", and has also been adding selectively to bank debt.

However, Mr Woolnough says he continued to have a negative view of bank debt in general as there was a far smaller pool of senior secured bonds following the crisis in Europe. This was due to political pressure to secure depositors' money above all else.

"We have been buying banks on recent weakness but we are very selective about who we lend to and where in the capital structure we are," he says.

Turning to quantitative easing (QE) Mr Woolnough says: "If I was in the Federal Reserve , I would have stopped QE already. It's going to be a slow process and the Fed will react to the data, but I also think the Fed will take action sooner than the market thinks. It wouldn't surprise me if rates were up later this year."

To reflect this view, the manager has been running a shorter duration position in the M&G Optimal Income fund, reducing the funds' sensitivity to movements in interest rates.

This position protected the fund during May's bond market volatility as the fund ranked fourth in its peer group, gaining 0.6 per cent compared with the IMA Sterling Strategic Bond sector's average 0.7 per cent loss.

In the five years to June 11, the M&G Optimal Income fund ranked third of 49 funds in the IMA Sterling Strategic Bond sector with a 68.6 per cent gain, according to FE Analytics.

WEEKEND INVESTOR --- Missing the Target --- A growing number of investors have big chunks of their retirement savings in 'target-date' mutual funds; But these simple-seeming vehicles can be unexpectedly complicated; Here's what you need to know

Target-date funds have become one of the most important ways that Americans save for retirement. But for many investors, the funds are still wide of the mark.

The funds generally are set up so that investors can put their entire nest egg into a single one linked to the year they expect to retire, in effect putting a savings strategy on autopilot. The funds typically shrink their stock allocation and boost the bond allocation to become more conservative as the retirement date nears.

After a 2006 federal law paved the way for many employers to put 401(k) contributions into target-date funds unless workers choose an alternative, the funds added assets rapidly. They held more than $550 billion at the end of May, according to investment researcher Morningstar, up from $160 billion at the end of 2008. Fund giants Fidelity Investments, Vanguard Group and T. Rowe Price Group dominate the field, while Wells Fargo, BlackRock and others also offer funds.

The approach can be particularly useful for people who don't pay advisers to help them manage their investments.

In practice, though, the simple concept can get complicated, and many investors use the funds in ways designers never intended. A quarter of investors who own target-date funds believe the funds provide guaranteed retirement income, according to a 2012 Securities and Exchange Commission survey -- which isn't true in most cases.

Target-date funds, which are often composed of separate underlying funds, also carry widely disparate fees, and higher-cost funds can cut into investor returns. Some of these underlying funds passively track indexes, while others actively try to beat the market-- an approach that can push fees up and lead to diverging performance.

The asset allocations the funds have vary, so two funds with the same target date could look markedly different. Fund companies sometimes add to the confusion by tinkering with the investment recipe, which can expose investors to unexpected risks.

Investors who want to buy a target-date fund often can't dodge the complications. Many investors have access to the funds in a 401(k) or similar retirement-savings plan through an employer, which often only offers one firm's target-date funds.

Almost 32,000 of the nation's largest retirement plans offer target-date funds to nearly 39 million workers, says BrightScope, which rates plans.

Many investors hold them in other accounts. Nearly 30% of the money in target-date funds at the end of 2012 was held in individual retirement accounts, brokerage accounts and other vehicles, according to data from the Investment Company Institute and the Employee Benefit Research Institute, nonprofits based in Washington.

Even fans of the funds can find it tricky to use them. Kent Lind, a high-school science teacher in Waco, Texas, says only a portion of the roughly $750,000 in retirement funds he and his wife, a physician, have amassed is in target-date funds.

He thinks the funds might be a good choice for the entire nest egg, but it is spread out over several retirement plans, with current and former employers, and some have higher-cost target-date options he doesn't like. Instead, Mr. Lind's wife holds low-fee stock mutual funds through her employer's plan, and Mr. Lind uses a bond fund offered by the federal government, where he once worked, to balance her stock risk.

Mr. Lind, who is 49 years old, puts his current contributions into Vanguard's Target Retirement 2030 Fund to reach the balance between stocks and bonds he wants for the overall portfolio. But only a quarter of that overall portfolio is in target-date funds, he says.

"You have to be creative how you put it all together," he says.

Despite the shortcomings, target-date funds have already logged a major achievement, experts say, by pushing investors out of low-yielding investments and into the markets, and by adjusting the allocations to stocks and bonds -- the so-called glide path -- in a way that manages risk.

"In general, target-date funds are great for investors and do a better job of diversifying a portfolio across multiple asset classes than most investors can do on their own," says Jeremy Stempien, a director of investments at Morningstar.

Investors in target-date funds also seem to behave differently. T. Rowe Price found that investors with 100% of their accounts in a target-date fund were about six times less likely to trade in that account during the course of a year.

Kevin Becker, who is 61 and lives in Plymouth, Minn., used to think about tweaking his investments incessantly. A few years ago, the retired software engineer put most of his retirement money into target-date funds, setting those allocation decisions on autopilot.

"I've been sleeping very well since," he says.

Here are some issues investors should consider in deciding whether to invest in a target-date fund, and if so, how to go about doing it.

Are target-date funds a good fit?

Four years from now, Vanguard estimates, 47% of workers enrolled in 401(k) and other defined-contribution retirement plans it helps administer will have all of their contributions invested in a target-date fund -- as will 75% of new participants.

They have become especially popular with younger workers. Fidelity says 32% of the 11.5 million participants who have access to target-date funds in plans where Fidelity serves as record-keeper have their entire accounts in the funds. Among participants in their 20s, that figure climbs to 61%.

"If you're 20-something, on your first job, they're perfect," says Mr. Lind, the teacher.

Young investors often end up in investments that could be inappropriate for their age. For example, they often put retirement money in the kind of stable-value funds that might be better suited for someone who needs to tap it soon, when in fact retirement is decades away, says Craig Israelsen, co-founder of Target Date Analytics, which studies the funds for employers and financial advisers.

"That's like preparing to stop at a stop sign a mile before you get there. They were braking way too soon," he says.

Older investors can benefit from being in a target-date fund, too, says Stephen Nelson, a tax accountant in Redmond, Wash. The funds put asset-allocation decisions on autopilot, which can be useful for investors at a stage in life when financial literacy "can tend to ebb a little bit," he says.

Yet the same thing that makes target-date funds popular -- the one-size-fits-all approach -- also can be a weakness, because the funds don't account for an individual's specific circumstances.

That is particularly important as investors age, because many other factors can affect investment decisions in or near retirement, including the value of other assets, level of debt, financial commitments to children, number of years before retirement and health.

"There are a lot of differences among 60-year-olds," Mr. Israelsen says.

He says investors should review their finances as retirement approaches and decide if the target-date fund they are invested in still matches their needs and risk tolerance.

One key question: how much an investor has saved. An investor with no debt, $2 million socked away and confident of covering living expenses, might not want to stay in a target-date fund that has a significant chunk in stocks, says Mr. Israelsen. The investor might not need to take that risk.

For someone who has saved much less and still has significant debt, the decisions can be tougher, Mr. Israelsen says.

That investor may need to weigh whether to stay in a target-date fund with a higher stock allocation in hopes of making up for lost ground, but with the risk of losing money in a down market, or seek out one with a low stock allocation in hopes of preserving assets.

Older investors who expect to pass their assets on to heirs without tapping them might avoid a target-date fund that gets more conservative as they age, Mr. Israelsen says.

Know your investment.

Two funds with the same target date don't necessarily have the same proportion of stocks and bonds -- but barely half of people who own target-date funds realize that fact, says Rolf Wulfsberg, global head of quantitative research at Siegel+Gale, a strategic branding firm, which conducted the SEC survey.

"There is a lot of misunderstanding," he says.

In fact, similar-sounding funds can have different risk profiles. The T. Rowe Price Retirement 2030 Fund, for example, has 82% of its assets in stocks and 17% in bonds and cash, while the Fidelity Freedom 2030 Fund is 62% stocks and 38% bonds and cash, according to Morningstar.

For instance, a target-date fund with a higher allocation to stocks might be a bad choice for an investor whose income can vary widely or who is at greater risk of getting laid off or fired, says Ryan Klekar, a financial adviser at wealth-management firm Truepoint in Cincinnati, which oversees $1.4 billion.

Similarly, if an employer's stock is an important component of the retirement plan, then an investor might need a target-date fund with a lower stock allocation, Morningstar's Mr. Stempien says.

On the flip side, if an investor has a traditional pension in addition to investments in a defined-contribution plan, the pension should be viewed as a bond, and a target-date fund with a higher stock allocation might be appropriate, he says.

"The whole idea of target-date funds is that there's some sort of smooth glide path," says Zvi Bodie, a finance professor at Boston University. In reality, "you're going to have to make corrections along that path."

Be aware of other risks.

Target-date fund managers can also change their strategies.

In February, for instance, Vanguard announced that it was adding a fund that seeks to track an index of international bonds to its target-date series, a move it said would "diversify" the funds. It held the overall allocation to fixed-income investments steady.

Fund companies also can change the proportion of stocks and bonds in a given fund, Mr. Stempien says.

Decisions like that may or may not turn out well, but investors need to be aware that they can happen and understand the possible implications.

"It's important to look at those disclosures that are given to you," says Sarah Holden, senior director of retirement and investor research for the trade group Investment Company Institute.

Because the funds hold a mix of assets, sometimes spread out over a dozen or more underlying funds, it also can be difficult for an investor to determine if the funds are doing as well as the markets they follow.

"It's very easy to mask poor performance," Mr. Stempien says.

Fees, which eat into returns, also vary significantly. For example, the Fidelity Freedom 2030 Fund, which invests its assets in an array of actively-managed funds and index funds, charges 0.74%, or $74 per $10,000 invested. Vanguard Target Retirement 2030 Fund uses only index funds, and charges 0.17%, or $17 per $10,000 invested.

Other funds charge more than 1% of assets in fees. Investors who think a target-date fund costs too much can see if their retirement plan has lower-cost funds holding the same assets and compose a portfolio with the cheaper funds in the same proportions, says Anthony Webb, senior research economist at the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.

Some target-date funds charge more than the fees on the various underlying funds would support, he says.

"There's really no justification for these investment managers larding them up with fees," Mr. Webb says.

Use it or lose it.

Investors who find an appealing target-date fund have to decide how much to invest in it -- keeping in mind that the products are generally designed to hold 100% of an investor's retirement savings.

"If you trust the strategy, you should just contribute," says Mike Alfred, chief executive of BrightScope.

Many investors do that, but others don't. T. Rowe Price says that about one in 10 of roughly 1.8 million participants in plans in which it serves as record-keeper have some of the account balance, but less than 25% of it, in target-date funds.

The risk, advisers and academics say, is that mixing target-date funds in with other investments could skew an investor's assets in ways that could have costly consequences.

"It adds complexity and may create a lot of overlap," says Mr. Klekar, the financial adviser.

But even investors who find a good target-date fund and use it wisely need to remember that it won't solve all their retirement-savings problems.

"People do not save enough," Mr. Stempien says. "It doesn't address that."

In Depth: Traders Routinely Paying For Early Peek at Key Data --- Few U.S. Rules Control the Release of Economic Reports From Nongovernmental Organizations

By Brody Mullins, Michael Rothfeld, Tom McGinty and Jenny Strasburg

On the morning of March 15, stocks stumbled on news that a key reading of consumer confidence was unexpectedly low.

One group of investors already knew that. They got the University of Michigan's consumer report two seconds before everyone else.

Infinium Capital Management, a high-speed trading firm in Chicago, used the information to launch a wave of trading in futures contracts, in just one example of the activity that followed.

In a single second, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis, traders from various firms bet nearly seven million shares that equity markets would decline -- which was exactly what happened when news of the survey became widely known.

Economic reports from public universities, trade groups and other nongovernmental organizations can move markets as surely as official data from the U.S. government.

But unlike government reports, where pains are taken to make certain no one gets them ahead of time, few rules control release of nongovernmental economic reports. Unknown to many investors, selling early access is routine.

This is a "blind spot" in U.S. law, said Richard Painter, a former Republican White House ethics lawyer. Groups, he said, should "not be allowed to selectively disclose market-moving data to people who pay more money -- that is not right."

But it is legal, and so is trading on the advance peeks.

Even as securities rules bar companies from selective data disclosure, and as authorities vigorously pursue insider trading in all its forms, no law prevents investors from trading on nonpublic information they have legally purchased from other private entities.

Trading would be illegal only if the information was passed through a breach of trust, said securities lawyers.

"If someone gives you permission to use the information, then there is no problem," said Steve Crimmins, a former Securities and Exchange Commission enforcement official now at law firm K&L Gates LLP.

Besides the Michigan consumer-sentiment survey, reports released early to paying customers include a Chicago-based barometer of business activity and a widely followed manufacturing index from the Institute for Supply Management -- which said Wednesday it is re-evaluating how it releases its data.

Other organizations, including trade associations and private research firms, sell data that move industry-specific stocks and futures markets on everything from agriculture to truck sales.

Among investment firms that have subscribed to such reports are SAC Capital Advisors L.P., Tudor Investment Corp., and Wellington Capital Management, according to people familiar with the matter. The firms declined to comment.

"It's not an exclusive club," said Infinium's chief operating officer, Gregory Eickbush. He said his firm needs to have an advance look at the consumer-sentiment survey to keep from getting "flattened" by other futures traders.

Mr. Eickbush said Infinium attributes around 10% of its annual revenue, or close to $18 million in recent years, to using high-speed news and economic-data feeds, in a strategy he called "event jumping."

Trading on such reports, called the "news-feed trade," is emblematic of an era in financial markets dominated by hair-trigger trading measured in fractions of seconds.

At its speediest, this means trading by algorithms based on what is known as "machine-readable news." Paul Rowady of research firm Tabb Group, who studies the economics of trading, estimates the delivery of machine-readable news will generate $75 million in revenue for financial-news providers this year, up almost 50% in five years.

Sharad Kumar, a veteran of several high-speed trading firms, said the availability of early access to nongovernmental data creates an arms race in which firms pay for it to avoid being at a "huge disadvantage." At the same time, its cost can be "a barrier to entry" for smaller traders, he said.

The early look at the consumer-sentiment findings comes from Thomson Reuters Corp. The company will pay the University of Michigan $1.1 million this year for rights to distribute the findings, according to the university. Next year, it will pay $1.2 million.

In turn, Thomson Reuters's marketing materials say the firm offers paying clients an "exclusive 2-second advanced feed of results . . . designed specifically for algorithmic trading."

Clients who pay a subscription fee to Thomson Reuters, which for some is $5,000 a month plus a $1,025 monthly connection charge, get the high-speed feed at 9:54:58 a.m. Eastern time.

Those who pay for Thomson Reuters's regular news services get the report two seconds later.

At that point, it swiftly becomes widely available through other news providers as well, including Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones, a News Corp. unit that is a Thomson Reuters competitor.

Five minutes later, at 10 a.m., the university posts the numbers on its website.

Richard Curtin, an economist who runs the university's survey, said he knows the deal gives an advantage to select investors.

"Hardly anyone would pay for it if they didn't see a profit motive," Mr. Curtin said. Later, he added: "This research is totally funded by private sources for the benefit of scientific analysis, to assess public policy, and to advance business interests. Without a source of revenue, the project would cease to exist and the benefits would disappear."

Thomson Reuters said in a statement: "Thomson Reuters is a leading provider of data and analytics to many categories of participants in financial markets such as investors, asset managers, traders, and high frequency traders. Thomson Reuters, like many information providers, looks to produce and secure exclusive content to help its customers make better informed trading and investment decisions.

Thomson Reuters is open and transparent about how data is released but always looks for ways to improve this transparency further. Anyone wishing to invest or trade on this data can subscribe to the service that best meets their data needs."

Matthew Winkler, editor in chief of Reuters rival Bloomberg News, criticized the University of Michigan's arrangement with Reuters in a letter to the university's president and provost in April 2012.

"As an institution that receives public funding, the university has a legal and ethical obligation to be accountable to the public. If such organizations as Bloomberg News, Reuters, Dow Jones and others do not have equal access to information, neither does the public," Mr. Winkler wrote, in a communication reviewed by the Journal. He said Reuters's subscribers had "an unfair advantage."

Suellyn Scarnecchia, then the university's general counsel, responded to Bloomberg that university officials "have always been comfortable that our relationships and structures were in full compliance with all applicable laws."

Six years earlier -- before Reuters acquired distribution rights -- Bloomberg itself bid for them, promising it would create a level playing field. After its offer wasn't accepted, a Bloomberg executive editor emailed the university complaining that in the deal the school planned to make with Reuters, "you will be guaranteeing that every other news organization -- to say nothing of every investor who doesn't subscribe to Reuters -- will be disadvantaged.

No wonder Reuters is willing to pay you so much more than Bloomberg: While we were offering money to help the University create a system that is fair to everyone, they are paying you to guarantee an unfair one!"

A university economist told Bloomberg at that time that those were difficult issues the university was grappling with.

Journal publisher Dow Jones doesn't exclusively distribute indicators created by nongovernment entities but does send some exclusive content reported by its news staff to premium subscribers before it is published on general newswires or on its website. Most Journal articles are available only to subscribers.

The Chicago Business Barometer is a monthly index of economic activity based on a survey of companies in that area. German financial exchange Deutsche Boerse AG bought the right to produce and distribute the Barometer two years ago, and sells early access to it starting at about $2,600 a year. Customers receive "this market-moving data 3 minutes before public release," according to the website of a Deutsche Boerse affiliate. Paying customers can get the early release by email, conference call or a machine-readable feed.

Subscriptions are "open to everyone and all customers receive the report simultaneously, regardless of delivery method," a spokeswoman for Deutsche Boerse said.

On April 30, the Barometer showed its lowest reading in 3 1/2 years. Those who bought early access found this out at 9:42 a.m. Eastern time.

Jump Trading LLC, a high-speed trading firm in Chicago, used the head start to make negative bets on securities that tend to move with the report, according to people familiar with its operations. Jump declined to comment.

This was part of a flurry of trading at 9:42. In one minute, the SPDR S&P 500, an exchange-traded fund that tracks the stock market, traded 1.4 million shares, triple the number traded in the previous minute. Its share price was 24 cents lower by 9:45, the time when anyone who wasn't paying Deutsche Boerse for an early look got the news.

In contrast to "the fast money" that uses the early report, "the dumber money" comes along three minutes later with the Barometer's general release, said Caleb Eplett, a former trader at Chopper Trading LLC, another Chicago high-speed firm. "Anybody who's anybody is going to have that number when it [first] comes out," he said. Chopper said that it trades on Deutsche Boerse's high-speed access but declined to discuss specific transactions.

Jim Overdahl, an economist and an adviser to a traders' group at the Futures Industry Association, to which Jump, Chopper and Infinium all belong, said: "Professional traders subscribing to services that provide the fastest possible access to news hardly differs from your paying extra for online access to a favorite newspaper instead of waiting for the paper to plop on your doorstep the next morning. For some people, it's worth the premium to get access to news in real time."

Besides the Chicago Business Barometer, Chopper said it trades on an early release of the monthly manufacturing index from the Institute for Supply Management, or ISM. That index -- beefed up during the Great Depression when President Hoover was frustrated by a lack of data -- is regarded by many as the single most important economic report coming from the private sector.

Last summer, the ISM began offering access to survey results through Thomson Reuters's high-speed feed. Customers who want it pay Thomson Reuters a fee of about $2,000 a month, plus the $1,025 monthly for a high-speed connection if they don't already have it.

The manufacturing data are scheduled to be released to the public at precisely 10 a.m. by Thomson Reuters's high-speed feed and also via news release from the ISM. In fact, the ISM news release routinely goes out five to 10 seconds late, giving that much of an edge to customers of Thomson Reuters's high-speed news feed, according to records from the release and people familiar with it.

Thomson Reuters's sales team has used the lag as a selling point for the high-speed feed, according to an emailed sales pitch to a prospective client viewed by the Journal.

On Feb. 1, the ISM manufacturing number was good, exceeding expectations. This rippled through stock, options, futures and currency markets. In the single second after the clock struck 10 -- with the ISM news release not yet in the hands of subscribers -- volume in the SPDR S&P 500 exchange-traded fund soared to 719,000 shares, from about 27,000 in the prior second.

The Journal analysis shows most of the trades were bets on the fund to rise. It did rise. Within five minutes, these bets collectively rose in value by almost $100,000.

The ISM's chief executive, Thomas W. Derry, said he wasn't aware of a delay in the 10 a.m. broad release of the data. He said the ISM "strongly believes that this data is released on equal terms to everyone."

Later, Mr. Derry said the ISM is "evaluating whether it makes sense to continue" its arrangement with Thomson Reuters.

The University of Michigan's consumer-sentiment survey, produced since 1946, is considered by some economists to be the best predictor of future U.S. household spending. On March 15, its mid-month update landed with a thud. Economists polled by Dow Jones Newswires expected the index to come in at 78, which would have been up slightly from the prior month. Instead, it fell steeply to 71.8.

During the two-second window that Thomson Reuters gave to some clients, traders made short-sale bets against 1,624 separate securities. More than 85% of those securities saw their prices fall within five minutes, according to the Journal's analysis. The price action increased the value of these short positions, if still held, by hundreds of thousands of dollars.

The hectic trading during the two-second window before public release of the surprisingly negative report included these examples:

Trading that morning in the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR, an ETF tracking stocks that do well when consumers feel flush, averaged 177 shares a second. But during the first second when Thomson Reuters fed the disappointing result to certain clients, 59,839 shares traded. Stock-exchange data show most trades were negative bets. Benefiting them, the share price fell as much as 21 cents in the next five minutes.

Volume in the SPDR S&P 500 fund also skyrocketed in that key second, to nearly 310,000 shares from just 1,000 total in the previous two seconds. Two-thirds of the bets were negative. These were rewarded when the ETF's share price dipped by as much as 27 cents over the next five minutes.

On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, Thomson Reuters's release coincided with a spike of trading in futures contracts based on the S&P 500 index, according to data collected by market-research firm Nanex LLC. Volume in that single second totaled 4,196 contracts, which was a level that had been exceeded by only 50 other individual seconds since the beginning of 2012.

At the ISM, Mr. Derry, in noting that his group is re-evaluating how it releases its manufacturing index, said: "We are in the business of distributing important economic data, not in the business of providing privileged access to a certain class of investors."

Markets
Short Sales Dropped in Second Half of May

Short selling fell at the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market during the second half of May.

In the exchanges' latest twice-a-month statistics, this time for the period ended May 31, the number of short-selling positions at the NYSE not yet closed out, known as short interest, declined 0.42%. The positions stood at 13,442,785,071 shares from a revised 13,498,929,546 shares in the period ended May 15.

On Nasdaq, short interest fell 1.1% to 7,488,661,708 shares from 7,573,777,649 shares, over the same period.

"The shorting space has been unstable recently," said Doug Noland, fund manager of Federated Prudent Bear Fund, part of Federated Investors Inc., in Pittsburgh. "There's been a lot of covering of stocks that have outperformed the market, while shorting commodity-related stocks has increased."

Hedge funds' long-short strategies, which account for the majority of shorting activity nowadays, are struggling, according to Mr. Noland.

Commonly shorted stocks have outperformed the market for most of the year, so hedge funds have been closing losing positions and opening new positions, "mainly in resources and emerging markets," Mr. Noland said.

"In the first few days of June, the volume of securities borrowed to establish short positions increased by 2.5%," said Tim Smith, executive vice president at SunGard's Astec Analytics. "However, in the last few sessions the trend has reversed and now for the whole period since the beginning of the month the increase in volume has increased by a meager 0.25%."

The personal-products sector saw a significant decrease in short selling since June began, falling 10%, according to Mr. Smith.

The volume of Herbalife Ltd. shares borrowed in order to maintain short positions fell 25% since June started from 22 million shares to 16 million shares, according to Astec data.

"It seems to indicate market sentiment may have become more positive towards Herbalife," said Mr. Smith.

The only sector which experienced an increase in short-selling activity since the start of the month was communications equipment, which saw borrowing increase 12% during the past two weeks, mostly on the back of BlackBerry, according to Mr. Smith.

Since the beginning of the month, the volume of BlackBerry shares borrowed increased 6% to approximately 110 million shares, while the cost of borrowing has risen to about 8% on an annualized basis, according to Astec data.

Meanwhile, Lululemon Athletica saw an uptick of 10% in short-selling activity on Monday amid a gyration in stock price.

The company said Monday that its chief executive was stepping down. Lululemon shares closed Tuesday at $67.85, down 18%. Year to date, the shares are off 11%.

Currently, 26 million shares of the clothes maker are being borrowed by short sellers, according to Astec data.

All of the companies mentioned declined to comment. In addition, BlackBerry cited a quiet period. It reports quarterly earnings June 28.

Over the period covered by the latest short-interest report, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 160.12 points, or 1.05%. The Nasdaq Composite Index declined 15.71 points, or 0.45%.

Nasdaq's short ratio, or the number of days' average volume represented by outstanding short positions, fell to 4.2 days from a revised 4.4 days in mid-May.

The short ratio on the NYSE declined to 3.8 days from a revised 4.0 days during the same period.

The next short-interest report is scheduled to appear in The Wall Street Journal Online on June 26.

How to invent an invention machine

OVER the years, Babbage has been fascinated by start-up companies. Start-ups bring novel technology to the marketplace in the hope of making a fortune for their creators by making life richer, easier, healthier or more interesting for their customers. Babbage professes no special talent for picking technological winners, still less for founding new businesses. That has not stopped him, though, from offering his opinions, sought or otherwise, to those founders of start-ups that he counts as friends. Nothing ever changes hands, other than a vigorous exchange of views. But from these, Babbage invariably learns a lot.For instance, one such start-up call it Company A has an analytics technology that could, in principle, be applied to any number of different endeavours. Some of these would be vastly more useful than others to society at large, but that utility does not necessarily coincide with maximum opportunities for profit. Sensibly, from their point of view, the founders have focused on the area with the largest margins of all: the fat-cat world of managing funds. That has allowed them to bootstrap their business without the drawbacks of seeking venture capital. But it has left a lot of other avenues unexplored.Babbage applauds Company A';s efforts, but believes the firm';s proprietary know-how could do wonders outside the narrow confines of finance for the public in general and for high-tech in particular. One thing he has been badgering the firm's founders to do is use their technology to create a universal, self-directed invention machine. This may sound a wild idea but it is not entirely a fool';s errand. The algorithms the firm has developed which had their origin in the decoding of genomes are remarkably adept at finding their way through a thicket of unknowns.As they are currently configured, Company A';s computer programs digest everything there is to know about firms quoted on the stockmarket: news reports, quarterly statements, regulatory documents, shareholder meetings, blog posts and even Twitter feeds. The firms are then ranked according to the likelihood that their share price will rise or fall over the coming days or weeks. Investment funds use such intelligence to speculate about how their stock selections will perform, and to assess the risks involved.Ah ha, you say, this is just deep contextual analysis, with a sentiment engine tacked on the front end. Indeed, it is at least in its present incarnation. But it does not extract sentiment from content in any of the usual ways.Much of the sentiment analysis done today relies simply on counting positive and negative words in a text and assigning an overall numerical score positive, negative or neutral based on this word-count. Another popular approach is to write a set of rules that classify all the words and clauses likely to be encountered in a text as having positive or negative implications, and then using the rule book to mark the text accordingly. Still others combine rules with statistical techniques developed for natural-language processing.Company A';s sentiment engine, by contrast, relies almost exclusively on artificial intelligence. Like human beings, it learns by being fed training data. It then builds on this to interpret the world around it, applying the various  patterns of relationships  (what humans might call "common sense") acquired along the way.Because the engine learns by experience, it can learn more or less anything. All it needs is the appropriate training data. So far, it has been taught to read Chinese and Japanese, as well as English. But it could just as easily learn to read molecular models, weather maps, geological data, political campaigns, terrorist threats, you name it.Babbage wants it to learn to read all about inventions, starting with the patent literature, to discover which combination of factors makes a particular invention novel, non-obvious and useful. In theory, an invention needs to satisfy all three of these requirements to be considered patentable (though, shamefully, many software patents granted these days fail on all three counts).

Such an invention machine could be a useful adjunct for enterprises seeking to create new drugs, devices, gizmos, materials or services. At the very least, it might tell firms what combination of chemicals, processes or components to consider, and then point to novel, non-obvious and useful ways of stringing them together.The things to tackle first would be those that people know they do not know the  known unknowns  that are out there waiting to be discovered or invented. As the machine became more adept, it might turn its attention to things people don';t know they don';t know the  unknown unknowns . That would be truly awesome.But enough of the flights of fancy. With feet more firmly on the ground, Babbage would like to propose two components he believes would be essential for any invention machine.

The first is serendipity the happy accident that can lead to breakthrough discoveries and inventions. Many of the most useful things around today penicillin, smallpox vaccination, X-ray machines started with fortuitous accidents. But they were not entirely the result of luck alone. In each case, the investigator concerned was sagacious enough to link various seemingly unrelated facts together to come up with a valuable conclusion. Making an invention machine smart enough to do that while harnessing serendipity would be a challenge, but probably not an insurmountable one.The second essential component of invention is imagination. Working out how to endow a machine with imagination stretches, well, the imagination. But teaching it to think outside the box might be done by getting it to mimic how children play. Starting at around 18 months, infants learn to move seamlessly back and forth between a make-believe world of imaginary roles and objects, and the real world that surrounds them.By the time they are adults, this ability to create personal realms within the mind using perceptions and experiences drawn from one's surroundings gets blunted by a surfeit of harsh reality. But it lingers on, in some people at least, as an aptitude for unfettered free-association. Clayton Christensen, a professor at Harvard Business School and the author of  The Innovator';s Dilemma , has identified associational thinking the ability to link unrelated ideas in different ways as one of the crucial factors for generating new concepts.So the question becomes how to create the training data that can be used to teach algorithms to free-associate. Babbage admits he does not have a clue how to go about this. But he feels sure artificial-intelligence buffs would have plenty of suggestions.Apart from being good at associating, a successful invention machine would need to question conventional wisdom at every turn, while experimenting continuously in order to glean serendipitous insights from unexpected results. In inventing the incandescent light-bulb, Thomas Edison America';s most prolific inventor, with some 1,093 patents to his name experimented with thousands of different materials before finding that carbon filaments could glow endlessly in a vacuum without burning up.The world needs more inventors capable of changing for the better the way people live, work and play. Regrettably, geniuses of Edison';s calibre are in short supply. Sooner or later, it seems, someone will just have to invent an invention machine.

NATIONAL NEWS
Bilderberg silence leads to speculation

A former Labour minister, a Ukip MEP and a US arch conspiracy theorist gathered in a field just outside Watford yesterday with one shared objective: to get the minutes of a meeting taking place inside the luxury hotel on the horizon.

Two hundred protesters were penned in by police and G4S guards in the English countryside where the Bilderberg group of political and business leaders has begun its secretive annual three-day event . Mercedes cars with blacked-out windows sped past, possibly transporting any of 140 people on the guest list.

Invitees ranged from George Osborne, chancellor, to Jos Manuel Barroso, head of the European Commission, and Eric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google, to Peter Sutherland, chairman of Goldman Sachs International.

"Scum!", "Maggots!" and "Pay your taxes!", demonstrators shouted at the cars, despite not being able to identify the passengers. Some refused to call themselves protesters, saying they objected to the lack of transparency, but could not protest against decisions they did not know about.

Michael Meacher, Labour backbencher and former environment minister, was among the throng. He said the secrecy surrounding the meeting was "utterly anti-democratic". He has asked the speaker of the House of Commons for an urgent question to demand Mr Osborne reveals any plans made in the red-brick hotel.

"This is arguably the most important meeting of the leaders of western finance capitalism this year," he said. "I don't think they attend for just the tea and coffee."

Mr Meacher was on unlikely shared ground with Gerard Batten, a Ukip MEP for London, who suspected decisions about Europe would be made.

"If they want to fix the world's problems, they do have to bring the people with them," he said.

Founded in 1954, Bilderberg was designed to foster dialogue between Europe and North America during the cold war. This year, it will discuss topics including growth, US foreign policy, cyber warfare, big data, Africa and the Middle-East.

Once cloaked in secrecy, it has been slowly opening up over the past decade: it has a website and publishes an agenda and a list of participants . It insists no resolutions are proposed and no votes are taken.

That assurance was not enough for protesters. Placards connecting the event with everything from eugenics to paedophilia show how silence from inside the building has led to speculation outside. "Bilderberg ate my hamster," read one banner draped across the metal barriers.

"We are assaulting the Bilderberg group with the search lights of publicity. Like Count Dracula!" bellowed Alex Jones, an American radio host and conspiracy theorist, in the middle of a swarm of supporters.

Other campaigners connected the meeting with real world events, drawing parallels between the lack of transparency and the lobbying scandal which has hit British politics in the past couple of weeks.

Hanging up at the heavily guarded entrance to the field of protesters, one sardonic sign read: "Lobbying register: all corporate lobbyists please sign in here."

What are the biggest changes likely to hit the ETF market in the next five years? The Wall Street Journal put this question to The Experts, an exclusive group of industry, academic and other thought leaders who engage in in-depth online discussions of topics from the print Report. This question relates to a "http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323826804578468933572113120.html" that discussed the growing number of exchange-traded funds and what this might mean for long-term investors and formed the basis of a discussion in The Experts stream on Thursday, June 6.

The Experts will discuss topics raised in this month's Investing in Funds & ETFs Report and other Wall Street Journal Reports. Find the finance Experts stream, recent interactive videos and other exciting online content at "http://online.wsj.com/public/page/journal-report-wealth.html?mg=inert-wsj"

Charles Rotblut: Actively Managed Funds Are Coming. At Some Point.

Actively managed ETFs always seem to be right around the corner. Though Pimco's Total Return ETF (BOND) has been a big success with $5.26 billion in assets, it has been the exception to the rule. Most actively managed ETFs haven't attracted a significant amount of investment dollars.

There have been filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission from various companies, raising expectations of ETF offerings from mutual-fund companies. I think these preliminary actions will eventually result in new actively managed ETFs.

The exact timing is uncertain, however, because of various issues surrounding disclosure. A big hurdle is that ETFs are transparent and the transparency could empower hedge funds to anticipate moves by active managers. This, in turn, could hurt the performance of the actively managed funds. It is both a regulatory and logistical hurdle that needs to be worked through.

Charles Rotblut ("https://twitter.com/charlesrotblut") is a vice president with the American Association of Individual Investors.

Matt Hougan: What's New? Not Much.

The biggest change is likely to be the lack of change. The big ETF providers will stay the big ETF providers. Sure, a few new challengers like Charles Schwab and Pimco (Pacific Investment Management Co.) will nibble significantly around the edges, but we won't see the big actively managed equity firms elbow their way into the space in a major way.

The reason is that ETFs have fundamentally shifted the way investors invest. People who invest in ETFs it skews toward the young and sophisticated- approach investing in a different way than users of actively managed mutual funds. They tend to take an institutional-style approach, focusing on asset-allocation strategies, where traditional beta-focused ETFs work very well.

The biggest thing that proponents of actively managed ETFs overlook is that, outside of a very select number of managers, actively managed mutual funds are sold, not bought. ETFs don't allow that, which will make pickup slow.

George Papadopoulos: Competition and Consolidation

I was an early advocate of broad-based ETFs. I remember years ago in conferences colleagues were always surprised I had decided to go to all-ETF portfolios. Some even insisted ETFs were a fad sure to die out. Instead, they grew 30% per year for a decade. Most of my skeptical colleagues have now jumped on board. I think ETFs will continue to grow and even make inroads in defined-contribution employer retirement plans. Two months ago, Charles Schwab announced they will introduce an all-ETF 401(k) plan!

I am actually concerned that ETFs may be getting too popular. Last year alone, 180 new ETF products were introduced. The continuous slicing and dicing of them has reached ridiculous levels. I am sure someone is working to introduce a medical-marijuana industry ETF right now. Therefore, I predict more consolidation in the ETF-provider market as they continue to compete against each other. The intense competition will accelerate the trend toward lower fees. William Shatner of Priceline ads fame comes to mind screaming "Lower, lower."

I am not a fan of active ETFs. I think their existence defeats the whole purpose of low-cost passive-investment management. I am sure some investors will eat them up after a few others post huge performance numbers for one year. I am also afraid they are here to stay.

Rick Ferri: Old-Line Funds Will Join the Action

Many old-line mutual-fund companies will aggressively enter the ETF market. Only a few brand-name firms have pursued this distribution channel to date. They include Vanguard Group, State Street Global Advisors, BlackRock, Invesco and most recently, Pimco. A long list of traditional fund companies plan to launch multiple ETFs. These include Fidelity Investments, T. Rowe Price, Legg Mason, J.P. Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and even USAA. These companies are primarily interested in issuing actively managed strategies through an ETF platform.

ETFs can be divided into four basic types. The first ETF type is a low-cost product that tracks a market index. The second type is a more expensive product that follows a "strategy index" that's specifically designed not to follow a market. The third type is a short-term, high-fee hedging vehicle that uses leverage and derivatives. The fourth and newest type is a pure active-management product where no index is used. Like all actively managed products, these funds are considerably more expensive than ETFs that track market indexes.

Rick Ferri is founder of Portfolio Solutions LLC and the author of six books on low-cost index fund and ETF investing. His blog is "http://www.rickferri.com/blog/".

Greg McBride: Even More Choices Ahead

There is already a plethora of ETF choices and the sheer number will continue to grow. In particular, investors will see more actively managed ETF options in what has been a predominantly index-oriented landscape.

Greg McBride ("https://twitter.com/BankrateGreg") is a senior financial analyst and vice president for "http://Bankrate.com", providing analysis and advice on personal finance.

Tom Brakke: More Active Funds and More Failures

The large mutual-fund families will continue to introduce actively managed ETFs, in an attempt to establish a presence in the ETF world in case those vehicles continue to gain market share. However, I would expect that many of the products introduced will fail. The biggest names and the best performers might be able to generate critical mass, but many of the fund families don't have a natural competitive edge in establishing new ETFs.

Speaking of failures, there will continue to be plenty of them. ETF sponsors have been chasing all sorts of specialized niches (and in many cases levering or "inversing" them), throwing products at the wall to see what sticks. Many won't. Investors should keep an eye on deathwatch lists to see if their favorites are among those that are likely to be terminated sooner rather than later.

Eleanor Blayney: A Race to the Bottom

Consider the humble corn flake. In the 1890s, John Kellogg developed cornflakes as part of the bland diet served at his Michigan sanitarium. The patients loved them. Dr. Kellogg's businessman brother then added sugar to the flakes and brought them to the mass market. Before long, Kellogg's Cornflakes were an American breakfast staple.

Since then, the corn flake has been endlessly copied, reinvented and repackaged. Every major grocery chain and food distributor in the world has its own flake cereal or derivative thereof. Today's competitive challenge is to create unique flake products such as gluten-free; with fruits, nuts, or honey; in serving-size packages; with pictures of Olympians on the boxes anything to charge more than a commodity price.

In 1975, Vanguard Group's John Bogle created an investment as unpretentious as the corn flake: the S&P 500 Index fund, which was a simple, low-cost way to get broad U.S. stock-market diversification for a low price. The first U.S. ETF, arriving two decades later, was based on the same idea: It held an unmanaged basket of S&P 500 securities. The difference was that the basket could be purchased on a market exchange, thus affording intraday trading, market orders, leverage and hedging through puts, calls and shorts.

Since then, index funds and ETFs have gone the way of the corn flake: What exists today and will be created tomorrow looks little like its humble, healthy prototype. The consumer will be increasingly confused by all the flavors, and the packaging will change far more rapidly than the contents. Pricing will likely go up as manufacturers pursue ETF active management, derivatives and synthetics.

In my opinion, ETFs served consumers best in their original manifestation: as simple, good-for-you investment fare that works as a staple in just about everyone's portfolio. Unfortunately, today's ETF providers seem to be racing to the bottom in an effort to create new and esoteric ETF products that may dazzle, but don't nourish, the average retail investor.

Larry Zimpleman: They Will Look More Like Managed Funds

The biggest change to the ETF market in the next five years is likely to be the growth in the "managed" ETF market. To date, most ETFs have followed different indexes and have focused on having low fees. It will be interesting to see where ETF fees go as ETFs begin to look more like managed funds.

New Zealand Dollar Down Late as Risk Appetite Fades

WELLINGTON, New Zealand The New Zealand dollar was lower late Thursday as risk appetite faded, after a session in which it hit a 12-month low.

"It seems that we get good news out of the U.S. and the Kiwi drops and when we get bad news out, the Kiwi drops," said Western Union Business Solutions corporate dealing manager Chris Hunter. "We saw last night that the weak ADP data hurt the U.S. dollar against the other majors, but against the other risk currencies they were the ones that took the hit."

U.S. private-sector jobs increased by 135,000 in May, showed a report by payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecaster Moody'sAnalytics. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expected 170,000.

The New Zealand dollar was at US$0.7910 compared with a 12-month low of US$0.7900 during the session, and US$0.8033 late Wednesday. It was at A$0.7910 from A$0.8353.

With little on the domestic agenda this week, the New Zealand dollar will continue to be driven by offshore events with attention on interest rate announcements from the European Central Bank and the Bank of England later in the global day, said Bank of New Zealand strategist Kymberly Martin.

"However, Friday night's U.S. payrolls data remain the most likely detriment to the New Zealand dollar's fate this week," said Ms. Martin. "After soft U.S. employment indicators &expectations for tomorrow's payrolls report are now likely quite low."

New Zealand government bonds due April 2015 fell 2.5 basis points to 2.595% and those due April 2023 fell 2.5 basis points to 3.595%.

The New Zealand Debt Management Office sold NZ$200 million (US$158 million) of inflation-linked September 2025 bonds at an average yield of 1.4804%. A local trader said they were sold near where the market had priced them before the tender.
