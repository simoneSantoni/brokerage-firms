Of the many advances in agriculture technology in recent years, many say the biggest benefit is the ability for farmers to share data that can lead to higher crop yields.

But for the millions of farmers in the developing world, data-sharing and analysis isn't possible when most of the industry doesn't have access to the internet.

So Wefarm Ltd., a London-based startup operating in a few African countries, created a digital network that connects small-scale farmers with agricultural information via old-style SMS.

The company, which was founded in 2015, just raised a $5 million seed round led by True Ventures, with participation from LocalGlobe and Accelerated Digital Ventures. Individual investors including Skype founder Niklas Zennstrom and Blue Bottle Coffee Chief Executive Bryan Meehan also contributed.

Wefarm is used by some 640,000 farmers in Kenya and Uganda, who can ask a question via SMS in their own language about anything agriculture-related, according to the company. Wefarm says it then applies ### invalid font number 2
machine learning### invalid font number 1
 to distill the most relevant answers from the network users.

Conducting business via basic mobile phones is common in Africa, where millions of people use mobile banking service M-Pesa to transfer money or even take out insurance policies. Wefarm Chief Executive Kenny Ewan said the familiarity with mobile phones quickly made the company popular with farmers, and the platform has a 90% user-retention rate.

He said the funding will be used to develop new features such as a digital farming assistant. Wefarm also intends to create a marketplace for buying and selling cropsimilar to what the Farmer's Business Network Inc. offers in the U.S. and Canada.

"Wefarm not only democratizes technology in a big but overlooked market, but it allows for a level of supply chain transparency you couldn't get anywhere else," said True Ventures co-founder Jon Callaghan.

James Bond flies a jetpack in the film 'Thunderball'etty Every so often I have lunch with a maths whizz who spent years in investment banking and is obsessed with the future of technology.

He is not a household name himself but he talks to a lot of people who are, and I always come away from our meal thinking about something to do with technology that I had not thought of much before.

This is not always cheering. My friend has long shared Elon Musk's fear that ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
 poses an existential risk to human civilisation.

And that was before last week's news that Amazon's Alexa digital assistant had been cackling creepily at startled owners for no apparent reason.

But I am also struck by how much working life could change if even a fraction of the technologies that companies are working on ever take off.

Being whisked to the office in a vacuum tube train would be a serious advance on the rush-hour Tube. Reading email through a bionic contact lens could be useful, though not as good as having a personal avatar answering my phone, or an invisibility shield I could whip out to dodge the approach of unwanted humans.

Yet what is truly likely to become a reality in one's lifetime? One of the UK's top universities has just had a stab at an answer. Imperial College London has an outfit called Tech Foresight that tries to help boardrooms understand what is happening in the lab and how it is likely to affect their company.

Bravely, it has ranked 99 technologies, from implantable phones to head transplants, according to how soon they could become ubiquitous.

The ranking is based on factors such as the number of companies working on a particular technology, the sums they are spending, whether people are likely to love or loathe the innovation and how disruptive it could be.

Number one on the list is something that is already here but will not shake the world: a smart nappy that promises to make the "sniff test" a thing of the past with a monitor that can alert parents to the need for a change.

Disappointingly, life-long personal avatar assistants are deemed to be at least 10 to 20 years away and vacuum tube transport is an even more distant prospect.

Like male pregnancy, it is not expected to be widely available for 20 or more years.

The same goes for a lot of other things I would not mind seeing sooner, including invisibility shields and artificially intelligent board members, which presumably would be no worse than some human versions.

On the upside, we could be closer to some helpful stuff, including human organ printing and artificial blood.

Other technologies seem too close to Big Brother for comfort. Public mood monitoring could be upon us in 10 to 20 years, according to the list.

This includes technology that could remotely read facial expressions or detect heart rates accurately enough to predict whether a football crowd is about to riot, says Nik Pishavadia, Tech Foresight's director of corporate engagement.

I am not sure about that. As Mr Pishavadia says: "There are some things that will be more or less acceptable to people and that will affect the route they take to market."

That brings us to the most frightening of the lot: artificial consciousness.

Comfortingly, machines that are not just merely smart enough to beat us at chess but could decide to grind us to a pulp if they felt like it are ranked at number 99 on the list.

Along with human cloning and telepathy, they are classed as "fringe science", meaning the technology is highly improbable but not impossible nd important to watch.

The Tech Foresight list is not comprehensive. I was sad to see it does not include personal jetpacks, which James Bond was using as far back as the 1960s, or even flying cars.

The authors say they had to draw the line somewhere.

They also warn that their list is supposed to provoke as much as predict and I hope it will.

In the meantime, I have resigned myself to answering my own phone, using the Tube nd staying away from Alexa for quite a while to come.

Keywords: Blockchain Has Power to Transform### invalid font number 1

We're now awash in "crypto" hype -- cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and fundraising efforts like initial coin offerings. For every venture capitalist or technical expert, there are a half-dozen hype men and fly-by-night startups making the entire space look like a 21st-century version of the Amsterdam tulip mania.

All that noise has obscured the bona fide efforts involving the underlying technology, blockchain. Of all the manifestations of crypto, it's the most seemingly mundane applications of blockchain that could lead to the biggest and most concrete changes in all of our lives.

These applications can't be found on a coin exchange, and they aren't going to turn anyone into an overnight billionaire. But they could bring much-needed change to some of the world's most critical industries. This means new ways of transferring real-estate titles, managing cargo on shipping vessels, guaranteeing the safety of the food we eat and more. Using blockchain, you could prove that a particular diamond on sale in a Milan boutique came from a particular mine in Russia.

What is blockchain? It's essentially a secure database, or ledger, spread across multiple computers. Everybody has the same record of all transactions, so tampering with one instance of it is pointless. "Crypto" describes the cryptography that underlies it, which allows agents to securely interact -- transfer assets, for example -- while also guaranteeing that once a transaction has been made, the blockchain remains an immutable record of it.

Blockchain has the power to transform industries for three reasons. First, it's genuinely well-suited to transactions that require trust and a permanent record. Second, blockchain typically requires the cooperation of many different parties. The third reason is that hype I mentioned. The excitement around cryptocurrency gives blockchain the visibility to attract developers and encourage adoption.

In this way, blockchain resembles "the cloud." While detractors argued that the cloud was just "someone else's computer," it gave many industries new business processes, disruptive startups and new divisions within existing companies, an ecosystem of supporting technologies, and new ways to charge for services. Blockchain has the same potential.

Take logistics. Already, 1.1 million items sold or on sale at Walmart are on a blockchain -- including chicken and almond milk -- helping the company trace their journey from manufacturer to store shelf. Global shipping company Maersk uses the same technology from International Business Machines to track shipping containers, making it faster and easier to transfer them and get them through customs.

While these projects are still a fraction of the overall tracking that goes on at these companies, they are expanding rapidly both within the organizations and across their industries. Other companies using blockchain technology to track goods include Kroger, Nestle, Tyson Foods and Unilever, says Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president of platforms and blockchain at IBM.

Everledger, a company started in April 2014 with the intention of creating a blockchain-based registry of every certified diamond in the world, already has 2.2 million diamonds in its registry. It's adding about 100,000 diamonds a month, says Leanne Kemp, chief executive and founder.

By recording 40 different measures of each stone, Everledger is able to trace the journey of a stone from when it's pulled from the earth to the day it's purchased by a consumer. Every participant in that chain, from the miner to the cutter to the retailer, maintains a node -- with a copy of the database -- in the Everledger blockchain network.

CartaSense is an eight-year-old Tel Aviv company that puts internet-connected sensors on freight pallets and uses ### invalid font number 2
analytics### invalid font number 1
 to determine when goods might be delayed or damaged. CartaSense customers use a blockchain database on which freight companies can record every stage of the journey of a package, pallet or shipping container.

Blockchain is being implemented first within companies and centralized governments that can move quickly on new technologies.

Dubai, for example, has declared its intent to make itself the "first blockchain-powered government in the world by 2020." That could streamline things in real estate, says Stephen McKeon, an associate professor of finance at the University of Oregon who studies blockchain. By moving the central record of all real-estate transactions onto a blockchain, Dubai could make it faster and easier to transfer property titles.

It's too early to say whether blockchain, as both a technology and a movement, has the power to overcome issues that thwarted generations of software engineers. The most justifiable skepticism is that blockchain is incremental, rather than revolutionary.

But if it works, it has the potential to be a fundamental enabling technology, the way new standards for transmitting data across networks led to the internet.

More concretely, it could someday underlie everything from how we vote to whom we connect with online to what we buy.

Insurance. Costs challenge

Express Scripts set to bring much-needed clout when buying drugs and services

With its $67bn takeover of Express Scripts, health insurer Cigna is sending a signal that it will have to get bigger to deal with the most pressing malady of US healthcare: soaring costs.

Express Scripts was the last large independent pharmacy benefits manager, or PBM, acting as middleman in negotiations between drugmakers and the payers mployers, insurers and government hat buy medicines in the US.

By buying the PBM, Cigna hopes to gain more scale so it can drive a harder bargain when buying drugs and services, not just from pharmaceutical companies but also the doctors and hospitals that provide patient care.

Since employers started funding healthcare during the war, the US system has fragmented into hundreds of for-profit companies, from insurers and private hospitals to blood-testing labs, pharmacies and drugmakers.

Although all these groups insist they put patients first, they have a competing duty to provide shareholder returns, and all have benefited in different ways as US expenditure on healthcare, adjusted for inflation, rose from $221bn in 1960 to $3.4tn in 2016, growing on average 5 per cent annually over that period. "The healthcare ecosystem puts tremendous pressure on our society, and by expansion on far too many individuals and families," said David Cordani, Cigna chief executive, on an investor call yesterday, adding that the deal would make it "more affordable" for its customers to access care.

With total US health expenditure forecast to hit $5.7tn by 2026, large employers from Walmart to IBM have started to worry that spiralling costs will eat into their profits, and are demanding change. "The impetus behind this is that major corporates are really angry that insurance vendors like Cigna have been unable to contain the increase in costs," says Roger Longman, chief executive of Real End Points, a health ### invalid font number 2
analytics### invalid font number 1
 company. "One of Cigna's points is that they'll have a lot more buying power after this deal."

That anger has prompted formation of various alliances between large groups. Most recently Amazon said it would start a venture with JPMorgan and Hathaway with a mission to lower costs. Forty large employers including American Express, Verizon and Coca-Cola have joined the Health Transformation Alliance, which is tasking the companies that provide healthcare to find ways to do more with less.

So far, the response of companies like Cigna and CVS Healthcare he drugstore chain which recently agreed to buy health insurer Aetna for $69bn as been to get bigger through megadeals, arguing that consolidation will give them the power they need to push down costs. Although the fragmented US healthcare system is still a far cry from the UK's National Health Service, these deals are at least in part designed to emulate some of the power wielded by "single payer" healthcare systems.

If a drugmaker wants to sell medicines to patients in the UK, it must agree to sell those products at a price deemed acceptable by the country's powerful gatekeeper, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, or forgo those sales. More often than not, pharma groups agree to sell their drugs at a considerably lower price in the UK, but insurers like Cigna and Aetna can only dream of having such power.

Drug costs are only part of the problem: although spending on medicines has been rising well above inflation specially for medicines prescribed by specialist doctors rugs still only account for roughly 15 per cent of total healthcare costs. A far bigger chunk of the cash bout 60 per cent oes to doctors and private hospitals, which earn more when spending is high.

To tackle that part of healthcare spending, Mr Longman projects that companies like Cigna and United-Healthcare, the largest insurer, will start buying hospitals and clinics, and change their business models so they are incentivised to bring down expenditure. One of the forces behind the CVS and Aetna deal was a plan to turn CVS's pharmacies into healthcare hubs, where Aetna's patients could be directed to receive low-cost care.

UnitedHealth has also moved into the "provider" sector, and in December spent $4.9bn on DaVita, which operates a network of clinics. It is still unclear, however, whether regulators in the US will agree that the megadeals being pursued by Cigna and CVS really are necessary to cut costs. Health insurers made much the same argument in 2015 when they tried to merge with each other in 2015 through big-ticket takeovers, but the Department of Justice blocked the deals. See Lex

Uber Retreats in Southeast Asia### invalid font number 1

Uber Technologies Inc. has reached an agreement in principle to sell most of its Southeast Asia operations to local rival Grab Inc., ending a costly fight for market share in the fast-growing region, according to people familiar with the matter.

In exchange for its operations in Southeast Asia, Uber would gain a roughly 30% stake in Grab, these people said. The two companies are still hashing out the final terms of the pact, the people said, cautioning any deal would be subject to regulatory scrutiny. One of the people said Uber's stake in Grab could wind up being smaller.

Uber was spending some $200 million annually to take on Grab and another upstart in the region, PT Go-Jek Indonesia, two of the people said. Go-Jek, a motorcycle-taxi service based in Indonesia, recently raised more than $1 billion in funding from KKR & Co. and Tencent Holdings Ltd., among others.

Uber and Grab spokeswomen declined to comment.

Bloomberg News earlier reported a deal was near.

A deal could relieve pressure on Uber's new chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, who is trying to shore up the company's finances ahead of an expected 2019 initial public offering. Uber posted a net loss of $4.46 billion in 2017 on sales of $7.36 billion.

Since taking the helm in September, Mr. Khosrowshahi has reached an agreement to sell the company's car-leasing business in the U.S. and settled a distracting lawsuit from Alphabet Inc. over trade secrets.

In recent weeks, Mr. Khosrowshahi vowed to keep fighting for market share in Southeast Asia, even in the face of hefty losses.

"We expect to lose money in Southeast Asia and expect to invest aggressively in terms of marketing, subsidies," he told reporters during a visit to New Delhi last month. Earlier in the month he said Uber was investing hundreds of millions of dollars in the region but that it is difficult to compete against locals.

"The economics of that market are not what we want them to be," said Mr. Khosrowshahi.

Uber has shown a willingness to cut its losses in markets where it is struggling to maintain market share. Last year it reached a deal to merge its Russian operations with Yandex.Taxi, forming a joint venture with parent company Yandex NV in exchange for a nearly 37% stake. And in 2016 it sold its Chinese business to Didi Chuxing Technology Co., amassing a 20% stake in Didi in the deal.

The talks with Grab involve all of Uber's major assets in the region, but a final deal could exclude small pieces of the Southeast Asian operations, people familiar the discussions said.

A deal would speak to the investment strategy of SoftBank Group Corp., which took a 15% stake in Uber in January for $7.7 billion. The Japanese firm is also a major stakeholder in Grab, Didi and ANI Technologies Inc.'s Ola, whose home market is India.

Beijing-based Didi is expanding to Japan in competition with Uber and recently bought out Brazil's 99Taxis, a popular taxicab app. Meanwhile, Ola and Uber are duking it out in Australia.

Uber, which is based in San Francisco, expects to seat Sprint Corp. chief Marcelo Claure and SoftBank partner Rajeev Misra on its board after a review of the SoftBank deal is completed by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S.

Uber and Grab have been racing to dominate the roads of Southeast Asia, home to 600 million people. The region's ride-hailing market is forecast to grow more than five times to $13.1 billion by 2025 from $2.5 billion in 2015, according to a report from Alphabet's Google and Singapore state-investment firm Temasek Holdings.

While Uber has tangled with regulators around the globe, Grab says it works closely with government authorities and better understands local habits. In the Philippines, for example, it offers rides on widely popular motorcycles with covered sidecars.

Grab has more monthly active users across much of the region than Uber, according to app ### invalid font number 2
analytics### invalid font number 1
 firm App Annie. A report in May of last year from consultancy Bain found users across Southeast Asia prefer Grab to Uber.

In Indonesia, the region's biggest country by population, both Uber and Grab are also grappling with GoJek. The startup has rapidly expanded from offering transportation to services such as package and food deliveries.

Private Equity's Trick to Make Returns Look Bigger; Most important performance number in the private-equity world is at risk of being massaged in a way that undermines the industry's credibility### invalid font number 1

. (March 9, 2018)

It is perhaps the most important number in "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-private-equity-risks-tripping-on-its-own-success-1518518193?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=3". It is also at risk of being massaged in a way that undermines the industry's credibility and adds dangers when a downturn comes.

The internal rate of return is the key performance metric published by private-equity firms. A percentage that measures annualized returns, the IRR is based on a complex set of numbers tied to fund cash flows. Investors use IRR to choose which funds to invest in.

But the growing use of hidden borrowing, known as subscription-line or bridge financing, is flattering the IRR figures some funds report.

It works like this: As funds identify investments, they traditionally call on their investors, known as limited partners, to pony up the cash they committed to supply when the fund was put together. But instead of calling that cash as soon as an asset to buy is identified, the funds borrow money to make the investment, tapping investors' cash later.

This began as a way simply to make capital calls more predictable for LPs, and in itself such borrowing doesn't boost a fund's cash profits.

But crucially it shortens the time during which investors' cash is actually in the fund. When you shorten the apparent time it takes to generate a cash profit, that boosts the IRRometimes in a very big way.

The trouble is, fund managers, investors and the consultants who advise them may not have an interest in rocking this boat: Internal rates of return are the key statistic that determines how much (and when) most of these people get paid. It also makes a good impression, say, with a pension fund investor committee that oversees how money is allocated among bonds, stocks and private equity.

But some investors are growing more worried about the damage that might be done by this borrowing. They fear first that it will increasingly distort returns data across the industry, making them less reliable.

Potentially worse is the risk that funds will face in a cash crunch if markets turn, banks withdraw the financing and some investors can't deliver their fund commitments, even after their money has in effect already been spent.

Huge jumps in IRRs can occur when funds use bridge financing and resell investments quickly, says Oliver Gottschalg, a professor at HEC, a French business school, and head of research at Peracs, a consulting firm that analyzes private-equity returns.

"For 80% of funds, short-term use of bridge finance lifts IRRs by less than a percentage point, but for a few, the IRR goes through the roof," he says.

Prof. Gottschalg's analysis is based on cash-flow data from 149 fully mature funds that began investing between 2003 and 2006. He recalculated their IRRs to add in simulated use of bridge financing on the funds' first capital call for up to 360 days.

Much of his work is based on bridge financing that lasts just 90 days. However, funds now regularly use it for six months or a year and some are pushing that to 18 months or more, investors say. The longer that funds hold investments without calling on investors' cash, the greater the boost to IRRs.

So who are the worst offenders? It's hard to say because most private-equity firms don't disclose this financing other than to existing investors. And while investor bodies are working to improve transparency, the industrywide returns data from consultants like Cambridge Associates or Preqin can't yet correct for the effects of financing. Nobody knows how important it is.

There may already be an arms race under way as firms compete to show the best returns data. At a time when private-equity deals are being done at high valuations and some think a downturn in markets is already overdue, this is a growing, hidden financial risk.

Searchlight Capital Partners will invest $150 million in Global Eagle Entertainment Inc., a publicly traded provider of connectivity services to the travel industry.

As part of the deal, Searchlight will receive $150 million aggregate principal amount of the company's new second-lien notes due June 30, 2023, according to a press release.

Global Eagle expects to receive net proceeds of approximately $142 million, after payment of fees and expenses. The company intends to use a portion of the proceeds to repay the full $78 million principal balance on the company's revolving credit facility and the rest for growth initiatives and other general corporate purposes, the release said.

The company will remain a publicly traded entity after the close of the deal, said Peter Lopez, vice president of investor relations for Global Eagle.

Los Angeles-based Global Eagle provides wireless internet services as well as content services and data ### invalid font number 2

 to airlines, cruise lines, commercial ships, yachts, ferries and land locations. The company has around 1,500 employees in 50 offices.

Barclays PLC acted as Global Eagle's placement agent for the deal.

Searchlight, which has offices in New York, London and Toronto, targets transactions including buyouts, growth-equity deals, recapitalizations and investments throughout companies' capital structures, according to its website.

The firm in January backed Italian wireless broadband provider EOLO SpA. It also agreed last week to sell Ocean Outdoor, a U.K.-based digital billboard company, to Ocelot Partners Ltd. for an enterprise value of £00 million ($246.4 million).

Kixeye raised $20 million in its Series D round. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the amount. (March 9, 2018)

The gaming company behind "War Commander: Rogue Assault" and "Battle Pirates" has fresh venture funding for the first time since 2011.

Kixeye Inc. has raised $20 million in Series D funding, led by Icon Ventures with participation from Ridge Ventures, Trinity Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners. The nine-year-old company is refueling its war chest as it invests in ### invalid font number 2

 and plans to release a new title later this year.

With the round, Lightspeed General Partner Jeremy Liew will return to Kixeye's board. Mr. Liew was on the board after initially investing in the company's seed round, but another Lightspeed partner took his position during a period when he was juggling several board seats.

San Francisco-based Kixeye gained notoriety for its bold approach in its early days, with Chief Executive Will Harbin releasing a YouTube parody of competing gaming companies such as Zynga Inc. and Kabam Inc. Mr. Liew said the company used these tactics when gaming was a hot and crowded category, and companies were looking for a way to stand out.

"Today the company's found a really repeatable motion around building its games and monetizing them," Mr. Liew said.

Mr. Harbin said Kixeye has achieved this through improving its business intelligence systems using ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
 to predict players' behavior. He said the company is now able to predict with high accuracy when a player might leave a game.

Kixeye has always offered free-to-play games, initially focusing on browser games through Facebook and other social networks. In recent years, the company has focused entirely on developing mobile games. It also briefly invested in virtual reality content, but later pivoted away from those efforts.

Mr. Harbin said the company has avoided taking funding from venture capitalists in recent years because there are "always strings attached." He said U.S. investors have increasingly hit the brakes on funding gaming companies and that investors in Asia have been much more active in the category.

Fiscal Stimulus Resolved the Fed's Inflation Conundrum

Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard's speech Tuesday night illustrates how an unprecedented fiscal policy experiment could make the Fed's debate over the path of interest rates a little smoother this yearnd a lot trickier after that.

Ms. Brainard had been one of the most articulate advocates for going slower to raise interest rates in the face of puzzlingly low inflation, including after last spring's surprising slowdown in consumer price pressures.

But on Tuesday she signaled those concerns had fadedot because the Fed's understanding of inflation has improved but because Washington has approved two big bursts of stimulus, first in December with a tax cut worth at least $1.5 trillion over a decade and later in February with a surprisingly large $300 billion, two-year increase in federal spending.

By moving closer to the center of the Fed's policy committee, Ms. Brainard illustrates how officials have grown far more confident about continuing with their gradual rate increasesither three or four quarter-point moves this year, including the Mar. 20-21 meeting.

This isn't to say more dovish Fed officials are done worrying about soft spots in the economy. Ms. Brainard called attention to the share of workers aged to 25 to 54 who are employed, which remains 1 percentage point below the level that prevailed before the financial crisis in 2008.

But she also placed more attention on upside risks in her speech, including an economy that overheats from financial imbalances and not just inflation. "We do not have extensive experience with an economy at very low unemployment rates and cannot be sure how it might evolve," she said.

If the Fed's 2018 policy path looks like it might have less of the tension between hawks and doves that existed last year, the path after this year looks more complicated.

The two-year government funding deal provides an especially large demand boost in 2019, when it is likely the unemployment rate will have fallen even farther below the level most officials expect is sustainable over the long run.

What happens, for example, if the unemployment rate drops further this year without signs that displaced workers continue to return to the labor market?

Ms. Brainard's remarks illustrate how Fed officials' debate may shift from how much to raise rates this year to how long to keep raising rates in coming years.

Key Developments Around the World

Fed's Brainard Sees Rate Increases as Appropriate as Inflation Firms

Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard said Tuesday she has become more confident inflation will hit the central bank's target, allowing officials to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-brainard-sees-rate-increases-as-appropriate-as-inflation-firms-1520380821?mod=djemCentralBanksAlertPro&tpl=cb" She also sounded more upbeat about the economic outlook, saying factors that held back the U.S. economy in recent years have reversed and now are offering a boost, in remarks prepared for a speech in New York. Today's economy "is the mirror image of the environment we confronted a couple of years ago," Ms. Brainard said. "In the earlier period, strong headwinds sapped the momentum of the recovery and weighed down the path of policy. Today, with headwinds shifting to tailwinds, the reverse could be true." Ms. Brainard in recent years was one of the Fed's most vocal advocates for patience in raising interest rates, noting that inflation remained subdued despite a strong labor market.

Fed's Kaplan: Central Bank Should Get Started on Rate Increases oon'--CNBC

Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said Tuesday "https://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-kaplan-central-bank-should-get-started-on-rate-increases-soon-1520344610" the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates three times in 2018, but said officials should get started "soon." In an interview with CNBC, Mr. Kaplan said the labor market appears to be at or beyond "full employment" already, and officials see the jobless rate falling below 4% this year. Fed officials in December penciled in three quarter-percentage point interest rate increases in 2018, and Mr. Kaplan said he still expects three increases this year. "I think we should get started sooner rather than later though, and we'll see as the year unfolds whether the base case should stay at three or it should be something more or something less," he said.

Gary Cohn Resigns as White House Economic Adviser After Losing Tariffs Fight

Gary Cohn will resign from the White House after 14 months serving as President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, he said Tuesday, days after Mr. Trump surprised his senior staff by announcing steel and aluminum tariffs that Mr. Cohn had opposed. During his time at the White House, Mr. Cohn oversaw a major revamp of the U.S. tax code and pushed a significant rewrite of financial rules. But the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive stumbled in an uphill and monthslong fight to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gary-cohn-to-resign-as-president-trumps-economic-adviser-1520376157". He was also on the losing side of an effort to prevent the U.S. withdrawal last year from the Paris climate accord, and will leave having made little progress advancing a $1 trillion infrastructure program.

Big Banks Get a Big Win in Senate Rollback Bill

Bipartisan legislation expected to clear the Senate as early as this week has just one provision that is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/megabanks-get-one-big-win-in-senate-rollback-bill-1520332201" the nation's megabanks: a section aimed at making it easier for them to buy state and local bonds. The provision, championed by Citigroup Inc. and other large banks, would ease a new rule aimed at ensuring banks can raise enough cash during a financial-market meltdown to fund their operations for 30 days, requiring them to hold more cash or securities that are easily salable. The Senate on Tuesday voted 67-32 to formally begin debate on the bill, which primarily benefits small and medium-size banks, easily reaching the 60 votes needed and signaling that the measure has enough support from Democrats to pass by a comfortable margin.

Bank of Japan to Keep Mum on Exit Details

The Bank of Japan isn't likely to outline its conditions for "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-japan-to-keep-mum-on-exit-details-1520409607" measures in the near future, despite Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda's recent willingness to talk about a time frame for considering an exit. The central bank is widely expected to leave policy on hold when it meets Thursday and Friday, but will keep mum on the meatier details of how it might pull back from its easing measures, despite calls from investors and politicians to explain its exit strategy.

Economists from 10 of the 11 primary dealers of Canadian government securities told The Wall Street Journal they anticipate the Bank of Canada will keep the key rate at 1.25% this week. While many expect at least two interest-rate increases later in the year, several acknowledged their forecasts could be in doubt if trade relations worsen.

BOE's Haldane Slams Central-Bank Speak, Promises to Listen

Much of what central bankers say and write "https://www.wsj.com/articles/boes-haldane-slams-central-bank-speak-promises-to-listen-1520360100", a practice that undermines public trust in policy makers, the Bank of England's chief economist said Tuesday. Andy Haldane was speaking after the publication of a report on building more public engagement in economic policy-making. The report found that just a fifth of Britons feel they have any influence on the economic policies set by the government or the BOE. Mr. Haldane highlighted language as a key obstacle to greater public engagement, accusing central bankers of using "the tribal language of technocracy." Mr. Haldane said the BOE is changing its approach to communication, recently employing a "layered" approach that includes simple graphics to communicate the main messages from its quarterly report on the outlook for the economy.

We also expect inflation to increase a little from its current low rate," Mr. Lowe said in a speech to a business conference. With the economy moving in the right direction, and interest rates still quite low, "it is likely that the next move in interest rates in Australia will be up, not down," he added.

The move was expected by economists after data released last week showed the country's inflation fell to its lowest point since December 2016. Malaysia's consumer-price index in January rose at a weaker-than-expected pace of 2.7% from a year earlier as growth in transportation costs weakened.

Central Banks' Gender Balance Deteriorates

The number of women in senior roles at central banks "https://www.wsj.com/articles/central-banks-gender-balance-deteriorates-1520356585", according to a new report that highlights the yawning gender gap at the world's monetary authorities. A gender balance index for central banks compiled by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a London-based think tank, fell to 19% in 2018, from 31% a year earlier. The index measures the number of men and women in top roles at central banks, weighted for factors including seniority and the size of the central banks' economies. A score of 100% would indicate that those roles are shared equally between the sexes. The decline in the index largely reflects the departure of a handful of women in the uppermost echelons of global central bankingarticularly that of Janet Yellen from the top job at the U.S. Federal Reserve in February, OMFIF said.

A New Way to Measure Growth and Development: The Inclusive Development Index

Richard Samans "https://voxeu.org/article/new-way-measure-growth-and-development" a new way to measure growth in a standard manner, given recent "political developments in many countries suggest that most of their citizens lack confidence in the assumption of the standard growth model that everyone in a society benefits from GDP growth." His "Inclusive Development Index" is "based on a dashboard of indicators in growth and development, inclusion, and intergenerational equity and sustainability." He finds in a VoxEU column, "The IDI's comparative data provide striking evidence that we cannot rely solely on strong GDP growth to generate inclusive socioeconomic progress and a rising median standard of living. GDP per capita growth is weakly correlated with performance for three-quarters of IDI indicators, including those pertaining to employment, income inequality, wealth inequality, median household income, public indebtedness and carbon intensity."

Low Rates Spur Reach for Yield

Low interest rates "https://voxeu.org/article/new-take-low-interest-rates-and-risk-taking", according to experiments conduction in the U.S. and the Netherlands by Yueran Ma and Wilte Zijlstra. In a posting on VoxEU, the two economists write that this behavior is partly driven by the use of a "reference" rate for acceptable returns based on experience. "We find that investment history has a significant impact on investment decisions or instance, when participants first make investment decisions in the high interest rate condition and then make decisions in the low interest rate condition, they invest substantially more in the risky asset in the low-rate condition," they write.

Have We Dodged the Secular-Stagnation Bullet?

Northwestern University's Robert Gordon posited "that the century after the US Civil War rom about 1870 to 1970 rought an unprecedented economic revolution, as innovations like electricity and piped water rapidly raised productivity and transformed people's lifestyles. In his view, today's innovations specially in digital technology, ### invalid font number 2

 ay be breathtaking, but they do not have the same broad productivity-raising potential," Kemal Dervi "https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/growth-acceleration-or-secular-stagnation-by-kemal-dervis-2018-03?a_la=english&a_d=5a9e8c4178b6c72560e52fcf&a_m=&a_a=click&a_s=&a_p=/section/economics&a_li=growth-acceleration-or-secular-stagnation-by-kemal-dervis-2018-03&a_pa=section-commentaries&a_ps=" for Project Syndicate. Recently, the expected return on investment has changed, he writes. "If, controverting Gordon's thesis, today's technologies do boost productivity significantly, the return on investment would rise (unless labor receives all of the gains in the form of higher wages, an outcome that nobody expects). That would lift the interest rate that balances supply and demand out of negative territory, solving [the] secular-stagnation problem."

Jury's Out on Central Banks' Resolve to Face Down Markets

"As far back as June 2014, the [Bank for International Settlments] said central banks were being too "hesitant" to remove stimulus "out of concerns about disrupting [financial] markets" and that "the risk of normalising [policy] too late and too gradually should not be underestimated,"" Nicholas Spiro "http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2135681/jurys-out-central-banks-resolve-face-down-markets" for the South China Morning Post. "Last week, Jerome Powell he bold new chairman of the US Federal Reserve... gave the strongest hint yet by a leading central banker that rising volatility in markets is not a sufficient reason to refrain from withdrawing stimulus," but "Powell is not the only prominent central banker who appears willing to test the resilience of stimulus-dependent markets more forcefully than has been the case up until now... One of the most important determinants of central banks' resolve to remove stimulus, and the litmus test of how investors will respond to the end of QE, is the shift to tighter policy in Europe... Powell may prove to be more hawkish than markets anticipate, yet the concerns of the BIS are likely to lie more with Europe's central bank."

China's government has "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-spends-more-on-domestic-security-as-xis-powers-grow-1520358522" spending on domestic security, official figures show, reflecting mounting concern about threats inside its borders as President Xi Jinping moves to acquire more power and reassert the authority of the Communist Party.

Fiscal Stimulus Resolved the Fed's Inflation Conundrum

Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard's speech Tuesday night illustrates how an unprecedented fiscal policy experiment could make the Fed's debate over the path of interest rates a little smoother this yearnd a lot trickier after that.

Ms. Brainard had been one of the most articulate advocates for going slower to raise interest rates in the face of puzzlingly low inflation, including after last spring's surprising slowdown in consumer price pressures.

But on Tuesday she signaled those concerns had fadedot because the Fed's understanding of inflation has improved but because Washington has approved two big bursts of stimulus, first in December with a tax cut worth at least $1.5 trillion over a decade and later in February with a surprisingly large $300 billion, two-year increase in federal spending.

By moving closer to the center of the Fed's policy committee, Ms. Brainard illustrates how officials have grown far more confident about continuing with their gradual rate increasesither three or four quarter-point moves this year, including the Mar. 20-21 meeting.

This isn't to say more dovish Fed officials are done worrying about soft spots in the economy. Ms. Brainard called attention to the share of workers aged to 25 to 54 who are employed, which remains 1 percentage point below the level that prevailed before the financial crisis in 2008.

But she also placed more attention on upside risks in her speech, including an economy that overheats from financial imbalances and not just inflation. "We do not have extensive experience with an economy at very low unemployment rates and cannot be sure how it might evolve," she said.

If the Fed's 2018 policy path looks like it might have less of the tension between hawks and doves that existed last year, the path after this year looks more complicated.

The two-year government funding deal provides an especially large demand boost in 2019, when it is likely the unemployment rate will have fallen even farther below the level most officials expect is sustainable over the long run.

What happens, for example, if the unemployment rate drops further this year without signs that displaced workers continue to return to the labor market?

Ms. Brainard's remarks illustrate how Fed officials' debate may shift from how much to raise rates this year to how long to keep raising rates in coming years.

Key Developments Around the World

Fed's Brainard Sees Rate Increases as Appropriate as Inflation Firms

By David Harrison

Federal Reserve governor Lael Brainard said Tuesday she has become more confident inflation will hit the central bank's target, allowing officials to continue raising interest rates gradually.

She also sounded more upbeat about the economic outlook, saying factors that held back the U.S. economy in recent years have reversed and now are offering a boost, in a speech in New York.

Today's economy "is the mirror image of the environment we confronted a couple of years ago," Ms. Brainard said. "In the earlier period, strong headwinds sapped the momentum of the recovery and weighed down the path of policy. Today, with headwinds shifting to tailwinds, the reverse could be true."

Ms. Brainard's mention of headwinds turning into tailwinds echoed language in Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's testimony to Congress last week, in which he expressed optimism about the economy's path.

Fed officials in December penciled in three quarter-percentage-point increases in their benchmark interest rate this year. The first move is likely coming at the March 20-21 meeting.

But the strong economy and Mr. Powell's congressional testimony have raised expectations that officials could add a fourth rate increase. The Fed last raised its benchmark federal-funds rate in December to a range between 1.25% and 1.5%.

Asked in a question-and-answer session after the speech about the potential for four rate increases this year, Ms. Brainard said that "we could see risks develop in either direction," which could result in changes to the path of rate raises.

Ms. Brainard in recent years was one of the Fed's most vocal advocates for patience in raising interest rates, noting that inflation remained subdued despite a strong labor market. Inflation has undershot the Fed's 2% target for much of the past five years.

On Tuesday, Ms. Brainard struck a more upbeat tone and suggested a booming labor market could generate stronger inflation.

"With greater confidence in achieving the inflation target, continued gradual increases in the federal-funds rate are likely to be appropriate," she said.

"Although last year we faced a disconnect between the continued strengthening in the labor market and the step-down in inflation, mounting tailwinds at a time of full employment and above-trend growth tip the balance of considerations in my view."

In particular, Ms. Brainard said recently enacted fiscal policy such as tax cuts and spending increases could boost economic growth. She also cited a stronger global outlook, a weaker dollar, higher oil prices, higher capital spending and financial conditions that continue to support growth.

Those factors could help pin inflation expectations around the Fed's 2% target, she said. Inflation could even exceed 2% temporarily in the next year or two, she added.

Ms. Brainard also said the Fed will need to make sure the improved outlook doesn't lead to the formation of new asset bubbles. For now, she said, the financial system faces only "moderate" risks because households aren't borrowing excessively and banks have enough capital on hand.

"History suggests, however, that a booming economy can lead to a relaxation in lending standards, and the attendant excessive borrowing can complicate the task of monetary policy," she said. "We will need to be vigilant."

Fed's Kaplan: Central Bank Should Get Started on Rate Increases oon'--CNBC

By Kate Davidson

Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Robert Kaplan said Tuesday he still expects the U.S. central bank to raise interest rates three times in 2018, but said officials should get started "soon."

In an interview with CNBC, Mr. Kaplan said the labor market appears to be at or beyond "full employment" already, and officials see the jobless rate falling below 4% in 2018. That should put some upward pressure on wages and create more jobs, but Mr. Kaplan warned, "the history of overshooting full employment in the United States and having a soft landing, it's not a long history."

Raising the Fed's benchmark federal-funds rate soon "will give us the best chance to extend this expansion for longer," he said.

Fed officials in December penciled in three quarter-percentage point interest rate increases in 2018, and Mr. Kaplan said he still expects three increases this year.

"I think we should get started sooner rather than later though, and we'll see as the year unfolds whether the base case should stay at three or it should be something more or something less," he said. "But for now I'd say three and I think we should get started soon."

The Fed's policy-setting committee will meet again on March 20-21, when markets expect officials will raise the fed-funds rate to a range between 1.5% and 1.75%.

Mr. Kaplan also suggested he wasn't overly worried about the Trump administration's recently announced plans to impose high tariffs on steel and aluminum imports.

Asked to weigh in on the tariff proposal, Mr. Kaplan said he didn't want to jump to conclusions about what might actually happen. He said he is concerned the announcement could have "some chilling effect" on ongoing trade negotiations with Mexico and Canada, but added, "It's so clearly in the interests of the United States to have a strong trading relationship with both of those countries, I'd be optimistic about how this actually gets implemented."

Mr. Kaplan said the recent trade discussion "probably won't" change his economic forecast. In an essay last month he said he expects the economy to grow strongly over the next year or two, prompting the Fed to raise interest rates "gradually and patiently."

He is concerned, however, that recent tax legislation and a new budget agreement boosting federal spending may turn out to be "a stimulus funded by increasing the debt," which might only give the economy a small boost over the next two years while increasing the country's leverage, he said.

"I think that leverage at the government level and the future path of debt could become a headwind for economic growth in the United States," he said.

Gary Cohn Resigns as White House Economic Adviser After Losing Tariffs Fight

By Nick Timiraos, Peter Nicholas and Liz Hoffman

Gary Cohn will resign from the White House after 14 months serving as President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, he said Tuesday, days after Mr. Trump surprised his senior staff by announcing steel and aluminum tariffs that Mr. Cohn had opposed.

During his time at the White House, Mr. Cohn oversaw a major revamp of the U.S. tax code and pushed a significant rewrite of financial rules. But the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc . executive stumbled in an uphill and monthslong fight to sway Mr. Trump against the tariffs. He was also on the losing side of an effort to prevent the U.S. withdrawal last year from the Paris climate accord, and will leave having made little progress advancing a $1 trillion infrastructure program.

Financial markets have seesawed in recent weeks, first on the prospect that higher federal budget deficits approved by Mr. Trump might boost inflation and interest rates and more recently because of his desire to start a "trade war."

Mr. Cohn's departure could further rattle investors. Though not universally well liked on Wall Street, Mr. Cohn was widely admired for his market savvy and his pro-trade world view, which many traders and executives share. The dollar slumped, and futures in the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down about 300 points, or 1.2%, late Tuesday.

Mr. Cohn said it had been an honor to serve in the administration as director of the National Economic Council and thanked the president in a statement. Mr. Trump praised Mr. Cohn's "superb job" as his economics adviser and called him a "rare talent."

The White House staff has seen numerous departures over the past year. A study by the Brookings Institution in January showed turnover in Mr. Trump's White House surpassed that of the previous five presidents' first year in office.

Since the study was published, Communications Director Hope Hicks, Staff Secretary Rob Porter and communications adviser Josh Raffel have also resigned, among others.

Mr. Cohn was part of a globalist wing of the White House that lately has been in retreat. Peter Navarro, another adviser who helped craft the president's protectionist stance in the campaign, prevailed in a high-profile fight over new tariffs on aluminum and steel imports. Mr. Cohn had fought internally to stave off the move and told aides last week he might resign if the president followed through and imposed the tariffs.

"I don't think he suddenly lost an argument. He just never won it," said Joshua Bolten , who served as chief of staff to President George W. Bush from 2006 to 2009. "He's done a very effective job through rational argumentation and maybe through bureaucratic maneuvering in staving off the day of reckoning."

As recently as early this week, Mr. Cohn still seemed to be fighting the decision, trying to put together a meeting among industry executives whose companies could be hurt by the tariffs. That meeting, which had been expected to happen later this week, was no longer being planned following Mr. Cohn's resignation, a White House official said.

Another White House official said in an interview Tuesday that Mr. Cohn had always intended to stay for about a year. This person said that Mr. Cohn wasn't resigning because of frustration or disappointment over Mr. Trump's decision to impose steel and aluminum tariffs.

Mr. Cohn wound up staying two months longer than he had anticipated because the president asked him to help with the State of the Union speech and a trip to a global economic conference in Davos, Switzerland, the official said.

Mr. Cohn, though, was unhappy about the "process" by which Mr. Trump last week announced that he would be imposing steel and aluminum tariffs, the official said.

This person described the process as one in which White House proponents of the tariffs, on their own, slipped into the president's office "at 6 o'clock at night" last Wednesday, then called steel and aluminum CEOS two hours later and invited them to a meeting the next morning, telling them the president would sign an executive order imposing the taxes even though no such order was ready.

"There is extreme frustration when the process breaks down," the official said. In this instance, the official said, the White House "nationalists hijacked the process."

One Wall Street executive who kept in contact with Mr. Cohn said a rotating group of colleagues and friends took turns urging him to stay. Some of these people said Mr. Cohn's departure hinted at the limits of trying to hem in Mr. Trump's desire to take more dramatic actions on trade.

On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers that the administration wasn't looking to get into a trade war. Later in the afternoon, Mr. Trump said, "trade wars aren't so bad."

The departure will put pressure on other advisers, especially Mr. Mnuchin, to make the case for preserving the post-World War II trade architecture the U.S. helped construct and for speaking credibly to financial markets.

"More than anyone else in the White House, Cohn had credibility with the markets," said Ian Katz, a financial policy analyst at Capital Alpha Partners in Washington. "If we go several days without news of a replacement, investors could get edgy."

The National Economic Council job post doesn't require Senate confirmation. An administration official said those being considered to succeed Mr. Cohn include Andy Puzder, a fast-food executive who withdrew his labor secretary nomination after domestic-abuse allegations from an ex-wife surfaced. Mr. Puzder has denied the claims.

The official said others who could be considered include CNBC commentator and former Trump campaign adviser Lawrence Kudlow; Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett ; and Mr. Navarro.

With Mr. Cohn's departure, several Goldman alumni who joined the administration last year will have left.

"Gary Cohn deserves credit for serving his country in a first class way," Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein tweeted Tuesday afternoon. "I'm sure I join many others who are disappointed to see him leave." Mr. Cohn had spent 26 years at Goldman was once seen as the likely successor to Mr. Blankfein.

Mr. Cohn grew up in Cleveland, where his first job was selling window frames and aluminum siding. He later traded silver on Wall Street and took a pay cut to join Goldman's commodities arm. He became a partner in 1994.

He has stayed long enough in the White House to keep tax-deferred treatment on more than $250 million in Goldman stock.

Early on, Mr. Trump enjoyed introducing Mr. Cohn as a former Goldman executive who gave up a lucrative career to work for him. In a Wall Street Journal interview in July, Mr. Trump mused about installing Mr. Cohn as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve.

But that nomination never happened. Mr. Cohn criticized Mr. Trump's response to the racially charged violence in Charlottesville, Va., and found himself isolated.

Mr. Cohn found his way back into Mr. Trump's good graces last fall by shepherding the president's tax cut package through Congress, delivering the president his signature legislative accomplishment.

Mr. Cohn performed so favorably that the president discussed with friends as recently as last month whether to install him as chief of staff, even though Mr. Cohn is a registered Democrat.

Big Banks Get a Big Win in Senate Rollback Bill

By Andrew Ackerman

WASHINGTONipartisan legislation expected to clear the Senate as early as this week has just one provision that is set to directly benefit the nation's megabanks: a section aimed at making it easier for them to buy state and local bonds.

The provision, championed by Citigroup Inc . and other large banks, would ease a new rule aimed at ensuring banks can raise enough cash during a financial-market meltdown to fund their operations for 30 days, requiring them to hold more cash or securities that are easily salable.

Under federal banking rules approved in 2014, those "high quality liquid assets" included cash, Treasury bonds and corporate debtut not municipal debt. Banks historically like to hold municipal bonds because of their safety and tax advantages.

The Senate on Tuesday voted 67-32 to formally begin debate on the bill, which primarily benefits small and medium-size banks, easily reaching the 60 votes needed and signaling that the measure has enough support from Democrats to pass by a comfortable margin. The legislation was backed by 16 Democrats and one independent, Maine Sen. Angus King, bucking Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and 31 other Democrats who opposed the procedural vote.

Including the municipal-bond provision in the deregulatory bill was a priority for the nation's biggest banks that buy a lot of municipal securities as investments. A Citi lobbyist recently told a Senate staffer that the firm would be pleased if easing the treatment of municipal debt under the bank-funding rule was the one thing it could accomplish during the current Congress, according to a person familiar with the conversation.

State and local officials have praised the move, saying their securities could suffer if banks begin to shun them.

A Citi spokesman said the bond provision "is supported by a wide array of groups focused on helping cities and states address critical infrastructure needs."

While the provision is a victory for Citi, the biggest U.S. banks haven't lobbied extensively on the Senate bill, according to congressional aides. Big firms have spent billions to comply with a gamut of postcrisis rules and generally aren't eager to tear them down.

Analysts have said changing the rule for municipal products would be a mistake because it would erode the core of a bank-safety rule put in place after the 2010 Dodd-Frank law. While municipal securities have relatively low default rates, they are traded thinly and shouldn't count as liquid assets, critics say.

"It's an outrageously bad idea," said Phillip Swagel, a professor at the University of Maryland who served in the George W. Bush Treasury, characterizing the provision as an implicit federal guarantee of the municipal market. In the next crisis, banks will have trouble selling their municipal securities, freezing up the market for them and requiring the government to step in to backstop it, he predicted.

While lawmakers agreed to include the municipal debt measure, they rebuffed Citi and JPMorgan Chase & Co . efforts to water down a separate postcrisis capital requirement known as the supplementary leverage ratio. That regulation effectively restricts banks from making too many loans without adding new capital, forcing firms to maintain a proportion of capital to fund their assetsncluding loans, investments and even the collateral clients post on derivatives transactions.

The legislation includes a provision to diminish the leverage ratio in a way that lawmakers say would only benefit financial institutions primarily engaged in "custody services," in which they hold assets on behalf of other banks. Citi and JPMorgan , global banks that don't fit the definition but still offer custody services, have argued it is unfair to carve out certain banks from the provision and not others.

"As Congress has sought to make a common sense change to the way capital rules treat custody assets, we have asked that they apply that change to all custody banks to maintain a level playing field in this important business," a Citi spokesman said.

Senate aides said lawmakers crafted a delicate compromise that can pass the chamber and don't want to broaden the bill with more provisions helping big bankshich became a target of criticism during the crisisnd risk having the bill fail. "That is not happening," said one Senate Democratic aide.

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said on Feb. 27 that the Fed would prefer that Congress allow regulators to rewrite the leverage ratio rule. Instead, the bill directs regulators to exclude certain assets from the calculation of the leverage ratio for custody banks such as Bank of New York Mellon Corp . and State Street Corp .

Bank of Japan to Keep Mum on Exit Details

By Megumi Fujikawa

TOKYOhe Bank of Japan isn't likely to outline its conditions for winding down its aggressive monetary easing measures in the near future, despite Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda 's recent willingness to talk about a time frame for considering an exit.

The central bank is widely expected to leave policy on hold when it meets Thursday and Friday, but will keep mum on the meatier details of how it might pull back from its easing measures, despite calls from investors and politicians to explain its exit strategy.

The reluctance to unveil any conditions or scenarios for exiting easing measures stems from concern over causing confusion or sparking sharp market movements, according to people familiar with the bank's thinking.

The central bank got another taste of how sensitive markets are to any sign of a move toward the door when Mr. Kuroda said Friday that the bank would likely consider a departure from its easing policy in the fiscal year starting April 2019.

The mention of the time frame was enough to nearly double the yield on 10-year Japanese government bonds and bump up the yen against the dollar.

Mr. Kuroda on Tuesday said the remark didn't necessarily mean the bank would start winding down its easing policy next year. He was giving testimony in a parliamentary hearing over his nomination for a second term. His nominated deputies, Masayoshi Amamiya and Masazumi Wakatabe, have also given testimonies.

The central bank governor's remark was seen as an attempt to reel in speculation that he was paving the way for the BOJ to wind down its massive monetary stimulus program.

Still, the BOJ will largely leave market participants to reach their own conclusions about when it will exit from its ultra-easy policy or when it might raise interest rates, provided no sharp market reactions take place, the people said.

Some economists expect the bank to consider raising its target for the 10-year JGB yieldurrently set at 0%f the so-called core-core inflation, which excludes volatile fresh food and energy prices, hits 1%alfway toward the bank's goal. Core-core inflation rose to 0.4% in January.

Other analysts have said the bank might conduct another comprehensive assessment of its measures before adjusting policy, but Mr. Kuroda has previously said that an assessment wasn't under consideration.

The denial suggests he doesn't see a major flaw in the program and that rate adjustments could happen without publishing such a report, some of the people said.

Once momentum toward 2% inflation is assured, the bank said it could raise rates before inflation reaches the target, because its policy commitment focuses on keeping monetary conditions loose, rather than on any specific rate levels.

But another factor that might delay a presentation of an exit strategy is a lack of consensus among policy setters at the bank about how best to define "momentum" toward 2% inflation, some of the people said.

The bank is expected at this week's meeting to maintain its 0% yield target on 10-year JGBs and its minus 0.1% rate on some deposits held by commercial banks at the central bank.

Bank of Canada Expected to Stand Pat Amid Trade Uncertainty

By Kim Mackrael

OTTAWAhe growing uncertainty over Canada's trade ties with the U.S. is reinforcing expectations that the Bank of Canada will hold its benchmark interest rate steady in its policy announcement Wednesday.

Economists from 10 of the 11 primary dealers of Canadian government securities told The Wall Street Journal they anticipate the Bank of Canada will keep the key rate at 1.25% this week. While many expect at least two interest-rate increases later in the year, several acknowledged their forecasts could be in doubt if trade relations worsen.

The 11th primary dealer, HSBC Canada , didn't participate in the survey.

Wednesday's rate decision comes less than a week after U.S. President Donald Trump announced plans for global tariffs on steel and aluminum, blindsiding Canadian officials and stoking fears of a possible trade war. Meanwhile, efforts to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement , or Nafta, have made limited progress. Canada sends about three quarters of its exports to the U.S., so any disruption in trade flows between the two countries would have a significant impact on the Canadian economy.

BMO Capital Markets is one of several firms forecasting two more rate increases later this year. "Given what's unfolding in trade, there's a clear risk there might actually be less than that," chief economist Doug Porter said. "I'm not too worried about the upside, I'm more worried about the downside to the rate call at this point."

After raising the key rate by a quarter percentage point in Januaryhe third such increase since mid-2017he central bank said Canada's economic outlook likely would warrant higher interest rates over time. However, it said it would take a cautious approach to increases, citing uncertainty over Nafta and worries about soaring household debt.

Canada's economic outlook has faced several setbacks since then. A series of strong employment reports came to an end with January's jobs data, which saw the economy drop a net 88,000 jobs. Canada's gross domestic product came in below market expectations in the fourth quarter, and a Statistics Canada survey released last week suggests business investment could slow considerably this year, led by a pullback in the country's energy sector.

"At risk is the Bank of Canada 's story that we had cause to be more optimistic because we were seeing the rotation away from excess reliance on the household sector and towards more encouraging evidence on the export and investment side of the picture," Bank of Nova Scotia economist Derek Holt said.

He said he doesn't expect much additional guidance from the central bank during its announcement this week.

"There's so much uncertainty hanging in the air that I think [the central bank] will want to make this one largely a maintenance statement and not rock the boat too much in either direction," Mr. Holt said.

This week marks the first time the Bank of Canada will provide an update on the country's economic outlook after issuing an interest-rate decision that isn't accompanied by a monetary policy report. Bank of Canada deputy governor Timothy Lane will deliver an economic progress report in a speech in Vancouver, British Columbia, on Thursday.

BOE's Haldane Slams Central-Bank Speak, Promises to Listen

By Paul Hannon

Much of what central bankers say and write is incomprehensible to most people, a practice that undermines public trust in policy makers, the Bank of England's chief economist said Tuesday.

Andy Haldane was speaking at an event hosted by the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, or RSA, following the publication of its report on building more public engagement in economic policy-making.

The report found that just a fifth of Britons feel they have any influence on the economic policies set by the government or the BOE.

Mr. Haldane highlighted language as a key obstacle to greater public engagement, accusing central bankers of using "the tribal language of technocracy."

He noted that 70 years ago, BOE officials made just one speech a year, and the central bank's total communication with the public amounted to fewer than 5,000 words. Last year, that stood at 4.5 million words.

However, he said they weren't well chosen, estimating that 95% would have been "inaccessible" to 95% of the British population.

"Imagine speaking 4½illion words and more than 4¼illion of them falling on deaf ears?" he said. "When someone says to me poken like a true central banker,' they come to bury Andy not praise him."

Mr. Haldane said the BOE is changing its approach to communication, recently employing a "layered" approach that includes simple graphics to communicate the main messages from its quarterly report on the outlook for the economy.

He also said the BOE would implement an RSA recommendation to set up a series of "regional citizens councils."

"The aim is to establish, in a structured, systematic and comprehensive way, a two-way dialogue and collaboration between the bank and a panel of citizen representatives on the economy, financial system and policy, as a means of enhancing the understanding of both parties," Mr. Haldane said.

Australia's Central Bank Chief Sees Economy Moving in Right Direction

By James Glynn

SYDNEYlobal investors should be confident that Australia is on track for higher economic growth and rising inflation, albeit gradually, Reserve Bank of Australia Gov. Philip Lowe said Wednesday.

In a speech to a business conference, Mr. Lowe said the best contribution the RBA can make to ensuring Australia attracts foreign investment is consistent macroeconomic conditions.

"Investors should have confidence that, over time, [consumer-price index] inflation in Australia will average between 2 and 3 percent. They can expect some variation from year to year, but over the medium term the average inflation rate will be 2 point something," he said.

"Our assessment is that the economy is moving in the right direction. We expect stronger growth in 2018 than in 2017 and a further reduction in the unemployment rate. We also expect inflation to increase a little from its current low rate," Mr. Lowe said.

With the economy moving in the right direction, and interest rates still quite low, "it is likely that the next move in interest rates in Australia will be up, not down," he added.

The comments come after the RBA left its cash rate at a record low 1.5% Tuesday. It was the 19th month in a row with no change in interest rates, with economists expecting the period of inactivity to stretch into 2019.

Bank Indonesia Managing Rupiah to Reflect Fundamentals

By I Made Sentana

JAKARTA, IndonesiaIndonesia's central bank said Wednesday that it would try to keep the rupiah in line with the country's improving economic fundamentals.

"Bank Indonesia is consistently and cautiously responding to the current (fluctuation) in the rupiah's exchange rate to maintain macroeconomic stability," Gov. Agus Martowardojo said.

The rupiah has fallen 1.5% against the U.S. dollar so far this year, as investors have bought the dollar amid expectations of further tightening by the Federal Reserve. President Donald Trump's recent trade-war rhetoric has also unnerved investors.

The Indonesian currency was recently at 13,763 to the dollar, its lowest level since Jan. 29, 2016, according to Bank Indonesia 's exchange-rate guidance.

Mr. Martowardojo said Indonesia's economy should be able to weather the current shift in the global economy given improving fundamentals, with inflation easing, the current-account deficit narrowing, foreign-exchange reserves rising and a healthy budget.

He added that the central bank will continue to sell dollars in the domestic currency market to limit volatility.

Separately, senior deputy governor Mirza Adityaswara indicated that the central bank doesn't currently plan to raise interest rates to defend the rupiah.

Bank Indonesia left the benchmark 7-day reverse repo rate unchanged at 4.25% last month.

Japan-based Rating and Investment Information on Wednesday raised its rating on Indonesia's creditworthiness to BBB from BBB-, citing the economy's growing resilience to external shocks.

Malaysian Central Bank Stands Pat on Benchmark Rate

By Yantoultra Ngui

KUALA LUMPUR, MalaysiaMalaysia's central bank kept interest rates unchanged on Wednesday.

The move was expected by economists after data released last week showed the country's inflation fell to its lowest point since December 2016. Malaysia's consumer-price index in January rose at a weaker-than-expected pace of 2.7% from a year earlier as growth in transportation costs weakened.

All 11 economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expected Bank Negara Malaysia to hold its overnight policy rate, or OPR, at 3.25%. The bank raised the OPR by a quarter of a percentage point in January.

"At the current level of the OPR, the degree of monetary accommodativeness is consistent with the policy stance to ensure that the domestic economy continues on a steady growth path amid lower inflation," Bank Negara Malaysia said in a statement.

The stand-pat decision signals that a softening of inflation, continued local-currency strength and a coming general election have led Bank Negara Malaysia to stay put for the moment.

Another increase just ahead of the election, due by August, would be unpopular with voters who would have a costlier household debt burden. Malaysia's household debt is among the highest in Asia.

A possible global trade war following the U.S.'s plan to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum might negatively impact trade-dependent Malaysia, despite the release of data on Monday showing that January's export growth picked up faster than expected. Strong exports helped Malaysia's economy to grow by 5.9% in 2017.

Bank Negara Malaysia acknowledged the trade tensions but said "at this point, risks to the global growth outlook remain balanced, pointing towards continuity in global economic expansion."

For Malaysia, the bank said growth prospects will be sustained by the positive global growth outlook and spillovers from the external sector to the domestic economy.

"With additional impetus from the external sector, growth is expected to remain strong in 2018," it added.

Bank Negara Malaysia also said inflation was projected to average lower in 2018, on expectations of a smaller effect from global cost factors. A stronger ringgit exchange rate compared with 2017 will mitigate import costs, it added.

The Malaysian government projected inflation to slow to between 2.5% and 3.5% this year from 3.7% in 2017. The ringgit has been one of Asia's best-performing currencies this year, rising 3.5% year-to-date.

Central Banks' Gender Balance Deteriorates

By Jason Douglas

The number of women in senior roles at central banks has fallen over the past year, according to a new report that highlights the yawning gender gap at the world's monetary authorities.

A gender balance index for central banks compiled by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, a London-based think tank, fell to 19% in 2018, from 31% a year earlier.

The index measures the number of men and women in top roles at central banks, weighted for factors including seniority and the size of the central banks' economies. A score of 100% would indicate that those roles are shared equally between the sexes.

The decline in the index largely reflects the departure of a handful of women in the uppermost echelons of global central bankingarticularly that of Janet Yellen from the top job at the U.S. Federal Reserve in February, OMFIF said.

Just 11 of 173 institutions surveyed were headed by a woman at the end of 2017, including the central banks of Russia, Ecuador and Cyprus.

At the Fed, one woman, Lael Brainard, holds a seat on the seven-member Fed board of governors, which has four vacant slots. Two of 12 regional Fed bank presidents are female.

The findings will make uncomfortable reading for central banks, many of which are under growing political pressure to better reflect the citizens of the economies they serve. Critics say the lack of diversity also leaves central banks vulnerable to groupthink, risking policy errors.

OMFIF's report also looked at gender balance at sovereign-wealth funds and European public pension funds. Sovereign funds fared worse than central banks, with a score of 12%, while the pension funds managed 40%.

ECB's Easing Bias t Odds' With Buoyant Conditions: Fitch Ratings

The European Central Bank 's easing bias appears to be out of sync with the economic backdrop. In particular, the ECB's commitment to increase asset purchases in terms of size and/or duration if needed "sits at odds with current buoyant conditions," says Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings . The ratings firm expects that strong eurozone growth momentum and greater confidence by the ECB that underlying inflation will pick up over the forecast horizon will necessitate modest changes to its language, Mr. Coulton says.

Doves to Beat Hawks in Eurotower Rumble

It might sound like the preview for a major sporting event, but central-bank fans know what's at stake. At the European Central Bank 's meeting Thursday, the doves will "hold off" the hawks, resulting in the bank leaving its guidance unchanged, Berenberg writes in a note. "For the rest of the year, we believe the ECB is likely to normalize its monetary stance via further baby steps," says Berenberg. It expects quantitative easing to be cut to ¬5 billion ($18.5 billion) a month from ¬0 billion in October, before being ended in December. The first increase to the refinancing rate will be in June next year, Berenberg says.

ECB Rate Rise Before 2nd Half 2019 Would Be Surprise: J.P. Morgan AM

The European Central Bank is likely to end its quantitative-easing program this year, but it won't rush to raise interest rates, says Mike Bell of J.P. Morgan Asset Management in a note Tuesday. "We would be surprised to see core eurozone inflation rise anywhere near to target by the end of this year. As a result, while the ECB are likely to end QE this year, we don't think they will be in any rush to raise interest rates," he says. "We would be surprised to see a rate hike from the ECB before the second half of 2019."

Swiss National Bank Seen on Hold Until Early 2020: Capital Economics

Switzerland's very subdued inflation rate should keep the Swiss National Bank 's policies unchanged until early 2020, say analysts at Capital Economics. Annual Swiss inflation was 0.6% last month, and core inflation was 0.5%. "Worryingly for the SNB, the inflation rate for domestically-produced goods was again unchanged at +0.3%, suggesting that the renewed strength of the economy in the second half of 2017 has not yet put upward pressure on domestic prices," the analysts wrote. The SNB meets next week and is widely expected to keep its deposit rate at minus 0.75%.

Still, "of course, we cannot rule out that the SNB does still actively influence the exchange rate from time to time," Commerzbank says. February data on Switzerland's exchange reserves are due Wednesday.

Norway Oil Fund's Ethical Investing Principles Yield Lower Returns

Norway's sovereign-wealth fund, the world's largest such fund, has seen lower returns than it otherwise would due to its ethical investing principles, it said in a report on risk and return published Tuesday. Norges Bank Investment Management , the arm of the central bank that manages the so-called oil fund, said that over the last 12 years its equity investments have returned 1.6 percentage points less as a result of excluding companies that don't meet its ethical guidelines. The $1 trillion fund doesn't invest in companies that produce tobacco or weapons, or those that contribute to serious human rights violations. It also has been pulling out of companies that threaten severe environmental damage through unacceptable greenhouse gas emissions. A recent addition to its guidelines has seen it stop investing in mining companies and power producers that derive 30% or more of their revenue from thermal coal. In 2017, the fund returned 19.4% on its equity investments, contributing to a total annual return including other investments of 1.03 trillion Norwegian kroner ($131.8 billion), the highest return in krone terms it has ever recorded.

New Record for RBA Inactivity Should Last a While

Seventeen policy meetings and 19 months have passed (Australia's central bank doesn't meet in January) since interest rates were last changed in Australia, equaling the record set in the mid-1990s. It could be at least 20 more years before the soon-to-occur new record is broken as the Reserve Bank of Australia won't be moving for a while yet. Shane Oliver, chief economist at AMP Capital, says the probability is increasing that the central bank won't start raising rates until sometime in 2019 as uncertainty around consumer spending remains high, wage growth and inflation are still low, and the Aussie dollar is arguably too strong.

Food to Help Cool India's CPI for Now

Standard Chartered sees India's consumer-price index on pace to come in below the central bank's 5.1% target for this quarter, thanks to falling food prices.

But StanChart does admit that a spike in oil prices, an expansion in the coverage of state-purchase prices for more crops or a sharper-than-expected growth recovery may pose risks to that rate call.

A New Way to Measure Growth and Development: The Inclusive Development Index

Richard Samans "https://voxeu.org/article/new-way-measure-growth-and-development" a new way to measure growth in a standard manner, given recent "political developments in many countries suggest that most of their citizens lack confidence in the assumption of the standard growth model that everyone in a society benefits from GDP growth." His "Inclusive Development Index" is "based on a dashboard of indicators in growth and development, inclusion, and intergenerational equity and sustainability." He finds in a VoxEU column, "The IDI's comparative data provide striking evidence that we cannot rely solely on strong GDP growth to generate inclusive socioeconomic progress and a rising median standard of living. GDP per capita growth is weakly correlated with performance for three-quarters of IDI indicators, including those pertaining to employment, income inequality, wealth inequality, median household income, public indebtedness and carbon intensity."

Low Rates Spur Reach for Yield

Low interest rates "https://voxeu.org/article/new-take-low-interest-rates-and-risk-taking", according to experiments conduction in the U.S. and the Netherlands by Yueran Ma and Wilte Zijlstra. In a posting on VoxEU, the two economists write that this behavior is partly driven by the use of a "reference" rate for acceptable returns based on experience. "We find that investment history has a significant impact on investment decisions or instance, when participants first make investment decisions in the high interest rate condition and then make decisions in the low interest rate condition, they invest substantially more in the risky asset in the low-rate condition," they write.

Have We Dodged the Secular-Stagnation Bullet?

Northwestern University 's Robert Gordon posited "that the century after the US Civil War rom about 1870 to 1970 rought an unprecedented economic revolution, as innovations like electricity and piped water rapidly raised productivity and transformed people's lifestyles. In his view, today's innovations specially in digital technology, ### invalid font number 2

 ay be breathtaking, but they do not have the same broad productivity-raising potential," Kemal Dervi "https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/growth-acceleration-or-secular-stagnation-by-kemal-dervis-2018-03?a_la=english&a_d=5a9e8c4178b6c72560e52fcf&a_m=&a_a=click&a_s=&a_p=/section/economics&a_li=growth-acceleration-or-secular-stagnation-by-kemal-dervis-2018-03&a_pa=section-commentaries&a_ps=" for Project Syndicate. Recently, the expected return on investment has changed, he writes. "If, controverting Gordon's thesis, today's technologies do boost productivity significantly, the return on investment would rise (unless labor receives all of the gains in the form of higher wages, an outcome that nobody expects). That would lift the interest rate that balances supply and demand out of negative territory, solving [the] secular-stagnation problem."

Jury's Out on Central Banks' Resolve to Face Down Markets

"As far back as June 2014, the [Bank for International Settlments] said central banks were being too "hesitant" to remove stimulus "out of concerns about disrupting [financial] markets" and that "the risk of normalising [policy] too late and too gradually should not be underestimated,"" Nicholas Spiro "http://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/2135681/jurys-out-central-banks-resolve-face-down-markets" for the South China Morning Post. "Last week, Jerome Powell he bold new chairman of the US Federal Reserve... gave the strongest hint yet by a leading central banker that rising volatility in markets is not a sufficient reason to refrain from withdrawing stimulus," but "Powell is not the only prominent central banker who appears willing to test the resilience of stimulus-dependent markets more forcefully than has been the case up until now... One of the most important determinants of central banks' resolve to remove stimulus, and the litmus test of how investors will respond to the end of QE, is the shift to tighter policy in Europe... Powell may prove to be more hawkish than markets anticipate, yet the concerns of the BIS are likely to lie more with Europe's central bank."

China's government has "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-spends-more-on-domestic-security-as-xis-powers-grow-1520358522" spending on domestic security, official figures show, reflecting mounting concern about threats inside its borders as President Xi Jinping moves to acquire more power and reassert the authority of the Communist Party.

China Weighs Boost for Markets --- Tencent and Alibaba, already listed abroad, would get clearance to trade on home turf### invalid font number 1

BEIJING -- The Chinese government is considering plans that would allow shares in technology giants such as Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to trade back home, a move that could raise the profile of the country's tightly controlled capital markets.

The country's securities regulator has reached out to a number of state-owned investment banks to explore ways to let already-listed companies and private businesses issue shares on the mainland, according to investment bankers briefed on the discussions.

One option being considered is to allow such companies to issue depositary receipts, so they can bypass Chinese law prohibiting firms incorporated overseas from going public on the mainland. The likes of Tencent and Alibaba are incorporated abroad in a special corporate structure so they can get around Chinese restrictions on foreigners investing in sectors such as technology.

It is part of China's longer-term goal to turn the tide on years of the country's businesses going public overseas. Beijing would like to see more Chinese companies choose the mainland capital market as their primary listing destination eventually, the investment bankers said.

"At some point, it makes sense for Alibaba and Tencent to have their primary listings in China," said Paul Gillis, an accounting professor at Peking University's Guanghua School of Management. "The government has a long-term plan to wean these companies off the U.S.," he added.

Tencent and Alibaba are already among the world's most valuable companies, and China has earmarked technologies such as ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
 as important growth drivers for the country's economy.

Shares in Hong Kong-listed Tencent -- the owner of China's most popular messaging app, WeChat -- more than doubled last year. In the process Tencent became the first Chinese tech company to crack the $500 billion valuation club, joining industry titans such as Facebook Inc. and Apple Inc.

NYSE-listed shares of Alibaba, China's largest e-commerce company, almost doubled last year. Alibaba now has a market capitalization of more than $460 billion.

Recently, a number of tech firms said they are open to a China listing, though executives haven't gone into details. Tencent Chief Executive Pony Ma said the company would "actively consider" listing inside China. Baidu Inc. Chairman Robin Li said recently that the search-engine company has "always wanted to come home to China." Richard Liu, chairman of Nasdaq-listed e-commerce company JD.com Inc., said "if the authorities allow it, we are willing." The executives were speaking on the sidelines of China's annual legislative meetings, currently taking place in Beijing.

Chinese technology firms have in the past often opted for overseas listings, many in the U.S., for the prestige and to benefit from rules allowing dual-class share structures that give company owners more control over the business. The Chinese regulator's tough listing rules, such as the requirement for companies to be profitable for three years before listing, have also deterred high-growth technology firms from seeking direct share sales at home.

The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Chinese regulators have already approached smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp., which has plans to go public in Hong Kong. Investors say it would be sensible for China's tech companies to list at home, given the brand awareness they command there and the likelihood their shares would trade at high valuations.

Still, analysts have some concerns. Depending on how contracts are drawn up, Chinese individual investors buying depository receipts could lack full shareholder rights, they say. The listings of a few hot names could also fuel speculation by Chinese individual investors, who dominate trading on the mainland.

"When the government is supporting something, everyone rushes in," said T.J. Wong, a professor of business administration and accounting at the University of Southern California's Marshall School of Business. "What you don't want is a huge bubble, then a burst."

Chinese companies often have to wait years before getting approval from the market regulator to list their shares. The authorities would likely expedite this process for some tech companies, the investment bankers said.

Letting a number of top-quality companies issue shares on the mainland could help the Chinese market mature, analysts said.

International Property Report: Europe: Banks Throw Off the Lending Shackles --- Real-estate loans are on the rise as lenders ramp up business and compete on rates### invalid font number 1

When Spain's Bankia SA received a bailout in 2012, it was prohibited from making the kind of real-estate loans that triggered the bank's implosion.

That ban expired on Jan. 1 and, like other Spanish lenders, Bankia is now jumping at the opportunity to finance real-estate projects again.

"It's a good time to be in the sector; in terms of growth, the cycle still has upside," said Alberto Manrique, head of real-estate development finance at Bankia, Spain's fourth-largest bank by market capitalization.

With the European economy expanding and most of banks' balance sheets restored to health, many European financial institutions are boosting loan volumes in their real-estate lending businesses and competing aggressively on rates.

BNP Paribas SA increased its portfolio of commercial real-estate loans by double-digit percentages in 2016 and again in 2017, said Gilles Polet, head of European real-estate finance for corporate and institutional banking at the Paris-based bank. Its 40 deals last year included a 625 million euros ($771 million) refinancing of the Dundrum Town Centre, one of Ireland's largest shopping malls.

Paris-based Natixis SA, meanwhile, has emerged as one of the most active lenders in the U.S. market. Late last year, it led a group that provided a $480 million construction loan to Cottonwood Management LLC for the development of a more than 800,000-square-foot mixed-use project in Boston's Seaport District.

Some financial institutions in a few countries, such as Greece, remain troubled, and the stocks of even well-capitalized banks are being shunned by investors because of low profitability. But real-estate lending is back in vogue among banks that have returned to health.

"We have capital and we have appetite," said Roman Kogan, Deutsche Bank AG's European head of commercial real estate.

Bankia is building up a pipeline of loans to finance residential construction in Spain. Mr. Manrique anticipates that within about three years, Bankia will capture up to an 8% market share of what he estimates to be the country's 5.5 billion euro annual real-estate financing sector.

The availability of debt financing is a sign of health in the European real-estate market. Sales of commercial property are strong, pushing values in some markets to records. Last year, investors purchased 312 billion euros of commercial property in Europe, up from 281 billion euros in 2016, according to data firm Real Capital ### invalid font number 2
Analytics### invalid font number 1
.

Values have risen so high that some bank regulators have expressed concern. In his remarks to the European Parliament in February, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said commercial property was a segment that needed close monitoring to protect against a possible asset bubble. "We actually see stretched valuations," he said.

The ramp-up in lending comes after a long slog stemming back to the 2008 global financial crisis. For years, many European banks reined in their real-estate businesses because of a weak European economy and pressures from regulators and others to beef up their capital.

Some banks got back into real-estate lending before others. ING Groep NV did so in late 2013 partly because, as a deposit-taking bank, it was under pressure by the ECB to deploy cash and diversify, said Mike Shields, ING's head of real-estate finance for the U.K., U.S. and Asia.

Domestic banks in the euro area had 947.3 billion euros of real-estate loans at the end of 2016, the last year for which statistics are available, according to the ECB. That is up from 910.7 billion euros at the end of 2014.

European bank lending also is rising sharply in the U.S. For example, U.S. branches of German banks held $24 billion of U.S. commercial real-estate loans in the third quarter of 2017, compared with $14 billion in the third quarter of 2015, according to data firm Trepp LLC.

Some market participants said some lenders are trying to win business by increasing loan sizes relative to a property's value. "Banks try to stick to 65% to 70% loan-to-value [ratio]," said Torsten Pokropp, a lawyer in DLA Piper's Frankfurt office. "However, we now see 80% again."

Many European bank executives said they are trying to learn from past mistakes and avoid softening underwriting standards. They said they are primarily dealing with increasing competition by cutting rates. That is reducing borrowing costs for many real-estate investors even in a rising interest-rate environment.

Still, some borrowers are able to obtain bank financing for new construction, renovations and other projects that involve more risk.

For example, a 650 million euro development fund raised by Coima SGR SpA obtained a 56.4 million euro loan from Banco BPM SpA -- an Italian bank formed by the merger of Banco Popolare and Banca Popolare di Milano -- for the redevelopment of the former Unilever headquarters in Milan's Porta Nuova neighborhood.

Coima was able to get such a loan thanks to its history of paying off its debts, said Manfredi Catella, Coima's chief executive. It would be tougher without such a track record, he said.

Firms across the country added 235,000 workers in February, according to payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody's ### invalid font number 2
Analytics### invalid font number 1
.

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected the addition of 200,000 jobs.

"The labor market continues to experience uninterrupted growth," said Ahu Yildirmaz, vice president and co-head of ADP Research Institute, in the report. "We see persistent gains across most industries with leisure and hospitality and retail leading the way as consumer spending kicked up."

Still, natural resources and mining added only 2,000 jobs and the information sector posted a 1,000 job decline.

The January figure was revised up to 244,000 from 234,000.

The ADP report is based on private-payroll data in addition to government data.

Still, the report raised concerns over employee shortages given the low unemployment rate.

"The job market is red hot and threatens to overheat," said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody's ### invalid font number 2
Analytics### invalid font number 1
. "With government spending increases and tax cuts, growth is set to accelerate."

The ADP report comes ahead of the monthly jobs report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday. Economists expect nonfarm jobs to rise by 205,000 for February, compared with 200,000 the prior month.

Acrimony on the Road to Harmony

Securities and commodities regulators have long said that harmonizing postcrisis swap rules was a priority. But actual interagency work has been at a standstill, until the recent formation of a working group. As soon as that group got going, it encountered controversy by including only Republican commissioners from one agencynd tweeting about it.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission hosted a meeting last week that included staff from both agencies. From the Securities and Exchange Commission, attendees included Chairman Jay Clayton, a Trump-appointed independent, and Hester Peirce, a Republican commissioner. Attending from the CFTC side were Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo and Commissioner Brian Quintenz, both Republicans. Democratic Commissioner Rostin Behnam wasn't present; his office didn't respond to requests for comment.

That presented a dicey situation for the CFTC. Its short-staffing (two seats on the commission are vacant) makes it legally difficult for two commissioners to discuss rules without the third being present, since two commissioners represent a quorum. The meeting wouldn't have become public at all if not for the CFTC's decision to tweet out a photo highlighting being "hard at work on Title VII harmonization."

The CFTC says the meeting was meant for staff to brief officials from both agencies, and that the commissioners didn't discuss rulemaking condition that would have triggered the "Sunshine Act" requiring such discussions to occur in a public forum.

"The key factor of a Sunshine Act meeting is whether there were deliberations that resulted in the joint conduct or disposition of official agency business," a spokeswoman for the CFTC said.

Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, wasn't pleased with that explanation.

"There's a good reason for the open meeting laws, so the public can at least get a window on efforts to roll back the laws that protect them from Wall Street special interests," Mr. Brown said in an email to The Wall Street Journal. "Only in this administration would an effort to harmonize rules begin on such a partisan note."

Mr. Brown and Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, the top Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee, sent a letter Tuesday to Messrs. Clayton and Giancarlo asking for details of what was discussed at the meeting, to make sure it qualifies for a Sunshine Act exemption.

The meeting flub isn't likely to leave lasting consequencesut it's another bump on the long road toward swap rule harmonization.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Gary Cohn Resigns as White House Economic Adviser After Losing Tariffs Fight

By Nick Timiraos, Peter Nicholas and Liz Hoffman

Gary Cohn will resign from the White House after 14 months serving as President Donald Trump's top economic adviser, he said Tuesday, days after Mr. Trump surprised his senior staff by announcing steel and aluminum tariffs that Mr. Cohn had opposed.

During his time at the White House, Mr. Cohn oversaw a major revamp of the U.S. tax code and pushed a significant rewrite of financial rules. But the former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive stumbled in an uphill and monthslong fight to sway Mr. Trump against the tariffs. He was also on the losing side of an effort to prevent the U.S. withdrawal last year from the Paris climate accord, and will leave having made little progress advancing a $1 trillion infrastructure program.

Financial markets have seesawed in recent weeks, first on the prospect that higher federal budget deficits approved by Mr. Trump might boost inflation and interest rates and more recently because of his desire to start a "trade war."

Mr. Cohn's departure could further rattle investors. Though not universally well liked on Wall Street, Mr. Cohn was widely admired for his market savvy and his pro-trade world view, which many traders and executives share. The dollar slumped, and futures in the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down about 300 points, or 1.2%, late Tuesday.

Mr. Cohn said it had been an honor to serve in the administration as director of the National Economic Council and thanked the president in a statement. Mr. Trump praised Mr. Cohn's "superb job" as his economics adviser and called him a "rare talent."

The White House staff has seen numerous departures over the past year. A study by the Brookings Institution in January showed turnover in Mr. Trump's White House surpassed that of the previous five presidents' first year in office.

Since the study was published, Communications Director Hope Hicks, Staff Secretary Rob Porter and communications adviser Josh Raffel have also resigned, among others.

Mr. Cohn was part of a globalist wing of the White House that lately has been in retreat. Peter Navarro, another adviser who helped craft the president's protectionist stance in the campaign, prevailed in a high-profile fight over new tariffs on aluminum and steel imports. Mr. Cohn had fought internally to stave off the move and told aides last week he might resign if the president followed through and imposed the tariffs.

"I don't think he suddenly lost an argument. He just never won it," said Joshua Bolten, who served as chief of staff to President George W. Bush from 2006 to 2009. "He's done a very effective job through rational argumentation and maybe through bureaucratic maneuvering in staving off the day of reckoning."

As recently as early this week, Mr. Cohn still seemed to be fighting the decision, trying to put together a meeting among industry executives whose companies could be hurt by the tariffs. That meeting, which had been expected to happen later this week, was no longer being planned following Mr. Cohn's resignation, a White House official said.

Another White House official said in an interview Tuesday that Mr. Cohn had always intended to stay for about a year. This person said that Mr. Cohn wasn't resigning because of frustration or disappointment over Mr. Trump's decision to impose steel and aluminum tariffs.

Mr. Cohn wound up staying two months longer than he had anticipated because the president asked him to help with the State of the Union speech and a trip to a global economic conference in Davos, Switzerland, the official said.

Mr. Cohn, though, was unhappy about the "process" by which Mr. Trump last week announced that he would be imposing steel and aluminum tariffs, the official said.

This person described the process as one in which White House proponents of the tariffs, on their own, slipped into the president's office "at 6 o'clock at night" last Wednesday, then called steel and aluminum CEOS two hours later and invited them to a meeting the next morning, telling them the president would sign an executive order imposing the taxes even though no such order was ready.

"There is extreme frustration when the process breaks down," the official said. In this instance, the official said, the White House "nationalists hijacked the process."

One Wall Street executive who kept in contact with Mr. Cohn said a rotating group of colleagues and friends took turns urging him to stay. Some of these people said Mr. Cohn's departure hinted at the limits of trying to hem in Mr. Trump's desire to take more dramatic actions on trade.

On Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers that the administration wasn't looking to get into a trade war. Later in the afternoon, Mr. Trump said, "trade wars aren't so bad."

The departure will put pressure on other advisers, especially Mr. Mnuchin, to make the case for preserving the post-World War II trade architecture the U.S. helped construct and for speaking credibly to financial markets.

"More than anyone else in the White House, Cohn had credibility with the markets," said Ian Katz, a financial policy analyst at Capital Alpha Partners in Washington. "If we go several days without news of a replacement, investors could get edgy."

The National Economic Council job post doesn't require Senate confirmation. An administration official said those being considered to succeed Mr. Cohn include Andy Puzder, a fast-food executive who withdrew his labor secretary nomination after domestic-abuse allegations from an ex-wife surfaced. Mr. Puzder has denied the claims.

The official said others who could be considered include CNBC commentator and former Trump campaign adviser Lawrence Kudlow; Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett ; and Mr. Navarro.

With Mr. Cohn's departure, several Goldman alumni who joined the administration last year will have left.

"Gary Cohn deserves credit for serving his country in a first class way," Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein tweeted Tuesday afternoon. "I'm sure I join many others who are disappointed to see him leave." Mr. Cohn had spent 26 years at Goldman was once seen as the likely successor to Mr. Blankfein.

Mr. Cohn grew up in Cleveland, where his first job was selling window frames and aluminum siding. He later traded silver on Wall Street and took a pay cut to join Goldman's commodities arm. He became a partner in 1994.

He has stayed long enough in the White House to keep tax-deferred treatment on more than $250 million in Goldman stock.

Early on, Mr. Trump enjoyed introducing Mr. Cohn as a former Goldman executive who gave up a lucrative career to work for him. In a Wall Street Journal interview in July, Mr. Trump mused about installing Mr. Cohn as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve.

But that nomination never happened. Mr. Cohn criticized Mr. Trump's response to the racially charged violence in Charlottesville, Va., and found himself isolated.

Mr. Cohn found his way back into Mr. Trump's good graces last fall by shepherding the president's tax cut package through Congress, delivering the president his signature legislative accomplishment.

Mr. Cohn performed so favorably that the president discussed with friends as recently as last month whether to install him as chief of staff, even though Mr. Cohn is a registered Democrat.

Banks Look to Break Government's Hold on Student-Loan Market

By Josh Mitchell and AnnaMaria Andriotis

Private lenders are pushing to break up the government's near monopoly in the $100 billion-a-year student-loan market.

The banking industry's main lobbying group, the Consumer Bankers Association, is pressing for the government to instate caps on how much individual graduate students and parents of undergraduates can borrow from the government to cover tuition.

That would force many families to turn to private lenders to cover portions of their bills. While that could mean lower interest rates for some, it could constrain funding to households with blemished credit histories.

A group of investors also is lobbying for legislation to provide a clearer legal framework for "income-share agreements," under which private investors provide money up front to cover tuition in exchange for a portion of a student's income after school. Firmer rules would help spur more agreements, the group said.

At stake is potentially billions of dollars in new business for private lenders, a group currently dominated by SLM Corp. , better known as Sallie Mae, Wells Fargo & Co., and Discover Financial Services .

The U.S. Education Department makes about 90% of student loans annually market that totaled $107 billion in new originations in the most recent academic year, according to the College Board.

Private lenders pushed for legislative changes in previous years to no avail, but now they're receiving a more welcome reception from congressional Republicans and the Trump administration.

House Republicans, looking to revamp higher-education policies for the first time in a decade, have included the industry's proposals in a wide-ranging bill unveiled in November, which they hope to pass this year.

Student loans made by lenders other than the federal government during the last academic 2016-17 year totaled $11.6 billion, down 51%, after inflation, from a decade earlier, according to the College Board.

Private student lending has fallen in part because banks tightened underwriting standards after the 2007-2009 financial crisis. It also has dropped because of moves by Congress to allow students to borrow more directly from the government. Starting in 2006, most graduate students have been able to borrow unlimited amounts. Parents also face no restrictions on how much they can borrow under the Parent Plus program.

The Republican billromoting Real Opportunity, Success, and Prosperity through Education Reform, or Prosper, Actalls for limits on the total federal student-loan amounts certain borrowers can receive. Many graduate students wouldn't be able to borrow more than $150,000 in total federal loans for undergraduate and graduate studies. Parents in many cases would be limited to around $56,000 per dependent. That could mean students who attend pricey schools or those who go on for advanced degrees will turn to the private student lenders to cover additional borrowing needs.

The House billntroduced by Rep. Virginia Foxx (R., N.C.), chairwoman of the House education committee, late last yearleared the panel in December and now requires approval of the full House. A vote hasn't been set. Her Senate counterpart, Lamar Alexander (R., Tenn.), has yet to introduce companion legislation this year.

Critics say some of the industry's proposals would hurt taxpayers and students who lack the credit to qualify for private-sector loans. Some schools and student advocates add that setting stricter dollar limits on federal loans would limit many students from attending schools of their choice.

"The number one priority of Wall Street banks is their own bottom line," Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.), a member of the Senate education committee, said in a statement. "Pushing more students to borrow private loans from banks without consumer protections is a terrible idea."

Banks argue the government's policy of extending loans to college and graduate students, no questions asked, has led to high default rates, runaway tuition inflation and taxpayer costs.

"We absolutely believe there is a role for the federal government. What we don't want to see is continued nearly unlimited lending that has been fueling a rise in tuition costs," said Kristen Fallon, vice president of congressional affairs for the Consumer Bankers Association.

Private lenders won't make loans to cover tuition at schools of dubious quality, Ms. Fallon says. "They're making some assessment on the value proposition" of individual schools, she said. "We think that is absolutely necessary."

CBA leaders have met with lawmakers and Trump administration officials to push for the changes, a spokesman said. The group spent $3.54 million in lobbying last year on all issues, according the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics.

Private student lenders target the most creditworthy borrowers. That includes parents of undergraduate students and graduate students with an established history of paying debts on time. Most private lenders require high credit scores and around 90% of the loan dollars they extend to undergraduates have parent or other adult cosigners attached to them, according to MeasureOne, which tracks lending in the private student-loan sector.

Several private lenders are offering lower interest rates than what the federal government charges the most creditworthy borrowers. And unlike federal loans, most private loans don't charge an origination fee when borrowers sign up for the loan.

Private lenders hope low interest rates, which often start at around 4% to 5% for the most creditworthy borrowers, will convince applicants to take out private loans. A federal program known as "Plus" loans for graduate students and parents of undergraduates that are given out during the current academic year have rates of 7%, regardless of how high or low borrowers credit scores are. The government currently charges rates of 4.45% for undergraduate loans.

The government relies on interest payments from creditworthy borrowers to offset the money it loses on defaults from other borrowers and thereby keep the federal loan program solvent.

NYSE to Pay $14 Million Over 2015 Trading Malfunctions

By Dave Michaels and Alexander Osipovich

The New York Stock Exchange agreed Tuesday to pay $14 million to settle regulatory investigations into a series of market malfunctions and technical errors that disrupted trading on three occasions in 2015.

The settlement represents the first case in which the Securities and Exchange Commission accused a stock exchange of violating rules established to prevent outages of critical market infrastructure. The SEC also faulted NYSE for using unapproved "price collars" to damp price swings during a wild trading session on Aug. 24, 2015, which had the unintended effect of exacerbating volatility.

"For retail investors to have confidence in our markets, exchanges must provide accurate information and comply with legal requirements, including being equipped for unexpected market disruptions," said Stephanie Avakian, co-director of the SEC's enforcement division.

Chaotic trading on the morning of Aug. 24, 2015, exposed flaws in the way U.S. stocks and exchange-traded funds trade and prompted criticism of the NYSE's unusual market design, in which human traders on an old-fashioned trading floor coexist with electronic trading. Critics of NYSE's model said human traders, given discretion to set the opening price of stocks, made things worse.

The many price swings that morning triggered nearly 1,300 halts of stocks and ETFs. Many shares didn't formally open for trading until 9:45 a.m. or, in some cases, after 10 a.m., as the NYSE's market makers struggled to find valid starting prices for stocks.

During the upheaval, dozens of ETFs traded at sharp discounts to the sum of their holdings, worsening losses for fundholders who sold during the panic.

Tuesday's fine won't have a big financial impact on NYSE parent Intercontinental Exchange Inc., a global exchange operator that had profits of $2.5 billion last year. But it is a black eye for the Atlanta-based firm, known as ICE, which has a reputation for bringing cutting-edge technology to the exchange industry. ICE completed its acquisition of NYSE in 2013.

NYSE and its two sister exchanges, NYSE Arca and NYSE American, agreed to settle the SEC claims without admitting or denying fault. "We believe this settlement is in the best interest of the NYSE Exchanges," NYSE said in an emailed statement.

The SEC said NYSE failed to seek regulatory approval for how it used price collars on Aug. 24, 2015, when they prevented stocks and ETFs from more quickly trading at prices that reflected supply and demand. The exchange also failed to inform traders during another technical glitchn July 8, 2015hat price quotes were no longer immediately accessible to them, the SEC said.

The SEC also alleged that NYSE hadn't disclosed an important aspect of one order type to all market participants. Order types are instructions that brokers and traders use to inform exchanges about how they want their orders to be handled.

Exchanges have introduced hundreds of complex order types in recent years as they compete for business from high-volume traders. In the case cited by the SEC, regulators said the order type could have allowed floor traders to detect the presence of a large order that was intended to be hidden from other participants.

The Fine Print: What's in the Senate Financial-Regulation Bill

By Ryan Tracy

The Senate is voting on a bill as early as this week that would make the largest changes to financial regulatory law since 2010, when the Dodd-Frank Act passed. Opponents say the bill cuts protections against consumer abuses and financial crises. Supporters say it will help small lenders without undoing Dodd-Frank's core tenets.

Decide for yourself. Here's what's in Senate Bill 2155.

Help for Regional Banks

"odd-Frank said larger banks must follow stricter rules than smaller ones. It drew the line at $50 billion in assets, leaving about 40 of the roughly 5,670 U.S. banks above it. The bill would effectively raise that threshold to $250 billion in assets, leaving 12 banks facing mandatory annual "stress tests" and other hurdles. The Federal Reserve could still decide to impose strict rules on banks below $250 billion in assets. See how changing the threshold affects banks.

Help for Big Banks

"he bill would make it easier for big banks to buy bonds from state and local governments.

"t would lower a capital requirement called the leverage ratio for State Street Corp. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp., two large "custody" banks that predominantly hold clients' assets for safekeeping, rather than lending out client money like traditional banks. Some observers say other big banks in the custody business, including JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc., may end up qualifying for this help as well.

Mortgage Credit

"enders with less than $10 billion in assets would be exempt from Dodd-Frank's mortgage-underwriting standard, so long as they hold the loans rather than sell them to Wall Street.

"anks that originate fewer than 500 mortgages annually wouldn't have to report racial and income data on their mortgage lending.

"ellers of manufactured homes, such as companies owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, would be exempt from restrictions that apply to other parts of the housing market.

Help for Small Lenders

"mall banks would be exempt from the Volcker rule, which bans banks from making speculative bets.

"mall banks would file shorter financial reports with regulators, be examined less often, and be released from some capital rules as long as they maintain a relatively high ratio of equity to assets.

Credit Reporting

"redit bureaus such as Equifax Inc. would have to provide free security freezes, during which a person's credit information can't be disclosed.

Other Provisions

"he bill contains protections for tenants facing foreclosure and for people working in the financial industry who report exploitation of senior citizens.

"t boosts aid for remediating lead and asbestos hazards in homes.

"redit unions would get a permanent say on their regulator's budget.

The New ID Theft: Millions of Credit Applicants Who Don't Exist

From a townhouse near a megachurch in Atlanta, Kelvin Lyles recruited about 300 accomplices to embark on a crime spree. His group scammed ATMs, internet retailers and credit-card companies, grabbing around $350,000, until late 2015, when federal agents closed in.

Mr. Lyles was the only one convicted. None of his accomplices existed.

In a twist on ID theft, criminals are deploying figments of their imaginations, in what is often called synthetic-identity fraud. It's one of the fastest growing forms of identity crimes, the Justice Department says, and among the hardest to combat.

Because the person taking out cards or loans isn't real, there are no consumer victims to alert lenders. When companies and law enforcement discover something amiss, they often wind up chasing ghosts. Mr. Lyles secured credit cards often using fictional names and numbers the Social Security Administration hadn't yet assigned.

Synthetic-identity fraud exploits a vulnerability in America's consumer-credit system. Lenders often consider a loan applicant legitimate if the applicant has a credit report at Equifax Inc., TransUnion or Experian PLC. But a new "credit file"ssentially a precursor to a credit reportften gets created when someone simply applies, even if the loan doesn't come through.

Some lenders approve loans after reviewing credit files, which helps turn those files into full credit reports. That's how a fictitious person, or 300 fictional people, can end up with a credit card.

"When you see this type of scheme," said Samir Kaushal, the assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted Mr. Lyles, at a hearing, "one realizes how precarious our system actually is."

While a small part of total identity-fraud losseshat number hit about $16.8 billion in 2017, according to consulting firm Javelin Strategy & Researchynthetic-identity losses are soaring.

TransUnion says a record $355 million in outstanding credit-card balances was owed by people who it suspects didn't exist in 2017, up more than eightfold from 2012. It estimates lenders have issued credit cards or loans to millions of synthetic identities in the U.S.

In January, Accenture PLC listed synthetic-identity fraud as one of the biggest threats facing banks in 2018, saying it would be "costing banks billions of dollars and countless hours as they chase down people who don't even exist."

In Rock Hill, S.C., a 50-year-old man was arrested last year after applying under synthetic identities for more than 750 credit cards; he pleaded guilty. Earlier, a Southern California man pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud using synthetic identities, agreeing to forfeit properties in Los Angeles, West Hollywood and Santa Monica bought with the proceeds.

TransUnion says it began hearing from lenders and law enforcement about unusual fraud cases between 2012 and 2014. It began investigating, searching for driver's licenses, voter registrations and other records to confirm identities. When nothing turned up, TransUnion investigators realized the cases could be tied to fabricated identities.

The company blocked thousands of credit reports from future use, figuring any real people would get in touch, says Lee Cookman, a director in its identity-solutions department. None did.

TransUnion and Experian say it is tough to distinguish between a fake person and a real person applying for credit for the first time with legitimate identifying information that isn't on file. Equifax didn't respond to requests for comment.

Criminals have taken up this new ruse in part because lenders and borrowers have gotten better at protecting against more traditional fraud, which often involves using stolen data about real consumers, says Chris Pinion, who specializes in fraud strategy at LexisNexis Risk Solutions, a unit of RELX Group.

Bypassing actual consumers, scammers such as Mr. Lyles trip fewer alarms. An Alabama native, he had worked at a debt-collection firm and as a U.S. Navy service member trained in electronic warfare, according to court records. He was once chief financial officer at Chosen Destiny Foundation Inc., a nonprofit serving Atlanta's homeless.

Over two decades, he was convicted of crimes such as motor-vehicle theft and marijuana possession, court records show.

"He's a good son, a loving father, and he took care of his family to the best of his ability," says Betty Hollinger, his mother. "Whatever else happened, I just don't know."

Mr. Lyles, in federal prison for the fraudulent credit-card scheme, didn't respond to interview requests. His lawyer, Careton Matthews, declined to arrange an interview with his client. "Mr. Lyles accepted responsibility early on," he says. "He is remorseful for having committed the acts that caused him to be sentenced."

In 2014, two months before the marijuana conviction, Mr. Lyles registered a business, Horizon Mediation LLC, specializing in "business performance improvement," according to its website. Its official address was a strip-mall UPS Store. Bob Persky, the store's owner, says: "We follow the guidelines of both the U.S. postal office and UPS corporate with all our mailbox holders."

Risk managers at credit-card issuer Capital One Financial Corp. started noticing peculiar patterns with transactions at Horizon and other merchants in the Atlanta area, according to federal investigators. Several of the accounts went delinquent shortly after purchases.

A Capital One review found that even though the applications were filled out in names of multiple individuals, several were submitted from common IP addresses. Some cards were being mailed to the same location.

Numbers game

Mr. Lyles had been looking to rehabilitate his credit when he learned about what are often called credit-profile numbers, Mr. Matthews said at his client's sentencing hearing.

Also simply called CPNs, these are essentially fake Social Security numbers, nine digits the agency hasn't assigned or, in some cases, numbers assigned to children that haven't ever made it into credit files. People with tainted credit histories sometimes use them rather than their legitimate numbers so they won't be dogged by prior delinquencies. Underground websites sell them in batches.

Using CPNs on loan applications is illegal, says Stephen Stigall, partner at law firm Ballard Spahr LLP, and can subject their users to charges of making false statements to banks, bank fraud or conspiracy to commit bank fraud.

Lenders lack methods of instantly distinguishing credit-profile numbers from Social Security numbersn part an unintended consequence of a Social Security Administration move meant to reduce identity fraud.

The agency used to generate numbers in predictable patterns. The first few digits corresponded to a person's ZIP Code when the number was issued, letting lenders cross-check the number with other application entries. In 2011, the agency began generating numbers randomly. That made it tougher for lenders to spot fakes.

An agency spokesman, Darren Lutz, says "randomization represents an important step forward in preventing the compromise of SSNs and preventing identity theft" including by making it harder for scammers to reconstruct numbers using public information.

Lenders can ask the agency to cross-check numbers, but most don't. The agency requires an applicant's handwritten signature, which can be time-consuming.

The agency's Mr. Lutz says: "We are currently exploring authentication capabilities to enhance the consent process."

The missing tool for preventing synthetic fraud is an instant way to verify a Social Security number through an agency process, says Brian Murphy, senior director of policy at the American Bankers Association trade group. "At this point," he says, "it is the numberhe single identifiern which everything turns."

Lenders tend to use their own data and fraud-detection tools and review information from credit-reporting companies. Those companies build histories for people based on information lenders provide.

That can create openings for fraud because of the vulnerability in the system. If an applicant hasn't received credit before, a lender's query to a credit-reporting firm will reveal no borrowing history, and the lender will likely reject the application.

But that very query typically results in the creation of a new credit file for the person. If the person applies for more loans, that process expands the credit file and can give the perception the applicant is real.

If one lender approves a card for that applicant, that information can make the file a full-fledged credit report. While the person probably won't get a high-spending-limit card without a repayment history, lenders who provide low-limit cards often take chances on newer borrowers.

Some identity fabricators pay bills promptly to qualify for higher limits, then "bust out," running up the maximum charge.

TransUnion's Mr. Cookman says it informs lenders when applicant information is consistent with synthetic fraudn address associated with more than 200 people, say. Experian last year introduced a score alerting lenders if an applicant exhibits characteristics of a synthetic fraudster. TransUnion introduced a similar service in 2015.

Banks are looking to put more emphasis on factors besides Social Security numbers and other static identifiers, says the ABA's Mr. Murphy.

Amanda Landers, a spokeswoman for Capital One, which was pulled into Mr. Lyles's ruse, says: "When opening new accounts, Capital One has multiple defenses in place and layered verification checks to identify potential fraud."

Tracking Mr. Lyles

Mr. Lyles used credit-profile numbers to win cards in nonexistent people's names, investigators say. Investigators found a receipt at his house from a website that sells such numbers.

One of his "people" was a Mike Milton, born May 7, 1987, and from Fayetteville, Ga. He applied for and received a Capital One credit card in that name, investigators say.

Mr. Lyles ran new cards through phony merchant accounts he controlled with Square Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc. payment systemsesulting in payments from Capital One and other banks into the accounts. Square and PayPal declined to comment. Investigators say he also used cards for actual purchases and cash advances.

"Realizing how easy that appeared to be and how these CPNs were not real people," said Mr. Matthews at the hearing, "it seemed too easy."

In late 2014, Capital One became concerned enough about signs of fraud it was spotting as well as delinquencies in the accounts used at Horizon that it contacted Keith Speers, a U.S. Postal Inspection Service investigator.

Mr. Speers, a former U.S. Air Force security-forces officer, says he spent the first weeks of 2015 cross-referencing account information with public records and calling affected businesses, hoping to uncover who was behind the transactions.

The addresses to which new cards were mailed were often vacant or mail centers from which mail was forwarded elsewhere. In February 2015, Mr. Speers received security-camera images of someone withdrawing $300 from a PNC Financial Services Group Inc. ATM using a Capital One card in a name flagged to Mr. Speers. Images showed a man with a buzzcut.

In March, Mr. Speers says, information from Amazon.com Inc. and other retailers about online purchases of clothing, shoes and other goods using fraudulent cards shared a shipping address. The recipient appeared to be female.

Mr. Speers says he ran the address through motor-vehicle records and found Mr. Lyles. His license photo matched the man in the PNC pictures.

Discover Financial Services had also issued cards to some of the same "people" that had raised suspicions at Capital One, Mr. Speers says. Discover, Amazon and PNC declined to comment.

Given the number of suspicious identities involved, Mr. Speers wanted to make sure Mr. Lyles wasn't a patsy. He recalls worrying that "we're going to take off kind of one head and there may be multiple people connected but essentially independently capable of continuing, and then they would know we were out."

After subpoenaing cellphone and other records, Mr. Speers says, lenders "would always come back with, hat linked us to these additional accounts.' " GPS data tied to payment terminals showed the activity centered in Mr. Lyles's neighborhood.

Mr. Speers and six other agents arrived at Mr. Lyles's home with a search warrant. Investigators found multiple payment terminals, five fake IDs, 30 credit and debit cards mostly in other people's names, a list of more than 300 credit-profile numbers and the receipt from the site selling those numbers.

Among the IDs was one for Mr. Milton.

The U.S. attorney's office charged Mr. Lyles not with identity theft, because he didn't try to defraud real people, but with wire fraud. He pleaded guilty in January 2017.

At an April sentencing hearing, he told U.S. District Judge Mark H. Cohen that "I thought it was something legal at first...It was helping me take care of my family, it was actually helping me grow my business. And life just started to look up."

Judge Cohen sentenced him to 46 months in prison. "This is not a victimless offense," the judge said. "This is basically abusing the credit system of, frankly, this country."

China Lowers Banks' Liquidity Requirement

By Chao Deng and Chuin-Wei Yap

BEIJINGhinese authorities are cutting the amount of cash banks are required to set aside to cover bad loans, a move that would boost lenders' bottom line but potentially increase financial risk.

With the sector struggling to boost profits, the country's banking regulator will lower the provision coverage ratio for commercial banks requirement to safeguard their ability to weather losseso a range of 120%-150%, from the current minimum of 150% of their bad loans, according to people familiar with the situation.

One of the people said the China Banking Regulatory Commission handed a document announcing the relaxation to its local bureaus last week, rendering the move effective immediately.

Lowering the required threshold is "conducive to speeding up the disposal of current nonperforming loans," Wang Zhaoxing, a vice chairman at the regulatory commission, told state media on Tuesday.

Beijing is trying to release more credit into the economy to keep growth humming, even as it tries to tighten financing to overheated areas like property. Analysts say the move is an acknowledgment by authorities that growth isn't booming like before. "They're trying to release capital otherwise stuck in the financial system," says Jonas Short, an analyst at Everbright Sun Hung Kai Co. Ltd.

At the same time, the relaxation comes as financial regulators have been trying to get banks to rein in risky lending and investment practices. It is indicative, say analysts, of the huge sway lenders retain over their watchdog.

Chinese banks began lowering the amount of cash they are required to set aside as early as the first quarter of 2016, when a tide of souring corporate loans brought profit levels near zero across the industry. They appeared not to face regulatory consequences.

Industrial & Commercial Bank of China Ltd., the world's largest lender by assets, said at the time it set its buffer ratio at 141%. The bank has continued to keep its ratio below the regulatory threshold, reporting 148% as of the end of September.

Bank of China Ltd. was another big state lender to lower its impairment provision in 2016. The lender told The Wall Street Journal at the time that a declining ratio had become a trend in China, and that it was cutting the ratio to accommodate an acceleration of loan write-offs.

Analysts are skeptical as to whether lowering the capital requirement would prompt banks to fully disclose the extent of their bad debt. Bad loans accounted for 1.74% of banks' total loans at the end of 2017, according to official data, a level far lower than what most analysts believe to be true.

Lenders have lobbied since 2015 for regulators to lower cash buffer requirements so they could free up more cash and spur profits. The CBRC's Mr. Wang said the industry's provision coverage ratio currently averaged 180%.

A vice president at one global rating firm said the relaxation was "credit negative" for the sector. He declined to be named, citing worries his employer wouldn't agree. "They may have been forced to," he said of regulators' decision. "Concerns about weakened risk management have to be balanced against banks' desire for strong profitability."

U.K. Makes Case for Including Financial Services in EU Trade Deal

By Jason Douglas

LONDON.K. Treasury chief Philip Hammond is planning to say Wednesday that the British government believes it is in the interest of the European Union to include financial services in a free-trade deal with the U.K. after Brexit, a day after his French counterpart ruled it out.

The disagreement underscores what is set to be a major sticking point between Britain and the EU when talks over the U.K.'s withdrawal move on to the terms of its future relationship from the bloc. The EU is due to publish its draft guidelines for that future economic partnership Wednesday.

Mr. Hammond is due to say in a speech in Londonxtracts of which were published by his office Tuesdayhat the U.K. government believes a bespoke free-trade accord that extends to financial services is in the mutual interest of the U.K. and the EU, given the scale of cross-border financial activity.

He is planning to dismiss those who say financial services shouldn't be included in a free-trade deal with the EU. The bloc set a precedent when it discussed liberalizing trade in financial services during negotiations with Canada and the U.S., he is due to say.

"I am clear not only that it is possible to include financial services within a trade deal but that it is very much in our mutual interest to do so," Mr. Hammond is planning to say. He is due to stress that "every trade deal is unique" and financial services shouldn't automatically be ruled out.

British officials have acknowledged that after Britain leaves the EU in March next year, the U.K. will have to give up its financial district's cherished "passport" that allows financial institutions based in London to trade freely across the EU's other 27 member states. Firms that lack such as passport must set up subsidiaries within the EU, raising the prospect that banks and insurers could decamp from London.

A separate, "equivalence" regime allows non-EU financial firms to offer a limited range of mostly wholesale servicesuch as securities trading and clearingo European customers provided their home country's financial regulations are broadly similar to the EU's. But British officials are pushing for a better deal because they regard equivalence as unsatisfactory for British-based firms, since the responsibility for policing equivalence lies exclusively with the European Commission in Brussels.

European officials have so far insisted that equivalence is the best the U.K. can expect. French economy minister Bruno Le Maire, speaking in London Tuesday after meeting Mr. Hammond, said the regime offers "many opportunities" and works well for non-EU partners.

He insisted financial services shouldn't be covered in a free-trade agreement with the U.K.

"We do not believe that financial services can be part of an FTA. Because financial services are not goods. They cannot be traded and supervised in the same way," he said.

What Bust? European Banks Are Loading Up on Real Estate

By Peter Grant and Jeannette Neumann

When Spain's Bankia SA received a bailout in 2012, it was prohibited from making the kind of real-estate loans that triggered the bank's implosion.

That ban expired on Jan. 1 and, like other Spanish lenders, Bankia is now jumping at the opportunity to finance real-estate projects again.

"It's a good time to be in the sector; in terms of growth, the cycle still has upside," said Alberto Manrique, head of real-estate development finance at Bankia, Spain's fourth-largest bank by market capitalization.

With the European economy expanding and most of banks' balance sheets restored to health, many European financial institutions are boosting loan volumes in their real-estate lending businesses and competing aggressively on rates.

BNP Paribas SA increased its portfolio of commercial real-estate loans by double-digit percentages in 2016 and again in 2017, said Gilles Polet, head of European real-estate finance for corporate and institutional banking at the Paris-based bank. Its 40 deals last year included a ¬25 million ($771 million) refinancing of the Dundrum Town Centre, one of Ireland's largest shopping malls.

Paris-based Natixis SA, meanwhile, has emerged as one of the most active lenders in the U.S. market. Late last year, it led a group that provided a $480 million construction loan to Cottonwood Management LLC for the development of a more than 800,000-square-foot mixed-use project in Boston's Seaport District.

Some financial institutions in a few countries, such as Greece, remain troubled, and the stocks of even well-capitalized banks are being shunned by investors because of low profitability. But real-estate lending is back in vogue among banks that have returned to health.

"We have capital and we have appetite," said Roman Kogan, Deutsche Bank AG's European head of commercial real estate.

Bankia is building up a pipeline of loans to finance residential construction in Spain. Mr. Manrique anticipates that within about three years, Bankia will capture up to an 8% market share of what he estimates to be the country's ¬.5 billion annual real-estate financing sector.

The availability of debt financing is a sign of health in the European real-estate market. Sales of commercial property are strong, pushing values in some markets to records. Last year, investors purchased ¬12 billion of commercial property in Europe, up from ¬81 billion in 2016, according to data firm Real Capital ### invalid font number 2
Analytics### invalid font number 1
.

Values have risen so high that some bank regulators have expressed concern. In his remarks to the European Parliament in February, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said commercial property was a segment that needed close monitoring to protect against a possible asset bubble. "We actually see stretched valuations," he said.

The ramp-up in lending comes after a long slog stemming back to the 2008 global financial crisis. For years, many European banks reined in their real-estate businesses because of a weak European economy and pressures from regulators and others to beef up their capital.

"Banks have been managed for the regulators for the last 10 years rather than for the shareholders," said George Karamanos, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.

Some banks got back into real-estate lending before others. ING Groep NV did so in late 2013 partly because, as a deposit-taking bank, it was under pressure by the ECB to deploy cash and diversify, said Mike Shields, ING's head of real-estate finance for the U.K., U.S. and Asia.

Domestic banks in the euro area had ¬47.3 billion of real-estate loans at the end of 2016, the last year for which statistics are available, according to the ECB. That is up from ¬10.7 billion at the end of 2014.

European bank lending also is rising sharply in the U.S. For example, U.S. branches of German banks held $24 billion of U.S. commercial real-estate loans in the third quarter of 2017, compared with $14 billion in the third quarter of 2015, according to data firm Trepp LLC.

Some market participants said some lenders are trying to win business by increasing loan sizes relative to a property's value. "Banks try to stick to 65% to 70% loan-to-value [ratio]," said Torsten Pokropp, a lawyer in DLA Piper's Frankfurt office. "However, we now see 80% again."

Many European bank executives said they are trying to learn from past mistakes and avoid softening underwriting standards. They said they are primarily dealing with increasing competition by cutting rates. That is reducing borrowing costs for many real-estate investors even in a rising interest-rate environment.

Still, some borrowers are able to obtain bank financing for new construction, renovations and other projects that involve more risk.

For example, a ¬50 million development fund raised by Coima SGR SpA obtained a ¬6.4 million loan from Banco BPM SpAn Italian bank formed by the merger of Banco Popolare and Banca Popolare di Milanoor the redevelopment of the former Unilever headquarters in Milan's Porta Nuova neighborhood.

Coima was able to get such a loan thanks to its history of paying off its debts, said Manfredi Catella, Coima's chief executive. It would be tougher without such a track record, he said.

"Even if banks are in better shape, they're still very, very selective," Mr. Catella said.

Bank Branch Warfare

JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America have announced plans recently to open branches in new markets. They won't say it, but the bank executives all know that Wells Fargo , one of their biggest rivals, is immersed in scandal and has done a good job angering customers and regulators. And they know that "https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-banks-enter-branch-warfare-1520245801".

JPMorgan said in January it would open up to 400 new branches over the next five years, expanding into 15 to 20 new markets. The bank has branches in 23 states, but not yet in major markets like Washington, D.C., Boston and Philadelphia, its statement said. Wells Fargo has the most branches of any bank in Washington and the second most in the Philadelphia area, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

Not about to be outdone, Bank of America said last week it plans to open more than 500 new branches over the next four years. It highlighted plans to move into the major Ohio metropolitan areas of Cincinnati, Cleveland and Columbus. Wells Fargo doesn't have a significant presence in the state, but Bank of America hasn't said where else it will open branches.

The banks are still shutting branches in existing markets, so their total branch counts will likely keep declining. The plans for expansion into new cities highlights the crucial role that brick-and-mortar branches still play in the industry. In a recent survey, research firm Novantas found that just under half of U.S. customers visit a bank branch at least once a month.

Exchanges Want Fintech Collaborations, Not Acquisitions

Exchange operators prefer teaming up with fintech firms through collaboration deals and joint ventures over buying such firms, according to "https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/fintech-decoded-the-capital-markets-infrastructure-opportunity" of 46 members of the World Federation of Exchanges. In the survey, 40% of exchanges said collaboration was the most efficient approach to leveraging fintech, while 25% favored joint ventures. Investing in fintech firms through minority or majority stakes was the top choice of 13% of the surveyed exchanges, and 9% said acquisition was the most effective approach.

Uses for Blockchain Are Limited

Blockchain has potentially far-reaching implications for the financial sector, but its obvious limitations will keep it from living up to some investors' promises, Nouriel Roubini, a former member of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, and Preston Byrne of the Adam Smith Institute"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/blockchain-technology-limited-applications-by-nouriel-roubini-and-preston-byrne-2018-03". Processing transactions with blockchain technology is "markedly slower and less efficient" than the systems financial institutions use now, and it doesn't eliminate the need for financial intermediaries, as some have claimed, they say. "Ultimately, blockchain's uses will be limited to specific, well-defined, and complex applications that require transparency and tamper-resistance more than they require speed," they write.

It isn't the first startup promising to accelerate the drug discovery via ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
, but Atomwise Inc. aims to expand on the commercial traction it has quietly built up over the last six years.

The San Francisco-based company has just closed a $45 million Series A, led by Monsanto Growth Ventures, Data Collective and B Capital Group. Atomwise, an alum of Y Combinator, previously had raised $6 million.

Atomwise says its platform performs the next phase of testing after human biologists' experimentations in the wet lab. The company is working with the likes of Merck KGgA, Duke University and Monsanto.

When a promising molecule is discovered at companies or academic institutions working with Atomwise, its software analyzes the structural components and makes predictions about combinations of molecules that could become new drugs.

Similar companies in the sector include Deep Genomics Inc., which uses ### invalid font number 2
machine learning### invalid font number 1
 to map genetic pathways that could lead to drug development, and Recursion Pharmaceuticals Inc., which tests existing drug compounds to find potential new uses.

Atomwise Chief Executive and co-founder Abraham Heifets likened the company's platform to software developed for airplane simulation; the computer is smart and powerful enough to allow for accurate testing of expensive, dangerous and time-consuming endeavors.

"There are 600 million molecules available in libraries from chemical vendors all over the world, and we do an analysis of all of those," Mr. Heifets said. "There is no other way you can do that without computational chemistry."

Data Collective Managing Partner Matt Ocko said his firm backed Atomwise both in this round and the seed for its differentiated approach to drug discovery.

"No one else has been able to show us a credible atom by atom approach to driving the kind of breakthroughs they are already delivering in academic and commercial settings at scale," said Mr. Ocko, who will take a board seat along with B Capital Partner Gavin Teo and Monsanto Growth Ventures Partner Kiersten Stead.

Carney's crypto crackdown### invalid font number 1

When the governor of the Bank of England speaks, markets take note. When he talks about cryptocurrencies then it pens-down time for us all.

Most of the attention, understandably, on Mark Carney speech on Friday focused on his calls to bring parts of the crypto ecosystem into the egulatory tent

So far, so predictably central-bank governor. But it was a sweeping and surprisingly nuanced speech on the history of money, whether cryptos will replace money [spoiler alert: he says they won] and how policy makers and regulators should approach digital currencies. You can read the full speech ere and my news story ere. 

But worth further examination are his comments around blockchain, or the distributed-ledger technology that underpins cryptos. One of the reasons Mr Carney doesn think a crypto ban would be useful is because he argues it would stifle potentially useful innovation that could be harnessed in wider ways for the public good.

It long been known that the BoE has been examining uses of DLT. It one of the most avant-garde central banks in that regard (although perhaps not as revolutionary as Venezuela, the only country so far to ttempt a central-bank digital coin with its etroffering two weeks ago).

The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street even looked at whether its £00bn-a-day settlement system, TGS, could run on DLT. For now, that plan has been shelved because, Mr Carney says, the technology is just not up to it.

But that is not to dismiss it, nor the wider change afoot that has made cryptocurrencies wildly popular over the last couple of years.

ven if the current generation [of crypto-assets] is not the answer, it is throwing down the gauntlet to the existing payment systems,r Carney said. hese must now evolve to meet the demands of fully reliable, real-time, distributed transactions.

People increasingly consume, work and operate in communities, the thinking goes, yet traditional banking and payment services operate on a hub-and-spoke model.

Using the community idea familiar to many crypto users as a model, Mr Carney reckons there could be an overhaul in how we interact with government or public agencies hink paying our tax, managing our medical records, or even buying a house. Mr Carney explicitly highlighted how DLT might expedite the stamp-duty process (proptech entrepreneurs, take note).

Securities settlement is another obvious area ripe for change with the assistance of DLT, and Mr Carney is right to highlight that while it takes a nanosecond to execute a trade, it can still take days to settle.

hat why the Bank is building the new RTGS so that new forms of securities settlement that meet our standards of resilience (including those using distributed ledger) will be able to plug in directly,e added.

As an aside, the BoE is allowing non-bank payment-service providers to access RTGS directly. The first PSPs are expected to do so in a matter of weeks. That should help lower transaction costs for everyone.

Joanna Torode, a London-based lawyer at Ropes & Gray, says: ppropriate and thoughtful regulation will facilitate the better exploration of the opportunities that blockchain offers to the financial services and technology sectors in London, in particular the thriving London fintech market, particularly post-Brexit.

So in the same way as the BoE has been forced to be more nuanced in how it thinks about cryptos, maybe the crypto community should be more nuanced in how it thinks about the BoE: regulation may herald a legitimisation that in turn could bring even wider adoption.

FT Fintech video interview

The first Tuesday of every month, the FT interviews leading figures from the fintech sector on Facebook Live. This week, we will be talking to three British fintech entrepreneurs: Michael Kent, founder and chief executive of cross-border payments provider Azimo; Anne Boden, founder and CEO of digital lender Starling Bank; and Michael Rolph, co-founder and CEO of payments app YoYo Wallet. They will discuss the state of Britain's fintech industry, including how it could be transformed by new "open banking" rules and whether Brexit is a major threat. Please join us on the T's Facebook page from 11:00 GMT on Tuesday to watch what the trio have to say and send in your questions.

Further Fintech Fascination

Stock take: It big tech, not small fintech firms, that stock exchanges and clearing houses fear will disrupt their business models. A tudy by McKinsey showed that 40 per cent of exchanges and trading houses around the world worry that Amazon, Google and the like present the biggest threat, particularly when harnessing ### invalid font number 2

 and ### invalid font number 2

, to provide the lumbingo the financial system.

North star: Strong growth in Nordic countries accounted for a ig jump in profits for Klarna, one of Europe most highly valued fintechs. The $2.3bn online payments group, which has big backers including Visa and Permira, the private-equity house, has made a push into the US and UK too, but with less striking results.

The Ascent of Money: scent Technologies got a boost during its first funding round, and not just a monetary one (though it did raise $6m): the mprimatur of a former US Federal Reserve governor, Randall Kroszner. The Chicago-based company is looking at applying ### invalid font number 2

 to compliance; an area highlighted by analysts as particularly ripe for an overhaul.

IC-uh-oh: The US Securities and Exchange Commission asked Overstock for more information on its planned $250m initial coin offering, swiftly iping 10 per cent from the online retailer share price. Overstock e-commerce arm accepts Bitcoin and has a venture fund that invests in blockchain.

Trio in push on cyber security standards for fintech groups### invalid font number 1

Three of the world biggest financial institutions have joined forces to develop a set of cyber security standards for technology companies, which could allow incumbents to partner with challengers without fear of risking a damaging breach.

Big banks, insurers and other financial institutions have spent heavily in recent years on bolstering their defences against cyber attacks, assuring investors that they have done all they can to fend off criminals, acktivistsnd disaffected insiders. But they worry that the same cannot always be said for smaller fintechs, which have developed niches in areas such as online lending, payments, wealth management and biometrics.

Many big financial institutions have entered into partnership with such companies, allowing them to sift and sometimes store customersata. But as such arrangements proliferate, the incumbents say there is a growing threat of attacks via the backdoor. 

A consortium led by Citigroup, Zurich Insurance and Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation has pledged to draw up a set of cyber security standards for fintechs to sign up to. The group was brought together following a meeting hosted last year by the World Economic Forum, which promotes co-operation between the public and private sectors. 

e all live and die by each other; the weakest link in the chain is the highest point of vulnerability,aid Michael Bodson, president and chief executive of DTCC, the main US clearing house. The New York-based company has several partnerships with fintechs under way, including on blockchain technology and ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
.

e all like to think it just a bunch of kids sitting in a garageut obviously the sophistication has gone up massively in the last couple of years. It turned into an arms race, unfortunately, with not only the good guys winning,e said.

The initiative comes at a time when big financial institutions are looking to toughen their cyber defences, partly at the urging of regulators such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and New York Department of Financial Services. The SEC last month published new guidance on how public companies should disclose cyber security risks and breaches, while a new rule from the DFS, requiring top executives to attest to the durability of their company controls, came into effect this month. 

Founding members of the consortium also include Hewlett Packard Enterprise, the software company, and Kabbage, an online lender which ranks as one of the biggest funders of small businesses in the US. Participants say they aim to produce a set of standards within the next six to 12 months.

At the moment, digital apps such as Venmo, TransferWise and Acorns roam more or less freely across customersank accounts, using companies such as Plaid and Yodlee to connect them. Their right to do so was enshrined in Section 1033 of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which said consumers should be able to access their account-related data in usable electronic form. 

But operators of apps have complained that big banks and insurers have occasionally put up barriers, blaming fears over security or misuse of customer data. 

That was a concern, said Rob Frohwein, chief executive of Atlanta-based Kabbage. He saw a clear need for a iving, global standardo allow fintechs to compete with, and work with, incumbents across borders and industries.

roviding data to third parties should be done on a standard basis; one that stands the test of time,e said.

The deal is the latest sign of Wall Street embracing AI. Almost one-fifth of banks and financial-services companies surveyed by Greenwich Associates have implemented AI technology into their businesses, according to an October report by the research firm. Banks have tapped ### invalid font number 2

 for their research, trading and compliance, the report said.

Kensho, based in Cambridge, Mass., uses AI to provide data analysis for financial institutions.

"Kensho's capabilities are critical for S&P Global to be at the forefront of the technology transformation taking place within the financial markets," said S&P Global Chief Financial Officer Ewout Steenbergen.

The company was founded in 2013. Its staff consists of former employees of Google parent Alphabet Inc., Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc., an S&P Global spokesman said.

While S&P Global is known for its credit-ratings business, the New York-based company has in recent years been building its indexing and data divisions. Last month, it completed the acquisition of Panjiva Inc., another ### invalid font number 2

 company but one that tracks global supply data.

It also invested last year in London-based Algomi, which uses AI in fixed-income trading.

In its fourth-quarter earnings presentation, S&P Global indicated that it wants to expand its index division and invest in alternative data companies.

Companies, including those outside of the technology industry, have been venturing more into AI. ### invalid font number 2

, a branch of AI, is the capability of computers to learn things without programming by humans. ### invalid font number 2

S&P Global's stock has jumped more than 12% this year, hitting a record $193.30 a share on Feb. 26. The company's market capitalization has topped $48 billion, FactSet data show. On Tuesday, S&P Global rose 0.3%, to $190.99.

On Monday, at a conference in Orlando, S&P Global Chief Executive Douglas Peterson emphasized the company's focus on data and ### invalid font number 2

. "About five, six years ago, we repositioned the company around the theme of essential intelligence," Mr. Peterson said at the conference.

Kensho had raised venture-capital funding from investors including Accel, Devonshire Investors, General Catalyst Partners, Goldman Sachs & Co., GV, In-Q-Tel and New Enterprise Associates.

At what point does innovation become dangerous? The long winding road of financial inventiveness is littered with innumerable crashes, and observers must now wonder if the exchange traded funds industry is in danger of becoming too clever for its own good.

The standard narrative of financial excess is usually the most recent one involving mortgage securitisation, but investment trusts, a beloved feature of the UK investment landscape, are more relevant. The first such trust was set up 150 years ago and since then the industry has featured a long list of emerging market and split-cap blow-ups.

The common theme is product developers building previously esoteric ideas into structures that are easy to access and can be traded in real time by everyone. This included retail investors who had no idea what their split-cap or emerging markets mining fund from the Victorian era was really investing in.

Flash forward a few decades and the ETF, especially in the US, has become the vehicle for experimentation as all manner of ideas purloined from investment bank research desks now turn up as ETFs. Another trend is for turning increasingly illiquid asset classes gain, previously accessible to only professional investors nto liquid vehicles, many of which are anything but passive in their tracking.

The ETF car crash is still some way off, not least because some of the ideas are genuinely transformational. But the industry must start asking whether many of its shiny new products really are appropriate for anyone other than big institutional investors.

A gaggle of recent developments should prompt debate. A new issuer called Metaurus, for instance, launched funds that separate the S&P 500 into two ETFs: one that tracks the capital growth of the index while the other captures the dividend yield. I like the thinking behind these funds based as they are on dividend arbitrage and the growing body of work that looks at how investors will pay to express preferences. But despite my own enthusiasm I can't shake the idea that these look and feel a bit like the split-cap investment trusts of old.

ETF newcomer Breakwave provides an example of the rush to bring in alternative ideas. It lists an ETF that tracks the Baltic Dry Index, which measures the cost of shipping dry bulk commodities around the world. Again, this is an interesting idea and a great way of playing the global economic cycle, but I wonder how appropriate this is for mainstream investors.

My favourite new idea is from Canada where an outfit called Redwood has listed a hedge fund-style ETF that tries to make the most of investor behavioural and market inefficiencies. It targets several biases, such as emotional cascade, earnings overreaction, indexing bias, unloved or less loved, neglect and crowded trades. This is a compelling frontier of investment thinking, but I worry that if even hedge funds can mess this stuff up, what might happen in an ETF? I cite these ETFs not as examples of anything untoward, just to pose the questions about appropriateness and risk n each case I think they are quite compelling as long as investors understand the risks.

Exchange eyes series of deals as it inches towards finding successor to Rolet

The London Stock Exchange Group is continuing to look at large deals even as the company had little news for investors on its long-running search for a new chief executive to replace Xavier Rolet.

It is making "good progress" in the search "with a strong field of high quality candidates," said David Warren, acting chief executive following Mr Rolet's departure in November.

Several industry executives and bankers have been linked with the position, but few favourites have emerged. The exchange, which has been looking since October, has a short list of five or six names and it is likely to be an external candidate, according to two people familiar with the process. The LSE declined to comment further.

Mr Warren's comments came as the LSE shrugged off last year's slow trading environment on global markets, reporting double digit earnings growth on the back of its push into indices and derivatives clearing.

Mr Rolet ended his eight-year tenure in response to growing board pressure to resolve a governance crisis. One shareholder, The Children's Investment Fund, was unhappy at Mr Rolet's planned exit and called a shareholder vote on the futures of Mr Rolet and Donald Brydon, chairman.

Mr Warren said the LSE was following Mr Rolet's strategy, which had included a string of ever-larger deals. "There are opportunities we continue to look at as part of that strategy."

Underlining his point, the exchange disclosed a deal to buy a further 2 per cent of the LCH clearing house from minority shareholders for ¬5m, to take its stake to 68 per cent.

While the LSE was a "natural buyer" for such stakes, Mr Warren said the group was not looking to change the way it jointly operates the clearing house with big investment banks that trade swaps.

The exchange's total revenues rose 17 per cent to £.8bn for the year to December 31. Total income for the period rose 18 per cent to £.95bn.

However, total operating expenses rose 16 per cent to £19m because of acquisitions and the weakness of sterling against the dollar and euro. Shares in LSE closed down 2.66 per cent at £8.37 yesterday.

Earnings were again underpinned by the sales of data and indices to investors to benchmark their portfolios and managing the risk to the market from thousands of swaps contracts. The figures included the $685m purchase of global bond ### invalid font number 2
analytics### invalid font number 1
 businesses from Citigroup, the first significant deal since the collapse of the exchange's proposed merger with German rival Deutsche Böse a year ago.

The LSE's majority-owned clearing house, LCH, the world's largest swaps clearer, processed more than $873tn in notional swaps in 2016, up 31 per cent, as investors ignored the potential threat from European regulators to move the euro denominated swaps business to the EU after Brexit. A clearing house sits between two parties in a deal and manages the risk to the market if one side defaults.

17% Rise in LSE's total revenues, to £.8bn, for year to December 31

16% Increase in total operating costs, to £19m, lifted by acquisitions

Stock exchanges and trading venues fear that Amazon, Google and Microsoft are more likely than start-ups to harness ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
, ### invalid font number 2
big data### invalid font number 1
 and automation to challenge their role as the providers of the infrastructure for global financial markets.

Almost 40 per cent of exchanges, trading venues and clearing houses anticipate disruption from big tech in the next five years, according to a report by McKinsey, the consultancy, and the World Federation of Exchanges, a trade body.

Blockchain, automation and ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
 are among the developments that industries spanning banking to retail have identified as having the potential to bring benefits as well as upheaval. Just a fifth of the exchanges and trading venues questioned by McKinsey expect start-ups to cause the disruption in their industry.

"Is there a Kodak moment and we're not seeing it?" said Matthias Voelkel, a partner at McKinsey, referring to the photography pioneer often cited as an example of a household name failing to adapt to technological change. "Large tech could do anything," he added.

The anxiety among providers of market infrastructure is also a reflection of the blurring of lines between tech companies and exchanges, as both see profits in data that can be used in research, ### invalid font number 2
analytics### invalid font number 1
 as well as the construction of an index or tradeable financial products.

The pace of investment in areas that affect operators of market infrastructure such as exchanges, trading venues and clearing houses has outstripped that in areas such as payments and banking since 2015, McKinsey said.

Concern over the threat posed by large tech groups is amplified because they are technologically nimble, have ample firepower, and access to issuers and consumers, the report found.

Some exchanges have even compared themselves to a TV network that requires data, or in the case of a broadcaster, content, to remain relevant. "We want to protect and build and diversify our industry-leading content," Lance Uggla, chief executive of IHS Markit, the $20bn data provider, told the Financial Times. "We might do that through combinations or combining structured and unstructured data. We want to be the network."

But the exchanges are still unsure whether they will end up in competition with big tech or whether they will wind up taking part in more ventures and collaborations with Silicon Valley groups.

Technology

Venture capital spending by Japanese corporations including Toyota and Sony have reached record levels as established companies look to the start-up world to keep pace with digital innovation.

Panasonic yesterday became the latest company to join the "open innovation" boom, announcing a tie-up with San Francisco-based Scrum Ventures to accelerate start-up funding in technologies for connected home appliances. Panasonic did not disclose its investment plan but a person with knowledge of the talks said it was expected to invest roughly ¥bn ($9.4m) in Scrum.

Privately owned Japanese start-ups raised a record ¥71.7bn in 2017, compared with ¥3.6bn in 2012, according to the latest survey by Japan Venture Research. Data from Recof, a Japanese research house, also showed that corporate venture capital spending hit a record high of ¥0.9bn last year from just ¥.2bn in 2011.

Investments in ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
, robotics and the internet of things are on the rise globally, particularly driven by carmakers. While the scale is tiny compared with the US and China, the trend is pronounced as Japanese companies seek to absorb not only new technologies but also become faster at developing and launching products.

Panasonic's joint venture with Scrum, which provides funding to start-ups, comes as the Japanese group shifts away from consumer electronics to focus on batteries, car parts and industrial hardware. It also hopes to take advantage of the internet of things to keep its home appliance business relevant.

"If you look at venture trends in Silicon Valley, it's clear that information and communication technology is rapidly entering homes," said Tetsuro Homma, head of Panasonic's appliances business. "We hope to catch new ideas and propose them to our key markets in Japan, India and hopefully China as well."

Japan saw a boom in corporate venture capital funds in the early 2000s but many of these deals fell through with big companies lacking investment professionals and knowledge of how to engage with start-ups. Japanese businesses have become more experienced since then, but analysts say start-ups may not always have the same interests and timeframe as corporations. Company executives have also been vague about what exactly they plan to generate from their start-up investments.

Technology

Aurora, a year-old start-up led by the former head of Google's self-driving car unit, has raised $90m in funding, in the latest sign that investors are racing into the self-driving car market.

The Silicon Valley company's funding comes just days after California approved regulations that could see truly driverless cars appear on its roads within weeks.

Index Ventures and Greylock, the venture capital firms, jointly led the investment in the Silicon Valley company. Although terms of the equity investment were not disclosed, the deal is likely to value Aurora in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

At the same time as Aurora's funding was announced, Chris Urmson's former employer, now called Waymo, sought to consolidate its early lead by revealing that its vehicles had driven more than 5m miles on public roads.

With every extra mile bringing new data that can teach the autonomous systems and ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
 software, the pace of Waymo's data gathering is also accelerating: it took six years to reach its first 1m miles but fewer than three months for the fifth million.

Mr Urmson left the Alphabet-owned company in 2016 to start Aurora with Sterling Anderson, Tesla's former autopilot chief, and robotics professor Drew Bagnell, a co-founder of Uber's self-driving car unit.

"In a sector that has so much novelty and first-time-ness to the technology you're developing, the experience really matters," said Mike Volpi, general partner at Index Ventures, who will join Aurora's board. "It's clear today that the leader in terms of technology is Waymo. The people who built it are here at Aurora. I'm pretty sure they can do it better a second time."

Unlike some Silicon Valley start-ups, Aurora wants to partner with traditional carmakers. It has already struck partnerships with Volkswagen and Hyundai, as well as Chinese electric vehicle start-up Byton.

The new funds will help it to accelerate development of its technology for these customers and expand its team.

Small businesses

Scotland has announced plans for a £bn national investment bank to support smaller businesses and strategic projects with "patient" long-term funding.

Nicola Sturgeon, first minister, welcomed proposals yesterday for a government-owned bank to be in operation by 2020.

"The time for debating whether or not this is a good idea has passed, it is now time to get on with making it happen," she said. "We are determined now to move at pace."

The Scottish National party sees the investment bank as an important way of boosting Scotland's anaemic growth rate, which has lagged well behind that of the UK as a whole in the past few years.

Under proposals drawn up for the Scottish government by Benny Higgins, chief executive of Tesco Bank, the investment bank would fill a "gap in the market" for loans of £m to £0m to small and medium sized enterprises with high growth potential.

The bank would also help fund, possibly through direct investment, projects that aim to promote innovation to tackle "grand challenges" such as carbon emission reduction or ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
, Mr Higgins said.

With capital of £bn quivalent to around 1.3 per cent of Scotland's gross domestic product he bank would have the "scope and scale to be transformational to the Scottish economy," his proposal said.

Mr Higgins cited Germany's KfW as an example of the economic contribution a state investment bank could make. He dismissed concerns that a new bank, which would have a core mission of promoting economic development and aim to achieve returns in excess of the cost of capital, might "crowd out" profit-seeking commercial lenders.

Research for the new bank argues that "short-termism and risk-aversion" mean the private sector will often not invest in innovation early enough.

artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
, ### invalid font number 2
big data### invalid font number 1
 and automation to challenge their role as the providers of the infrastructure for global financial markets.

Almost 40 per cent of exchanges, trading venues and clearing houses anticipate disruption from big tech in the next five years, according to a new report by McKinsey, the consultancy, and World Federation of Exchanges, a trade body.

Blockchain, automation and ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
 are among the developments that industries from banking to retail have identified as having the potential to bring benefits as well as upheaval. Just a fifth of the exchanges and trading venues questioned by McKinsey expect start-ups to cause the disruption in their industry.

s there a Kodak moment and wee not seeing it?aid Matthias Voelkel, a partner at McKinsey, referring to Eastman Kodak, the photography pioneer often cited as an example of a household name failing to adapt to technological change. arge tech could do anything,e added.

The anxiety among providers of market infrastructure is also a reflection of the blurring lines between tech companies and exchanges, as both see profits in data that can be used in research, ### invalid font number 2
analytics### invalid font number 1
 as well as the construction of an index or tradeable financial products. 

The pace of investment in areas that affect operators of market infrastructure such as exchanges, trading venues and clearing houses as outstripped that in areas like payments and banking since 2015, McKinsey said.

Concern over the threat posed by large tech companies is amplified because they are technologically nimble, have ample firepower, access to issuers and consumers, the report found.

Some exchanges have even compared themselves to a TV network that requires data, or in the case of a broadcaster, content, to remain relevant. 

e want to protect and build and diversify our industry leading content. We might do that through combinations or combining structured and unstructured data. We want to be the network,ance Uggla, chief executive of HS Markit, the $20bn data provider, told the Financial Times.

However, the exchanges are unsure whether they may ultimately end up in competition with big tech or it will result in more ventures and collaboration between them and Silicon Valley.

The study from McKinsey estimated that investment by fintech in capital markets had nearly quadrupled since 2010, and stood at more than $2bn in 2016. 

Numbers for 2017 have been swelled by initial coin offerings, in which blockchain-based start-ups issue their own digital oins CB Insights stimates that blockchain start-ups, alone, pulled in $2.8bn using ICO funding last year, five times as much as equity funding.

e don know of a member who isn looking at fintech, who isn looking at this space right now,aid Nandini Sukumar, chief executive of the WFE.

The survey also showed a mismatch in perception between the fintech companies and exchanges over where innovation in capital markets is most active. 

Most fintechs saw more innovation in areas like opening up access to capital, developing ### invalid font number 2
analytics### invalid font number 1
 and data or execution of trades. By contrast, half of all exchanges saw it in post-trade services like clearing and settlement, via blockchain.

Blockchains are lectronic databases of transactions, whereby new deals are added to the chain and then stamped and protected with a mathematical equation. t a classic disconnect between industry and start-up,aid Ms Sukumar. ost-trade is an area that has typically lacked investment.

Chinese Smartphone Maker Xiaomi Weighs Listing in Mainland and Hong Kong; Xiaomi's initial public offering is expected to raise $10 billion in the second half of the year### invalid font number 1

China wants one of its biggest tech unicorns to go public at home.

Authorities have asked smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. to list its shares on the mainland, according to people familiar with the situation, who say the company is considering doing so with a dual listing. It already plans a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/xiaomi-plots-a-path-out-of-the-wilderness-with-a-big-ipo-1513933772".

Beijing-based Xiaomi aims to raise at least $10 billion, according to people familiar with the matter, which would make the IPO one of the largest globally this year. The company is targeting a valuation of $80 billion to $100 billion, one of the people said.

Unicorns are private companies with valuations above $1 billion. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-xiaomi-raises-over-1-billion-in-investment-round-1419093589".

A Xiaomi spokeswoman declined to comment. Representatives of the China Securities Regulatory Commission didn't return requests for comment.

A dual listing would be a win for Chinese regulators, which have been trying to get large homegrown companies to participate in the country's capital markets. A string of tech giants have listed their shares elsewhere: internet giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc. in New York and Tencent Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong.

There have been few concurrent dual listings by Chinese companies that included their home market. The most recent was in 2010, when state-owned "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704535004575349210680027260", according to Dealogic data.

Some market participants and analysts say regulators could encourage more technology companies by loosening listing rules. Currently only companies that have been profitable for three consecutive years, or that obtain special approval from a state council, can apply to go public on the Shanghai or Shenzhen stock exchange.

Foxconn Industrial Internet Co., a subsidiary of Taiwan-based electronics contract manufacturer Foxconn Technology Group that was established less than three years ago, recently won approval from the state council to seek a Shanghai IPO.

The participants and analysts say securities regulators could also expedite their IPO review processhich currently takes as long as 18 monthsor companies that are industry leaders.

After a meeting in early January with internet, ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
 and biotech companies, Zhang Shenfeng, assistant chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said the agency aims to "keep the good companies at home" and allow them to go public as soon as possible, according to a statement. Three weeks later, commission Chairman Liu Shiyu said at a conference that China's listing rules could be changed to help support more technology and new-economy companies.

A dual listing could benefit Xiaomi. The company, founded in 2010, sells its phones mostly in China, and could draw interest from the many domestic investors familiar with its brand.

Xiaomi has increased its global smartphone market share by expanding into new markets such as India and Spain. In fiercely competitive China, it "https://www.wsj.com/articles/xiaomi-plots-a-path-out-of-the-wilderness-with-a-big-ipo-1513933772", trailing Huawei Technologies Co., Oppo Electronics Corp. and Vivo Electronics Corp, according to Counterpoint Research.

But after declining in 2016, Xiaomi's China market share rose last year, and its overall smartphone shipments were up more than 50% to 96 million units, according to Counterpoint. And Xiaomi has been broadening its offerings beyond phones to include internet-connected devices from rice cookers to air purifiers.

Xiaomi doesn't publicly report financial results, but a spokeswoman previously said annual revenue exceeds 100 billion yuan ($15.2 billion). In the U.S., Xiaomi's product line is currently limited to connected devices like Bluetooth speakers and fitness trackers, but it has plans to sell smartphones eventually.

CMO Today: WPP's Weak Earnings Report; Spotify's IPO; NBCU Cuts Ad Time; Here's your morning roundup of the biggest marketing, advertising and media industry news and happenings.### invalid font number 1

Good morning. Marketing departments often conjure up new specialist roles so their companies can get their heads around the latest trends and technologies. Remember everyone rushing to appoint a "head of mobile" and "digital evangelists"? Here's a new one: "http://www.thedrum.com/news/2018/02/28/bank-america-creates-brand-safety-officer-role-help-it-clean-up-house". The new job was born out of a necessity to clean house. The bank's senior vice president and enterprise media executive Lou Paskalis said at Mobile World Congress earlier this week: "I get a text from my chief financial officer every time there is news about a brand safety issue. I know why he is sending them to me... at some point he is going to say 'gee, is marketing safe to invest in?' and we don't want that."

Oh You Pretty Things

WPP rounded off the agency holding company earnings season with its "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wpp-shares-plunge-on-worst-results-in-years-1519894944", which summed up a fairly shoddy 12 months across the sector. In the earnings release, Mr. Sorrell said, "2017 for us was not a pretty year." He blamed cost-cutting by clients engaged in zero-based budgeting and technological changes as the main contributors to the company's decline in full-year sales. WPP also warned that 2018 would be a slog, too, and set budgets on the assumption that both revenue and net sales will be flat. The antidote? "Horizontality": WPP's effort to simplify its vast structure of specialist shops and get its agencies working better together on client projects. We've already seen the consolidation of agencies such as the formation of Wavemaker in its media division and yesterday's merger of Burson- Marsteller and Cohn & Wolfe in the PR vertical. The company is also "horizontalizing" (they said it, not me) its internal systems, announcing today, for example, its production management platform Hogarth will now be rolled out for the entire company to use.

ediapawhoza?

Rival agency groups have suggested 2018 may have a repeat of 2015's "Mediapalooza," when a large number of clients called media reviews. But Mr. Sorrell doesn't see a Mediapalooza 2 on the horizon, saying that while there has been increased new business activityajor reviews going on at the moment include Mars, Shell and HSBCt's not particularly busier than any other time. WPP Finance Chief Paul Richardson even said that the $21 billion of media billings on the table three years ago wasn't dramatically more than the $18 billion that usually changes hands in a normal year. What *is* significant, according to Mark Read, CEO of WPP's Wunderman, is that a tremendous amount of the activity this time is driven by companies looking at data and how they organize their tech stack, including how they work with companies like Adobe and Salesforce.

Raising the Roof

We finally have a look under the hood of Spotify's business after the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-kicks-off-its-unusual-ipo-1519847272", WSJ reports. Lots to absorb from an advertising perspective. Spotify had 92 million monthly users on its ad-supported service this year, up 19% on 2016. It had 159 million monthly users in total. (Interesting that a monthly active user is counted if they consume content for "greater than zero" millisecondshat's one very short song!) Ad-supported revenue grew 41% to ¬16 million ($507 million) in 2017, which the company said was due to an increase in the number of impressions sold, driven largely by the growth in its programmatic channel. Spotify also managed to boost its average rate per impression by 7%, buoyed by the growth of its premium video offering. Elsewhere in the filing, Spotify says 62% of its users are in the coveted 18- to 34-year-old demo, and that there's a big opportunity to grow its user base by gaining share from the $28 billion global radio market.

This Is the Next Century, Where NBCUniversal's Free (Of Ads?)

Typical! A week after I suggested that the smattering of news about TV companies experimenting with reducing their ad minutage doesn't look to be escalating into a widespread trend, another network group makes a big announcement about cutting down their commercials. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nbcu-cuts-ad-time-in-original-prime-time-shows-by-10-1519837249" across its networks, CMO Today reports. NBCU also wants to reduce the number of ads per break by 20%. The network hopes to offset the reductions by running a standalone 60-second ad break at the start or the end of a show. Interestingly, Pivotal Research Group Senior Analyst Brian Wieser wrote in a research note earlier this month that NBCU was far from the worst offender as far as ad load is concerned. NBCU had average ad loads of 11.1 minutes per hour in January, roughly in the middle of the 10 national U.S. TV network groups analyzed. Viacom had the highest, at 14.6 minutes per hour.

A Time and a Placed

A newsletter exclusive: You might remember Placed as the location ### invalid font number 2
analytics### invalid font number 1
 company Snap acquired for $135 million in cash last year. Now Placed, which continues to operate independently from Snap, also wants to be remembered as the go-to metric for offline location data, the company's CEO David Shim tells me. From Thursday, any brand, agency or Placed competitor will get free access to Placed's Insights dashboard (the company will also continue to operate a paid-for premium service) to get data about the types of people that visit particular stores and which other brands and categories they have an affinity with. Mr. Shim tells me that while Nielsen is seen as the standard for TV ratings and comScore for website visits, there hasn't really been a common currency for visits in the physical world. Placed gets its location data from owned-and-operated apps. Users opt-in to share their whereabouts in the background, in exchange for rewards like airline miles or charitable donations. Mr. Shim tells me it's this opt-in consent approach which puts the company in good stead when Europe's new General Data Protection Regulation comes into force in May.

Scotland has announced plans for a £bn national investment bank to support smaller businesses and strategic projects with atientong-term funding.

Nicola Sturgeon, first minister, welcomed proposals on Wednesday for a government-owned bank to be in operation by 2020.

he time for debating whether or not this is a good idea has passed, it is now time to get on with making it happen,s Sturgeon said. e are determined now to move at pace. 

The Scottish National party sees the investment bank as an important way of boosting Scotland anaemic growth rate, which has lagged well behind that of the UK as a whole in recent years. 

Under proposals drawn up for the Scottish government by Benny Higgins, chief executive of Tesco Bank, the investment bank would fill a ap in the marketor loans of £m to £0m to small and medium-sized enterprises with high growth potential.

The bank would also help fund, possibly through direct investment, projects that aim to promote innovation to tackle rand challengesuch as carbon emission reduction or ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
, Mr Higgins said. 

With capital of £bn quivalent to about 1.3 per cent of Scotland gross domestic product he bank would have the cope and scale to be transformational to the Scottish economy the proposal said.

Mr Higgins cited Germany KfW as an example of the economic contribution a state investment bank could make. 

He dismissed concerns that a new bank, which would have a core mission of promoting economic development and aim to achieve returns in excess of the cost of capital, might rowd outrofit-seeking commercial lenders. 

Research for the new bank argues that hort-termism and risk-aversioneans the private sector will often not invest in innovative activities at an early enough stage. 

nnovation requires patient strategic finance, and there is simply not much of that in the UK,aid Mariana Mazzucato, director of the Institute for Innovation and Public Purpose at University College London and an adviser to the Scottish government. 

Ms Sturgeon said the government would formally respond to the proposals in May, but that Mr Higginsimetable of starting operations in 2020 appeared hallenging but achievable

The government has already budgeted £40m in initial public capital for the bank.

Aurora raises $90m as investors race into self-driving sector### invalid font number 1

Aurora, a year-old start-up led by the former head of Google self-driving car unit, has raised $90m in funding, in the latest sign that investors are racing into the self-driving car market. 

The Silicon Valley company funding comes just days after California approved regulations that could see truly driverless cars appear on its roads within weeks.

Index Ventures and Greylock, the venture capital firms, jointly led the investment in Aurora. Although terms of the equity investment were not disclosed, the deal is likely to value Aurora in the hundreds of millions of dollars. 

At the same time as Aurora's funding was announced, Mr Urmson former employer, now called Waymo, sought to consolidate its early lead in autonomous technology by revealing that its vehicles had driven more than 5m miles on public roads. 

With every extra mile bringing new experiences that can teach the autonomous systems and ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
 software, the pace of Waymo data gathering is also accelerating: it took six years to reach its first 1m miles but fewer than three months for the fifth million. 

oday, wee driving as many miles in one day as the average American adult drives in a whole year,Waymo said in a blog post on Wednesday. 

Mr Urmson left the Alphabet-owned company in 2016 to start Aurora with Sterling Anderson, Tesla former autopilot chief, and robotics professor Drew Bagnell, a co-founder of Uber self-driving car unit.

n a sector that has so much novelty and first-time-ness to the technology youe developing, the experience really matters,aid Mike Volpi, general partner at Index Ventures, who will be joining Aurora's board. t clear today that the leader in terms of technology is Waymo. The people who built it are here at Aurora. I pretty sure they can do it better a second time.

Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn and a Greylock partner who will also join Aurora's board, added: ased on background alone, Chris could be considered as the Henry Ford of autonomous vehicles.

Unlike some Silicon Valley start-ups such as Zoox, which are planning to develop their own self-driving vehicle, Aurora wants to partner with traditional carmakers.

It has already struck partnerships with Volkswagen and Hyundai, as well as Chinese electric vehicle start-up Byton. The new funds will help it to accelerate development of its technology for these customers and expand its team. 

Mr Volpi said the company model to work alongside, rather than in competition with, existing carmakers was a key differentiator from rivals at a time when it was unclear whether Silicon Valley was friend or foe to the car industry.

Aurora is hoping to win customers among both manufacturers and fleet operators such as Uber or Lyft, which plan to run obo-taxiervices. 

he business models of the ncumbentsamong Silicon Valley autonomous driving companies] are a little unclear,r Volpi said. he landscape is odd and it creating a very interesting opportunity for Aurora.

Splunk Inc. has agreed to acquire venture-backed Phantom Cyber Corp. for about $350 million in cash and stock, as the ### invalid font number 2
big-data### invalid font number 1
 specialist seeks to expand its cybersecurity offerings.

The acquisition, Splunk's largest acquisition to date, is also a notable exit for Phantom's investors, which include Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, TechOperators Venture Capital, Blackstone, Foundation Capital, In-Q-Tel and Rein Capital. Phantom, founded four years ago, had raised about $23 million, and its valuation was just under $100 million following its funding round in January 2017, according to PitchBook Data Inc.

Tuesday's deal comes after a two-year uptick in cybersecurity M&A, with financial and strategic buyers completing $41 billion such deals, according to data tracker Momentum Cyber. Last year, another automation cybersecurity startup, Hexadite, was acquired by Microsoft Corp. for an undisclosed sum.

Phantom Cyber provides security automation and orchestration tools that help clients ensure that the existing cybersecurity products they own are working well together. By automating menial tasks, Phantom aims to ensure cybersecurity personnel have more time to focus on bigger threats.

The automation and orchestration category has been an increasingly attractive opportunity for venture investors. Companies have been spending record amounts on cybersecurity to secure their digital assets in the wake of high-profile data breaches at Equifax and Target.

But the supply of talented cybersecurity professionals hasn't kept up with the demand for their skills. Venture investors have been funding companies that can help alleviate that shortage.

Splunk Senior Vice Preisdent of Security Markets Haiyan Song said the product will bring relief to Spunk customers who have struggled to hire security teams.

"Even if they have the budget they might not be able to find the people who have the skills," Ms. Song said.

Phantom Cyber, based in Palo Alto, Calif., has about 100 employees. Chief Executive and founder Oliver Friedrichs will join Splunk, and the companies are still completing hiring plans for other Phantom employees.

Mr. Friedrichs said the Splunk acquisition will allow Phantom to consider expansion into automating and orchestrating other IT tasks beyond cybersecurity.

"Splunk is collecting, storing and analyzing data," Mr. Friedrichs said. "Phantom is all about taking action on data."

The world largest sovereign wealth fund has sharply reduced its stakes in the three largest listed gunmakers in the US amid a growing debate over how investors should react to mass shootings. 

Norway $1.1tn oil fund cut its stake in American Outdoor Brands ormerly known as Smith & Wesson y almost 90 per cent during last year. As of December 31 2017, the fund owned just 0.15 per cent of the company. 

The fund overnment Pension Fund Global lmost halved its stake in Sturm Ruger, a maker of pistols, revolvers and rifles, to 1 per cent while it cut its holding in Vista Outdoor by a quarter to 0.7 per cent. 

The fund only discloses its ownership positions once a year and noted that the reduction took place in 2017, before the recent debate sparked by the killing of 17 in a shooting at a Florida school earlier this month. 

Yngve Slyngstad, the oil fund chief executive, declined to comment on the individual companies but stressed that the fund had ot put these companies on a divestment route 

He said: e don have a deliberate strategy with regards to gun use because this is not a sector that we are covering in our security selection strategies. Our changing ownership in these companies will be an effect of quantitative strategies more than any specific ### invalid font number 2
analytics### invalid font number 1
. 

Norway oil fund is barred from owning a number of companies based on the products they make, from nuclear weapons and coal to tobacco and cluster munitions. It has proposed excluding oil and gas companies from its portfolio but Mr Slyngstad said any decision on gunmakers would be for the council of ethics, an independent body, to take, not the fund itself.

The disclosures of its holdings, which came as part of its annual report released on Tuesday, come amid a growing debate about how investors and companies should deal with the large number of shootings in the US. 

BlackRock, the world largest asset manager and also the biggest shareholder in American Outdoor Brands and Sturm Ruger, said it spoke to gunmakers o understand their responseo the school shooting but did not say whether it would reduce its stakes. State Street, another large US investor, said it would talk to gunmakers o seek greater transparency from them on the ways that they will support the safe and responsible use of their products 

The oil fund separately reported one of the best years in its 20-year history as it returned 13.7 per cent in 2017, helped by booming equity markets. Equities returned almost 20 per cent, while property and bonds also contributed positively. The NKr1tn ($128bn) return was the biggest ever measured in kroner. 

But Mr Slyngstad stressed that the good times would not continue forever, warning Norwegians to be prepared for a potential fall in value in the future. 

He also reiterated the fund position that it would stay invested in the UK regardless of the outcome of Brexit talks. e remain a long-term and committed investor in the UK in all asset classes,r Slyngstad said.

Alibaba is in negotiations to acquire Ele.me in a deal that would value the online food delivery start up at as much as $9.5bn as the ecommerce conglomerate seeks to build up its dominance in delivery and food services in China.

Alibaba and its affiliate Ant Financial already own 40 per cent of Ele.me but are looking to buy the remaining 60 per cent from existing investors including Baidu, according to people familiar with the matter. 

Alibaba and Baidu declined to comment on the negotiations. 

Ele.me, a play on the Chinese phrase for ungry yet?, has emerged as one of the biggest food delivery players within China since being founded in 2008. 

Should the deal go through, Alibaba would become one of the country largest players in food delivery, rivalled only by online-to-offline services platform Meituan Dianping, which is backed by Alibaba competitor, the internet group Tencent.

China food delivery market was valued at Rmb204.6bn ($32.5bn) in 2017, according to the China Cuisine Association, an industry group. 

For Baidu, the deal would mean an exit from another services sector as it focuses on developing emerging technologies in ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
 and autonomous driving. 

Meanwhile, Alibaba has sought to build up its logistics and delivery capabilities. Unlike e-commerce giant JD.com, it does not employ its own delivery workers or own the warehouses that store its inventory but must rely on third-party providers. 

It has invested significantly in offline retail, started its Hema chain of supermarkets and has shored up the scope of Cainiao, an expansive logistics platform that began as a grocery delivery system.

Nomad Health Inc., an online marketplace to connect health-care professionals with freelance work, has raised a $12 million Series B round.

Polaris Partners led the round, with participation from First Round Capital, RRE Ventures and .406 Ventures. The latest financing brings Nomad's total funding to date to $17 million.

Alexi Nazem, a physician, founded Nomad in 2015 with MongoDB Inc. founder Kevin Ryan seeking to remove the middleman in job-finder services. The platform allows employers and prospects to contact one another directly. The company says its platform can help organizations save up to 40% on recruitment fees.

The impetus for the company's creation was the complex and time-consuming hiring process for freelance health-care professionals. Although the health-care industry is now the largest source of jobs in the U.S., the country still grapples with a shortage of doctors and nurses. Dr. Nazem thinks Nomad could be a valuable tool in quickly filling jobs.

"For the first time ever, health care became the largest share of jobs created in the U.S. economy, and that will put more pressure on recruiters to do their job as quickly and effectively as possible," said Dr. Nazem.

Nomad is available in 12 states including California, Texas and New York. Dr. Nazem said there are over 35,000 clinical professionals on the platform and around 1,500 medical facilities.

With the new funding, the company plans growth of its sales team and will explore ways to add more capabilities to the platform. Dr. Nazem said existing customers have been asking for tools for things like onboarding and employee ### invalid font number 2
analytics### invalid font number 1
, and he said he would eventually like Nomad to function as a workforce management platform.

Polaris Managing Partner Brian Chee will join New York-based Nomad's board of directors.

Ben Golub, a former chief executive of software startups Docker Inc. and Plaxo, has joined Mayfield Fund as a venture adviser.

Mr. Golub will focus on evaluating opportunities in enterprise software and emerging technologies such as blockchain-related investments.

Navin Chaddha, Mayfield's managing director, called the firm's approach on blockchain is "nascent" and said it would likely involve enabling technology at the protocol layer and perhaps blockchain-based apps that help both consumers and enterprise.

He said Mayfield was attracted to Mr. Golub because he brings a "complete skill set" owing to his years of operational and entrepreneurial experience in software. He will be the firm's sole adviser, working alongside five investing partners.

From 2013 to last year, Mr. Golub was CEO of Docker, a software infrastructure company that helped usher in the containerization model in the industry. Before that he held CEO roles at personal-information app Plaxo until its acquisition by Comcast Corp. in 2008, and at open-source storage startup Gluster through its acquisition by Red Hat Inc. in 2012.

As a teenager, Mr. Golub once tended to apricot orchards on land that today is occupied by a different sort of fruit, Apple Inc. He said he is now interested in open-source software, ### invalid font number 2

 and data companies.

He serves an adviser to startups including Minio, TrustE, Quilt, and Streamlio, and holds board seats at two companies that he said are in stealth mode.

Mayfield, based in Menlo Park, Calif., closed its last fund in 2016 at $400 million. The firm's recent deals include investments in Lendingkart, Poshmark and HashiCorp.

How SoftBank, World's Biggest Tech Investor, Throws Around Its Cash; SoftBank is on a shopping spree, investing billions in firms such as Uber and WeWork, both directly and through an affiliated tech fund### invalid font number 1

Corrections & Amplifications

David Chao is general partner of DCM Ventures. Plenty is a South San Francisco startup. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated Mr. Chao was a managing partner of DCM Partners and Plenty was a San Francisco startup. (Feb. 26, 2018)

Tech magnate Masayoshi Son often befuddles people in his industry with the large sums he is willing to pay for stakes in companies.

That includes his directors.

Shigenobu Nagamori says he objected when Mr. Son, chief executive of SoftBank Group Corp., told his board in 2016 he wanted to pay "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-agrees-to-buy-arm-holdings-for-more-than-32-billion-1468808434". The U.K. chip-design firm was worth a 10th of that, Mr. Nagamori, then a SoftBank outside director, says he told Mr. Son.

Mr. Son paid it anyway. And he continued a buying spree, picking up stakes in dozens more companies, many of them "http://www.wsj.com/graphics/tech-startup-stocks-to-watch/#"uch as Uber Technologies Inc. and WeWork Cos. In some of those deals, too, he had to argue with directors and advisers who thought he was paying too much.

Investors want to understand just how Mr. Son goes about deciding on his billions of dollars of bets, among the largest in the tech industry, which he does through SoftBank and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-the-long-painful-birth-of-the-worlds-biggest-tech-fund-1495214782". Current and former SoftBank directors, executives, investing partners and others who know Mr. Son give a glimpse into how he works. It appears sometimes methodical, sometimes haphazard.

They describe a man who sometimes makes gut-instinct decisions in businesses he knows little aboutuch as the time he spent about 30 minutes deciding he wanted to invest $200 million in a"https://www.wsj.com/articles/indoor-farming-takes-root-at-california-startup-1486981806". Other times, he compiles an elaborate analysis, inundating his directors with hundreds of pages of documents to help explain an investment target.

To strike quickly, he sometimes commits to investments before getting approval from his fund's investment committee, some of these people say. And he often spars with his executives and board members over his proposals until they are convinced or acquiesce.

"I've opposed almost all of Mr. Son's proposed investments," says SoftBank director Tadashi Yanai, president of Fast Retailing Co., "https://www.wsj.com/articles/uniqlo-founder-thinks-u-s-needs-fewer-malls-and-more-of-his-stores-1509969603". Instead of acting like a speculative investor, he says, Mr. Son should focus on "real business." Mr. Yanai has publicly said his role is to tell Mr. Son things that are painful to hear. He and Mr. Nagamori have publicly praised Mr. Son's vision and drive, saying they support him despite reservations on investments.

Understanding the 60-year-old Mr. Son matters because of his outsize impact. SoftBank, his Tokyo-based tech-investment-and-telecom firm, has led investments totaling about $145 billion in companies since 1995, according to deal tracker Dealogic, including "https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-headline-available-1394139736" U.S. mobile carrier Sprint. He wields the world's biggest technology fund, the $92 billion Vision Fund, and a $6 billion affiliate, brandishing investments that often make him a company's biggest shareholder.

Last year, he spent around $37 billion on more than 40 companies, according to Dealogic. Among them was "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-succeeds-in-tender-offer-for-large-stake-in-uber-1514483283" for a roughly 15% share.

Many in tech finance believe his investments "https://www.wsj.com/graphics/billion-dollar-club/". "We all thought the unicorn stuff was going to start slowing down," says Tim Connors, founder of the Silicon Valley venture-capital firm PivotNorth Capital. "Then along comes SoftBank and lobs another $90 billion into what many people thought was already an overheated market."

His money makes waves beyond tech. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-is-in-talks-to-buy-big-stake-in-insurer-swiss-re-1518030022" in a deal that could be valued at $10 billion or more, The Wall Street Journal reported this month.

SoftBank declined to make Mr. Son available for an interview. In November, he told the Journal SoftBank does due diligence to ensure its investments' valuations are appropriate.

"Mr. Son's activities, including the Vision Fund, are extremely prominent and flashy, and it makes people think he's taking on a huge amount of risk," says Yasuhiro Sato, CEO of Mizuho Financial Group, SoftBank's main bank. "I can guarantee that we've been monitoring the risk very carefully."

Outlook: 00 years'

Mr. Son has said his goal is to take big stakes in a coalition of companies driving technological change that will "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-group-corp-plans-to-list-telecom-cash-cow-1517986513" He told reporters this month because the Vision Fund invests in unicorns and companies that are No. 1 in their markets, he expects "extremely high growth" from them.

Arm CEO Simon Segars, a SoftBank director, says Mr. Son's investments often are in companies that collect large amounts of data on how people live, work or move. "I can look at the majority of those investments that have been made and say, look, the data angle is this."

A Japanese of Korean descent, Mr. Son attended the University of California, Berkeley, and in 1981 founded SoftBank as a software distributor. He led its investments in more than 1,300 companies, sometimes on gut instinct. He often recounts deciding to put $20 million in a fledgling Chinese e-commerce firm named Alibaba in 2000 because of the "sparkle" in CEO Jack Ma's eyes stake now valued at about $120 billion.

He survived a close call in the dot-com bust after 1999, when "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB985815778394585467" of its value. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB106633694181524900". SoftBank is now Japan's No. 7 company in revenue, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence.

Venture investor David Chao says it took Mr. Son just around half an hour in a 2017 meeting to decide to back Plenty, a South San Francisco startup that grows vegetables indoors. Mr. Son was skeptical before the meeting, says Mr. Chao, an early Plenty investor. He gave Mr. Chao and Plenty CEO Matt Barnard 15 minutes to make their case at Mr. Son's Woodside, Calif., residence.

Mr. Chao says he brought a 7-foot growing wallhe vegetables are produced on themutting off lettuce and mustard greens for Mr. Son to try. Mr. Son quizzed Mr. Barnard and listened to his plan for indoor farms in the U.S.

Soon, Mr. Son was lecturing him to think bigger, suggesting the company expand abroad. "The next thing you know, it's like: ow much do you need and let's get this deal done,' " says Mr. Chao, general partner of DCM Ventures, in which SoftBank has a minority investment. "He doesn't let capital be a constraint."

Four months later, Mr. Son invested around $200 millionwice what Plenty had asked for, Mr. Chao said.

A Plenty spokesman declined to make Mr. Barnard available for comment.

Mr. Son has publicly praised Plenty for using ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
 and "Internet of Things" technologyeaturing networks of sensors and computing chips.

Mr. Son's willingness to make quick bets surprised CEO Eugene Izhikevich of San Diego ### invalid font number 2
artificial-intelligence### invalid font number 1
 company Brain, which is developing self-driving technology. In May, Mr. Son asked how much it would take to speed Brain's rollout, Mr. Izhikevich says. Within two months, SoftBank had invested $114 million through the Vision Fund. "Something I thought would take 10 to 15 years," he says, "now I can achieve three to five times faster."

Often, Mr. Son will rough out deal terms on his own, leaving little for SoftBank and Vision Fund deal teams to do, people familiar with the investments say.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/behind-the-long-painful-birth-of-the-worlds-biggest-tech-fund-1495214782", with funds from SoftBank and investors such as Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. The fund has its own investment committee, including Mr. Son, that approves deals. Some of its biggest deals are also brought before SoftBank's board.

The line between SoftBank and the Vision Fund isn't always clear. SoftBank units advise and manage the fund. SoftBank must offer deals of $100 million or more to the Vision Fund.

To move fast, Mr. Son sometimes agrees to deals first and passes them to the investment committee for approval later, say people familiar with the process. SoftBank's Uber investment, for instance, hasn't yet been approved by the Vision Fund's committee, although SoftBank has said it plans to transfer it to the fund.

Board persuasion

Other times, Mr. Son researches his targets extensively, spelling out scenarios for how the investment will play out. When he pitches deals to his SoftBank board, says Mr. Nagamori, the former director, he often gives it hundreds of pages of documents in advance.

Mr. Son can go "on and on" explaining his conclusions if directors challenge him, says Mr. Nagamori, CEO of precision-motor maker Nidec Corp., who says he resigned in September because it consumed too much time. "If you want to lodge a proper challenge" to Mr. Son, he says, "you need to really study upt takes a tremendous amount of time."

In some deals, SoftBank executives and directors have told Mr. Son they thought he was overpaying, say people with knowledge of those conversations.

In 2015, Mr. Son wanted to buy Arm, which designs chips for products ranging from smartphones to networked cars. Several SoftBank executives told him SoftBank didn't have the financial strength to buy Arm, persuading him to raise cash by selling some holdings first, people familiar with the discussions say. "It was like pulling teeth," one says.

By mid-2016, Mr. Son had raised the money and tracked down Arm's chairman on a yacht in the Mediterranean to propose the deal, says Mr. Segars, Arm's CEO, who was present.

Mr. Son's projections to support his $32 billion bid included a prediction that Arm-designed networked chips would dominate the market, which Mr. Nagamori says he considered too optimistic. "I said, ome competitor is bound to emerge, so you can't pay such a high price.' " He eventually relented, although he says he remains unpersuaded about the valuation.

"From the outside, some of the moves are riskier moves than most companies would take," says Mr. Segars. "But history has shown that he's been right more often than he's been wrong."

At a 2017 shareholder meeting, Mr. Son said it was natural for directors to have different opinions and dissent was a sign of healthy management.

Price concerns also emerged during Mr. Son's "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-a-20-billion-startup-fueled-by-silicon-valley-pixie-dust-1508424483", was pitched to SoftBank executives in early 2015. It was valued at around $5 billion then, estimates Dow Jones VentureSource, which tracks venture-capital data.

SoftBank's investment head at the time dismissed the pitch because he didn't see WeWork as a tech company and worried it was too expensive, especially given SoftBank's weak finances at the time, say people familiar with the discussion.

In January 2016, with WeWork's valuation at $10 billion, Mr. Son met CEO Adam Neumann and was intrigued by his vision of how work would evolve, says WeWork Japan CEO Chris Hill. Mr. Son told Mr. Neumann he was moving too slowly, and he responded that WeWork needed "fuel," Mr. Hill says. WeWork declined to make Mr. Neumann available for comment.

A year later, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-mulls-investment-of-over-1-billion-in-wework-1485814702", the Journal reported. Most SoftBank directors were opposed, telling him they didn't understand why SoftBank should invest in what they viewed as essentially a real-estate company, say people familiar with the discussions. Some SoftBank executives thought WeWork's valuation, then $17 billion, was excessive, says one.

Mr. Son prevailed, leading SoftBank and the Vision Fund to invest $4.4 billion in WeWork in 2017, boosting its valuation to around $20 billion. "Mr. Son has his own ideas," says a SoftBank executive who says he sees his job as telling the CEO his qualms while also supporting him.

Mr. Son's buying spree continues. In January, the Vision Fund put $300 million in Los Angeles-based dog-walking app Wag Labs Inc. During a press conference, he called it "Uber for dogs."

It also invested ¬60 million ($562.7 million) in German online used-car dealer Auto1 Group. Mr. Son urged it to take more money than it had planned and "think bigger," says Matt Krna, managing partner of tech-investment fund Princeville Global, which introduced Auto1 to SoftBank a few months ago. Auto1 declined to comment.

"Anyone can be optimistic," says Mr. Krna. "Masa really makes enormous bets on his beliefs."

Media and publishing companies have once again become a darling of buyout firms. In the first seven weeks of this year firms have already spent nearly $18 billion in media acquisitions, putting 2018 on track to become the largest amount invested in a single year since the global financial crisis.

In the media space, buyout houses are showing growing appetite for companies that produce data and ### invalid font number 2
analytics### invalid font number 1
 valuable to the financial service industry.

Before the global financial crisis, in 2006 and 2007, buyout firms spent nearly $100 billion in the two years combined on media companies globally but investments in the sector decreased fast, according to data provider Dealogic Ltd.

Amid declining advertising and subscriptions, firms pulled their money out of the sector, and over the past decade buyout houses have spent no more than $20 billion in a single year, Dealogic said. The figures also include film and broadcasting deals.

The $17 billion acquisition of a 55% stake in Thomson Reuters Corp.'s data and terminal by a consortium led by Blackstone Group LP comprised a majority of the cash invested by private-equity firms in media companies this year.

The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Singaporean sovereign-wealth fund GIC Pte. Ltd. are also part of the consortium.

Thomson Reuters is controlled by the Canadian family Thomson and has a market value of over $28 billion, according to the New York Stock Exchange.

The deal represented one of the largest buyouts in Blackstone's history, proving the strong interest the asset class has in data companies. Blackstone is one of the largest private-equity firms in the world with $387 billion of assets under management.

"Data distribution and ### invalid font number 2
analytics### invalid font number 1
 is a very fast-growing space," Martin Brand, a senior managing director at Blackstone, who worked on the Thomson Reuters deal, said in an interview to The Wall Street Journal this month.

Other recent deals in the sector include Hong-Kong based Citic Capital Partners' acquisition of Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC's Global Markets Intelligence Division in February. Citic joined with Chinese news and data provider Caixin Global to do the deal and committed to pay $180.5 million for the division, which generated £1.9 million for the financial year ending in September 2017.

The Euromoney carve-out is based in Hong Kong and provides industry, economic and corporate intelligence on emerging markets. Citic said it plans to expand the business in China, Private Equity News reported.

Economics of Data

Firms are taking a closer look at b-to-b companies that provide intelligence and data because of strong global demand for selective and analytical data. The world-wide data and business ### invalid font number 2
analytics### invalid font number 1
 market is predicted to hit over $210 billion in revenue in 2020, of which $70 billion will be spent on reporting, analysis and data warehouse tools, according to a 2017 report by U.S. advisory firm International Data Corporation. IDC expects the banking sector to spend more than all other industries on data.

As demand for business information rises, so do prices. B-to-b data and information companies can also create scale by disseminating information across multiple platforms, said Eric Lawson-Smith, a partner at Arma Partners, M&A advisory firm focused on communications, media and technology deals.

"The concept behind data is: produce it once and sell it many times," he said.

Alongside offering strong growth margins, data and intelligence companies are easy to sell and easy to buy, because banks have appetite to back leverage buyouts involving those companies, said Mr. Lawson-Smith.

From a banker's point of view, it is very easy to predict the company's performance, Mr. Lawson-Smith added. This is because a typical subscription for data services is prepaid on an annual base.

For instance, in the deal to acquire a 55% stake in Thomson Reuters' financial and risk unit, the consortium led by Blackstone will raise debt, which covers a vast majority of the $17 billion the buyers committed to pay, the Journal reported.

Thomson Reuters' news service will be split from its financial and risk business following the deal. The Thomson Reuters' financial and risk solutions spinout recently backed by Blackstone has signed a 30-year contract to use the news services, in exchange for at least $325 million a year, the Journal reported.

Arma has said that private-equity firms have been able to net multiples in the midteens from selling b-to-b information and financial data companies over the past five years.

Strong Returns

Good growth margins and easy financing means it could be the right time to sell. A string of private-equity firms have netted strong returns by exiting or selling parts of information service businesses to fellow firms or trade buyers seeking to increase their data portfolio.

"There are really exciting exit opportunities because there is a lot of interest from trade buyers," said Nathaniel Cooper, executive director media and technology at advisory firm DC Partners.

For example, last year Sweden-based private-equity firm EQT sold data provider Bureau Van Dijk to Moody's Corp. for ¬ billion, nearly twice the amount it paid to buy the company in July 2014, Moody's said.

Amsterdam-based Bureau, which was founded in 1991, had four private-equity owners between 2004 and 2017.

EQT bought the company in 2014 from Charterhouse Capital Partners, which had acquired it in 2011 from BC Partners. Bureau's first private-equity owner was Candover Investments, which sold the business to BC for £00 million in 2007.

The company provides information on more than 220 million companies and helps financial institutions, professional services firms and governments with credit analysis, investment research, tax analysis, compliance and due diligence.

In 2016, Bureau had revenue of $281 million and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of $144 million, Moody's said last year announcing the deal.

London-based buyout firm BC Partners bought Mergermarket for £82 million in 2014 when it carved the business out from publisher Pearson PLC and sold a minority stake in the business to Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund GIC last July valuing the company at £ billion. Under the firm's ownership the company has seen its Ebitda double, Private Equity News previously reported.

Mergermarket, which was founded in 2000 and rebranded Acuris after the deal with GIC, provides financial data and analysis. The company employs more than 1,000 staff in 65 locations across the world.

Creating Profit

Given the promising estimations for the sector, private-equity firms are making an effort to tap into media and information businesses.

Blackstone has hired data scientists to help it evaluate how to create profit for its new data business Thomson Reuters' financial and risk unit, the Journal reported.

The companies achieving the highest returns on their initial investment are those that can combine data, intelligence and software that simplifies and selects data, Mr. Lawson-Smith said.

U.S. technology company IBM Corp. estimated in a 2017 report that every day, the world's population creates 2.5 quintillion bytes of data. About two decades ago, the value of b-to-b information companies was measured based on the quantity of data they were able to deliver, but now there is almost too much of it for institutions to use effectively, Mr. Lawson-Smith said.

"I think today in the data market, the most attractive businesses are businesses that can provide not just data but genuine, insightful analyses into that data," he said.

A new startup led by Khan Academy's former chief engineer is betting that ### invalid font number 2
machine-learning### invalid font number 1
 will help speed up research that could slow down aging.

Spring Discovery Inc.'s platform specifically aims to accelerate drug discovery to treat diseases linked to aging. Using multiple sources of raw data from a network of partner labs, Spring applies ### invalid font number 2
machine learning### invalid font number 1
 to quickly analyze and identify promising leads.

"Measuring the progression of aging is different than looking at specific biomarkers of one disease, and ### invalid font number 2
machine learning### invalid font number 1
 can really speed up the time it takes to identify what researchers should be looking for, where to direct their next experiment, and give them the power to translate that research into therapies," said Spring co-founder and Chief Executive Ben Kamens.

The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company is launching with $4.25 million in seed funding from investors including General Catalyst, Y Combinator's Sam Altman and the Longevity Fund.

In recent years, significant advancements in aging research have led to a wave of startups developing therapies targeting biological processes of aging. While the field receives a relatively small amount of national or nonprofit funding compared with something like cancer, venture investors have risen to the occasion. Last year, startups raised a record $567 million in funding, according to PitchBook Data.

Mr. Kamens, who was the lead developer at Khan Academy, got interested in the longevity sector following talks with Color Genomics Inc. co-founder Elad Gil, who has done extensive research on aging and heads Spring's advisory board. Other advisers include top executives at Amgen Inc., Mr. Altman and longevity researchers from Stanford and the University of California, San Francisco.

"With aging, there has been so much good research and the private sector has really picked up in developing companies and funding, but no one has really been taking the computational approach," said Mr. Gil, who serves as chairman of Spring's scientific advisory board.

Spring declined to share specifics on which diseases it will tackle first, or which exact forms of data it would analyze. Mr. Kamens said they would take a pragmatic approach to drug pipelines based on what their partners are working on.

Longevity Fund founder Laura Deming says she hears pitches from dozens of longevity-focused startups each month but was drawn to Spring's computational bioinformatics program.

"I was skeptical at first because there are so many people trying to enter the space, but what has really been missing is a fantastically well-run ### invalid font number 2
machine learning### invalid font number 1
 team," said Ms. Deming. "I think this is the kind of tool companies will fight to use."

China's Authoritarian State Has an Edge in Artificial Intelligence Development; A wealthy repressive state can press ahead with tech innovation unimpeded by privacy concerns### invalid font number 1

China made enormous economic strides in the past quarter-century by manufacturing everything from toys to tires inexpensively and exporting them overseas. To become a truly wealthy nation, it must move beyond its role as a low-cost manufacturer and become an economic innovator itself.

Can a repressive state, led by a central government specializing in five-year plans and surveillance of its own people, make such a leap? The odds against success look steep. Economic history includes few examples of authoritarian states becoming innovative business leaders. But China aims to make that jump "https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-u-s-companies-may-lose-the-ai-race-1516280677"r high-level ### invalid font number 2
machine learning### invalid font number 1
ith an unusual approach that can't be dismissed.

Beijing is bankrolling "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-and-intel-beware-china-is-gunning-for-dominance-in-ai-chips-1515060224", in part, to keep better track of homegrown individuals it considers criminals and dissidents, and to intimidate would-be opponents. That work involves fundamental research in image recognition, data collection and sorting that could have commercial spinoffs in the software used to run complex systems. A city with millions of self-driving cars, for instance, would need data analysis and the ability to recognize, say, that a ball bouncing across the street might be followed by a child chasing it.

"What gives China an edge is there is more of a sense of urgency," says Paul Triolo, a technology research manager at Eurasia Group.

Last summer, China's central government published a comprehensive plan for ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
 development that aims to make the nation "the world's primary AI innovation center" by 2030.

In China such plans aren't simply blueprints, but indications of central government priorities, which work down to localities, state-owned firms and entrepreneurs. So far, local governments, looking to turn themselves into software centers, have pledged about $7 billion in funding for AI development, estimates a congressional panel that focuses on China.

Mix that with genuine enthusiasm for the technology among Chinese scientists and companiesnd "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-searches-for-path-back-to-china-with-artificial-intelligence-lab-1513162471"nd you have a formidable force, say U.S. researchers who have studied China's AI program.

"There's an enthusiasm for AI and culture of dynamism that we don't see as much in the U.S., at least outside of Silicon Valley," says Massachusetts Institute of Technology researcher Erik Brynjolfsson.

Among the most innovativend threateningf the Chinese research involves surveillance. The Wall Street Journal has detailed how Beijing has turned its "https://www.wsj.com/articles/twelve-days-in-xinjiang-how-chinas-surveillance-state-overwhelms-daily-life-1513700355" into a warren of "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-all-seeing-surveillance-state-feared-in-the-west-is-a-reality-in-china-1498493020" to track millions of Uighur minorities. Police there use hand-held devices to search smartphones for encrypted chat apps. A new twist: mobile facial-recognition units "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-police-go-robocop-with-facial-recognition-glasses-1518004353" that police use to search crowds for fugitives, among other uses.

### invalid font number 2
Artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
 works by the collection of vast amounts of data used to "train" computer software to recognize patterns and reach conclusions, precisely the kind of skills needed to track a small number of dissidents among a sea of Chinese faces.

"A repressive state can be an engine of innovation," says Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a tech policy center.

In the past, Chinese efforts to innovate have stumbled over the state's desire to centralize control, denying researchers and companies the freedom to follow their own ideas. China, for instance, has tried to jump-start its semiconductor industry with projects dating as far back as the Cultural Revolution, but still hasn't produced a company that can compete with global leaders like Intel or Samsung. Beijing is trying once again i"https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-next-target-u-s-microchip-hegemony-1501168303", putting together a massive government fund, but the U.S. government so far has blocked China's efforts to acquired advanced Western technology.

AI may be different, say U.S. technology researchers. China's AI effort is being joined by globally competitive internet powerhouses including Tencent Holdings Ltd., which is focused on medical imaging, and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which wants to help create smart cities that use sensors, cameras and computers to manage traffic. So far, the government is following their lead in technology development, AI researchers say, whatever the goals laid out in the government plan.

Chinese researchers may not have political freedom, they say, but they have the economic freedom to chart their own course. And the Chinese government doesn't throw up roadblocks to the technology on the grounds of privacy, as occurs in the West.

"Freedom is very important," says Mr. Brynjolfsson. "But there is more freedom in China to do startups than most people realize."

Becoming an innovator in high technology and making a business success of those innovations in international markets is something that only a few countries have done, says Loren Graham, an emeritus MIT science historian.

"All of themo farre open, democratic societies in which government companies do not dominate," he said.

He says China's push in AI represents a great economic experiment.

"Can a country like China with lots of money combine repression, creativity and economic success based on that creativity? If the answer is yes, then we will have to rethink everything."

Low volatility funds fail to protect investors### invalid font number 1

INVESTING Specialist ETFs lose out during recent market correction

A number of exchange traded funds (ETFs) designed to protect investors from sharp stock market gyrations lost more money than mainstream US stocks during this month's selloff, underperforming in precisely the conditions in which they were meant to thrive.

Low volatility ETFs, launched by asset managers including BlackRock and State Street, were billed as a way of buying the least volatile parts of a market or index such as the S&P 500. They mimic the return of a main index but are weighted towards low volatility stocks and are designed to lose less in the event of a correction.

Yet, instead of protecting UK investors against the sharp sell-off in US stocks this month, the three ETFs tracking low volatility versions of the S&P 500 lost more than the mainstream index over some of the most volatile days.

The US stock market slide began on February 2, following the publication of positive US jobs data. Over the next seven days, the S&P 500 index fell 2.9 per cent, while investors in Blackrock's $1.4bn iShares Edge S&P 500 Minimum Volatility Ucits ETF lost 4.1 per cent over the period and State Street's SPDR S&P 500 was down 4.4 per cent in total return terms.

Another fund designed to give a higher yield than mainstream stocks is the Power-Shares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Ucits ETF. It lost less over the week, at just under 2 per cent. But over the month to February 15 it had also lost more than the index.

Investors in SPDR S&P 500 Ucits ETF have also experienced a more turbulent ride than the broader index over six months, according to risk data from FE ### invalid font number 2
Analytics### invalid font number 1
, with the share price fluctuating more dramatically than the mainstream benchmark.

Critics say US low volatility strategies are vulnerable to interest rate rises because they are more heavily weighted towards sectors such as utilities, which are vulnerable when rates and bond yields rise, and were punished in the recent correction.

"People walk into low volatility ETFs thinking they will deliver the same performance as the widermarket with lower volatility. But that is not the case," said Shaun Port, chief investment officer at Nutmeg, an online investment platform. "Minimum volatility ETFs are also a bet on bond yields and you have to be cautious about usingthem." Analysts said former low volatility stocks could become Higherrisk as the economic climateshifted.

"Among the potential pitfalls to low volatility INVESTING is the reliance on past risk data," said Hortense Bioy, director of passive fund research at Morningstar. "There isnoguarantee that the least volatile stocks historically will remain so going forward. In fact, these stocksmay become more volatile as more money flows into them and their valuations increase, as has been witnessed in recent years."

Low volatility ETFstend to favour bond-like stocks that have offered steady dividends in aperiod of ultra-low interest rates. However, they have become increasingly popular and expensive as money has flowed into asset managers' lowvolatility products.

Higher interest rates benefit financial stocks and other sectors that have traditionally been seen as Higherrisk; these are also the sectors to which low volatility ETFs are less exposed.

BlackRock limits the extent to which its iShares S&P 500 Minimum Volatility ETF can diverge from the S&P 500 to manage its stock and sector risk. But the ETF still looks very different from a mainstream US fund, with far less exposure to tech giants such as Amazon and Apple and greater exposure to utilities andconsumerstaples stocks.

BlackRock and State Streetinsisted their Low volatility funds fulfil their function over the long term. State Street added that low volatility ETFs perform best in periods of extended downturn but cannot be expected to work in all conditions or in short periods ofvolatility .

iShares Said thatonthe basis of a net asset value return, based on the change in the value of the fund's assets rather than share price, its low volatility ETF had outperformed the S&P 500 index during the period ofvolatility .

Anthony Kruger of iShares European specialist sales team said: "The iShares S&PMinVol ETF has performed as it was designed to during the recent market sell-offandhas outperformed the parent benchmark ona relative basis."

Beijing Tightens Reins on Business### invalid font number 1

SHANGHAI -- When Anbang Insurance Group Co. paid about $2 billion to buy New York City's Waldorf Astoria Hotel three years ago, the deal seemed to define an era for China Inc. President Xi Jinping shortly afterward dropped in to stay at the Park Avenue landmark.

China's business priorities have since changed, turning real-estate trophies into symbols of risk. Regulators in Beijing on Friday said they seized control of Anbang to keep the closely held insurer from collapsing, while prosecutors in Shanghai said they indicted Wu Xiaohui, Anbang's swashbuckling ex-chairman, for alleged fraudulent fundraising and abuse of power.

China's government makes no secret of its penchant to guide commerce, even with private companies, but the boardroom takeover still rattled analysts used to Beijing's applying its influence more quietly. "This is an unprecedented step, putting into receivership a Chinese company in such a public direct way," said Scott Kennedy at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies. "They are so worried about risks that they will stop at nothing to avoid them."

The move, which some view as a quasi-nationalization of Anbang, sheds light on how far these companies have fallen out of favor with President Xi's government. Other high-profile private businesses were already signaling strategy shifts by selling assets and restructuring debt. They included real estate developer-turned-Hollywood producer Dalian Wanda Group; HNA Group Co., a conglomerate founded from an airline; and Tomorrow Group, a warehouse of financial businesses that has donated millions of dollars to institutions such as Harvard University.

Anbang declined to comment on the latest government statements, but in recent months it has said its business remained solid. Mr. Wu was first detained last June and hasn't made any comment. It isn't known if he has a lawyer.

Authorities began leaning on companies such as Anbang, Wanda and HNA -- dubbed "gray rhinos," or obvious-but-ignored risks -- in late 2016, after the central bank spent some $1 trillion in about 18 months to offset the effects of capital flight.

Insurers, some of which had turned to selling investment deals rather than traditional insurance, faced special scrutiny. One company's chairman was banned from the industry for a decade. Anbang, which will now be run by a working group led by a China Insurance Regulatory Commission official, has been guided by regulators since Mr. Wu's departure last June.

Even before regulators swooped down on Mr. Wu, Anbang was adjusting its sales practices and reporting good results. Regulatory filings also show that beginning last year it had pared its shareholdings in major Chinese banks, though according to the latest filings, it indirectly still held more than 15% in China Minsheng Bank in September and nearly 11% of China Merchants Bank Co.

Anbang now faces prospects of unwinding international holdings -- possibly the Waldorf in a sort of echo of a Tokyo developer's exit from New York's Rockefeller Center within seven years of its 1989 investment.

Chinese authorities allege companies such as Anbang got big through "regulatory arbitrage" -- taking advantage of incomplete financial oversight to raise money in gray markets -- and that a heavy hand is needed now to eliminate big threats to the broader financial system.

Pressure has been mounting for years on corporate China to manage debt, which International Monetary Fund analysts recently pegged at 135% of the underlying economy.

The new plan for Anbang aims to keep it from collapsing, according to the insurance regulator. But few analysts said they believe its potential demise would threaten China's financial system, the way regulators in the U.S. feared American International Group Inc. was "too big to fail" before rallying an $85 billion bailout in 2008. A report last August from UBS pegged the Chinese insurer's assets at 2.5 trillion yuan ($393.8 billion) at the end of 2016, or 3.4% of gross domestic product, but played down its potential systemic risks since all but 11% of that was in liquid investments such as stocks.

Beijing is allowing some debt fallout elsewhere in the economy, such as by permitting an increasing number of corporate-bond defaults and even publicly admonishing provincial governments for doctoring economic growth statistics.

"The case could be a signal for other investors that regulators are tightening," says Tiecheng Yang, a financial regulatory lawyer at Han Kun Law Offices in Beijing. Next, Mr. Yang says, authorities could restrict deal making between bank, securities and insurance firms that share an owner. Last month, China's banking regulator outlined new shareholder limits, including requiring permission for purchases of 5% or more in a commercial bank.

At its peak, Wanda, controlled by billionaire Wang Jianlin, had more than a half-dozen real-estate projects in development across the globe. Its overseas portfolio included the AMC movie-theater chain, Hollywood producer Legendary Entertainment, British yacht maker Sunseeker and the Ironman Triathlon.

But since mid-2017, Wanda has been in retreat, selling property projects in the U.K. and Australia, plus its Chinese theme parks, movie theaters and film sound stages.

Not long ago, Anbang's hotel purchases, Wanda's forays into Hollywood and HNA's logistics bids around the world appeared to fit Beijing's desire to own brands. Now, China's political priorities have shifted toward technology such as ### invalid font number 2

 and electric vehicles.

Hedge fund manager Man Group was under pressure after analysts cut estimates to reflect a tough February for its trend-chasing AHL funds, which will reduce performance fees. Merrill Lynch lowered its 2018 earnings forecast by 21 per cent.

BT Group jumped after regulator Ofcom watered down broadband price regulations, with BT Openreach wholesale division allowed to charge operators such as TalkTalk higher prices than under a consultation in September 2017.

Separately, Berenberg upgraded BT to uyrom oldith a 310p target.

Phoenix was in demand after announcing the £.9bn acquisition of Standard Life Aberdeen insurance business, part funded by £50m rights issue and £bn of vendor finance from Standard Life. The deal will triple Phoenix assets under administration.

Analysts at Barclays said Phoenix had cquired a material book of business on attractive terms that supports the current attractive dividend yield of 6.5 per cent. The question will be whether the deal will allow the stock to be re-rated, with the yield moving closer to its UK life peers yields of Legal and General and Aviva

British Airways owner IAG was the FTSE 100 sharpest faller after its full-year earnings came in slightly below consensus expectations.

Sky crept higher after Elliot Advisors, the activist hedge fund, put further pressure on 21st Century Fox by lifting its stake to 2.49 per cent with the purchase of a further 2.7m shares. A closing price of £1.05 compared with Fox £0.75 buyout offer, with Sky shareholders also due a 13p dividend.

Chip materials maker IQE rallied after Citi released an in-depth analysis of its UK and Singapore joint ventures, which have been the subject of criticism by short sellers in recent weeks.

hile joint venture accounting is complex and we see some scope for improved disclosure, our analysis so far does not identify particularly worrisome accounting practices,iti said.

In Europe, Zara owner Inditex dived on a raft of forecast downgrades ahead of the retailer full-year results due on March 14. JPMorgan, which cut its estimates for Inditex by about 5 per cent to reflect euro strength, said investors should expect gross margins to be under ignificant pressures Zara cleared stock in January to make a quick transition to Spring/Summer ranges.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise led US markets higher after its first-quarter results beat forecasts and nudged full-year guidance higher, thanks in part to tax cuts. The computer maker also set out a $7bn cash return to shareholders via buybacks and lifted its dividend by 50 per cent.

espite the solid first quarter, organic top-line growth, expectations remain muted while operating leverage seems largely driven by restructuring,oted analysts at Berenberg, which repeated a oldating.

e see increasing operational risk from both the latest restructuring and the management transition and so believe it is too early to be more constructive.

Blue Buffalo Pet Products climbed after General Mills agreed to buy the upscale pet-food maker at an enterprise valuation of $8bn. The price tag is equivalent to 25 times Blue Buffalo 2017 ebitda and more than six times sales.

Oppenheimer called the premium paid by General Mills air adding: lthough we see strategic rationale for other players such as Colgate-Palmolive, we do not see another bid emerging.

 Morgan Stanley downgrades Petrofac to nderweights part of a review of engineering companies exposed to the Middle East gas market. It cited International Energy Agency forecasts for Middle East gas demand to grow 38 per cent to 2030, making the region the second-largest growth area globally for gas behind China.

With about $100bn of outstanding Middle East tenders to be awarded and a further $358bn of planned projects, 2018 should be a record year for the industry, Morgan Stanley said. It named Saipem and Hyundai Engineering among the likely beneficiaries but argued that Petrofac was likely to underperform the sector given the overhangs of a Serious Fraud Office investigation and refinancing worries.

Contingency plans

Prolonged uncertainty over the UK's post-Brexit policies on immigration and passporting rights has pushed many technology entrepreneurs and start-ups to strengthen their businesses in mainland Europe.

Currencycloud, the payments company backed by Google Ventures, is one of a number of tech companies to have begun implementing Brexit contingency plans, establishing offices or applying for regulatory licences outside the UK because of concerns about hiring staff and accessing clients after Brexit.

"While we'd love for the UK to have a soft Brexit, you can't guarantee that," said Todd Latham, chief marketing officer and head of product at Currencycloud, which has applied for a regulatory licence in the Netherlands. "Our concern is about how we service customers and ensure that we're bringing the best talent to the organisation." Start-ups are seen as a crucial part of the tech "ecosystem" because of their role in encouraging innovation. The government has attempted to reassure the £70bn tech industry that Brexit will not affect its ability to hire highly skilled coders or do business in the EU.

Over the past year, Theresa May, prime minister, and Philip Hammond, chancellor, have unveiled initiatives, including plans to double the number of Tier 1 visas for "exceptional talent" and set up an office to promote start-ups in ### invalid font number 2

 research.

However, smaller start-ups without resources to support visa applications complain they will face a severe shortage if they cannot rely on hiring developers from the EU. A fifth of tech jobs in London are filled by workers from the bloc, said the Recruitment & Employment Confederation. Across the UK, they hold 7 per cent of all tech roles, the Department for Exiting the EU said.

Company founders claim hundreds of developers have rejected jobs in the UK since the referendum due to uncertainty over future status. "The number of candidates we've had applying from Spain or France has completely dropped off," said Aneesh Varma, founder of a start-up, Aire, that creates credit scores.

The UK has historically served as Europe's main start-up hub because of London's popularity as a base for venture capital investors. But since the EU vote, countries such as France, the Netherlands, Germany and Spain have begun to encroach on it, announcing more fast-track visas and holding events to lure high-profile investors.

A quarter of UK start-up founders surveyed by Silicon Valley Bank this year said they would open a European outpost because of Brexit. The founders and chiefs of a number of other startups ncluding Ensygnia, Inploi, Cablato, Kantox, Ecoisme, Avespa, ETFmatic and Aire lso confirmed they were strengthening non-UK operations.

"The market in the UK feels quite sour and it's going to have an impact on our ability to hire," said Matthew de la Hey, co-founder of Inploi, a platform for connecting employers with hospitality workers, which is raising capital for an office in the EU this year.

"We have found it more difficult to do business in the UK [since the vote]." Markets page 25

It been just over a decade since the Great Recession officially began. Apparently that long enough for people who should know better to pretend nothing ever happened.

Todd Zywicki, a law professor at George Mason University, says financial products aimed at American consumers should be regulated to prevent nfair and deceptive actions His suggested reforms of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, however, do not appear to be informed by the experience of the past 15 years.

A quick refresher:

Most people can buy housing without borrowing large sums. This means small changes in credit supply inimum down payment requirements, maximum debt-to-income ratios, minimum credit scores, etc an have large effects on how much money can be spent on housing. Looser credit boosts the share of people who own rather than rent, but the bigger impact is on house prices, construction activity, and total indebtedness.

For a variety of reasons, underwriting standards collapsed in the mid-2000s. There are many ways to demonstrate this, but perhaps the most obvious is the changing way additional mortgage debt was funded. From the early 1990s through the early 2000s, the share of net new mortgage debt funded by the so-called rivate-labelond market hovered around 10 per cent. In the mid-2000s this share ballooned to more than half:

This market then disappeared after a wave of defaults. Essentially all of the net decline in mortgage debt since the peak in 2009 can be explained by the collapse of these products. More traditional forms of mortgage debt held up relatively well.

The resulting credit boom and bust was a disaster for everyone. The borrowers who temporarily enefitedrom this were disproportionately poorer and less-educated. They often found themselves burdened with products that gave them ccesso credit at the cost of usurious fees. When the cycle turned they lost everything and generally ended up worse than they were before.

(Even if these borrowers hadn ended up worse than before the bubble, psychologists have found that temporary gains followed by large losses are more painful than a steady state.)

Given all this, it not surprising that legislators decided to create a new regulatory agency meant to protect borrowers and savers from certain products. If there is a case for regulating medicines, food, and motor vehicles, it makes sense to also regulate financial products that can have enormous consequences for our net worth, income security, and overall well-being.

Yet here is Zywicki first priority:

Regulations that eliminate credit options for those who already have few of them will not make their lives better. Working with the private sector and Congress to reverse this growing exclusion of Americans from the financial sector is a moral imperative.

This is code for loosening up on payday lenders and others who prey on the well-known inability of many people to understand the implications of compound interest.

Zywicki also wants to return to the bad old days of ontraditional credit scoringhich he thinks could be made to work with ### invalid font number 2
Big Data### invalid font number 1
 His professed goal is to ffer hope for those who don have access to mainstream banking.here are often good reasons why standards exist the way they are. The last time lenders experimented with ontraditionaleasures to increase ccesshey encouraged widespread fraud and excess credit growth that was bad for everyone.

Zywicki also cares about hoicend espect claiming that merican families know better than bureaucrats what financial products best meet their needs The most pernicious of the pre-crisis financial products were notoriously difficult to understand. This was by design eople won mind being ripped off if they can see it happening.

Choice is valuable, but only if paired with transparency and clear punishments for fraud. Unfortunately, neither of those seem to be among Zywicki priorities. Similarly, Zwyicki does not seem to appreciate the difference between isrespectnd worrying about how opacity affects the functioning of a market for complex services.

Intriguingly, Zywicki concludes his column by claiming that financial institutions need more regulatory protection from borrowers:

Protecting consumers from unfair and deceptive actions by financial institutions is the CFPB core mission. But not every consumer who fails to pay his bills is a hapless victim. Smarter regulation would recognize this. During the financial crisis, for example, millions of borrowers walked away from mortgages they could afford to pay simply because they were underwater. But the CFPB mortgage rules are designed only to ensure that borrowers have the ability to pay; they do not consider precautions such as requiring larger down payments that would address the incentive to default strategically when housing prices fall.

It unclear from the column why sophisticated profit-seeking lenders should need government bureaucrats to tell them the optimal level of down payments. Nonspecialists struggling to make ends meet are supposed to be left to their own meagre devices under the principles of hoicend espect Why should the banks be any different?

Many tech companies are shelving plans to hire staff in London, are opening offices in other European countries and applying to EU regulators for the right to sell financial services in the bloc in case the UK does not secure passporting rights, which enable fintech and other companies to offer financial services across the EU.

In a sign of the pace of change, Germany now has 3 per cent more skilled computer developers than the UK; last year it had 5 per cent fewer, according to data from Atomico, the venture capital group. French start-ups meanwhile agreed more funding deals than the UK for the first time in five years last year.

Home Sales Post Their Sharpest Drop in Three Years; Economists had expected sales to improve modestly last month after sales also declined in December### invalid font number 1

WASHINGTONales of previously owned U.S. homes in January experienced their sharpest annual drop in more than three years as low inventories and rising prices and interest rates took a toll.

"https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/existing-home-sales-slip-32-percent-in-january" 3.2% in January from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.38 million, the National Association of Realtors said Wednesday. Economists had expected sales to improve modestly last month after sales also declined in December.

Compared with a year earlier, sales in January were down 4.8%, the steepest annual decline since August 2014.

"Folks are looking at these ... hot markets. Prices are going up, there are fierce battles and all these homes are going for more than the asking price," said Alex Villacorta, executive vice president of HouseCanary, a housing data and ### invalid font number 2
analytics### invalid font number 1
 startup. "If you have a home at a really good mortgage rate, you're less inclined to give that up to get into a market that feels like 2004."

The drop was surprising given that pending home sales increased slightly over the past two months, which typically predicts an uptick in existing home sales. David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance, said this might partly reflect buyers who experienced "rate shock" when mortgage rates rose and they were unable to close.

The average rate nationwide for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage climbed roughly a quarter of a percentage point to 4.22% by the beginning of February from 3.95% at the beginning of January, according to mortgage-finance giant Freddie Mac. Rates on Thursday stood at 4.38%, according to Freddie Mac. Borrowing costs still remain low by historical standards.

"I still think we will see the job market and demographics overcome the rise in mortgage rates and give some upward movement in home sales, but much less than in the past because the number of homes for sale is so small," Mr. Berson said.

The tax-code overhaul passed in December limited deductibility of very large mortgages as well as state and local taxes, including property-tax bills. Mr. Yun said tax reform doesn't appear to be denting home sales yet, as buying activity remains strong in expensive regions and prospective buyers expressed limited concern to their Realtors, according to NAR.

A shortage of available houses on the market has driven up prices in many regions. There was a 3.4 month-supply of homes on the market at the end of January, based on the current sales pace. Total housing inventory declined in January from a year earlier to 1.52 million existing homes for sale, the lowest January count since 1999 when the agency began tracking the data.

Earlier in the year, strong home sales seemed to be "defying gravity" given low levels of inventory. "That's clearly been exhausted now," said Aaron Terrazas, senior economist at home-listings website Zillow. News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, also operates Realtor.com under license from the National Association of Realtors.

Several factors are converging to buttress demand. The national unemployment rate in January was 4.1%, holding at a 17-year low. Gauges of household confidence remain elevated.

But limited inventory on the market is driving up home prices at a rapid pace, potentially blocking some would-be buyers. The median sale price for an existing home in January was $240,500, up 5.8% from a year earlier.

In several of the largest metropolitan areas, a household making a typical salary would have to spend more than 30% of their income level that economists consider financially sustainableo afford the median home payment, according to HouseCanary.

In some of the fastest-growing and priciest metropolitan areas, affordability barriers are much steeper. A typical buyer in San Francisco, for example, would need to spend 75% of household income to afford a home.

Low volatility funds fail to protect investors### invalid font number 1

A number of exchange traded funds (ETFs) designed to protect investors from sharp stock market gyrations lost more money than mainstream US stocks during a sell-off this month, underperforming in precisely the conditions in which they were meant to thrive.

Low volatility ETFs, launched by asset managers including BlackRock and State Street, were billed as a way of buying the least volatile parts of a market or index such as the S&P 500 index. They mimic the return of a big index but are weighted towards low volatility stocks and are designed to lose less in the event of a correction.

Yet, instead of protecting UK investors against the sharp sell-off in US stocks this month, the three ETFs tracking low volatility versions of the S&P 500 index lost more than the mainstream index over some of the most volatile days.

The US stock market slide began on February 2, following the publication of positive US jobs data. Over the next seven days, the S&P 500 index fell 2.9 per cent, while investors in Blackrock $1.4bn iShares Edge S&P 500 Minimum Volatility Ucits ETF lost 4.1 per cent over the period and State Street SPDR S&P 500 was down 4.4 per cent in total return terms.

Another fund designed to give a higher yield than mainstream stocks was PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Ucits ETF. It lost less over the week, at just under 2 per cent. But over the month to February 15 it had also lost more than the index.

Investors in SPDR S&P 500 Ucits ETF have also experienced a more turbulent ride than the broader index over six months, according to risk data from FE ### invalid font number 2
Analytics### invalid font number 1
, with the share price fluctuating more dramatically than the mainstream benchmark.

Critics say US low volatility strategies are vulnerable to interest rate rises because they are more heavily weighted towards sectors such as utilities, which are vulnerable when rates and bond yields rise, and were punished in the recent correction.

eople walk into low volatility ETFs thinking they will deliver the same performance as the wider market with lower volatility. But that is not the case,aid Shaun Port, chief investment officer at Nutmeg, an online investment platform. inimum volatility ETFs are also a bet on bond yields and you have to be cautious about using them.

Analysts said former low volatility stocks could become higher-risk as the economic climate shifted.

mong the potential pitfalls to low volatility investing is the reliance on past risk data,aid Hortense Bioy, director of passive fund research at Morningstar. here is no guarantee that the least volatile stocks historically will remain so going forward. In fact, these stocks may become more volatile as more money flows into them and their valuations increase, as has been witnessed in recent years.

Low volatility ETFs tend to favour bond-like stocks which have offered steady dividends in a period of ultra-low interest rates. However, they have become increasingly popular and expensive as money has flowed into asset managersow volatility products.

Higher interest rates benefit financial stocks and other sectors that have traditionally been seen as higher risk; these are also the sectors to which low volatility ETFs are less exposed.

BlackRock limits the extent to which its iShares S&P 500 Minimum Volatility ETF can diverge from the S&P 500 index to manage its stock and sector risk. But the ETF still looks very different from a mainstream US fund, with far less exposure to tech giants such as Amazon and Apple and greater exposure to utilities and consumer staples stocks.

BlackRock and State Street insisted their low volatility funds fulfil their function over the long term. State Street added that low volatility ETFs perform best in periods of extended downturn but cannot be expected to work in all conditions or in short periods of volatility.

iShares said that on the basis of a net asset value return, based on the change in the value of the fund assets rather than share price, its low volatility ETF had outperformed the S&P 500 index during the period of volatility.

Anthony Kruger of iShares European specialist sales team said: he iShares S&P Min Vol ETF has performed as it was designed to during the recent market sell-off and has outperformed the parent benchmark on a relative basis.

Oliver Smith, portfolio manager at IG, said: mid the recent sell-off, US low volatility ETFs have all performed in lock step and performed worse than the mainstream index.

BlackRock is setting up a centre dedicated to research in ### invalid font number 2

, underscoring the heightened interest among asset managers in how ### invalid font number 2

 can revolutionise many facets of the investment industry.

The world's biggest investment group, with $6.3tn of assets under management, is establishing a "BlackRock Lab for ### invalid font number 2
Artificial Intelligence### invalid font number 1
" in Palo Alto, California, according to an internal memo seen by the Financial Times.

The memo, sent by Rob Goldstein lackRock's chief operating officer who is in charge of the company's technology group aid that the lab will "augment our current teams and accelerate our efforts to bring the benefits of these technologies to the entirety of the firm and to our clients".

AI has emerged as a hot topic across the corporate world as the swelling power of modern computers and expanding reams of digital data have unlocked fields such as ### invalid font number 2
machine learning### invalid font number 1
 and ### invalid font number 2
natural language processing### invalid font number 1
. The asset management industry is particularly interested in the area, as it tries to improve the performance of its fund managers, automate back-office functions to cut costs and enhance client outreach by analysing vast amounts of internal and external data.

Japan's Government Pension Investment Fund, the world's biggest manager of retirement savings, recently said AI could ultimately even replace human fund managers.

"AI may be in a big hype cycle but there's no doubt the technology is real and changing the world already," Mr Goldstein said in an interview with the FT. "We clearly live in a world with more computing power, more data and new methods to take advantage of."

BlackRock has long sought to be on the cutting edge of technology in the investment world and the setting up of the AI lab nd an internal "Data Science Core" unit announced in the same memo s part of the company's "Tech 2020" plan.

David Wright, head of product strategy in Europe for BlackRock's $109bn scientific active equity division, said quantitative managers are "engaged in an arms race" as data analysis techniques that work today will not necessarily be relevant in five years. "### invalid font number 2
Big data### invalid font number 1
 offers a world of possibilities for generating alpha [market beating returns] but traditional techniques are not good enough to analyse the huge volumes of information involved," added Mr Wright.

The lab represents a deepening of those efforts. It will be led by Stephen Boyd, a Stanford professor who has consulted for BlackRock since 2013, while the data science centre will be led by Sherry Marcus, previously chief data ### invalid font number 2

 officer at hedge fund Millennium Management, and Rachel Schutt, News Corp's former chief data scientist.

"When people hear the term AI, they often think about a robot taking over the world," Mr Goldstein said. "But this is about increasing the efficiency of what we do across the board. Every part of our business is already being augmented by these new capabilities."

The data centre is looking for another dozen or so hires for its launch, underlining the ravenous appetite among asset managers to snap up more quantitative analysts adept at trawling through data sets such as credit card purchases, satellite imagery and social media for investment signals.

Even SoHo Can't Escape the Retail Property Storm; Retail slump that has been battering shopping malls across middle America starting to show up in some of New York City's retail neighborhoods### invalid font number 1

The retail slump that has been battering shopping malls across middle America is starting to show up in some of New York City's choicest retail neighborhoods.

The ground floor retail space at 93 Mercer St. in Manhattan's SoHo neighborhood was in contract in August 2015 to sell for $35 million. But the sale ran into problems and in January 2017 the seller put the property back on the market. In November, it went into contract with a different buyer, this time for just $18.25 million.

The upshot: the value of at least one prime retail real-estate property in SoHo is on its way to being cut nearly in half in two years' time.

"The steady drumbeat of negative retail news is affecting even healthy assets in markets with great sales," said Jim Costello, senior vice president at Real Capital ### invalid font number 2
Analytics### invalid font number 1
.

For the past 18 months, the retail real-estate industry has been slammed by retailer bankruptcies and store closures. Malls anchored by department stores in particular have been most vulnerable to vacancies and declining rents and operating income, and some have lost 80% or more of their value.

Vista Ridge Mall in Lewisville, Texas, for instance, sold for $18.1 million last year after its value slipped from $46.1 million a year earlier.

Manhattan, a retail juggernaut, hasn't escaped the market headwinds. After reaching a record in 2014, retail rents in Manhattan started sliding and then plunged 18% in 2017, according to data from real-estate consulting firm CBRE Group Inc.

Even in the trendiest neighborhoods, swaths of vacant space have cropped up as tenants balk at high rents and decline to renew leases. Near the Mercer Street unit, rents along Spring Street and Broadway to West Broadway fell 19% to $828 a square foot in the fourth quarter of 2017 from the same period a year earlier, according to CBRE.

A low volume of retail real-estate transactions, especially among higher-quality properties, is making it difficult to arrive at accurate valuations, analysts said. While "grade A" assets will likely continue to survive and thrive, growth in their profit margins is slowing.

Retail real-estate values in other major cities are still holding firm in many cases, but pockets of weakness are emerging. Values of strip-center assets in Boston and Washington, D.C., for example, inched lower in 2017, according to Green Street Advisors.

In Washington, shopping mall Mazza Gallerie was sold to Ashkenazy Acquisition for $75.2 million, or $256 a square foot in 2017. The seller, TIAA, had initially acquired the mall in 2004 for $77.7 million, or $264 a square foot.

Leases at the mall were intentionally not renewed over the years as there were plans to redevelop it, but the fund that owned the property changed its strategy and decided to sell the asset, so the lower occupancy rate affected the eventual sales price, said TH Real Estate, an affiliate of the investment management arm of TIAA.

"We remain strong believers in the sectorhen assets are chosen selectively. We are taking a somewhat contrarian view to pervasive narratives about the retail sector and pursuing the buying opportunities this market disruption can create," said Todd Rollins, Senior Director of retail portfolio management at TH Real Estate.

There are still plenty of areas of strength in the investment market.

Grocery-anchored shopping centers posted strong transaction volume growth as well as a 5% year-over-year increase in prices last year, according to data from Real Capital ### invalid font number 2
Analytics### invalid font number 1
.

In December, Paris-based real-estate investment trust Unibail-Rodamco offered $15.7 billion for Westfield Corp., which owns tony malls in Manhattan and Los Angeles. This translates to a 4% to a healthy 5% capitalization rate measure of annual income from a property compared with its original costor Westfield's malls, analysts said. But the environment remains risky, analysts said, especially in Manhattan, where prices ran up sharply after the last recession.

"The investment value of Manhattan retail space is unusually volatile and uncertain today, given present market conditions," said Joshua Stein, a New York commercial real-estate lawyer, in an affidavit on behalf of Workspace Inc., the seller of 93 Mercer St., which is in litigation over the property. Workspace didn't respond to requests for comment.

"The history of Workspace's efforts to sell the Mercer Street unit amply demonstrates just how much commercial real-estate markets can change, and how quickly," said Mr. Stein.

Startups Are Investing in Homes --- Buyers get help from a crop of Silicon Valley upstarts that partner on purchases### invalid font number 1

Some well-funded startups have an unusual pitch for homeowners strapped for cash: Let's own this house together.

A handful of companies, including those backed by marquee Silicon Valley names such as Andreessen Horowitz and Mark Zuckerberg's philanthropic organization, are experimenting with a product that essentially lets them take an ownership position in a house along with the homeowner. The agreements, called "shared-equity" contracts, provide a new way for investors to get exposure to rising home prices across the U.S.

Shared-equity products are aimed at new buyers who need help with a down payment, or current homeowners looking for an alternative to a cash-out mortgage refinancing or a home-equity loan. The first use has caught the attention of mortgage-finance giant Freddie Mac, which recently agreed to buy loans on properties where one firm, Unison Agreement Corp., contributes to the down payment.

In those cases, home buyers get money for part of their down payment in exchange for pledging some of the home's future price appreciation. The firms market them as a better alternative to low-down-payment loans, since they can give consumers more buying power without requiring them to take out pricey mortgage insurance.

Landed Inc. offers these down-payment contracts to teachers and other educators. Last year, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a philanthropy co-founded by Facebook Inc.'s chief executive, gave Landed $5 million to start a new fund.

Michael Nizhnikov found out about Unison's shared-equity product from his mortgage lender, Guaranteed Rate Inc. He used it for half of the 20% down payment on a home when he moved to accept a position in the psychology department at Southern Connecticut State University.

Dr. Nizhnikov, 46 years old, said the idea of sharing ownership of his home at first was a bit disconcerting. One thing that won him over: If his home's value falls, Unison shares in the loss. "We get to feel comfortable, just in case something crazy happens," Dr. Nizhnikov said.

The length of the contracts can vary from a few years to 30. Homeowners can repay early, including if they sell their house before the term ends. How much they end up owing depends on how the value of their home changes. Because the funds are equity, not a borrowing, they don't require monthly payments.

For example, a Unison customer could receive $50,000 toward a $100,000 down payment on a $500,000 house. If the home later sells for $600,000, the customer gets back the $50,000 he or she initially put down plus 65% of the $100,000 appreciation. Unison gets back its $50,000 plus the other $35,000 of appreciated value. (That is keeping the mortgage constant at $400,000 for illustrative purposes.)

And if the home goes down in value? Unison shares in the loss. Say the home sells for $400,000. After paying back the $400,000 mortgage, the homeowner's $50,000 in equity is wiped out. Unison only shares in 35% of the loss. That means the homeowner is on the hook for the difference and needs to pay Unison $15,000.

Shared-equity contracts can help home buyers unload some risk of a decline in property values, but they also can end up being expensive if housing prices rise. "The homeowners who are going to do this are the ones who don't have a lot of choices," said Allan Weiss, who founded a home-price ### invalid font number 2
analytics### invalid font number 1
 firm that bears his name.

Patch Homes Inc., Point Digital Finance Inc. and Unison are among the companies that are marketing these products as an alternative to home-equity loans and cash-out refinancings. Unlike those products, shared-equity contracts don't add to the consumer's outstanding debt and tend to have looser qualification standards.

Raju Mann of Marin County, Calif., took out about $85,000 through a shared-equity contract on her home from Point in 2016. She was encouraged by the startup's shareholders, which include Andreessen Horowitz and former Citigroup Inc. CEO Vikram Pandit.

Ms. Mann, 54, said banks rejected her for loans because her sources of income -- including royalties on the sale of books written by her grandfather, Nobel Prize-winning author Thomas Mann -- were unpredictable.

After getting funds from Point, Ms. Mann used the money to pay off debt. Home prices were rising in her neighborhood, though, and the longer she waited to pay back Point, the more the firm would make. She decided to exit her contract last month, using money she got refinancing her existing mortgage. Ultimately, she wound up paying Point around $120,000. "They made good money with me," Ms. Mann said.

Unison said it has done 600 agreements in the past year; the other firms have done fewer. To the firms, the idea is to give homeowners the same option that companies have in raising funds via both debt and equity. The firms also typically charge fees for arranging the contracts.

For investors, yields can be attractive. Kingsbridge Wealth Management Inc., a Las Vegas-based multifamily office, has placed around $3 million into a fund that Point manages since May 2016, earning an internal rate of return of roughly 16%, said Kingsbridge President David J. Dunn.

But there also is risk that investors' capital will be tied up for years before recognizing any gains.

High-school biology teacher Sara Shayesteh and her husband, Isaac, used an agreement with Landed to cover about half their down payment for their home in San Mateo, Calif.

The Shayestehs have 10 years to repay Landed, but can choose to do so after one year. They said it feels odd to have an investor own part of their house but are grateful for the arrangement. "We're trying to live in a crazy area with a market," said Ms. Shayesteh, 32. "There's no other way we could have purchased a property that would have met our needs."

Backed by Billions, Longevity Startups Getting New Life; Silicon Valley's oft-maligned quest for drugs to stave off aging gains credibilitynd hefty venture capital### invalid font number 1

Silicon Valley's oft-mocked quest for drugs to stave off the aging process is making a comeback, only this time investors aren't laughing.

A new breed of entrepreneurs in the so-called longevity sector today is betting on data-science and drug-discovery advancements that are being taken far more seriously than yesterday's ventures in young-blood infusions, cryogenics and unproven potions aiming to prolong life.

Rather than treating aging as a disease by itself, longevity startups are developing therapeutics that target specific conditions tied to aging such as inflammatory joint diseases, vision loss, and neurodegenerative diseases. Entrepreneurs from Unity Biotechnology Inc. to Human Longevity Inc. to BioAge Labs Inc. hope that drugs treating these problems may also have life-extending powers.

"Aging has the biggest correlation with almost all diseases, even more so than genetics," said Robert Nelsen, whose ARCH Venture Partners has invested billions across the biotech and broader health-care landscape since 1986. "The serious, institutional biotech investors see the science and understand how it could have pretty profound impacts on health and health care."

Clearly this emerging niche of biotech is gaining credibilitynd venture capital. Investment in U.S. longevity companies has surged nearly sevenfold to about $567 million in 2017, up from $82 million in 2012, according to PitchBook Data Inc.

Last year's top funding round was a $200 million deal at Human Longevity, which is developing genomic and cell therapy-based therapeutics to treat a range of age-related diseases. It now commands a valuation of $1.7 billion. Mr. Nelsen's firm led the second-biggest deal of 2017, a $151 million Series B in Unity.

Mr. Nelsen and other investors in longevity are still trying to turn the page on the ridicule surrounding fountain-of-youth schemes of the past. Although tech moguls like Peter Thiel and Larry Ellison have funded research grounded in sound science, controversial ideas like enzyme supplements, stem cell injections and parabiosis have been deemed by critics to be far out of reach.

Parabiosis, or linking circulatory systems of older animals to younger ones, originated in the 19th century but has been revived periodically since then. Alkahest Inc., founded by Stanford neurologist Tony Wyss-Coray in 2014, is studying potential benefits of injecting blood plasma of young people into people with Alzheimer's disease.

"This isn't some B.S. driven by selfish rich people who just want to live longer, but by research that demonstrates the underlying biology that impacts how we age," says Mr. Nelsen, 54 years old. "We've gotten to the point where we can really think about making drugs."

To test their theories behind that kind of drug discovery, aging-related biotech startups today are also turning to far more powerful tools like ### invalid font number 2
machine learning### invalid font number 1
.

"You have data from people to derive the understanding that solves the mouse-human gap," said Vijay Pande, a physicist and structural biologist who is also general partner of Andreessen Horowitz, which raised a $450 million bio-focused fund in December. His firm has invested in BioAge Labs, an early-stage startup that applies ### invalid font number 2
machine learning### invalid font number 1
 to genomics data to measure aging.

As with all high-risk startups, many longevity ventures will fail. ARCH itself lost some $20 million on Elixir Pharmaceuticals, which was founded in 1999 to develop drugs for metabolic diseases, but it went out of business by the mid 2000s. Mr. Nelsen said the science wasn't ready to be translated into drug development.

GlaxoSmithKline paid $720 million in 2008 to acquire Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, which was developing an antiaging compound. Glaxo shut it down in 2013 amid skepticism over the compound's benefits.

Undeterred, Sirtris founder David Sinclair is at work on another compound that goes by the shorthand NAD+ that he says has resulted in mice acting younger and living longer.

"Now, the world is more optimistic, and we have invented and made synthetic compounds that extend life in animals," Dr. Sinclair said. "That has helped make this more of a valid business endeavor."

But making the leap from mice to humans is one of the toughest parts of longevity science, said Thomas Rando, a researcher in aging at Stanford. Last year, his lab published a paper that showed injecting mice with a stem-cell-activating protein that helped injured muscles to heal faster. Dr. Rando is planning to launch his own longevity startup soon.

"The tough part that entrepreneurs and investors still need to remember is just because animal studies show one thing, it doesn't always mean it will work with humans," he said. "There could be a big drop-off, and people need to know how solid their foundation of science is. And it's not going be an area where you are going to see returns in two years."

Catastrophe Losses Bruise Reinsurers --- Rising competition and lower renewal rates are taking a toll on the sector### invalid font number 1

One morning last September, Dwayne Elgin unbolted the front door of his home on the island of St. Martin and gazed upon a wasteland of flipped cars, uprooted trees and flattened homes.

Irma, the strongest Atlantic hurricane on record, had laid waste to the Caribbean island overnight and as head of Nagico Insurances, a local insurance firm, Mr. Elgin knew almost all of his policyholders would turn to him for help. But he was prepared: Like many insurers, he had unloaded a large portion of firm's risk to reinsurers, the industry's last line of defense.

Irma and an extraordinary string of other natural disasters in 2017 saddled insurers and reinsurers globally with more than $135 billion in losses, according to Munich Re's 2017 Natural Catastrophe Report.

Typically, that would lead reinsurers -- the largest of which include German and Swiss firms such as Munich Re, Swiss Re and Hannover Re -- to raise prices, helping them to bounce back from the losses.

However, this year the industry has struggled, in an illustration of how loose monetary policy is challenging Germany's financial sector.

Reinsurers fared poorly in January during annual price-renewal negotiations with insurers, according to industry analysts, with easy money opening up new ways for insurers to spread risk beyond reinsurers, such as issuing bonds, pressuring prices.

The combination of soaring catastrophe losses and low renewal rates -- the annual price difference in policies sold by reinsurers -- has, in some cases, all but wiped out profits.

Munich Re recently reported a 85% fall in full-year profit because of natural disasters, reducing its return on equity -- a closely watched measure of financial productivity -- to 1.3% from 8.3% the previous year. That is far below the long-term industry average of over 10% calculated by Standard & Poor's. The company's average renewal-rate increases of 0.8% will do little to compensate for the losses, analysts say.

Munich Re's chief financial officer, Jorg Schneider, said the company had a sufficient capital buffer to cope with the disaster-related losses and that he expected reinsurance prices to rise in future renewal negotiation rounds. The company is the world's second-largest reinsurer by premiums written behind Swiss Re.

Rival Hannover Re also has been hit, with a spokesman saying its disaster losses for 2017 would be the largest in its 52-year history. It is set to report full-year earnings next month. Its profit margin fell sharply in the third quarter.

U.S. firms face similar issues, with Berkshire Hathaway Inc. -- set to report full-year results on Friday -- citing hurricanes and an earthquake in Mexico for its insurance-underwriting arm swinging to a third-quarter loss.

The main reason for reinsurers' loss of pricing power is growing competition, which has come in part from insurance-linked securities such as catastrophe bonds. Such bonds essentially package insurance risk as debt that doesn't have to be repaid in full or at all if a disaster stipulated in the bond's contract strikes.

Offering relative yields of up to 8%, the bonds have proved popular with sophisticated investors looking for higher returns after bond buying by central banks drove bond prices higher and yields lower.

Global issuance of catastrophe bonds hit a record $10.5 billion in 2017, according to Property Claims Services, a U.S. industry body.

Such forms of alternative capital now account for around 14% of total reinsurance capital, up from 4% in 2006, according to U.S. insurance broker Aon Corp.

With monetary policy only starting to normalize around the world, the pricing environment for reinsurers looks unlikely to improve in the near term, according to David Flandro, head of ### invalid font number 2
analytics### invalid font number 1
 at JLT Reinsurance Brokers.

The other side of the profit equation -- natural disasters -- is impossible to predict but some reinsurers don't think 2017 was an exception.

The 2017 events "are giving us a foretaste of what is to come," Torsten Jeworrek, a Munich Re board member, said last month. "Our experts expect such extreme weather to occur more often in future."

The CFPB Could Be a Force for Good### invalid font number 1

During Richard Cordray's tenure as director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the CFPB pummeled American consumers and the economy while doing little to promote financial stability. The pain was especially acute for low- and middle-income consumers who lost access to credit cards, faced higher bank fees and reduced access to free checking, and found it harder and costlier to obtain mortgages, especially as first-time homebuyers. In response, consumers turned to payday loans and alternative products as financial life rafts -- only to have Mr. Cordray poke holes in them by imposing regulations that would effectively outlaw payday lending.

Yet despite its rocky start, the original promise of the CFPB is sound: to protect and empower consumers, promote fair and competitive markets, and stabilize the financial system. Well-designed consumer-credit regulation and vigorous enforcement of consumer-protection laws make markets more transparent and give consumers confidence to borrow and save. But poorly designed regulations choke off access to credit, drive up interest rates and eliminate choices, forcing consumers to turn to less desirable financial options -- even loan sharks.

A signature achievement of President Trump's first year was regulatory reform aimed at restoring the rule of law and promoting economic prosperity. Mick Mulvaney, the CFPB's acting director, announced in a staff memorandum last month that the bureau will go in a different direction under his leadership, and he has already started rolling back some of the its most harmful regulations. As Mr. Mulvaney, or his permanent successor, considers how to reorient the agency further in the interest of protecting consumers, he should consider five guiding principles: inclusion, innovation, choice, competition and respect.

-- Inclusion. The unintended consequences of Obama-era regulations fell hardest on lower-income families. Regulations that eliminate credit options for those who already have few of them will not make their lives better. Working with the private sector and Congress to reverse this growing exclusion of Americans from the financial sector is a moral imperative.

-- Innovation. New financial technologies have the potential to disrupt consumer banking in ways that would benefit consumers. Yet the CFPB has stifled innovation at every turn. Nontraditional credit scoring and underwriting models rooted in ### invalid font number 2
Big Data### invalid font number 1
 offer hope for those who don't have access to mainstream banking. Mr. Mulvaney should abandon the agency's "regulation by enforcement" approach, which discourages experimentation by heightening the risk of retroactive liability. The bureau can help unleash the power of FinTech by invigorating dormant tools like the no-action letter program and Project Catalyst, a CFPB initiative designed to facilitate "consumer-friendly innovation in markets."

-- Choice. American families know better than bureaucrats what financial products best meet their needs. One justification for the CFPB's broad scope of authority was to enable it to oversee the entire consumer-credit ecosystem and break down the traditional regulatory silos that focus on who issues financial products instead of how consumers use them. The CFPB should concentrate its efforts on empowering families instead of banning products or using trendy behavioral-economics theories to "nudge" consumers toward decisions central planners favor.

-- Competition. Excessive regulation disproportionately drives up costs for small banks and credit unions, forcing them to close, merge or restrict offerings. A 2014 Mercatus Center survey found many small banks were discontinuing mortgage lending because of Dodd-Frank and almost 3 out of 4 said the CFPB was affecting their business. Moreover, because small banks provide the bulk of the nation's small-business and agricultural loans, their struggles contributed to the meager job creation and weak economic recovery during the Obama years.

-- Respect. When the CFPB prototype was first proposed nine years ago, I wrote in these pages that the architects of the new agency should "treat borrowers like adults." Instead, Mr. Cordray's CFPB viewed consumers as too dumb, irrational or vulnerable to make their own decisions about whether to enter into a contract with an arbitration clause, take out a payday loan, or bargain with a car dealer over an auto loan.

Protecting consumers from unfair and deceptive actions by financial institutions is the CFPB's core mission. But not every consumer who fails to pay his bills is a hapless victim. Smarter regulation would recognize this. During the financial crisis, for example, millions of borrowers walked away from mortgages they could afford to pay simply because they were underwater. But the CFPB's mortgage rules are designed only to ensure that borrowers have the ability to pay; they do not consider precautions such as requiring larger down payments that would address the incentive to default strategically when housing prices fall. As a result, despite imposing billions in regulatory compliance costs, there is no evidence the CFPB's rules would have materially reduced foreclosures had they been on the books during the housing crisis.

Mr. Mulvaney has taken decisive steps toward reforming the CFPB. Now comes the more crucial step -- building a framework of consumer financial protection that restores the rule of law and contributes to economic prosperity.

INTERVIEW Veteran manager predicts a rosy future after 'second industrial revolution'

Bill Priest has an infectious enthusiasm for the investment world even after a career in finance spanning more than half a century. "Investment is the most fascinating game in the world. There's always something to learn," says the chief executive of Epoch Investment Partners.

New York City-based Epoch has grown to around $60bn in assets under management and advisory from $640m in 2004 when it was launched by Mr Priest and his three founding partners.

It is the second investment company that Mr Priest has created. He also co-founded BEA Associates in 1972, a business that was acquired by Credit Suisse in 1990. BEA became the cornerstone of the Credit Suisse Asset Management Americas business with Mr Priest as CEO, and then expanded further through the acquisitions of the asset management arms of Warburg Pincus and brokerage Donaldson, Lufkin &Jenrette.

But Credit Suisse's strict age policy of "60 and out" for senior executives compelled Mr Priest to "retire" against his wishes in 2001.

"I was aware that such a policy existed. I just didn't think it would apply to me," says the 76-year-old, to whom the idea of retirement still remains anathema.

The industry veteran has developed strong views on how a successful asset management business should be run.

"If the client doesn't win, we don't deserve to win. There's an old saying that Wall Street wants to combine its experience with the clients' money and turn that into Wall Street's money and the clients' experience. And I think that's wrong," he says.

He insists that asset managers can balance the pursuit of profits while being aligned with the interests of clients.

"The gap between the interests of asset managers and assets owners has to be as small as possible. If the asset management company is not built around the client, then you have a real problem," he says Epoch was acquired in 2013 by Toronto-Dominion Bank of Canada, a deal that Mr Priest was initially reluctant to sign after seeing the Credit Suisse Asset Management business dismembered following his departure. All hiring and firing decisions, along with pay and bonus agreements, remain under Epoch's control while TD has provided additional capital to seed new investment strategies and a far broader distribution platform.

"The history of these deals is terrible. I was afraid that Epoch's culture might be destroyed. But working with TD has enhanced our credibility," he says.

Around a third of Epoch's assets are managed in its Global Equity Shareholder Yield strategy, a portfolio of 90 to 120 companies that generate substantial free cash flows and return capital efficiently to shareholders through dividends, debt reductions or share buybacks.

Mr Priest catchily describes Epoch's flagship strategy as "the single most efficient dividend collection machine in the world".

It has been designed to answer the need for income replacement which he views as "the single biggest opportunity" for the asset management industry globally.

Mr Priest predicts that dividend payouts will continue to rise as technology replaces the use of labour and physical assets across modern economies, a disruptive process that he believes is now growing exponentially across multiple industries. "Any company that is not pursuing an 'asset light' model faces obsolescence as rivals will compete its business away. We have entered a second industrial revolution in the digital age. The world has never seen disruption at this pace before."

But he also cautions that technology could lead to "big social problems further down the road" as machines replace larger numbers of workers.

His early career was spent as a railroad analyst which required laborious hours of data inputting and painstaking manual calculations in the days before computers were widely adopted. "I could do those same calculations in minutes today," he says. Disruptive technology is also moving deeper into the investment industry as asset managers turn to ### invalid font number 2
big data### invalid font number 1
 and ### invalid font number 2
machine learning### invalid font number 1
 to gain an edge.

"The purpose of Epoch is to marry the judgment of man with the efficiency of computers. If we don't do that, we will die. The only reason to have a portfolio manager is to have judgment. But that judgment needs to be applied more efficiently."

Epoch has published more than 100 research papers on its website, part of Mr Priest's determination for the company to be seen as a thought leader for the investment industry.

"We want clients to understand why we do what we do and to value that approach."

He has also co-authored three investment books. The latest, Winning at Active Management, points to his loyalties in the debate over the merits of stockpickers and indextracking funds.

"The opportunities for active management will improve as central banks move from quantitative easing to monetary tightening," he says, adding that most investors also need help when combining the two different skills of stockpicking and asset allocation.

"Some clients oversimplify and that gets them into a lot of trouble. You need a pilot with the plane."

But he also warns that many smaller stockpickers are likely to go out of business because of the increasing burden of regulation and competition from low-cost trackers.

"Index funds are going to get bigger. Passive is not going away. Active management will be smaller but we need the price discovery delivered by active managers."

Outside of work, Mr Priest, a father of two, enjoys hiking and biking to keep fit, as well as playing golf, where "my handicap is my swing".

But having more time to work on his golf swing will have to wait.

"I need to remain relevant to my clients, my colleagues and to the owner of the business. The minute that I'm not relevant, then I gotta go."

Washington's $500 Million Financial-Storm Forecaster Is Foundering; Office of Financial Research was supposed to anticipate trouble and issue warnings, but initiatives have been delayed or scaled back### invalid font number 1

Congress created a brand new agency after the 2008 financial crisis with a gargantuan mission: Serve as the finance world's version of the National Weather Service.

The new Office of Financial Research wasn't expected to prevent economic storms, but it was supposed to anticipate them and issue warnings to help authorities contain the damage.

Almost a decade and nearly $500 million later, the agency has struggled to establish a place for itself in Washington. Major projects have been delayed or scaled back. Morale has suffered amid turf battles with other regulators and opposition from Republicans. And one of its most ambitious initiativeseveloping a database for recording financial contractsas progressed no further than a 16-page paper calling for "information gathering sessions" among constituents.

As the administration of President Donald Trump works to change financial policies it views as governmental overreach, the OFR's record of underachievement has made it an easy target. In November, Treasury Department officials told OFR employees that the agency's budget would be cut by one-quarter and its staff by more than one-third.

"If you're not happy here, you should leave," Craig Phillips, a counselor to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, told the staff.

The OFR's early backers thought it would become an authoritative source when financial markets experienced volatility, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/asia-pacific-stocks-fall-to-kick-off-the-week-1517790854?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=3". The agency does publish a "https://www.financialresearch.gov/financial-vulnerabilities/#/", but it isn't widely cited and is mostly based on already available information, not the private data Congress empowered the agency to collect.

The agency's creation "was a major opportunity to both reduce the burden of regulation and significantly improve regulatory oversight of financial risk, and it was squandered," says economist Allan Mendelowitz, a former federal housing-finance regulator who helped write the legislation creating the agency.

Richard Berner, who led the agency from its early days until the end of last year, told a congressional committee in December he was proud of its accomplishments "despite headwinds from working for a startup amid persistent uncertainties about existential threats to the OFR."

Mr. Berner declined to comment for this article, which is based on internal agency documents and interviews with current and former government officials.

The Trump administration appointed Ken Phelan, the Treasury's chief risk officer, as acting OFR chief while it searches for a permanent director. "Treasury is taking action to improve the management of OFR, right-size its resources and sharpen its focus," a Treasury spokesman said. "We are building a leaner, more effective organization." Mr. Phelan declined to comment.

Democratic senators who support the agency have spoken out against budget cuts, saying in a letter last year that the OFR provides "independent and apolitical analysis of the risks that could threaten our economy" and "should be fully funded and given every opportunity to do its work."

"It's a question of, will regulatory authorities have the willingness and ability to look across the financial landscape to see the risks developing?" said Jacob Lew, who served as U.S. Treasury Secretary from 2013 through 2017.

The idea for the agency "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704285104575492182195397138" by a group of academics, finance-industry executives and other self-described financial-data geeks, including Mr. Mendelowitz. During the economic turmoil, they concluded, regulators and industry didn't have a clear enough sense of what was going on throughout the financial system.

They argued the government needed a new agency to, among other things, vacuum up and standardize Wall Street trading and lending data and store it in a central data repository. That would make it easier, they felt, to identify systemic risks like the buildup of debt that bankrupted Lehman Brothers Holdings in 2008 and boomeranged through the economy.

They won over a key lawmaker, Sen. Jack Reed (D., R.I.), who had the influence to insert their idea into the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, which sought to overhaul U.S. financial regulation.

The goal, from the outset, was ambitious, and the agency's defenders say it has made progress in a new arena for government. "It was a total cold start," says Lewis Alexander, U.S. chief economist at Nomura Holdings Inc., referring to early deliberations within the Treasury, where he was a counselor helping to launch the agency.

Mr. Berner, then co-head of global economics at Morgan Stanley, was selected by President Barack Obama and approved by the Senate for a six-year term. He had wide discretion to determine OFR's agenda.

He started in April 2011 with a skeleton staff crammed into the second floor of an ancillary Treasury office building. Although OFR was established as a quasi-independent agency, funded by fees from big finance firms, it also is an arm of the Treasury and must consult with the Treasury on budgeting.

Treasury officials, including Deputy Secretary Neal Wolin, were skeptical that creating a financial early-warning system was possible. Mr. Wolin counseled Mr. Berner against setting unrealistic goals, according to people familiar with their discussion. Be practical, he told the new director.

Almost immediately, the agency came under attack from Republicans such as House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), who labeled it "### invalid font number 2
big data### invalid font number 1
 for Big Brother." In 2012, the committee released a video titled "The Office of Financial Research Is Watching You." It suggested OFR would have unfettered access to Americans' personal financial information.

The committee voted to abolish the agency. That measure died. A similar proposal was contained in a bill passed by House Republicans last year, although it stalled in the Senate.

Mr. Berner set a goal of about 300 employees. Rather than a data hub and financial-storm forecaster, he envisioned the OFR primarily as a sort of independent financial think tank, according to officials who worked with him in the agency's early months. He recruited researchers and gave them significant leeway.

Its first big assignment came in the spring of 2012, when senior regulators asked for an analysis of risks posed by the asset-management industry. OFR began developing a report, with no clear deadline. In the summer of 2013, Mary Miller, the Treasury Department's undersecretary for domestic finance, called Mr. Berner to her office for a status update, and grew incredulous that the project didn't sound close to completion, according to a person familiar with the meeting.

"Dick," she asked, "how are we going to land this plane?"

The OFR team shared drafts of the report with Ms. Miller and her Treasury colleagues and with officials from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which regulates asset managers. Officials at both agencies were alarmed to see lengthy descriptions of potential risks without empirical analysis, according to former officials at those agencies. They suggested edits, and the document was trimmed by about two-thirds.

SEC officials bridled at the OFR's failure to formally solicit public feedback. The SEC opened a forum on its own website. Treasury and OFR officials were furious, believing the SEC was providing a platform for criticism of an agency whose work had encroached on its turf, the former officials say. The SEC didn't back down.

The Sept. 30, 2013, report concluded that asset managers could threaten financial stability. Industry lobbyists blitzed Capitol Hill and blasted OFR in letters posted on the SEC website. They saw the report as a precursor to stricter federal regulation.

Fidelity's lobbyists complained the agency hadn't checked basic facts. A lobbyist for Fidelity Investments told congressional staffers that the report misstated the firm's assets under management by $200 billion, pointing the staffers to a public financial disclosure that backed up their claim, according to people familiar with the matter.

Mr. Berner said at a later Senate hearing that the agency had engaged in "a vigorous give and take" with the industry and others about the report. He was personally involved in drafting it and was surprised by the strength of the backlash, people familiar with the matter say. These people say the experience reinforced for him the need for the agency to tread softly to survive.

OFR developed a series of tools for monitoring financial risks, including a tracker of the multitrillion dollar money-market-fund industry and a new barcode-like device the helps regulators keep track of financial firms and what they own. Separate OFR research papers have drawn attention to holes or unintended consequences in banking regulations.

The agency built a system to store and analyze huge amounts of financial data. The problem has been getting the actual numbers. Other agencies were slow in fulfilling data requests, according to OFR and Treasury officials. The data OFR has purchased, or collected on a voluntary basis, is incomplete and misses trillions of dollars in financial transactions, employees say. The agency hasn't ever used its data-collection subpoena authority.

The possibility of using that subpoena power came up after Oct. 15, 2014, when Treasury bond prices suddenly surged and then crashed for no apparent reason.

Anxious analysts in the Treasury Department dialed up traders, asking what happened. They couldn't fact-check what they heard because the government "http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-new-bond-market-the-u-s-treasury-struggles-to-keep-up-1443027850".

To some, the lack of data looked like a problem tailor-made for the OFR to solve. Mr. Berner was invited to a meeting at the Treasury Department with representatives of the major financial regulators, including the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the SEC and the Fed.

When discussion turned to obstacles to gathering trading data on Treasury bills, Mr. Berner was asked about the OFR using its subpoena authority to gather the information, according to attendees.

He replied he wasn't sure the agency had that authority, and even if it did, it wouldn't use it in this case, recall two attendees.

Mr. Berner worried that forcing the handover of information could make enemies of other agencies it needed for other projects, according to people who worked with him. OFR's lawyers also believed the subpoena authority would hold up only in limited circumstances.

Mr. Berner faced "very difficult politics around data collection and analysis," says Amias Gerety, a former senior Treasury official who worked with him. "Dick definitely believed you could catch more flies with honey than with vinegar."

Nevertheless, Mr. Berner's statement stunned some who heard it. Not only had he questioned his own authority to use subpoenas, he had removed the threat of using it.

When Treasury and other agencies published "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-report-finds-no-single-cause-of-oct-15-treasury-market-volatility-1436801464", the OFR wasn't part of it.

That and other incidents fueled employee criticism that Mr. Berner was reluctant to embrace his powers, preferring to avoid controversy, according to current and former employees. Surveys of employees suggest that morale inside the agency has flagged.

Last March, the OFR published its 16-page paper on the development of the database for recording financial contracts, following years of false starts and infighting, according to employees. Mr. Berner weighed in on final drafts.

"We should be prepared that people will be underwhelmed," another OFR official predicted, according to one employee's notes about the project, known officially as the financial instrument reference database.

The prediction was accurate. Mr. Berner canceled an April public discussion about the initiative with OFR's advisory panel, then placed the project on hold, pending review by the Trump administration.

He announced his resignation in November, more than a year before his term expired, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family. He is now an adjunct professor and executive in residence at New York University's business school.

In e-commerce and mobile payments, it has already overtaken America

THE technology industry is the crowning glory of America's economy. It supports 7m well-paid jobs at home, and allows America to set standards globally. Silicon Valley generates almost $200bn of profits from abroad each year, several times the benefit that America gets from having the world's reserve currency. But after losing its lead in exports and manufacturing, is America's tech supremacy now under threat from China?

For years Silicon Valley dismissed Chinese tech firmsirst as an irrelevance, then as industrial spies and copycats. Most recently China has been seen as a tech Galapagos, where unique species thrive than would never spread abroad. But as our "http://www.economist.com/news/business/21737075-silicon-valley-may-not-hold-its-global-superiority-much-longer-how-does-chinese-tech" explains this week, China's technology industry has been catching up far faster than expected. American venture capitalists return from trips to China blown away by its energy. China's government has set a goal of becoming dominant in ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
 by 2030.

China still has huge weaknesses. Its tech firms are only worth about a third as much as America's, and their investment budgets pale in comparison with those in the United States. They generate relatively little revenue abroad, and are puny in semiconductors and business-related software. Moreover, Chinese companies in other industries make less intense use of technology products than their American counterparts do. And although China does have two giant tech firms in Tencent and Alibaba, as well as lots of small ones, it has relatively few mid-sized companies in the range of $50-$400bn.

Nonetheless, China is now approaching parity on the most forward-looking measures. In e-commerce and mobile payments, its industry is now bigger than America's. Its universe of nicorns" (unlisted firms worth over $1bn) is almost as large, as is its venture-capital sector. Both are proxies for China's ability to produce tomorrow's giant firms. And in cutting-edge areas such as facial and speech recognition, China now has recognised leaders. There are even some signs that it is catching up in hard science: it has produced nearly as many papers on ### invalid font number 2

 cited by parties other than their author as America has.

At its present pace, China is still 10-15 years away from reaching tech parity with America. But for American tech firms, the time to get paranoid is now.

Congress Lacks Will to Overhaul Fannie and Freddie

A bipartisan group of Senate moderates works feverishly for months to craft a complex overhaul of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The lawmakers prod progressive Democrats and right-wing Republicans, but prove unable to generate support beyond a group of centrists. The bill clears a key Senate panel but ultimately faces obstacles from leadership more focused on the midterm elections.

These dynamics were in play the last time a group of Senate centrists sought to revamp Fannie and Freddie in 2014. The same scenes are being repeated this yearncreasingly dimming the likelihood of any deal to overhaul the mortgage-finance giants, which have been under government control for nearly 10 years.

"The effort has been met with resistance from both ends of the ideological spectrum and neither base has moved meaningfully toward the center given the combination of complex issues and a lack of legislative urgency," said Isaac Boltansky of Compass Point Research & Trading.

To be sure, some current and former congressional aides remain optimistic a deal will yet emerge, particularly because the Trump administration wants to accomplish something in this space. Notably, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) has shifted his views and now says he is now willing to consider an explicit federal guarantee on mortgage securities significant concession.

Still, no deal is imminent in the Senate, according to aides. And unlike in 2014, the House has yet to even introduce its own version of the legislation. A plan by Mr. Hensarling that would have liquidated Fannie and Freddie had at least passed the House in 2013.

Centrist Senate lawmakers say they continue to negotiate with their more-partisan colleagues and could win the support of liberal Democrats needed to advance the bill through the chamber.

Yet some liberals say that "nothing done" is the best scenario for them, according to lobbyists and aides. They know that whatever legislation is signed into law will likely define the market for the next generation, and are willing to wait until they have a chance of controlling at least one of the chambers of Congress before striking a compromise.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

SEC Rejects Sale of Chicago Stock Exchange

By Dave Michaels

WASHINGTONhe Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday rejected the sale of the Chicago Stock Exchange to a group that would have included Chinese investors, capping a two-year battle over a deal that sparked political opposition in Congress.

The SEC's commissioners voted against the transaction six months after the agency's staff recommended approving the sale. The decision is a rare move by the SEC to choose who isn't allowed to control a U.S. stock exchange, even one that handles less than 1% of trading volume.

Critics of the sale, including lawmakers from both parties, said letting a Chinese company take a major stake in a U.S. stock exchange would create a backdoor for the Chinese government to influence American financial infrastructure. The Chicago company repeatedly said the Chinese government wasn't involved in the deal, but a political fight erupted that prompted two of the initial Chinese investors to withdraw from the group in October.

A spokesman for the exchange declined to comment. Under U.S. law, the exchange's parent company, CHX Holdings Inc., could appeal the SEC's decision in federal appellate court. It also could refile its application with the SEC with a revised group of proposed investors.

The group of investors who sought to buy the exchange had wanted to reinvent the struggling venue as a bridge between U.S. and Chinese markets, and a Western listings outpost for Chinese firms.

In an order rejecting the deal, the SEC said the exchange hadn't met the burden of proof to show it could stick to rules that limit the control of any one stockholder over an exchange. A father-and-son duo who proposed owning a piece of the exchangehe father from China and the son based in the U.S.ad agreed to limit their combined voting power to follow those rules.

The SEC also said it couldn't count on having access to the records of exchange owners based in China, if it needed to obtain them.

SEC Chairman Jay Clayton made the decision to freeze his staff's plan to approve the sale after consulting about the subject with the White House, people familiar with the matter said in September. Officials at the White House, which has clashed with China on trade, urged Mr. Clayton to pause the approval, the people said.

A spokesman for Mr. Clayton declined to comment at the time. Natalie Strom, a White House spokeswoman, said at the time that the Trump administration respects the SEC's independence. "The White House does not direct the actions of the SEC," she said.

The lead investor in the deal, Chongqing Casin Enterprise Group Co., would have owned 20% of the exchange's parent company. Chongqing Casin is controlled by Shengju Lu, whose son Jay Lu would have owned a 19.5% stake in the company.

Two other China-based firms, Chongqing Jintian Industrial Co. and Chongqing Longshang Decoration Co., had agreed to invest about $8 million as part of a consortium that offered $20 million to purchase the exchange, rising to $25 million if the exchange hit future revenue targets. The firms' managers dropped out in the fall due to political criticism of the deal in Congress and the slow approval process at the SEC, people familiar with the matter said.

Their withdrawal left Casin Group as the only China-based investor in the group. Proposed U.S. investors included Raptor Group, the family office of former hedge-fund manager Jim Pallotta; and Anthony Saliba, a current board member of CHX Holdings who runs an options-trading and technology firm, Matrix Holding Group.

The SEC was repeatedly pressured to block the sale by lawmakers including Rep. Robert Pittenger (R., N.C.), who said the regulator couldn't reasonably expect to monitor the involvement of owners based in China. Sens. Jon Tester (D., Mont.) and Tim Scott (R., S.C.) also came out against the sale.

A firm called Exchange Capital LLC, which has lobbied Congress for months to put pressure on regulators to block the deal, previously said it wanted to buy the Chicago bourse if Chongqing Casin's bid fell through, according to lobbyists and others familiar with the matter.

SEC officials declined to disclose how the vote of the five-member commission broke down.

U.S. Bancorp Charged Over Relationship With Race-Car Driver Scott Tucker

By Christina Rexrode

U.S. Bancorp was fined $613 million Thursday for what regulators and prosecutors said were shoddy anti-money-laundering controls, a rare regulatory setback for a bank that emerged from the financial crisis relatively unscathed.

The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan also announced criminal charges against the bank that eventually could be dismissed. The Manhattan U.S. Attorney, Geoffrey Berman, said the bank's poor controls had allowed a former customer, race-car driver Scott Tucker, to launder money from an illegal payday-lending scheme. Mr. Tucker was convicted of fraud last year.

Banks are required to have controls to prevent their systems from being used for illegal purposes, and to report suspicious activity to the government. But the government said that U.S. Bank had operated its program "on the cheap" with inadequate staffing and resources, which caused it to miss red flags of some of its customers' activities, including Mr. Tucker.

Minneapolis-based U.S. Bank is the largest among mid-sized U.S. banks, and one of the largest banks in the country. It has long cultivated a reputation for a cautious, plain-vanilla approach to banking, which has produced years of steady profits. The settlements announced Thursday represent its biggest regulatory fine ever.

Investors took the news in stride. Shares fell 0.4%, or 21 cents, to $55.10. The bank already had disclosed that prosecutors were looking at its relationship with Mr. Tucker. Bank executives said last month that they were expecting a settlement soon, and had set aside $608 million. The bank said Thursday it was fully reserved for the settlements.

Still, U.S. Bank can't put the matter behind it just yet. The bank is still subject to a 2015 consent order by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which flagged the bank for anti-money-laundering deficiencies, and the Federal Reserve issued a similar consent order on Thursday. The OCC order constraints U.S. Bank from buying other banks.

Also, the bank's agreement with the Justice Department includes a so-called deferred prosecution agreement, which requires it to submit to further monitoring. In exchange, the government could in two years seek to dismiss the charges. The bank has already been revamping its money-laundering programs since the OCC's consent order, by hiring staff, upgrading systems and installing a new leadership team.

"We regret and have accepted responsibility for the past deficiencies in our (anti-money-laundering) program," said U.S. Bancorp's Chief Executive Andy Cecere, in a statement. A longtime U.S. Bank executive, he became CEO last year.

The bank agreed to a statement of facts about its conduct.

"This order &hows that career examiners and prosecutors remain at work," Cowen & Co. analyst Jaret Seiberg wrote in a note to clients.

A customer at the center of the investigation was Mr. Tucker. According to prosecutors, from 2011 to 2013, the bank failed to appropriately report that Mr. Tucker had been using sham bank accounts opened under the names of companies connected to Native American tribes. Prosecutors said the bank disregarded numerous warning signs that Mr. Tucker was using the tribes to hide his ownership of the accounts. For example, prosecutors said, Mr. Tucker used money from the accounts for a vacation home in Aspen and his professional Ferrari racing team.

After news reports of Mr. Tucker's questionable business practices in 2011, U.S. Bank closed the accounts but didn't file a suspicious activity report, prosecutors said. It also left open other accounts belonging to Mr. Tucker.

Prosecutors said the bank dealt with its thin resources in anti-money-laundering compliance by capping the number of transactions subject to review. The bank then concealed that method from the OCC, prosecutors said, with one employee excluding references to limited resources from the minutes of an internal bank meeting.

In all, the bank announced settlements or agreements with the Justice Department, the OCC, the Fed and the U.S. Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.

The fines and penalties included a forfeiture of $453 million related to the Justice Department agreement, a $15 million penalty from the Federal Reserve, a $75 million penalty from the OCC, and a $70 million penalty from FinCEN.

GOP Senators Pan Trump Plan to Make Futures Industry Pay User Fees

By Gabriel T. Rubin

WASHINGTONenate Republicans on Thursday criticized the Trump administration's proposal to impose fees on the futures industry to fund the top U.S. derivatives regulator, which has requested a bigger budget.

User fees have also been opposed by the industry and the leaders of the regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, meaning the plan stands little chance of becoming reality. By floating the idea of funding the CFTC partly with user fees, the Trump administration has acknowledged the regulator's plea for more funds, but without shifting money from elsewhere in the government's budget to the CFTC.

The impasse suggests the agency could see its funding remain flat for a fifth consecutive year, though Republicans at a Senate hearing Thursday showed some willingness to consider higher funding levels for the CFTC, citing its need for funds to support more data analysis and market surveillance.

User fees are "a tax on farmers and ranchers who depend on you to make sure their risk-management strategy is protected," Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R., Kansas) told CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo at the hearing.

The CFTC's budget has remained flat at $250 million for the past four years, and congressional Republicans have previously rejected proposals to raise it. The White House's budget last year didn't ask for more funds for the CFTC, prompting Mr. Giancarlo, a Republican nominated by President Donald Trump, to submit an independent budget request for an extra $31.5 million. This year's White House budget includes those additional funds, but relies on industry levies to produce them.

"I very much oppose user fees," said Sen. John Boozman (R., Ark.), though he seemed sympathetic to Mr. Giancarlo's request for more funding. "I think I can speak for the Appropriations Committee," he added. "We're trying to address that."

Mr. Giancarlo has long opposed fees on individual derivatives trades, which he has said can hurt market liquidity by making trading less appealing. The fees proposed by the White House target other activities, including registering products and reimbursing regulators for examinations and supervisionut these would likely be passed on to investors and end users in the form of higher fees to participate on futures exchanges. CME Group Inc., which runs the U.S.'s largest futures exchange, opposes using fees to fund the CFTC.

Not wanting to get stuck in the middle between the White House and Congress, Mr. Giancarlo demurred when asked about the administration's budget.

"My position is the agency needs $281.5 million, and Congress will decide where that money comes from," he told reporters after the hearing.

Republicans' new openness to consider higher funding for the agency comes in the wake of a two-year budget agreement last week, which didn't directly address CFTC funding. It also comes as Congress has taken an interest in financial regulators' approach to cryptocurrency regulation, exploring whether more resources might be necessary for the CFTC to keep up with rapid developments in the opaque and unregulated spot markets.

While Mr. Giancarlo would welcome the extra funds, he pushed back on senators who suggested the CFTC might be the appropriate agency to regulate underlying cryptocurrency spot exchanges. The CFTC has labeled bitcoin a commodity, but as with other commodities, the agency mostly lacks jurisdiction over the primary market: It regulates corn futures contracts but not the buying and selling of corn itself, for instance.

"We are not an agency that traditionally regulates spot exchanges," he said. "It would be a very significant change for us."

Still, Mr. Giancarlo said that the decision to leave underlying cryptocurrency markets unregulated was a "policy choice we're going to have to face in the months and years to come."

Investors Warned of Cryptocurrency ump-and-Dump' Schemes

By Gabriel T. Rubin

WASHINGTONegulators on Thursday warned consumers to beware of "pump-and-dump" manipulation schemes in virtual-currency markets as they try to rein in misconduct on unregulated spot exchanges.

The guidance from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission targets schemes that rely on coordinated efforts to create phony demand for cryptocurrencies, followed by schemers quickly selling their stakes to take advantage of the inflated prices.

The CFTC advisory is part of a broader consumer-education effort related to virtual currencies such as bitcoin, which have seen a swell of interest from retail investors in recent months.

"As with many online frauds, this type of scam is not newt simply deploys an emerging technology to capitalize on public interest in digital assets," said CFTC spokeswoman Erica Richardson.

The advisory came in response to complaints the CFTC has received from consumers who say they have lost money in pump-and-dump schemes.

The CFTC has tried to strike a balance between supporting the growth of virtual-currency derivatives and blockchain-based applications while warning investors about the risks of investing in the underlying currencies, citing extreme volatility and opaque, unregulated exchanges that are prone to cyberattacks.

The agency treats virtual currencies like commodities, but as with other commodities, it mostly lacks jurisdiction over the primary market: It regulates corn futures contracts but not the buying and selling of corn itself, for instance. But the CFTC can use its enforcement powers to target manipulation of underlying markets if it would have an effect on derivatives contracts.

Last month, the CFTC brought charges in three cases involving virtual currencies, alleging that defendants fraudulently solicited customers and violated other commodity laws and regulations.

Facebook to Snap Targeted by SEC Regulator's Attack on Dual-Class Shares

By Dave Michaels

WASHINGTONorporate titans who control companies through special classes of stock that give them extra voting power should have to give up the system after a limited number of years, a senior Democratic regulator said Thursday.

Companies such as Viacom Inc., Facebook Inc. and Ford Motor Co. have multiple classes of stock that don't expire until after the founder or longtime controlling shareholder dies. The practice "raises the prospect that control over our public companies, and ultimately of Main Street's retirement savings, will be forever held by a small, elite group of corporate insiders," Securities and Exchange Commission member Robert Jackson Jr., a Democrat, said in remarks prepared for a speech at the University of California Berkeley Law School.

About 16% of companies that have gone public on U.S. exchanges since 2013 had at least two classes of stock, according to data provider Dealogic. Many technology companies have structured their initial public offerings with dual-class stock in recent years to give founders a viselike grip on the business. Snap Inc., for instance, gave new shareholders no voting rights whatsoever when it went public last year.

The founders of the Snapchat parent, Evan Spiegel and Robert Murphy, control the company through class C shares that give them 10 votes per share. The stock only loses its supervoting power nine months after their deaths, according to Snap's corporate charter.

Class B shares held by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, which grant him 10 votes per share, convert to common, one-vote shares three years after his death ornder more complex circumstancesf he resigns, according to Facebook's corporate charter.

Such outsize voting power gives controlling shareholders dominance over all decisions, ranging from the election of directors to whether to sell the company someday.

News Corp., the owner of The Wall Street Journal's parent, Dow Jones & Co., has two classes of shares, which allow Rupert Murdoch and his family to maintain greater influence over the media company.

An investor backlash against Snap's deal prompted the keepers of the S&P 500 to say they would block newcomers with multiple classes of stock from joining their flagship index. Barring those companies from prominent indexes could reduce demand for their stock from increasingly popular index funds.

Dual-class stock may benefit investors early in a company's life, when the visionary who launched it needs freedom to build the business without outside pressure from stockholders, said Mr. Jackson, who didn't call for banning the practice outright. But that benefit wanes over time, he said. His staff's analysis showed that firms with never-ending dual-class stock trade at a discount to ones that retire the structure later in the company's life.

The solution isn't banning companies with dual-class stock from the major indexes, as S&P did, Mr. Jackson said. That would hurt Main Street investors who invest through passive funds and stand to miss out on those companies' growth, he said.

Instead, he said in his first speech since joining the SEC, U.S. stock exchanges should force companies to retire their dual-class share structure after a period of time.

He declined to say how quickly that should happen, saying other critics have proposed ideas. "By giving investors more say in the governance of their companies, we can help protect them from managers who would misuse dual-class to extract value rather than build it," he said.

Exchanges, while regulated by the SEC, don't have to follow the recommendations of a single commissioner. Democratic SEC Commissioner Kara Stein also criticized dual-class shares in a speech this week, saying they disrupt the relationship that should exist between companies and shareholders.

Massachusetts Accuses Scottrade of Fiduciary Rule Violations

By Lisa Beilfuss

Massachusetts' top securities regulator has accused discount brokerage firm Scottrade Inc. of violating the U.S. Labor Department's fiduciary rule, the latest example of states stepping in as the federal government rethinks the retirement-savings regulation.

Scottrade, now a unit of TD Ameritrade Holding Corp., "knowingly violated the firm's impartial conduct standard" by holding at least two sales contests that affected retirement assets after the fiduciary rule went into partial effect June 9, 2017, Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin said Thursday. Mr. Galvin alleges "dishonest and unethical activity and failure to supervise."

Representatives for TD Ameritrade didn't immediately return requests for comment.

The retirement-savings regulation requires firms and financial advisers handling retirement money to put clients' efforts before their own. But much of the implementation of Obama-era regulation was delayed after President Donald Trump ordered a review of the fiduciary rule with an eye on revision or repeal. The rule's final compliance deadline was postponed to July 1, 2019.

"The secretary feels that since the federal government is unclear" on the future of the fiduciary rule, "the states have to step up and protect the people," a spokeswoman for Mr. Galvin said.

Massachusetts' action is the latest case of state regulators moving to bolster investor protections out of concern the Trump administration will weaken the federal rule. In recent months, the governors of Nevada and Connecticut signed bills to expand or amplify fiduciary requirements for brokers. Legislators in New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts have introduced similar bills. And several other states, including California, have indicated interest in exploring such requirements.

The Massachusetts complaint, which seeks a seeks a cease-and-desist order and an administrative fine, "may mark the start of a new chapter in the saga of the DOL's fiduciary rule," said Joshua Lichtenstein, an attorney at Ropes & Gray who focuses on employee benefits. The action "serves as a reminder" that there are compliance requirements despite the rule's future remaining unclear.

Big Borrowers Are Now Big Lenders

In the world of private deal making, the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-rise-of-private-assets-built-on-a-mountain-of-new-debt-1518695697" too. In recent years, private-equity firms have increasingly got into lending to buyouts, toond often to their own deals. Their credit businesses are adding to the huge growth in specialist private debt funds and retail money that has taken place in loan markets since the crisis.

The growth of debt operations at firms like Blackstone, KKR and Apollo is an important part of their expansion. They can manage loans in private-credit funds, special vehicles known as collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs, and listed business development companies, or BDCs.

Investors like loans because they have floating interest ratesnlike bonds, which have fixed rates. That means loan investors don't lose out when interest rates rise. But that can be bad for borrowers, who are hit by higher debt costs, especially if rates rise sharply.

Private equity's growing involvement in private debt can make things awkward if a company gets into trouble and a firm's credit and equity teams are on opposite sides of a workout. Industry executives say their credit funds are never the lead lender to their own companies: That should allow their credit funds to take a back seat to the biggest lenders in any talks and avoid conflicts of interest. But their investors may still end up unhappy with the outcome.

Gormley's Take: Startups See Opportunity in Medicare Advantage's Boom; Private alternative to original Medicare covers a third of people with Medicare### invalid font number 1

Medicare Advantage's explosive growth is creating opportunity for entrepreneurs.

In Medicare Advantage, an alternative to original Medicare, the government pays private insurers to cover Medicare benefits. Over the last decade Medicare Advantage enrollment has more than doubled to 19 million, and one-third of people with Medicare are now enrolled in these plans, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

That percentage will rise to 41% of Medicare beneficiaries in 2026, according to the foundation.

Medicare Advantage plans practice the value-based care model that is widely discussed but only gradually making its way into non-Medicare insurance. Medicare Advantage plans have incentive to lower costs because they keep the difference between what they spend on care and the amount they are paid. But they have to lower costs while still delivering quality care, which is reflected to the public through a star rating system.

Medicare Advantage plans can cover things that original Medicare doesn't, such as routine dental care. And to baby boomers, they generally feel more like the HMO they had with their employer, said Darren Schulte, chief executive of Apixio Inc., a health-care data-science startup serving Medicare Advantage plans.

Apixio, which began 2017 with 23 customers and now has 36, is one company benefiting from the program's rise. The San Mateo, Calif., company's ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
-based system helps these plans better represent the health status of their members so they can be reimbursed appropriately.

Startups that help health plans avoid unnecessary medical procedures can also profit from Medicare Advantage's growth, says David Friend, chief transformation officer of the BDO Center for Healthcare Excellence & Innovation. This could include technologies that predict health crises before they occur and tools that improve adherence to medication.

Medicare Advantage is "on the forefront of paying for value," Dr. Schulte says.

Congress Lacks Will to Overhaul Fannie and Freddie

A bipartisan group of Senate moderates works feverishly for months to craft a complex overhaul of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The lawmakers prod progressive Democrats and right-wing Republicans, but prove unable to generate support beyond a group of centrists. The bill clears a key Senate panel but ultimately faces obstacles from leadership more focused on the midterm elections.

These dynamics were in play the last time a group of Senate centrists sought to revamp Fannie and Freddie in 2014. The same scenes are being repeated this year"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fix-for-mortgage-giants-fannie-mae-freddie-mac-remains-on-back-burner-1505508211" to overhaul the mortgage-finance giants, which have been under government control for nearly 10 years.

"The effort has been met with resistance from both ends of the ideological spectrum and neither base has moved meaningfully toward the center given the combination of complex issues and a lack of legislative urgency," said Isaac Boltansky of Compass Point Research & Trading.

To be sure, some current and former congressional aides "https://www.wsj.com/articles/congress-to-tackle-dodd-frank-rollback-fannie-freddie-overhaul-1514853477", particularly because the Trump administration wants to accomplish something in this space. Notably, House Financial Services Committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) has shifted his views and now says he is now willing to consider an explicit federal guarantee on mortgage securities significant concession.

Still, no deal is imminent in the Senate, according to aides. And unlike in 2014, the House has yet to even introduce its own version of the legislation. A plan by Mr. Hensarling that would have liquidated Fannie and Freddie had at least passed the House in 2013.

Centrist Senate lawmakers say they continue to negotiate with their more-partisan colleagues and could win the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ackermans-take-fannie-freddie-overhaul-hinges-on-democrats-1516190202" needed to advance the bill through the chamber.

Yet some liberals say that "nothing done" is the best scenario for them, according to lobbyists and aides. They know that whatever legislation is signed into law will likely define the market for the next generation, and are willing to wait until they have a chance of controlling at least one of the chambers of Congress before striking a compromise.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

SEC Rejects Sale of Chicago Stock Exchange

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-rejects-sale-of-chicago-stock-exchange-1518738335" on Thursday rejected the sale of the Chicago Stock Exchange to a group that would have included Chinese investors, capping a two-year battle over a deal that sparked political opposition in Congress.

The SEC's commissioners voted against the transaction six months after the agency's staff recommended approving the sale. The decision is a rare move by the SEC to choose who isn't allowed to control a U.S. stock exchange, even one that handles less than 1% of trading volume.

Critics of the sale, including lawmakers from both parties, said letting a Chinese company take a major stake in a U.S. stock exchange would create a backdoor for the Chinese government to influence American financial infrastructure. The Chicago company repeatedly said the Chinese government wasn't involved in the deal, but a political fight erupted that prompted two of the initial Chinese investors to withdraw from the group in October.

Investors like loans because they have floating interest ratesnlike bonds, which have fixed rates. That means loan investors don't lose out when interest rates rise. But that can be bad for borrowers, who are hit by higher debt costs, especially if rates rise sharply.

Private equity's growing involvement in private debt can make things awkward if a company gets into trouble and a firm's credit and equity teams are on opposite sides of a workout. Industry executives say their credit funds are never the lead lender to their own companies: That should allow their credit funds to take a back seat to the biggest lenders in any talks and avoid conflicts of interest. But their investors may still end up unhappy with the outcome.

Global pharmaceutical company Roche has agreed to buy Flatiron Health, a start-up focused on using technology to improve cancer treatment, whose previous investors have included the venture capital arm of Google parent company Alphabet.

Roche had previously held a 12.6 per cent equity stake in Flatiron. The agreement announced on Thursday will see it acquire the remaining portion of the company, which will keep operating as a separate legal entity.

The deal is expected to close in the latter half of 2018.

Flatiron develops technology to help manage cancer treatments, as well as collecting and analysing data about the disease for researchers. Its founders, Nat Turner and Zach Weinberg, sold their previous start-up venture, Invite Media, to a Google subsidiary in 2010. They left to start Flatiron Health in 2012.

Google Venture, now known as GV he venture capital arm of Alphabet as among Flatiron backers, as were Roche and First Round Capital.

Roche chief executive Daniel Oay said:

his is an important step in our personalised healthcare strategy for Roche, as we believe that regulatory-grade real-world evidence is a key ingredient to accelerate the development of, and access to, new cancer treatments. As a leading technology company in oncology, Flatiron Health is best positioned to provide the technology and data ### invalid font number 2

 infrastructure needed not only for Roche, but for oncology research and development efforts across the entire industry.

Mr Turner said:

oche has been a tremendous partner to us over the past two years and shares our vision for building a learning healthcare platform in oncology ultimately designed to improve the lives of cancer patients. This important milestone will allow us to increase our investments in our provider-facing technology and services platform, as well as our evidence-generation platform, which will remain available to the entire healthcare industry.

Consumers Ramp Up Debt --- Credit cards and auto loans drive growth in borrowing as some banks tighten rules### invalid font number 1

Interest rates are on the rise, but that hasn't curbed Americans' appetite for consumer debt.

If anything, consumers are borrowing more on credit cards or through auto loans than they have in years, and lenders seeking growth are happy to oblige them.

Abe Schilling, a 33-year-old car salesman in Great Falls, Mont., said he signed up for more than five credit cards over the past year, from issuers including Capital One Financial Corp. and Discover Financial Services, after he received offers in the mail. He also took out a $36,000 loan to buy a new Jeep Grand Cherokee.

Mr. Schilling, who rents his home, said the offers have been arriving as his credit score has improved. He previously had dozens of collections and other negative marks on his credit reports after failing to pay back bills. With a steady income and months of debt counseling behind him, Mr. Schilling says he feels confident in his ability to pay for his debts.

So do plenty of other Americans. In the fourth quarter, consumer debt, excluding mortgages and other home loans, rose 5.5% from a year earlier to $3.82 trillion. That is the highest amountsince the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began tracking the data in 1999. Moreover, consumers' nonhousing debts accounted for just over 29% of their overall debt load, also the highest amount on record.

Many observers say they aren't worried yet. Their concerns about nonhousing credit are nascent because delinquencies are rising from historically low levels. Also, household debt including mortgages, the biggest category, barely edged up from the third quarter and remains well off the crisis-era highs as a percentage of U.S. economic output.

"In good times, people tend to take on a little more consumer credit because they think 'Well, my income looks good, my job looks very stable,' and when the economy turns down, they dial that back," said Tom Miller, professor of finance at Mississippi State University.

Still, there are signs that consumers' ability to handle these increased debt levels is getting strained. Student loans, the largest debt category consumers hold after mortgages, continue to have persistently high delinquencies.

Overall, households are paying about 5.8% of their disposable personal income to stay current on nonmortgage debts, according to third-quarter Federal Reserve data. This figure, which is at the highest level since the end of 2008, bottomed out at 4.9% in 2012.

An improving economy has fueled much of the growth in consumer borrowing. Low unemployment and rising confidence have increased consumers' appetite for big-ticket purchases and made lenders more willing to dole out larger loan balances while increasing credit-card limits. The boost to loan volume and balances has helped lift bank earnings and overall retail sales.

The shift to nonmortgage debt, including credit cards and personal loans, carries some drawbacks for consumers, including higher interest rates."This type of debt is problematic," said Cris deRitis, senior director and economist at Moody's ### invalid font number 2
Analytics### invalid font number 1
. "It should really be temporary," but for some consumers "it can be hard to get off that treadmill."

The boom in nonhousing consumer debt is in partthe result of lingering effects of the last recession that have kept many consumers from buying homes.

Some banks are tightening lending requirements in an effort to get in front of any problems. Discover's chief executive, David Nelms, said in October that the bank lowered spending limits on some of its credit cards and it is scaling back on some of the personal loans that it is originating.

The average charge-off rate for eight of the largest U.S. credit-card lenders by purchase volume was 3.25% in the fourth quarter, up 0.36 percentage point from a year earlier, marking the seventh straight quarter of year-over-year increases, according to Fitch Ratings.

Already, the average repayment period for loans issued to buy new cars hit a high of 69 months, according to third-quarter data from credit-reporting firm Experian PLC. Personal loans extended to consumers during the first half of last year averaged $6,285, according to the latest data from credit-reporting firm TransUnion, up 7.8% from a year earlier.

It was a miniature version of the annual meeting of Berkshire Hathaway, where Mr Munger is vice-chairman. But whereas at Berkshire Mr Munger acts as the laconic sidekick to Mr Buffett, here he had the floor to himself.

INSIDE BUSINESS ASIA

V isitors to the Hangzhou head office of Ant Financial are usually invited to contemplate a huge digital display with flashing lights that conveys the latest information on the financial unit of ecommerce group Alibaba, and update the figures for loans across China to small and medium companies and to individuals.

Among the data not displayed, however, is the amount the group is borrowing on China's Rmb1.53tn asset-backed securities market, where it is the largest borrower, accounting for 13.7 per cent of the total, according to UBS data. But Ant is not immune from the regulators' scrutiny. China's mounting debt has long raised alarms and prompted predictions of the sort of financial collapse that seized the US and was quickly transmitted around the world a decade ago.

The more immediate concern is that the regulatory response to widespread acknowledgment of financial risk could lead to an over-tightening. That, in turn, could trigger exactly the sort of crisis the authorities are trying to forestall. It could also impact on the wider economy as smaller companies are denied the credit they need to grow.

Not long ago, the regulatory approach was to encourage innovation, enabling new fintech companies to lend to smaller businesses and households given the reluctance of conservative state-owned banks to do so.

Only 40 per cent of 1bn Chinese adults have a credit history with a traditional financial institution, says Jason Bedford, an analyst at UBS in The speed and intensity of the clampdown has surprised many platforms Hong Kong. He adds that at the end of October, peer-topeer lenders accounted for Rmb 1.2tn in outstanding loans, up from almost zero in 2014. But regulators are tightening their grip in the face of mounting evidence of fraud and the fear of a new kind of circular debt, freezing the activity of those lenders that have not already been closed.

As the year of the dog approaches, internet finance companies have been asked to engage in a seasonal campaign of "self inspection", another indication of China's changing regulatory landscape.

Executives at Shenzhen-based Ping An, an insurer that evolved first into a financial conglomerate and then a leader in ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
 and ### invalid font number 2
big data### invalid font number 1
, fear that their borrowers are receiving money simply to pay back other lenders. To avoid that, they spend considerable time compiling information from the phone and WeChat habits of their customers. But few internet finance companies have risk management capabilities even remotely comparable to those of Ping An.

'Regulators used to be reactive.

Nowthey're The speed and intensity of the clampdown has taken many internet financial platforms by surprise. For example, Shanghai-based Dianrong, which has investors including one of Alibaba founder Jack Ma's family offices, the private equity completely proactive' arm of Standard Chartered and the Government of Singapore Investment Corp, has not been allowed to do much since last June, says one of its founders, Kevin Guo. That makes it unlikely the company will be able to go public any time soon, as its founders had hoped.

"The regulators used to be reactive," says Mr Guo. "Now they have become completely proactive."

Some worry that the potential damage stemming from the credit crunch for small businesses and the shuttering of numerous fintech institutions could lead to something far worse: a miscalculation that could trigger panic and contagion affecting high-quality financial companies as well.

For example, at one point last year regulators barred Anbang Insurance from selling wealth management products disguised as insurance policies. But they soon reversed course when they realised that if Anbang couldn't fund itself it would collapse, giving rise to even greater difficulties.

This was supposed to be a year in which a new generation of companies at the intersection of finance and technology would command ever higher valuations. So far, indications suggest that those hopes are likely to prove over-optimistic.

Corrections & Amplifications

With the acquisition of Global X, Mirae Asset Global Investment will have $30 billion in ETF assets under management. An earlier version of this story incorrectly said the assets of Mirae Asset Global Investments, the asset-management business of Mirae Asset Financial Group, had assets of $30 billion. (Feb. 14)

Global X, a U.S. ETF issuer with $10.2 billion in assets as of Jan. 31, is being acquired by Mirae Asset Global Investments, both companies announced Tuesday.

Terms of the deal weren't disclosed. Mirae will acquire complete control of Global X, including the minority stake purchased by JPMorgan Chase & Co. in 2016.

With the acquisition of Global X, Mirae, a financial firm based in Seoul, will have $30 billion in ETF assets under management.

Mirae will also gain a presence in the fast-growing $3 trillion U.S. ETF market, adding to its Horizons ETF lineup in Canada, BetaShares in Australia and Tiger ETFs in Asia. The U.S. funds will retain the Global X name.

Global X's ETF assets have more than doubled in the past year, according to FactSet. Its largest fund is the $2.1 billion Global X Robotics & ### invalid font number 2
Artificial Intelligence### invalid font number 1
 ETF, which trades under the ticker BOTZ.

"There are not a lot of independent ETF providers out there, and certainly not ones growing at this fast a pace," said Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research for CFRA, a New York research firm. "Global X has positioned themselves well to benefit from thematic investing, and they've had a couple of superstar products."

At current asset levels and prices, Global X's annual revenue is about $57.6 million, according to data compiled by FactSet.

ETF firms generally sell for eight to 12 times annual revenue, said Dave Nadig, chief executive officer of ETF.com. That would put Global X's sale price at about $460 million to $690 million.

"I could not be more delighted to find a partner such as Mirae Asset to bring this business to its next stage of its growth," said Bruno del Ama, co-founder of Global X, in a press release announcing the deal.

Mulvaney Under Spotlight on Equifax Probe

Mick Mulvaney, acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, has been under fire from Democrats and consumer advocates since a news report this month suggested that the agency had pulled back from its investigation into last year's Equifax Inc. data breach.

CFPB officials have declined to clarify the bureau's position, citing the need to stay quiet about investigative matters. Expect to get some clarity from the agency chief this week.

Mr. Mulvaney, who is also the White House budget director, is scheduled to testify before the Senate and House budget committees Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively. While his main topic is the Trump administration's 2019 budget plan, he will likely be grilled by Democrats over changes to the CFPB, including the status of the Equifax probe.

Last week, over 30 Democratic senators signed a letter to Mr. Mulvaney, expressing concerns about the Reuters report that the CFPB may have halted its probe into Equifax.

On Sunday, Mr. Mulvaney gave some hints on CBS's "Face the Nation," suggesting the agency might be taking a different approach to the probe rather than ditching it.

Mr. Mulvaney urged people to watch for Equifax's coming 10-Q quarterly disclosure form to the Securities and Exchange Commission to check for changes in the investigations it faces. In the previous form released in November, the credit-rating firm cited the CFPB as among a long list of federal and state agencies looking into the data breach.

He then emphasized the bureau's priorities in consumer protection hadn't changed since he took over in November. "We want to run the place with a good deal of humility and prudence," he said. "We are not being aggressive. We are not pushing the envelope. We are taking a different attitude toward the job but our priorities have not changed."

"Not pushing the envelope," an expression Mr. Mulvaney has used repeatedly in recent weeks to describe the CFPB's new enforcement stance, may hold the key to understanding the Equifax probe.

Experts familiar with the investigation say that while the CFPB certainly has jurisdiction over the credit-reporting industry, there is a question about whether it has the authority to investigate data-breach cases specifically. The Federal Trade Commission is the main cop on that beat.

In Sunday's interview, Mr. Mulvaney pledged the CFPB would protect consumers from "fraud, unfair and deceptive trade practices, things that are illegal." What that entails will become clearer when the agency gives more guidance on its Equifax probe.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Trump Administration Proposes Fees for Futures Industry

By Gabriel T. Rubin

WASHINGTONhe White House on Monday proposed levying fees on derivatives users to bolster the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's 2019 budget, an idea that may be dead on arrival because of industry opposition.

Moreover, leaders at the CFTC also are opposed to the funding idea.

The Trump administration's fiscal year 2019 budget calls for keeping the CFTC's budget appropriations flat at $250 million, but would add an additional $31.5 million in funding from a fee on some firms that participate in derivatives markets. The CFTC currently lacks the authority to collect such feesnlike its larger market regulator counterpart, the Securities and Exchange Commissionnd would require Congress to act to change its funding rules.

The budget proposal is a compromise with CFTC Chairman J. Christopher Giancarlo, a Trump-appointed Republican, who has been lobbying for additional funding but has publicly opposed fees on derivatives transactions. At a House Appropriations Committee hearing last year, he argued that market participants must already pay transaction fees to self-regulatory organizations and that additional costs could have a negative impact on liquidity.

"As the chairman has long maintained, a budget of $281.5 million will allow the Commission to effectively accomplish its mission, by providing increased resources for economic analysis, examinations of clearinghouses, cybersecurity, fintech, and enforcement," said CFTC spokeswoman Erica Richardson.

The fees would be assessed on derivatives users for activities such as product registration and reimbursing regulators for examinations and supervision.

CFTC discussions with the White House kept new fees out of the administration's 2018 budget request, according to people familiar with the matter. But disagreements over the proper level of funding for the agency led the CFTC to submit its own budget request to Congress, alongside the White House's request to keep the agency stuck at $250 million for the fourth straight year. Congressional Republicans largely vowed to ignore the CFTC's request, which Mr. Giancarlo said was necessary to fund a new technology initiative and hire more economists, among other priorities.

Industry giants such as CME Group Inc. have long opposed CFTC user fees. As the dominant futures exchange, CME has raised its own internal user fees several times in recent years, but has pushed back on proposals to fund the CFTC with similar levies.

Relying on user fees to fund the CFTC is "not a smart thing to do," said Terry Duffy, CME's chairman and CEO, at a 2014 Senate hearing. At the time, Congress was considering a proposal to fund the CFTC in the same fashion as the SEC, where congressional appropriations are fully offset by fees.

CME declined to comment Monday.

The 700-employee CFTC has repeatedly pressed for more funding, citing its expanded responsibilities from the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.

CFPB's Mission Overhauled; White House Proposes Budget Cuts

By Yuka Hayashi

WASHINGTONhe Trump administration on Monday further detailed its vision to change the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, proposing that the regulator get less funding and fewer enforcement powers along with an overhauled mission that is friendlier to companies.

In the CFPB's new five-year strategic plan, the administration articulated the thinking behind the changes in its enforcement and rulemaking policies being pursued under Mick Mulvaney, a longtime CFPB critic now serving as its interim director.

Separately, the White House budget plan unveiled Monday proposed sharply reducing the CFPB's budget for the next two years and restricting the agency's enforcement authority to "prevent actions that unduly burden the financial industry and consumer choice."

The budget plan calls for capping the CFPB's budget at $485 million for fiscal year 2019, which starts this Octobern amount equivalent to the 2015 levelnd $610 million for fiscal 2020. The CFPB's final budget requested under its Obama-appointed leadership was $630.4 million for fiscal 2018.

The White House said the two-year "restructuring period" would help impose "financial discipline" and "reduce wasteful spending."

In the latest strategic plan's introduction, Mr. Mulvaney wrote that the bureau is committed to fulfilling its responsibilities set under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law that established the CFPB in 2011, but it would "go no further."

He said "pushing the envelope" would no longer happen, voicing implicit criticism of the agency's Obama-era leadership that used novel legal interpretations and tactics to oversee the financial industry. The CFPB's aggressive approach under former Director Richard Cordray was praised by Democrats and consumer advocates but often created friction with financial companies that saw the agency as overreaching.

Mr. Mulvaney has implemented various changes at the agency, including reconsidering an Obama-era regulation affecting payday lenders and shelving some enforcement cases. He also recently requested a $0 budget for the January-March quarter, saying the bureau would draw down reserves instead.

The administration's budget plan also aims to subject the agency to a legislative overhaul starting in fiscal 2020, and bring its budget under congressional oversight. The CFPB is an independent agency that is currently funded by the Federal Reserve.

"Trump's budget proposal would harm American consumers, hurt our nation's communities and wipe out financial reforms that are in place to prevent another financial crisis," Rep. Maxine Waters, the top Democrat on the House Financial Services Committee, said in a statement.

The shift in the agency's stance was spelled out throughout the 16-page strategic document.

Under the new plan, the No.1 goal for the bureau is to ensure that "all consumers have access to markets for consumer financial products and services." In the previous plan published in 2013, the priority was to "prevent financial harm to consumers while promoting good practices that benefit them."

The new vision seeks "Free, innovative, competitive, and transparent consumer finance markets where the rights of all parties are protected by the rule of law." That contrasts with the previous vision for an agency "that helps consumers finance markets work by making rules more effective, by consistently and fairly enforcing those rules, and by empowering consumers to take more control over their economic lives."

Equifax Hires Jamil Farshchi as Chief Information Security Officer

By AnnaMaria Andriotis

Equifax Inc. said it has hired a new chief information security officer to help with the company's overhaul of its security in the wake of its massive breach last year.

Equifax said Monday that it hired Jamil Farshchi, as its new CISO. In this role, Mr. Farshchi will be responsible for transforming the company's information security. He was previously CISO at Home Depot Inc. and held similar roles at Time Warner Inc. and Visa Inc.

He will report to the company's chief executive Paulino do Rego Barros Jr. who currently holds that position on an interim basis.

Mr. Barros said in a company statement that Equifax is confident Mr. Farshchi "possesses the talent and skill set needed to continue our journey toward developing industry-leading security practices and, ultimately, to help us regain trust with consumers and customers."

The company in September disclosed that it had been breached and that personal information for 145.5 million Americans had been compromised. A few weeks later, several executives, including the then chief security officer and chief information officer, retired. The company's then chief Richard Smith retired soon after, too.

Mr. Farshchi became CISO at Home Depot in 2015, several months after the company confirmed a massive breach to its payment systems. That breach resulted in stolen email and credit-card information that impacted millions of customers.

Before that, Mr. Farshchi was the global chief information security officer at Time Warner. He was also vice president of global information security at card network Visa where he led efforts on mobile security and ### invalid font number 2

, according to the Equifax announcement.

"Equifax is a company with tremendous potential, and I am confident that we will transform our security program into one of the most advanced and recognized globally," said Mr. Farshchi in the statement announcing his appointment.

Market Volatility Strikes Exchange-Traded Products, Alarming Investors and Regulators

By Asjylyn Loder and Dave Michaels

The recent implosion of two exchange-traded products is renewing questions about the impact of fast-growing passive funds on the markets they are meant to track.

While exchange-traded funds have lowered the cost of investing and given individuals access to strategies once reserved for hedge funds and multibillion-dollar pensions, the $5 trillion global industry has ventured into complex strategies, sometimes with disastrous results.

The latest example came on the evening of Feb. 5, as ETPs that bet against Wall Street's fear gauge lost more than 80% of their value. The strategy has been a popular moneymaker in recent years as stocks marched steadily higher, keeping the Cboe Volatility Index, known as the VIX, at near-record lows.

That calm was shattered when the S&P 500 plummeted 4.1%, erasing nearly $1 trillion in market capitalization. The VIX surged, triggering steep losses in ETPs that had bet that the VIX would fall.

The next morning, Japanese securities firm Nomura Holdings Inc. and Swiss bank Credit Suisse Group AG said they would close two ETPs, the Nomura S&P 500 VIX Inverse ETN and the VelocityShares Daily Inverse VIX Short Term ETN, respectively. U.S. exchanges temporarily halted trading in similar ETPs.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has started examining the market mayhem, calling Credit Suisse on Tuesday and questioning the bank about its ETP, according to two people familiar with the matter.

Regulatory officials asked about how the investment's performance is calculated and whether retail investors were shareholders, one of the people said. The bank, which said it would shut down the ETP on Feb. 21, declined to comment.

Early indications are that the short-volatility products performed exactly as they were designed to amid Monday's market swings, but that is little comfort to investors who watched their money vanish.

Nick Ravo, a 62-year-old investor in Edmonds, Wash., said he had been betting against volatility for nearly two years and it has been largely profitable. He owned the Credit Suisse product in his retirement account on Feb. 5 and watched as the product lost nearly all of its value overnight.

Regulators have raised questions before about whether VIX exchange-traded products are suitable for retail investors. Wells Fargo & Co. agreed in October to pay more than $3.4 million to settle claims that it sold volatility-linked ETPs to customers who didn't understand them. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority said Wells Fargo made the products available to retail customers without restriction from 2009 to 2012, and some clients "incurred significant losses."

"You will see more pressure on clearer and cleaner disclosure of complex products, and more scrutiny on firms about how they train their representatives to responsibly sell them," said Michael Osnato, a former senior enforcement official at the SEC now in private practice at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP.

The big ETF firms moved quickly to distance themselves from the products that foundered last week. BlackRock Inc., the largest U.S. ETF firm by assets, published a blog post Wednesday from Martin Small, head of the firm's U.S. iShares ETF business, warning investors not to confuse its funds with the complicated products that were nearly wiped out Monday night.

"As the recent market volatility made clear, there's a big difference between plain vanilla ETFs and leveraged products making big bets with big risks," Mr. Small wrote.

In recent years, investors and analysts have blamed ETFs for roiling markets for oil, gold-mining companies and high-yield debt. Last year, a flood of cash into a triple-leveraged ETF triggered price gyrations in gold stocks from Toronto to Sydney. In September 2016, the Bank of Japan curbed its purchases of ETFs pegged to the Nikkei 225 index after its buying distorted prices. Some investors say it is a matter of time before that happens again.

"When ETFs become so large relative to the size of the market, they can have a big impact on the way up and the way down," said Peter Tchir, macro-investing strategist at Academy Securities LLC in New York.

Deutsche Bank to Pay $4.4 Million Over Traders Who Misled on Bonds

By Dave Michaels

WASHINGTONDeutsche Bank AG agreed to pay more than $4.4 million to settle regulatory claims that it failed to supervise traders who misled customers about the price of commercial mortgage bonds.

The Securities and Exchange Commission said Monday that the payment includes $3.7 million to reimburse clients that traded with the German bank, which also will pay a $750,000 civil penalty. Deutsche Bank's traders generated illicit profits by misleading customers from 2011 to 2015 about the prices they paid to acquire the securities, which allowed them to sell the bonds at higher prices, the SEC said.

The bank's former global head of securitized products trading, Ben Solomon, agreed to a one-year ban from the securities industry and will pay a $165,000 penalty, the SEC said. Mr. Solomon, 42 years old, was fired over the alleged misconduct in August 2015.

'"Deutsche Bank and Solomon failed to keep watch as traders generated profits for the firm at the expense of CMBS customers by misrepresenting purchase prices and other important details," said Daniel Michael, the head of the SEC's complex financial instruments unit.

A spokesman for Deutsche Bank said the bank "cooperated extensively with the SEC's investigation and took appropriate disciplinary action, including termination in some instances."

Barclays Hit by New Charge Over 2008 Emergency Fundraising

By Max Colchester

LONDONarclays BCS 0.47% PLC was charged for a second time by U.K. authorities over a criminal case relating to an emergency fundraising in 2008 from Middle Eastern investors.

The Serious Fraud Office levied charges of unlawful financial assistance against Barclays' operating company Monday, a move that ramps up pressure on the British lender ahead of a landmark trial.

Last summer U.K. authorities charged Barclays over a $3 billion loan it made to Middle Eastern investors as the bank struggled amid the financial crisis in 2008. The British prosecutors had said the funds were then plowed back into Barclays to recapitalize it. Barclays has previously denied the allegations.

Those initial charges were made against the bank's holding company. The new charge is significant as the operating company, Barclays Bank PLC, holds the lender's banking licenses. Regulators must deem the subsidiary to be "fit and proper" to keep those licenses. If found guilty, Barclays could, in theory, be at risk of losing its banking licenses.

In a statement Barclays said it would defend itself against the charges. The bank added that it didn't expect there to be any impact on its "ability to serve" customers. The bank hasn't said whether it would plead guilty or not against the charges.

Other European banks including France's BNP Paribas SA and Credit Suisse Group AG have in the past pleaded guilty to criminal charges without any lasting impact. Credit Suisse's settlement with U.S. authorities for aiding tax evasion didn't result in it losing any licenses. BNP Paribas was banned for a year from dollar clearing after pleading guilty to dealing with sanctioned countries. However, in the U.K. no major bank has recently been found guilty of a criminal charge, so the outcome of such a decision is unclear.

The SFO case has sucked in a cadre of former Barclays' executives who helped structure the deal at the height of the crisis which allowed the British bank to avoid being bailed out by taxpayers. The SFO has spent years probing how Barclays managed to woo Qatari investors to pump funds into the struggling bank. In particular what the purpose was of £22 million in "advisory services" that bank paid to Qatari investors.

British prosecutors last summer charged the former chief executive of Barclays with fraud and illegal payments along with three other former executives. It is the first time a chief executive of a major British bank faces criminal charges for actions taken during the financial crisis.

A date for the trial is expected to be set soon.

New Loans by Chinese Banks Hit Record High in January

By Lingling Wei

BEIJINGhinese banks logged a record amount of new loans in January, as the government's effort to contain financial risks caused a shift toward traditional lending from murkier forms of financing.

While credit growth slowed overall, new bank loans hit 2.9 trillion yuan ($461 billion) last month, up 43% from a year earlier, according to data released Monday by the central bank. Total social financing, a catchall term for various forms of credit that, in addition to bank loans includes bonds and other types of nonbank lending, increased 3.06 trillion yuan, a drop of 17% from the growth in the year-earlier period. Bank loans accounted for 88% of all new credit.

Rather than reflecting a new round of government stimulus, the unexpected increase in bank credit was primarily driven by banks bringing loans back onto their books to heed regulators' demands, economists and analysts say. At the same time, businesses also increased their appetite for bank loans as other forms of financing became harder to come by. In addition, Chinese banks tend to dole out more credit at the beginning of the year.

"This is an absolute monstrous number no matter how you look at it," said Christopher Balding, an economics professor at Peking University. The 2.9 trillion yuan in January lending represented almost 60% of all credit extended in 2008, when China was launching a large stimulus program to shield the economy from the global financial crisis.

The jump in bank loans was well above forecasts by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal for 2.15 trillion yuan and underscores policy makers' tough balancing act. Over the past two years, President Xi Jinping and his economic officials have made reducing ballooning debt levels a centerpiece of economic policy. But with the leadership pursuing a growth target many have viewed as too high, state companies and local governments have kept borrowing to expand.

Now, there is a realization within the government that it is in fact impossible for China to cut debt levels or cease relying on bank financing without hurting growth. As a result, the goal to deleverage, as written in the nation's economic plans for the past two years, has been softened into a mission to control the growth of debt this year.

In recent months, the central government has been calling a halt to new projects in the construction of subway systems all over the country, including two separate, $4 billion subway projects in Inner Mongolia.

Those and other measures aimed at controlling borrowing by localities could cause debt growth to slow this year, said Larry Hu, China economist at Macquarie Group. That, in turn, could lead to weaker economic expansion, he added.

"If policy makers still want to maintain growth, they have to boost government investment, which would then run counter to their deleveraging efforts," Mr. Hu said.

So far, authorities have focused efforts on clamping down on risks in the financial sector. In particular, they are targeting a rampant practice under which banks team up with outside financial firms to move loans off their balance sheets and then peddle them as high-yielding investments to individual savers. Such a strategyspecially popular at small and midsize banksas helped free up bank capital and made it easier to extend loan deadlines or new credit.

But that has created a parallel buildup of debt and made the financial system more vulnerable to shocks such as a liquidity crunch. To stem the risks, regulators since last year have been forcing banks to come clean on off-book lending, cut back on short-term borrowing and adopt more rigorous risk controls.

As these measures have caused banks to bring loans back onto their balance sheet, many lenders are starting to worry about a potential shortage of capital to cushion against potential loan losses. That is a big reason many Chinese banks are pushing back against a new proposal intended to control off-book lending.

"It's really tough for banks these days," said an executive at a national lender based in northern China.

European Countries Woo London Bankers With Lower Taxes

By Max Colchester

Are you a London banker looking to move to a tax-friendly locale after Brexit?

How about&aris!

Some of Europe's most legendary tax-heavy countriesmong them France and Italyre cutting special deals to woo rich expats with the promise of smaller personal tax bills. (Read more about the tax breaks, here).

KPMG LLP calculated the personal tax bill of a hypothetical expatriate earning ¬50,000 ($306,000) a year in five European countriesrance, Spain, Ireland, Germany and the Netherlandsor The Wall Street Journal. The results show that in all of them the expat would pay less in income tax and social-security charges than he or she would in the U. K.

The savings aren't trivial. An expat living in France earning ¬50,000 could take home an extra ¬7,588 after tax and charges compared with one living in the U.K., according to the calculations. That extra pay climbs to ¬2,545 in Spain if all the tax breaks are applied. Even Germany, which doesn't have an expat regime, leaves the worker some ¬,500 better off than in Britain.

The findings counter a widely held view that the U.K. is an attractively taxed island in Europe's sea of suffocating taxes. "What is less well understood is how significant the incentives and other special treatments that some locations offer can be," said Christopher Cowell, a partner at KPMG.

London's legion of foreign financiers is taking note. International banks in the U.K. are forming plans to bulk up in cities across the EU so that they can continue selling products to clients based there after Brexit. Around 10,000 finance jobs in Britain may disappear when the U.K. quits the EU, according to an estimate by the Bank of England.

Across Europe, fiscal red carpets are being rolled out in preparation.

Take France. In 2012, the French president at the time, Françis Hollande, called finance the "enemy" and imposed a wealth tax. But soon after the U.K. voted for Brexit, Mr. Hollande's government extended rules that allow employees recruited abroad to claim 30% of their salary as an "impatriate premium," which is income-tax free for up to eight years. There are further tax rebates including those for days worked outside France. In total, expats based in France can get up to half of their salary exempted from income tax.

The French aren't alone. In Spain, expats pay a special 24% tax rate on earnings up to ¬00,000. The Dutch allow 30% of salary to be paid as an income-tax-free expatriate allowance. In Ireland, the tax-exemption deal extends to children's school fees. The Belgians allow expats to deduct the cost of decorating their new house from their tax bill. Last year, Italy unveiled a deal that doles out a 50% tax break to skilled workers coming from abroad. The U.K. by comparison doesn't offer many such generous income-tax breaks to foreigners domiciled there, advisers say.

Conditions and time limits apply to the European tax sweeteners. In France, for instance, to qualify you need to have lived abroad for the last five years. In Spain, you have to be paid from an entity outside the country to get a lower tax rate, which can prove tricky to structure. The Irish need expats to earn at least ¬5,000 a year to get the tax breaks. In the Netherlands, you can't have been living within 150 kilometers of the Dutch border within the last 16 months (which bizarrely means that some people residing on the U.K.'s south coast aren't eligible). Another issue to consider in the Netherlands is a cap on bonuses for bankers.

And to be sure the sweet deals are for personal tax, not corporate tax. The U.K.'s corporate tax rate is lower than, say, France's. Labor laws also are far more stringent in countries such as Germany than the U.K. That has made some companies think twice about relocating big chunks of business into the continent.

Finally, money isn't everything. Factors such as language and the availability of private-school seats also play an important role in deciding whether to move abroad. But the lower tax rate is making it easier to convince staffers to give up London for another European city, bank executives say.

"When I say o and live in Paris for a few years and pay less tax,' people suddenly aren't so skeptical," says one senior U.S. banker in London.

Nevada Regulator Starts Website to Field Tips About Steve Wynn

By Chris Kirkham and Kate O'Keeffe

Nevada gambling regulators introduced a new online system for the public to send in confidential complaints and tips after receiving a number of reports about Steve Wynn in the days after The Wall Street Journal published an article detailing sexual-misconduct allegations against the casino mogul.

Becky Harris, chairwoman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, said the goal of the system is to have "a more efficient, more effective way for the public to communicate with the board." Ms. Harris, who became chairwoman on Jan. 22, four days before the Journal article on Mr. Wynn, said it quickly became apparent that an upgrade was needed, based on the deluge of phone calls, emails and traditional mail.

"It was disruptive," she said. "It was a challenge to conduct the necessary business of the board."

Michael Weaver, a spokesman for Wynn Resorts Ltd. and Mr. Wynn, said the company had no comment.

The new online system, which went live Monday afternoon on the gaming control board's website, is expected to allow anyone who wants to send information to leave comments that will be directed to the appropriate investigators. Ms. Harris said the site would be checked regularly and if there are additional questions, "people can expect to receive a returned phone call."

All communications will remain confidential in the system.

While the idea resulted from the volume of calls related to Mr. Wynn, Ms. Harris said, the online system is meant to be a channel for any case the board is investigating. "This is a process that will remain in place from this point forward," she said.

The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, which has also received multiple complaints about Mr. Wynn in the wake of the Journal story, according to a person familiar with the matter, is coordinating with the gambling regulator and running point on any reports that could potentially involve criminal allegations.

A spokesman for the department said in a Monday statement that it has received two sexual-assault complaints against Mr. Wynn since the Journal investigation was published. One woman made a report from St. Louis, alleging that Mr. Wynn sexually assaulted her in Las Vegas in the 1970s, according to the police department spokesman, Larry Hadfield. He declined to elaborate on the woman's allegations and added that the police couldn't move forward with the investigation since it wasn't reported within the 20-year statute of limitations for sexual assault.

A second woman filed a report a week later in person at a police substation in Las Vegas, alleging that Mr. Wynn had assaulted her in Chicago, also in the 1970s, the spokesman said. He declined to elaborate on that complaint, either, and added that Las Vegas police took a courtesy report and will forward the information to Chicago authorities.

Mr. Wynn stepped down last week as chairman and chief executive of Wynn Resorts, citing "an avalanche of negative publicity" in the wake of the Journal investigation.

Dozens of people the Journal interviewed who have worked at Mr. Wynn's casinos told of behavior that cumulatively would amount to a decadeslong pattern of sexual misconduct by Mr. Wynn, including pressuring employees to perform sex acts. Mr. Wynn has blamed his ex-wife, Elaine Wynn, for instigating the allegations and said, "The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous."

Ms. Wynn has consistently declined to speak to the Journal. An attorney for Ms. Wynn has said the notion she instigated the Journal's article "is just not true."

The Wynns remain embroiled in long-running litigation over restrictions on her right to sell her 9% stake in Wynn Resorts.

Gambling regulators in Nevada and Massachusetts, where Wynn Resorts is building a $2.4 billion casino, have opened investigations since the Journal first reported the allegations in late January, and both have said they would continue those probes despite Mr. Wynn's resignation last week.

Mr. Wynn still has a 12% stake in Wynn Resorts and as a result is subject to Nevada casino licensing regulations.

At a public meeting last week, Massachusetts gambling officials raised questions with implications for Wynn Resorts board members and other executives who could have been in a position to know about Mr. Wynn's alleged misdeeds and didn't report them.

The Wynn Resorts board pledged to investigate the allegations against Mr. Wynn, but last week it cut ties with an outside law firm, O'Melveny & Myers LLP, that had been hired just days earlier to assist. In a statement, the board's "special committee" to investigate the allegations said it "no longer required the services" of the law firm after Mr. Wynn resigned. On Monday the special committee announced it was giving the assignment to a new law firm, Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP, which has longstanding connections to the casino company.

Mr. Weaver, the Wynn Resorts corporate spokesman who is also representing the board and the special committee, didn't answer questions about why Mr. Wynn's departure led to the board's decision to terminate the outside law firm's investigation. He also didn't say what the board committee would be investigating, or how they would be conducting the investigation, beyond a statement that the investigation "will be detailed and thorough."

Company officials have been reaching out to some former female employees as part of an investigation the company itself is conducting, separate from the board's, according to people with knowledge of the matter. One former Wynn executive, Kevin Tourek, was brought on to work with the company in December, after the Journal started reaching out to former employees about Mr. Wynn's behavior, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Mr. Tourek has been making calls to former employees as part of the company's investigation, according to people briefed on the matter.

Mr. Tourek didn't return calls requesting comment.

Mr. Weaver said Mr. Tourek is working with the company but declined to answer additional questions about Mr. Tourek's role.

Bitcoin's Energy Drain

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/rural-washington-is-a-hot-spot-for-bitcoin-miners-1518354001" to generate new units of cryptocurrencies process that requires vast amounts of electricity to run and cool thousands of machines. That has become a dilemma for utilities that are figuring out how to deal with the deluge of requests without bearing the brunt of wild swings in cryptocurrency prices.

Mining operations can squeeze into small spaces, and they run servers constantly, which can strain electrical systems that aren't built for such heavy use. If all the cryptocurrency mining operations in the works go forward, power demand could double in some areas and require expensive new infrastructure.

There are already at least 30 known cryptocurrency-mining operations in Chelan, Grant and Douglas counties in central Washington, which has some of the cheapest power in the U.S. Four of the mining inquiries that Chelan County's utility has received since October are for 100 megawatts each. That is enough power for more than 50 hospitals, and building the infrastructure for each mine could cost more than $40 million.

Stricter Bank Supervision Brings More Lending

Joã Granja and Christian Leuz analyze in "http://papers.nber.org/tmp/69625-w24168.pdf" how strict supervision of banks affects lending and local business activity. They study the impact of the elimination of the Office of Thrift Supervision in 2011 after the financial crisis and "find stricter supervision operates not only through capital but can also overcome frictions in bank management, leading to more lending and a reallocation of loans. Consistent with the latter, we find increases in business entry and exit in counties with greater expose to OTS banks."

Leave Bank Leverage Ratios Alone

Lawmakers who want to weaken banks' capital standards have forgotten the lessons of the 2008 financial crisis, Sheila Bair writes in a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/congress-flirts-with-disaster-on-bank-leverage-ratios-1518479068". Ms. Bair, who was head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. from 2006 to 2011, argues against relaxing the "modest constraint on leverage" called the supplemental leverage ratio. "It would be the height of irresponsibility for Congress to loosen capital requirements now, when big banks need to prepare for rough times that may lie ahead," she writes.

Fannie-Freddie Overhaul Plan Puts Shareholders at Risk

A Senate plan to dismantle government-sponsored mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and shift its business to the private sector could take 10 years or more, during which time stockholders "would remain in financial limbo," Tim Pagliara of CapWealth Advisors LLC writes in a "https://morningconsult.com/opinions/corker-warner-bill-would-perpetuate-fannie-and-freddies-limbo/". A "more prudent course" would continue efforts to reduce Fannie and Freddie's investment portfolios and let them restore capital reserves, he says. "While this course of action alone would not forever shield taxpayers from having to cover losses during severe downturns, it would be far less risk than making the taxpayer responsible for all the mortgage-backed securities the still-unknown successors to [Fannie and Freddie] would issue," he writes.

INTERVIEW

Client trust badly hit by the Wells Fargo bogus accounts affair, admits Nico Marais bogus accounts affair, admits

Nicolaas Marais is under no illusions about the scale of the task confronting Wells Fargo.

He joined the US bank's $504bn asset management arm in February 2017. This was after the hugely damaging admission by Wells, the third-largest US lender, that its staff had created up to 3.5m bogus customer accounts to meet sales targets.

That scandal led to the departure of the chief executive John Stumpf, a boardroom shake-up and the imposition this month of unprecedented sanctions by the Federal Reserve, which barred the bank from increasing its asset pool until governance improvements are made.

Mr Marais, known as Nico, describes colleagues as "shocked and upset " by the scandal.

The asset management unit was not involved in the fraud and is not restricted from growing its assets but Mr Marais readily acknowledges the daunting challenge of repairing trust among clients.

"We will have to work very hard, client by client, mandate by mandate. But talking about this is not enough," says the 54-year old.

"We know that we have to prove our worth to clients."

Mr Marais adds that Wells Fargo's $1.9tn broader wealth and investment management division, of which WFAM is a part, has continued to grow in spite of the problems at the parent bank.

A veteran who has worked for almost three decades in finance, Mr Marais started his career as a gold trader for South Africa's central bank before moving on to a series of investment roles for the World Bank. He joined Barclays Global Investors in 2000, the business that was sold by the UK bank in late 2009 to Black-Rock, the world's largest asset manager.

It was while working at BGI that Mr Marais first met Kristi Mitchem, who was appointed chief executive of WFAM in April 2016.

Ms Mitchem later played an important role in persuading Mr Marais to move from Schroders, where he oversaw $118bn as head of multi-asset investments and portfolio solutions.

Speaking during a recent visit to London, he is generous in his praise of Ms Mitchem, describing her as "one of the most dynamic leaders I have ever worked with", and insisting that he has never before enjoyed such a "positive work culture".

"The lack of politics has been refreshing," he says. "Decision-making can happen at lightning speed at the management team level because we trust each other."

WFAM employs more than 500 investment professionals, spread across 29 autonomous teams. But Mr Marais boils asset management down to three essential functions that respond to the needs of his own family.

"We protect wealth, that's my 87-year-old dad, or we grow wealth, that's my 21-year-old son, or we pay income. That's it," he says, with a mild Johannesburg accent.

Wells Fargo moved its asset management activities into a separate unit within its broader wealth and investment management division as part of a re-organisation in 2015.

But in spite of strongly favourable market movements over the past two years, assets run by WFAM have increased by just $24bn since the 2015 re-organisation, as some clients have chosen to switch into low-cost passive funds.

Along with every US money manager, WFAM is facing intense competition from the leading passive fund providers BlackRock and Vanguard, which has led to downward pressure on fees across the entire investment industry.

"Asset managers historically have been quite insulated from some of the price competition that we see across other industries. But there is nothing wrong with fee pressure. It is just a question of how to structure a business to deal with that challenge," he says.

Along with his role as head of multiasset class solutions, Mr Marais is also responsible for overseeing new product research and development, an area where he believes WFAM should focus on "thought leadership" rather than following rivals that have rushed into launching "me too" low-cost index-tracking funds.

"I'm in the jewellery business, not the mining industry," he says, adding that a hard division between active management strategies and passive index trackers is "not really the point" for most investors.

"I'm agnostic about the choice between active versus passive as long as the strategy serves what the client wants," he says.

WFAM has been expanding its quantitative investment capabilities following the acquisition of the Analytic Investors business in 2016. More data scientists have been hired to work alongside investment staff. This month WFAM hired Wai Lee, previously head of quantitative investments at Neuberger Berman, as global head of research in the multi-asset solutions team led by Mr Marais.

"We want to take the fusion between quantitative techniques and fundamental analysis to the next level, to explore how ### invalid font number 2
big data### invalid font number 1
 and ### invalid font number 2
machine learning### invalid font number 1
 can translate into real value for a stockpicker," he says.

As president, Mr Marais oversees WFAM's international operations so he is watching the progress of the Brexit negotiations between the UK and EU with some care.

"I hope that sanity will prevail but we have to plan in the face of uncertainty. The UK will always remain a very important market to Wells Fargo Asset Management but if we have to build more capacity in Europe after Brexit, that is what we will do," Mr Marais says.

Equifax Hires Jamil Farshchi as Chief Information Security Officer; Executive will lead changes at Equifax, which disclosed massive data breach last year### invalid font number 1

Equifax Inc. said it has hired a new chief information security officer to help with the company's overhaul of its security in the wake of its massive breach last year.

Equifax said Monday that it hired Jamil Farshchi, as its new CISO. In this role, Mr. Farshchi will be responsible for transforming the company's information security. He was previously CISO at Home Depot Inc. and held similar roles at Time Warner Inc. and Visa Inc.

He will report to the company's chief executive Paulino do Rego Barros Jr. who currently holds that position on an interim basis.

Mr. Barros said in a company statement that Equifax is confident Mr. Farshchi "possesses the talent and skill set needed to continue our journey toward developing industry-leading security practices and, ultimately, to help us regain trust with consumers and customers."

The "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-reports-data-breach-possibly-impacting-143-million-u-s-consumers-1504819765" that it had been breached and that personal information for 145.5 million Americans had been compromised. A few weeks later, several executives, including the then chief security officer and chief information officer, retired. The company's then chief Richard Smith retired soon after, too.

Mr. Farshchi "https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2015/03/30/home-depot-names-jamil-farshchi-chief-information-security-officer/" in 2015, several months after the company confirmed a massive breach to its payment systems. That breach resulted in stolen email and credit-card information that impacted millions of customers.

Before that, Mr. Farshchi was the global chief information security officer at Time Warner. He was also vice president of global information security at card network Visa where he led efforts on mobile security and ### invalid font number 2

, according to the Equifax announcement.

"Equifax is a company with tremendous potential, and I am confident that we will transform our security program into one of the most advanced and recognized globally," said Mr. Farshchi in the statement announcing his appointment.

Here what happening

Nvidia is up as much as 12 per cent in US pre-market trading after beating expectations and raising guidance for a tenth consecutive quarter. The graphics card maker cited continued strength in gaming and an acceleration of its datacentre business, as well as pent-up demand as gamers compete with cryptocurrency miners for supply.

Citi analysts raised their price target on Nvidia to $270 and repeated uydvice. e continue to view Nvidia as a beneficiary of multiple secular growth drivers like eSports gaming, ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
 and autonomous driving,iti said.

Travel website Expedia has slumped around 16 per cent pre-market after slashing 2018 earnings guidance to reflect increased spending to improve hotels supply and customer help services.

Needham & Co analysts said they now forecast Expedia to be lossmaking in the first quarter and cut its 2018 earnings forecast to $4.88 per share, compared with a consensus of $5.30. Experian valuation of 25 times earnings is too high for 14 per cent EPS growth, said Needham, which cut the stock off its uyist.

Umicore, the Belgian chemicals group, has surged after beating forecasts with its full-year results and announcing an acceleration of investment in next-generation battery materials backed by an ¬92m share sale.

The news was seen as a setback for Johnson Matthey, which last year announced a £00m investment to commercialise its rival battery technology. Umicore targeted battery production capacity of 175,000 tonnes by 2021 while Matthey aims to produce just 10,000 tonnes by the same year.

Merrill Lynch double-upgraded Umicore from nderperformo uy saying the valuation failed to capture 20 per cent compound annual earnings growth to 2020. The broker also applauded Umicore plan for orld dominationn battery materials, saying its target production could be enough to capture more than half the available market.

Security software maker Sophos remains under pressure a day after reporting a surprise slowdown in billings growth, which it blamed in part on disruption from product launches.

ophos has been heavily punished in these generally weak conditions for missing consensus, and the conference call left room for speculation as to the causes. However, our investment view is unchanged, as we have seen this roduct introductionffect elsewhere many times over the years,aid Stifel.

Direct Line has climbed after the car insurer said its 2017 pre-tax profit will beat consensus forecasts by around 15 per cent, thanks to improved trading, milder than expected weather claims and higher reserve releases. JP Morgan Cazenove saw scope for Direct Line to pay a special dividend of up to 14p a share.

Trinity Mirror is in demand after confirming the purchase of Northern & Shell, the publisher of the Express and Star newspapers, at an enterprise value of £84.2m. Trinity said the deal should be materially earnings enhancing in the first full year of ownership, with about £0m of cost savings achievable by the second year.

he deal structure plus the modest initial price and the synergies suggest a potential 20 per cent uplift to EPS,aid Peel Hunt, which kept a uyecommendation and anticipated raising its 2019 earnings a share forecast from 34.9p to circa 41p.

A recommended cash bid backed by American Express sent Hogg Robinson, the corporate travel agent, surging to below the maximum 120p offer price. Amex Global Business Travel agreed to pay between £76m and £11m for Hogg, with the final price dependent on the timing of Hogg £41m side deal with Visa to sell payments software maker Fraedom.

Carney Sees Rise In Natural Rate

One of the features of a surprisingly strong 2017 for the global economy is that investment spending appears to have picked up, having long been the element of demand that had recovered most slowly from the financial crisis.

That in turn may feed in to one of the questions that investors are pondering as 2018 gets under way: are central bank policy rates set to rise more rapidly than they, and indeed policy makers, had expected?

Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney is one who thinks they might.

Backing up a bit, as my colleague Greg Ip explains, one of Janet Yellen's legacies as chairwoman of the Federal Reserve is a lower assessment of the equilibrium rate of interest, also known to central bankers as the natural or neutral rate. That is the rate which is low enough to keep the economy growing and unemployment low but high enough to maintain stable inflation.

This is the rate that balances investment and savings, and part of the reason it may have fallen is that the former appears to have been weakened by the crisis, while the latter has been boosted by an aging population.

But if investment spending is now picking up, so might the equilibrium rate.

"One of the things that is possible over the course of the next few years is that the underlying global equilibrium interest rate could be increasing," Mr. Carney said in a news conference, having warned that the BOE will likely raise its key rate sooner and further than it had previously expected to.

A higher equilibrium rate would mean that central banks would have to raise their own policy rates further if they intend to remove stimulus.

"If you stay still in that environment, then all things being equal, you're providing more stimulus," Mr. Carney said.

Key Developments Around the World

Rand Paul Says He'll Oppose Goodfriend's Fed Nomination

By David Harrison

Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.) said he would vote against the nomination of Marvin Goodfriend for a spot on the Federal Reserve's board of governors, raising the prospect the Carnegie Mellon University economist might not have enough support to win confirmation.

"I'll be a no," Mr. Paul said Thursday.

Earlier Thursday, the Senate Banking Committee voted along party lines to advance Mr. Goodfriend's nomination.

Mr. Goodfriend hasn't attracted any Democratic support. If no Democrat or independent votes to confirm him, the GOP can lose no more than one of its votes in the Senate. Republicans have a 51-49 majority in the chamber, with 47 Democrats and two independents. The GOP's thin majority has been even more delicate due to the medical absence of Sen. John McCain (R., Ariz.), who is being treated for brain cancer.

Last year, Vice President Mike Pence broke a 50-50 tie to secure confirmation for a handful of nominations where Republicans joined Democrats in opposition.

It is unusual for the Senate to reject a president's Fed nominees, especially when the president's party controls the Senate as it does now. In 2011, Peter Diamond, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, withdrew his name from consideration to become a Fed governor after some Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee opposed his nomination.

President Donald Trump nominated Mr. Goodfriend in November. The White House's other Fed nominees, Chairman Jerome Powell and Randal Quarles, vice chairman for supervision, won Senate confirmation with bipartisan support.

Mr. Trump stands behind his nomination of Mr. Goodfriend, "who is incredibly qualified," said White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters in a statement Thursday.

Mr. Paul said he was troubled by Mr. Goodfriend's past support for tracking cash as it moves in and out of banks.

In academic papers, Mr. Goodfriend has supported pushing interest rates below zero during recessions and advocated charging a fee to take cash out of banks to make negative rates more effective. He has suggested inserting a magnetic strip on bank notes to track them as they enter circulation.

Mr. Paul's father, former Rep. Ron Paul, was a vocal opponent of the idea. On Thursday, the younger Mr. Paul indicated he shared his father's views on placing magnetic strips on bank notes.

"That doesn't sound very exciting to me," he said.

Before Thursday's 13-12 committee vote to advance Mr. Goodfriend's nomination, Sen. Sherrod Brown (D., Ohio) said he was troubled by the economist's concern about rising inflation in the aftermath of the financial crisis. He also said he was concerned that Mr. Goodfriend had paid "lip service" to the Fed's independence.

"It ultimately rang hollow," Mr. Brown said.

Democrats pressed Mr. Goodfriend during his confirmation hearing last month about the accuracy of his economic predictions. In particular, they criticized him for calling on the Fed to raise rates after the financial crisis, warning that inflation could rise dangerously high if it didn't. Inflation has undershot the Fed's 2% target for much of the past five years.

After the hearing, analysts said Mr. Goodfriend may have hurt his chances at confirmation not because of a poor forecasting recordany economists, including at the Fed, have made such errors in recent yearsut because he didn't provide an accounting for why his projections had proved off the mark.

Mr. Goodfriend has also urged more congressional oversight on the Fed and said the Fed should adopt a mathematical target to set monetary policy.

At his confirmation hearing in January, Mr. Goodfriend said a policy rule would help enhance Fed transparency, but insisted he is committed to the central bank's independence. When asked whether he thought the Fed should have followed his advice to begin raising interest rates in 2012, he said, "No, I don't," but added that his remarks were being taken out of context.

Fed's Kashkari Says January Jobs Report t Best Mixed' on Wages

By Kate Davidson

Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari said Thursday that last month's employment report was "at best mixed" on the outlook for wage gains and said he wants to see more data that rising wages are translating to inflation before the Fed raises short-term interest rates again.

"If wages start increasing on a consistent basis around the country and that fact translates into higher prices, in inflation, I would expect to see that will affect how the Federal Reserve approaches interest rates and that could affect the trajectory for interest rates, but we are a long way away from that," he said at a town hall forum in Pierre, S.D.

The Labor Department said last week that average hourly wages grew 2.9% from a year ago in January, the biggest gain since the recession.

Mr. Kashkari said the report provided early evidence that wages may be starting to go up nationally, but said policy makers still need to see more data showing those gains will lead to higher prices.

"I don't want to rush to judgment," he said. "I want to look at the data and actually make decisions based on the data."

Mr. Kashkari was one of two Fed officials who voted against the Fed's decision to raise its benchmark federal-funds rate in December to a range between 1.25% and 1.5%. Officials have penciled in around three rate increases in 2018 and will meet next March 20-21, when markets expect they will raise rates again.

Mr. Kashkari isn't a voting member of the Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee this year.

Fed's Kaplan Reinforces His Case for Three Rate Rises This Year

By Todd Buell

FRANKFURT-nemployment in the U.S. will drop below 4% and 2018 will be a "strong" year for America, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas said Thursday, reinforcing his base case for three interest-rate rises this year.

"We think we're already at or near full employment, we would expect headline unemployment to dip below 4% during this year," Robert Kaplan said.

Speaking on U.S. monetary policy, he said, "I still believe that it is the right plan for us to remove accommodation in a gradual, patient, but deliberate manner."

"My own base case is three [rate rises]," Mr. Kaplan said, but added this wasn't a "static estimate."

"I'm watching financial conditions, economic conditions, the labor market, and progress on inflation," he told reporters on the margins of an event at Germany's Bundesbank in Frankfurt.

"While I say I have a base case, I'm always learning and trying to understand what's going on and be vigilant," he added. Mr. Kaplan doesn't have a vote on monetary policy this year.

The Fed has been gradually nudging up interest rates in recent years, removing monetary stimulus as the unemployment rate has fallen to 4.1%. A statement released after the Fed's latest meeting on Jan. 31 offered nothing to dispel market expectations that the central bank would deliver its next rate increase in March.

Fed officials are hoping to keep rates low enough to encourage inflation to firm up a bit without surging out of control, amid a tight labor market and solid economic growth. Inflation measured by Fed's preferred measure rose 1.7% in December.

He reiterated comments made Wednesday suggesting that he isn't terribly concerned about recent market volatility.

"At this point, I don't see this market adjustment spilling over into other financial conditions, but I'll be watching, carefully," he told reporters. He said he was more accustomed in his career in finance to higher volatility. "The period that's been more abnormal in my career has been the last 15 months."

Fed's Harker Says If Data Supports It, March Rate Rise Is Possible

By Michael S. Derby

Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Patrick Harker said Thursday that while he foresees slightly fewer rate rises this year than many of his colleagues, a case may exist to raise rates at the next central bank policy meeting.

"I would be open to a March increase" in the Fed's overnight short-term target rate range, Mr. Harker told reporters after a speech in New York, referencing the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee policy meeting scheduled for March 20-21.

Mr. Harker said the case for a potential move higher is a balancing act. He said the Fed shouldn't move so fast it dampens growth and complicates its effort to get inflation back to the 2% target. But it also needs to move interest rates back toward more neutral levels and gain some capacity to cut rates again should the economy run into trouble again.

Mr. Harker, who is not a voting member of the FOMC this year, said his outlook for monetary policy is a hair different than the current consensus. "I still have penciled in two [2018 rate rises], because I would like to see us slightly overshoot our 2% inflation target. But I think there are some risks to the upside where I would be open to three going forward." He added what happens with rates depends on the economic data, especially in regards to price inflation.

Based on the Fed's last forecasts from its December policy meeting, most officials are eyeing around three rate rises this year, in what's now a target set between 1.25% and 1.50%. Mr. Harker and other Fed officials don't believe a recent passed tax overhaul bill will add much to growth, at least in a way that would change the rate outlook.

Mr. Harker also said the heavy-duty volatility in financial markets over recent days hasn't altered his view on the outlook for monetary policy and the economy.

"I'm not going to tell the market if it's healthy or unhealthy" to have seen asset prices fall, Mr. Harker said. But he's not entirely surprised.

He said long-term bond yields are rising because market participants are taking on board that Washington's current policy regime will mean big deficits and an increase in government borrowing, boosting supply of debt securities. He added, "If you start to believe the long end of the curve is going to go up, it makes sense equities would have an adjustment."

Other Fed officials have been sanguine about the market's woes as well. New York Fed President William Dudley said on Wednesday "my outlook hasn't changed because the stock market is a little bit lower than it was a few days ago. It's still up sharply from where it was a year ago." He added, "having a bump like this has virtually no consequence in my view to the economic outlook."

In Mr. Harker's speech before a gathering of college educators in New York, he said economic growth is under pressure from a long-running trend of declining labor force participation.

The drop in the labor force "is largely due to demographic factors," Mr. Harker said. But even so, growth "is likely to suffer" without something that reverses the trend. "Simply put, we need more people," Mr. Harker said.

He also worried about borrowing to attend college. "The overall issue of student debt is important because it doesn't just affect individuals, it resonates across generational lines in families and spreads into the wider economy," Mr. Harker said. "On the national level, research by the Philadelphia Fed's Consumer Finance Institute, along with others, shows that student debt is affecting both small business formation and homeownership rates," he said.

Fed's Dudley Says Chance of a March Rate Increase Looks Good--Bloomberg TV

By Michael S. Derby

Federal Reserve Bank of New York leader William Dudley said in a television interview Thursday that prospects for a March rate rise are looking good, as he was upbeat about the economy and not concerned about the heavy volatility on Wall Street.

When it comes to boosting short-term borrowing costs at the March 20-21 Federal Open Market Committee meeting, "as long as I'm comfortable the economy is going to continue to grow at an above trend pace at a time when I think monetary policy is accommodative and financial conditions are easy, I'm probably going to be supportive of removing monetary policy accommodation," Mr. Dudley told Bloomberg's television channel.

"I think there many things on the side of the economy being stronger than expected" rather than weaker, so that makes the chance of boosting the current overnight target rate range of between 1.25% and 1.50% quite possible, he said.

"But again, let's see where we are at the time of the meeting" before actually making the call on rates, Mr. Dudley said. The official also said the central bank's current outlook, which has penciled in three rate rises for 2018, is "reasonable," though he added that how the economy performs will be the key to what happens.

Mr. Dudley, who is set to retire this summer, is a highly influential Fed official who also serves as vice chairman of the FOMC. The interview with Mr. Dudley occurred in the midst of highly volatile trading in stock markets, as investors have moved to reprice securities to reflect the possibility of more inflation and what some see as increasing odds the Fed may have to raise rates more than expected.

So far, Fed officials have shrugged off the market's woes and done nothing thus far to justify fears the central bank may raise rates more than the three increases officials projected back in December. Indeed, some in the Fed have appeared to welcome of the stock market's declines in a climate where central bankers were already viewing asset prices as elevated.

In an appearance Wednesday, Mr. Dudley said "my outlook hasn't changed because the stock market is a little bit lower than it was a few days ago. It's still up sharply from where it was a year ago." He added, "having a bump like this has virtually no consequence in my view to the economic outlook."

In a separate appearance on Wednesday, Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan said, "I think it's healthy that there is some correction, a little more volatility in markets." He added that he still favors raising rates in a "patient and gradual manner."

That same theme was echoed earlier Thursday when Philadelphia Fed chief Patrick Harker spoke with reporters in New York. He too was leaving unrevised his economic outlook, saying, "I still have penciled in two [2018 rate rises], because I would like to see us slightly overshoot our 2% inflation target. But I think there are some risks to the upside where I would be open to three going forward." He added what happens with rates depends on the economic data, especially in regards to price inflation.

In his comments to Bloomberg, Mr. Dudley said the market selloff is in large part driven by market participants accepting the reality of a strong global economy and what that means for central banks. He said long-term bond yields are on the rise as market participants embrace an outlook that's likely to bring a series of rate rises.

When it comes to the stock selloff, "if it stops here the implications for the economic outlook are very marginal," Mr. Dudley said. He described the degree of market selloff as "small potatoes."

WSJ Survey: Economists Expect Three Fed Rate Increases in 2018

By David Harrison and Ben Leubsdorf

Forecasters see the U.S. economy gathering steam this year and the Federal Reserve raising short-term interest rates three or perhaps four times by the end of 2018.

Economists surveyed in recent days by The Wall Street Journal on average predicted U.S. gross domestic product would rise 2.8% in 2018, accelerating from 2.5% growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus a year earlier, supported by the recent package of tax-code changes.

They also projected the unemployment rate would fall below 4% by midyear, from 4.1% in January.

The economists predicted the Fed would raise rates at its next meeting, March 20-21, followed by another move at its June 12-13 meeting.

The central bank in December raised its benchmark federal-funds rate to a range between 1.25% and 1.5%. The economists' average expectation was for the rate to end the year at 2.21%. That's consistent with Fed officials' anticipation of three quarter-percentage-point increases this year, which would lift it to a range between 2% and 2.25%.

The survey respondents' projections have been inching up as their economic forecasts have grown stronger in recent months. In November, they saw the fed-funds rate ending 2018 at 2.07%.

David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance, said the Fed was "on the borderline between three-four moves this year."

The latest survey of 63 business, financial and academic economists was conducted Feb. 2-6, after the release of the January jobs report and during a period of stock-market volatility.

Despite the Wall Street turbulence, the economists remained optimistic about the economy and anticipated the Fed would stick with its plan of gradually raising interest rates under new Chairman Jerome Powell. Some said the chances that officials would move more aggressively than anticipated outweighed the chances they would move less aggressively.

Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group, said the Fed under Mr. Powell would maintain "continued gradual tightening."

The average probability of a recession in the next year was 14%, ticking up from 13% in January's survey but remaining low. Nearly two-thirds of forecasters said they saw more risk that the economy would grow faster than it would grow more slowly, another sign of optimism about the outlook.

"The tax-cut stimulus and faster wage and salary growth are the garlic to the vampire of recession," said Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida's Institute for Economic Competitiveness.

One reason several days of swinging stock prices didn't rattle forecasters: 59% said they thought U.S. stocks were overvalued, and several others said stocks had been overpriced before their recent decline.

"February's drop has pushed prices more in line with earnings," said Lynn Reaser of Point Loma Nazarene University.

The economy has shown signs of strength over the past few months. On Friday, the Labor Department reported average hourly earnings for private-sector workers were up 2.9% in January over the previous year, the largest such gain since 2009.

In theory, continued growth and low unemployment should put upward pressure on inflation, which has undershot the Fed's 2% target for much of the past five years. Stronger inflation could lead the Fed to pencil in a faster pace of rate increases.

The central bank's preferred inflation index was 1.7% higher in December than a year earlier. Investors, anticipating stronger inflation, have pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note above 2.8%; it was close to 2% in September.

Several Fed officials have said they could support four rate increases this year if the economy picks up steam.

"The issues of whether we should have three or four rate hikes this year is really going to be driven by the data and changes in the outlook," San Francisco Fed President John Williams said Friday. "Both of those kind of possibilities are reasonable to think about as options."

On Wednesday, New York Fed President William Dudley said the past few days of market volatility haven't affected his view of the economy.

"Having a bump like this has virtually no consequence, in my view, to the economic outlook," he said.

WSJ Survey: Economists Support Fed's 2% Inflation Target

By David Harrison

Federal Reserve officials in recent months have floated ways they might alter the central bank's 2% inflation goal. But economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal have a message for the Fed: Don't touch that target.

About 84% of economists said the Fed should stick with its current target, in large part to avoid damaging the central bank's credibility.

"Changing the rules could trigger skepticism and uncertainty," said Lynn Reaser, an economist at Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego.

The Fed adopted the 2% target in 2012. Now, some officials, including former Chairman Ben Bernanke, say the central bank should examine alternatives that would better help the economy recover from recessions in an era of persistently lower inflation and interest rates.

Some have suggested a so-called price level target in which policy makers would try to let inflation rise faster in good times to compensate for weaker price increases during downturns. Another option would be to target nominal growth in gross domestic product instead of inflation. There has also been talk of raising the inflation target above 2%.

"The costs of hitting the effective lower bound for a prolonged period should cause a reassessment of the 2% inflation target," said Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren in January.

Many other developed country central banks have adopted similar 2% inflation targets. Economists in the survey said it made sense for the U.S. to match the goals of its peers. Allen Sinai, chief economist at Decision Economics Inc., said the 2% goal is the "accepted standard world-wide and an expected inflation anchor if central banks stick to it."

Inflation has undershot the target for all but two months in the past five years.

That suggests officials would have an even harder time hitting their mark if they raised the target or if they sought to let inflation run high for a time to make up for weak inflation periods.

"It's like moving the goal post when you can't put the ball in the net," said Rajeev Dhawan, director of the Economic Forecasting Center at Georgia State University.

Just 11% of economists surveyed supported moving to a price-level target and 5% were in favor of raising the inflation target.

Some economists said that while they support sticking with the 2% goal, they would be open to including a range between readings slightly below and above the target. David Shulman, senior economist at UCLA Anderson Forecast, suggested a range of between 1.5% and 2.5%.

Others said the Fed should try instead to hold prices steady or limit inflation to 1%.

Officials have said their target is "symmetrical," meaning they would tolerate inflation running slightly above or slightly below it.

Mexico's Central Bank Lifts Rates to Nine-Year High

By Juan Montes

MEXICO CITYhe Bank of Mexico lifted interest rates by a quarter percentage point Thursday to a nine-year high, amid stubbornly high inflation and investor expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve may raise rates faster than previously thought.

The overnight interest rate target now stands at 7.5%, the highest since February 2009. The move was expected by most economists and follows a similar move in December.

In its policy statement, the central bank left the door open to additional rate increases, saying it "will act in a timely, firm way to keep inflation expectations anchored."

The decision was unanimous. It was the first policy meeting attended by Irene Espinosa, who was appointed last month as the first woman at the bank's five-member board. It was the second meeting for the Bank of Mexico chief Alejandro Díz de Leó, who took the governor's post in December.

Some analysts said the newcomers are probably seeking to assure investors of their commitment to fighting inflation.

"We suspect that today's hike was the final move in the tightening cycle, but given recent swings in currency markets it clearly won't take much to persuade policy makers to move again," said Neil Shearing, chief emerging-markets economist at Capital Economics.

Normally, the bank probably would have stayed on hold, "but a combination of Nafta concerns, a new governor trying to burnish his inflation-fighting credentials with markets, and recent swings in the global financial markets all point towards playing it safe," he said, referring to the North American Free Trade Agreement that the U.S., Mexico and Canada are renegotiating.

The peso, which is he second-most-traded emerging-market currency after the Chinese yuan, weakened slightly after the announcement ashe quarter-percentage-point rate increase had been widely discounted. The peso traded in Mexico City at 18.9450 to the U.S. dollar Thursday afternoon, already weakened by the decline in global stock markets.

Mexico's annual inflation eased in January to 5.55%, from 6.77% in December, but it is still well above the central bank's 3% target. The central bank thinks inflation will return to the target in the first quarter of 2019, taking longer than previously expected.

The Bank of Mexico has raised interest rates by 4.5 percentage points since December 2015. Higher interest rates, which lead to more expensive credit and less consumption, are one factor behind the economic slowdown that Mexico experienced last year. Economic output expanded 2.1% in 2017, according to preliminary data, the lowest growth in four years.

The big beneficiaries have been banks and savers. Private banks, among them the Mexican subsidiaries of U.S. Citigroup and Spain's BBVA, had profits of $7.3 billion last year, a 28% increase from 2016, Mexico's banking regulator recently said.

In the last two years, consumer prices have been hit by several shocks. The peso has depreciated 22% since early 2015 due to falling oil pricesome 17% of Mexico's government revenue comes from oilnd uncertainty related to the renegotiation of Nafta. A weak peso makes imports more expensive, affecting end prices.

In early 2017, the government ordered an unprecedented 20% increase in gasoline prices, which in turn pushed up transportation costs.

The Mexican peso has recovered some ground in recent weeks as fears about a possible collapse of Nafta talks dissipated. But recent positive economic data in the U.S. have prompted investors to flee from riskier assets such as the peso, betting the Fed will raise interest rates faster than initially expected.

The Bank of Mexico said Thursday that the peso could face new episodes of volatility in the coming months as uncertainty remains high. It cited Mexico's presidential elections in July; the Fed's policy stance; and the risks that Mexico, the U.S. and Canada ultimately fail to reach a deal on Nafta.

Russia Cuts Key Interest Rate as Inflation Falls Below Target

By James Marson

MOSCOWhe Bank of Russia cut its key lending rate to 7.5% from 7.75% Friday, citing annual inflation that has fallen below the bank's target level of 4% and decreasing expectations of price rises.

The bank said in a statement that it would likely continue cutting the key rate as "the possibility of annual inflation rising above 4% this year has significantly decreased."

Inflation stood at 2.2% in January, a record low for the post-Soviet period.

The bank said economic growth slowed in the final quarter of 2017, although it was unclear why. Russia's economy returned to growth last year after a two-year recession caused by weak prices for oil and Western sanctions.

Bank of Canada's Wilkins Flags Concern Over Technology Firms' Market Concentration

By Kim Mackrael

OTTAWAhe market dominance of the world's largest technology firms could hurt competition and lead to higher prices if policy makers don't intervene, Bank of Canada Senior Deputy Governor Carolyn Wilkins said Thursday.

In a speech delivered to the G-7 Symposium on Innovation and Inclusive Growth, Ms. Wilkins said the five biggest technology companies have a market capitalization that, at $3.5 trillion, is about one-fifth the size of the U.S. economy. While the industry makes an important contribution to economic growth, she said in prepared remarks, the size and dominance of some firms raises concerns about a possible monopoly on prices and competition.

Ms. Wilkins said user data has become an additional source of power that can make some large companies "virtually unassailable." New technologies such as algorithmic pricing could also lead to tacit price collusion, she said.

The central bank official said governments should prioritize the modernization of antitrust and competition policy to ensure new companies can compete. "We are not going to get the full benefits of innovation if we leave market power unchecked," she said.

Ms. Wilkins also called on policy makers to work on improving workers' skills so they can benefit from innovation and to manage the risks that third-party digital service providers may pose to the financial system.

Ms. Wilkins didn't comment on Canada's economic outlook in her prepared remarks.

Last month, the Bank of Canada raised its benchmark interest rate to 1.25%, the third increase since mid-2017. The central bank said at the time that the economy was running roughly at capacity, but uncertainty over the North American Free Trade Agreement was clouding the economic outlook.

Stock Slides Likely Making Bank of Japan More Cautious About Rates

By Megumi Fujikawa

TOKYOhe Bank of Japan is likely more cautious about changing monetary policy after stocks plunged this week, an adviser to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said, as he called on the bank to keep supporting the economy aggressively.

"If Japan rushes to exit from monetary easing, after this big turmoil, it could be swallowed in a wave of global stock falls," Koichi Hamada, one of the architects of Abenomics, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal.

The Yale University economics professor emeritus said many central banks around the world may now be thinking twice about the appropriate speed for tightening policy.

"The Federal Reserve may not want to raise interest rates immediately after such a huge move in the stock market. If so, it would delay monetary tightening in Europe and push back the possibility of rate increases in Japan even further," he said.

The comments come in week that has seen the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunge more than 1,000 points on two separate days and entering correction territory, with falls partly stoked by fears over rising Treasury yields and higher interest rates. The Nikkei Stock Average marked its biggest point drop since 1990 on Tuesday. The sharp falls served as an indication of investors' heightened sensitivity to rising bond yields and policy moves.

Speculation that Japan's central bank might raise interest rates later this year has grown since Mr. Kuroda in November highlighted the potential drawbacks of superlow interest rates. Japan is in one of its best growth spurts in decades, prices are rising again and central banks around the world, led by the Fed, are tightening policy as the global economy gains speed.

Mr. Hamada lauded the success of the Abenomics project so far, but said it was important to keep plugging away at it and not change course even with a different BOJ governor.

Mr. Kuroda's aggressive quantitative easing program, now tweaked to focus on interest rates, has been one of the key pillars of Abenomics. Policy makers say it has helped spur the longest economic expansion in 16 years and the tightest job market in more than four decades.

The prime minister said earlier this week that he trusted Mr. Kuroda's abilities and praised him for changing market sentiment for the better, but he still hasn't given a clear indication of whether he intends to reappoint Mr. Kuroda. Market participants expect he will remain at the post.

Mr. Hamada said it wasn't necessary that Mr. Kuroda continued as governor provided his successor continued the same aggressive quantitative easing and yield curve control that has helped improve job conditions and corporate profits.

Still, the fact that inflation hasn't reached 2% means that the labor markethich he said was ultimately more important than the 2% figuresn't stretched enough to justify any rate increases.

"The key for increases in wages and prices is whether average payments to full-time workershich have been struggling to riseill start turning upward. If they do and cause cost-push inflation, that's when the Bank of Japan may start thinking of looking for the exit to QE," he said.

BOJ's Suzuki Says Cumulative Impact of Low Rates Needs to be Watched

By Megumi Fujikawa

TOKYOBank of Japan policy board member Hitoshi Suzuki said Thursday the bank must pay attention to the impact of low interest rates on the country's financial system, and should continue the current ultra-easy monetary policy to support further price increases.

"It is necessary to carefully watch cumulative impact of prolonged monetary easing on financial system and banks' intermediation functions," Mr. Suzuki said in a speech.

The former executive at the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ said Japan's financial system has been stable thanks to banks' strong capital, although low lending rates have squeezed their earnings.

The comments are in line with a view previously expressed by Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda in a speech at the University of Zurich last year, that the negative effects of low rates can increase over time.

In the speech, Mr. Kuroda referred to the reversal ratehe point at which low rates set by a central bank starts to hurt the banking industry and undermine the benefits of loose monetary policy. The remark sparked speculation in markets about rate increases later this year.

While Mr. Suzuki also agreed with the governor's view that inflation is still only halfway to the bank's 2% target and the BOJ should continue its easing program, he sounded more upbeat on the price outlook.

"Conditions are becoming ready for the pace of price increases to speed up further" thanks to the tight labor market, as well as the government's push for higher wages and improving productivity, he said.

The central bank expects inflation to reach 2% by March 2020. In December, core inflation rose 0.9% on year, matching the pace marked in the previous month.

RBA Warns Full Employment Still Some Way Off

By James Glynn

SYDNEYustralia will lag well behind the global shift toward higher interest rates, with the central bank Friday forecasting tepid inflation for some years yet, while warning full employment will be illusive.

The Reserve Bank of Australia forecast core inflation will drift up only slowly, reaching the lower end of its 2-3% target band by mid-2019, and just 2.25% by mid-2019. Core inflation is critical to policy-making at the RBA.

Economic growth will be stronger, running at a healthy 3.5% by mid-2019, but unemployment will fall only slowly.

The RBA lowered its forecast for unemployment to 5.25% by the end of 2018, from a forecast of 5.5% in November. The jobless rate is currently 5.5%.

But the outlook sees unemployment remaining above 5.0%, a level the RBA has associated with full-employment.

"The unemployment rate is set to remain above estimates of full employment for some time yet," the RBA said in a quarterly report.

The outlook is consistent with comments made Thursday by RBA Gov. Philip Lowe that there is no case for interest rates to be changed in the near-term.

"The Reserve Bank Board doesn't see a strong case for a near-term adjustment in monetary policy," Mr. Lowe told a business forum overnight.

The RBA has held its cash rate target at a record low 1.5% since mid-2016, and some economists expect the pause could extend well into 2019 or beyond.

Mr. Lowe also made it clear this week the RBA feels no pressure to follow its global counterparts like the U.S. Federal Reserve in raising interest rates, saying Australia's floating exchange rate gives it flexibility to make policy based on domestic conditions.

Despite the general caution, the RBA said 2018 sees the economy on a more solid footing than a year earlier, with the job market adding more than 400,000 new positions in the last 12 months.

The biggest uncertainty before the RBA is weak wages growth. Languishing at recession-style 20-year lows, policy makers are patiently waiting for further tightening of the job market to convert into higher wages.

So far there has been wage pressures reported in only small pockets of the labor market.

A recovery in wages growth will be needed if the RBA is to achieve its goal of 2-3% inflation.

Increasingly Fit Again: The Euro Area Economy is Shedding the Crisis Legacies

Marco Buti, Bjön Döring and Joséeandro "https://voxeu.org/article/euro-area-economy-shedding-crisis-legacies" the euro area economy's path forward by studying what the "different narratives of the typical recovery' imply about the further trajectory of GDP and inflation." They find in a VoxEU column, the "outlook for the euro area economy depends to a large extent on whether the impact of the crisis will turn out to be permanent or transitory... In view of remaining slack, and barring an exogenous shock or policy mistakes, there is scope for solid GDP growth above potential for some time. The factors that should eventually drive an increase in core inflation are gaining force, but only gradually."

Economic Predictions With ### invalid font number 2
Big Data### invalid font number 1
: The Illusion of Sparsity

"The idea that economic data are informative enough to identify sparse predictive models might be an illusion," Domenico Giannone, Michele Lenza and Giorgio Primiceri "https://voxeu.org/article/economic-predictions-big-data-illusion-sparsity" in a VoxEu column. "The availability of large datasets has sparked interest in predictive models with many possible predictors. Using six examples of data from macroeconomics, microeconomics, and finance, [we argue] that it is not usually possible to identify sparse models by selecting a handful of predictors from these larger pools."

Germany's Wage Deal Is Good for Europe Too

"Rarely has a round of wage negotiations been watched so closely as the recent dispute involving Germany's IG Metall labour union," Ferdinando Giugliano "https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-02-08/germany-s-wage-deal-is-good-for-europe-too" for Bloomberg View. "The agreement reached in Baden-Wuerttemberg with the Suedwestmetall employer's federation, including a 4.3 percent raise from April and the right to a 28-hour working week, is a further sign that wage pressures are finally returning to the euro zone. This is essential if the European Central Bank is to hit its inflation target of just below 2 percent. The deal marks a shift from Germany's recent wage-setting patterns. Unemployment has fallen sharply, giving trades unions greater bargaining power over employers. Workers representatives have exploited this position to push for higher wages as well better working conditions. The time for wage moderation - which characterized the decade since the 2002 labor market reforms - seems over."

The Chinese yuan "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-yuan-poised-for-biggest-one-day-drop-since-2015-devaluation-1518070593" against the U.S. dollar Thursday, notching its biggest one-day decline since the Chinese central bank devalued the currency in August 2015.

The number of Americans filing applications for new unemployment benefits "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-jobless-claims-fell-last-week-1518096889" for the third time in four weeks, pointing to continued labor market tightness. Initial jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs across the U.S., fell by 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 221,000 in the week ended Feb. 3, the Labor Department said Thursday.

Mexico's inflation "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mexican-inflation-slowed-in-january-1518101108" from a 17-year high as some fresh produce prices fell and gasoline prices went up less than they had the year before. The consumer-price index rose 0.53% last month, compared with a 1.7% jump in January 2017, causing the annual inflation rate to slow to 5.55% from 6.77% in December, the National Statistics Institute said Thursday.

China's consumer inflation "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-inflation-moderates-in-january-1518141798" to a seven-month low on continued weakness in food prices, official data showed Friday.

Personalities: JMI Equity's Contrella Hits His Deal-Making Stride### invalid font number 1

The same stamina that has pushed Larry Contrella to complete marathons also has brought him success in landing deals at software-focused JMI Equity.

The 31-year old principal stood out early on when he was interviewing back in 2009 to become part of a three-person associate class at the Baltimore-based midmarket firm, said General Partner David Greenberg. At the time, Mr. Contrella was training for the New York City Marathon while maintaining the grueling hours required of an investment banking analyst. He joined JMI's Baltimore office in 2010.

"We were excited about his potential," Mr. Greenberg said. "The thing in the interview process we learned that proved to be part of his work personality is he's a very committed and fast runner, and that he is very disciplined."

Larry Contrella

Background Before joining JMI Equity, Mr. Contrella worked as an investment banking analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. He earned his bachelor's degree in economics at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.

Select Investments Benevity Inc., CoreHR Ltd., Higher Logic LLC, Level Accessormerly SSB BART Groupnd Schoology Inc.

Relationships Mr. Contrella and Marco Schnabl, co-chief executive officer of automotiveMastermind Inc., keep in touch following the sale of JMI's stake in the company last year. They have seen a business partnership turn into a friendship. Mr. Schnabl said they would take a skiing trip to Jackson Hole this monthust as they did last yearo mark the exit but not the end of their relationship.

That drive has helped Mr. Contrella become one of the most productive members of JMI's investment team, completing six acquisitions in the last three years, Mr. Greenberg said. He also worked on exits of the firm's stakes in automotiveMastermind Inc. and DoubleVerify Inc. during the same period. IHS Markit Ltd. and Providence Equity Partners, respectively, acquired majority stakes in the companies last year.

"The last three years, Larry has done more deals here than anybody," Mr. Greenberg said. "He has no trouble telling you what the challenges are. That's definitely a big area of growth for him."

That fast and furious merger-and-acquisition pace was borne partly out of the lessons Mr. Contrella learned from his early days at the firm. When he first started, Mr. Contrella worked on JMI's internet team at a time of increasing risk to companies' business models from technology giants, Mr. Greenberg said.

"He saw a lot of risks come to fruition," said Mr. Greenberg, adding that since that time, Mr. Contrella has taken feedback about risk into account when investing in companies and has had no problem putting money to work.

Among Mr. Contrella's noteworthy deals was JMI's 2016 investment in automotiveMastermind, a provider of predictive ### invalid font number 2
analytics### invalid font number 1
 and marketing-automation software for the auto industry.

Marco Schnabl, co-founder and co-chief executive officer of automotiveMastermind, said Mr. Contrella's intelligence, humility and ability to put others at ease helped win the team over when the company was seeking its first round of institutional capital. AutomotiveMastermind's meeting with Mr. Contrella was the first of 20 the management team had with prospective investors. However, throughout the interviewing process, JMI and Mr. Contrella stood out.

"The first meeting was an intro meeting with Larry," Mr. Schnabl said. "It felt very natural. He's a humble, smart, high-energy person, and professional. We knew from the very first moment we were extremely comfortable."

The early relationship with Mr. Contrella blossomed during the company's short tenure within JMI's portfolio. Mr. Contrella said that during JMI's holding period, the business increased its head count to 220 employees from 70 members. Mr. Schnabl added that Mr. Contrella also was key in helping the company field an offer from IHS Markit, while explaining to them that they didn't need to feel pressured to take any deal. IHS Markit ultimately bought a 78% stake in the company for about $392 million. At the time of the deal, IHS Markit said it would buy the remaining 22% stake if the company hit certain financial milestones. Mr. Schnabl said Mr. Contrella helped negotiate a deal that preserved automotiveMastermind's culture, which was important to the CEO.

He added that Mr. Contrella also helped put management at ease during a time when automotiveMastermind was below its growth target, right after JMI invested in the company.

"I turned to Larry and Dave and said, his will be an embarrassing month for us, I feel terrible,'" Mr. Schnabl said. "Their feedback was basically, ey guys, we believe in you. Don't worryhis is the long run for us.' Everyone at the company knows that story."

Brexit talks uncertainty behind caution as foreign funds boost tech sector

European technology start-ups raised record levels of funding last year after a series of blockbuster deals led by foreign investors, but many of the continent's venture capital firms struggled to raise money, according to just released data.

Non-European investors were responsible for the biggest deals with SoftBank, the Japanese technology group, leading a ¬58m financing of UK virtual simulation technology start-up Improbable, and US funds T Rowe Price and Fidelity investing $385m into Deliveroo, the London-based takeaway food app. Chinese ecommerce group JD.com also boosted the figures with its $397m investment in Farfetch, the luxury goods website.

However, research from Pitchbook, a data provider, shows the total capital raised by Europe's venture groups fell by a quarter to ¬.4bn amid growing uncertainty about the outcome of Britain's negotiations to leave the EU. Despite large venture capital firms, such as Balderton Capital, closing big fundraising rounds, the total number of new funds dropped to a 10-year low of 54 in 2017, compared with 75 the previous year.

"If you're looking to invest into a UK or European fund, Brexit is a factor that you didn't have to consider before," says Doug Trafelet, managing director at Pitchbook. "You may say, 'Why not wait for a couple of months before investing in that fund?' ... or just invest 80 per cent of what you were going to invest."

The tougher fundraising environment for investors follows two years in which money poured in to Europe's venture capital groups.

Enthusiasm for the continent's technology sector specially in areas such as ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
 and financial technology ovetailed with low interest rates, to attract pension funds, insurance companies and family offices on the hunt for returns.

The excitement was fuelled by an increase in the amount of money allocated to the European Investment Fund, a public-private partnership created by the EU to support venture capital in the bloc. The initiative has become a central plank for the bloc's venture capital groups and accounts for more than a third of investment in UK-based funds.

Between 2014 and 2015, after the European Investment Bank decided to increase the EIF's capacity, venture capital groups saw a near-doubling in fundraising to ¬.4bn.

However, following the UK's 2016 vote to quit the EU, the EIF paused its investments in venture capital funds based in the UK, casting a pall over smaller investors that depend on it for capital. "The new funds are having a harder time raising money, or the amount [they raise] will be smaller," says Omri Benayoun, general partner at Partech Ventures, which shelved plans to open an office in London until the outcome of the UK-EU negotiations.

Venture capital companies are considered a key part of the technology "ecosystem", that enables start-ups to raise money and advice from experienced investors. Foreign investors and big companies have instead driven growth.

As big automotive and retail companies attempt to modernise their businesses, data from Atomico, the Londonbased venture capital company, show 637 financing deals last year involved at least one corporate investor, a 19 per cent increase on the year before. Asian investors meanwhile put $1.8bn into start-ups in the continent, compared with just $876m in 2016.

Certain pockets of the industry have attracted outsized interest. The data from Pitchbook show ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
 start-ups raised ¬.2bn last year, more than double the previous year, while fintech companies raised ¬.35bn, more than triple the amount in 2016.

"European entrepreneurs are becoming more ambitious and more competent at building bigger and bigger companies," says Neil Rimer, co-founder at Index Ventures. "It's an onward march for tech in Europe."

Countries such as the UK and France have benefited from their expertise in these specific sectors. "When we started out most people were sceptical at the idea of trying to build a hard technology company in London, let alone an AI research company," says Demis Hassabis, co-founder of DeepMind, the ### invalid font number 2
artificial intelligence### invalid font number 1
 start-up bought by Google in 2014. "So eight years on it's pretty amazing to see how much support is now flowing into the sector." Venture capital investors argue that moving away from a large number of small funds and a high volume of smaller deals will benefit start-ups that have struggled to achieve the scale of their counterparts from Silicon Valley or China.

"The ecosystem has evolved in terms of the geographic reach and the emergence of venture capital groups outside the UK, in Germany, France, the Nordics and beyond," says Tom Wehmeier, a partner at Atomico. "What you see now riven in part by the sustained improvement in European Venture s a really strong willingness from corporate and private venture funds from insurance and other investors abroad to engage with Europe's tech community."
