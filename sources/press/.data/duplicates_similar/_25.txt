The Buzz
Financial Problems Deepen at 2 Banks --- Corus Is 'Critically Undercapitalized,' Colonial Loses Possible Cash Infusion

Corus Bankshares Inc., the Chicago lender battered by the condominium bust, warned it is "critically undercapitalized" and that it is "highly unlikely" it can raise capital without substantial aid from bank regulators.

Corus disclosed a $487 million second-quarter loss in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Tier 1 capital, a measure of its cushion against bad loans, fell to negative $157 million at its banking unit at the end of June, a condition that usually triggers seizure.

Of the five banks that have reported negative Tier 1 levels for the second quarter, four have been seized by regulators, according to Foresight Analytics. Corus has assets of $7.07 billion.

In another indication of the troubles facing banks of all sizes across the U.S., Colonial BancGroup Inc., a Montgomery, Ala., bank-holding company with $25.5 billion in assets, said its management "has concluded that there is substantial doubt about Colonial's ability to continue as a going concern."

Colonial on Friday reported a net loss of $606 million for the second quarter, saying plans to get a $300 million infusion from outside investors had collapsed. As a result, Colonial has "shifted our focus" to pursing a sale or merger, jettisoning problem assets and other options, said Chief Executive Lewis Beville.

The regional bank has been battered by its exposure to real-estate lending, particularly in Florida. The state has been hammered by falling property values and rising foreclosures.

The deteriorating financial condition of Colonial and Corus puts even more pressure on bank regulators, who have been shopping around assets of critically wounded financial institutions and trying to line up buyers for banks that can't be saved.

Some analysts thought Corus would be taken over by regulators and its best assets sold after it failed to shore up its capital position ahead of a June deadline. Several private-equity and real-estate funds are looking at buying the bank's assets, which include 76 condo-construction loans, including 12 for buildings that Corus is in the process of acquiring through foreclosure.

That sales process has dragged on longer than many analysts expected, as would-be buyers look for a loss-sharing agreement with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Potential bidders are heavily discounting the assets because of challenges in gauging the true value of the bank's nonperforming construction loans. Another potential hurdle: Some of the remaining loans may have commitments requiring Corus to keep funding construction until the building is completed.

"Anytime you have a situation like this where the equity hole is so deep and the loan loss is so severe . . . [buyers] will want protection and assistance from the FDIC in a fairly significant way," said Peyton Green, a senior analyst at Sterne, Agee &Leach Inc.

Potential bidders for Corus include real-estate developer Related Cos., real-estate investor Lubert-Adler and private-equity firms Starwood Capital and Colony Capital.

Corus concentrated heavily on condo-construction lending, and more than half of the $3.9 billion in condo construction loans weren't generating payments or were in foreclosure at the end of March. Construction loans accounted for 88% of the bank's outstanding loans at the end of the first quarter, the largest share among any U.S. bank with more than $100 million in loans, according to Foresight Analytics.

"If I were the FDIC I would want to cut my losses and run. But it may be harder to achieve given the concentration of the loan portfolio," said Mr. Green.

While some of Corus's individual properties are seen as high-quality assets, many are concentrated in the same overbuilt condo markets. "All these units are coming to market at the same time in the worst housing depression we've seen, and especially the ones in South Florida," said Jack McCabe, a real-estate consultant in Deerfield Beach, Fla.

Some buildings are mired in legal disputes, as buyers fight to recoup deposits and as contractors file liens over unpaid bills. Representatives for Corus didn't return calls seeking comment.

Colonial said it charged off $244 million in loans in the latest quarter, or about 7% of its portfolio, up from $132 million, or 3.7%, in the first quarter.

Nonperforming assets swelled to $1.7 billion or 12.3% of net loans, other real estate owned and repossessions as of June 30.

Investec Asset Management Ltd. has emerged as the manager of the only mainstream U.K. equities fund to have made money for investors over the 12 months to the end of June, a period in which the FTSE All-Share index sank to its lowest point for more than five years.

Investec's GBP 213 million ($350 million) U.K. Contrarian fund returned 3.3% after fees were paid over the period, making it the best-performing among 100 peers and the only one to make money for clients. Investec is a unit of Investec PLC.

The second-best performer was the GBP 109 million U.K. Focus fund, managed by London boutique Majedie Asset Management, which lost 4.5%.

The figures were published earlier this week in the latest quarterly pooled-fund performance report from BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, which showed that U.K. equity funds lost an average of 21% over the 12 months to June 30, slightly worse than the FTSE All-Share index's loss of 20.5%. The report covered pooled funds available for investment by U.K. pension funds.

The figures exclude portfolios that invest in small-cap stocks, which lost an average of 20.6%.

Only property funds performed worse than U.K. equities funds over the year, according to the report, averaging a loss of 22.4%. International bond funds returned 25.1% on average, dramatically outperforming the other sectors. Long-term U.K. bond funds ranked second over the period with a 6.6% average return.

The report revealed a similarly small number of money-making U.K. equity funds over the three years to the end of June: two funds from Majedie, which returned 2.9% and 0.4% on an annualized basis, and Standard Life Investments' Unconstrained fund, which returned an annualized 0.9%. On average, U.K. equities funds lost 6.2% a year over the period.

The negative performance in the longer term came despite average positive performance for U.K. equities funds of 11.1% in the second quarter of this year as stock markets rose. The market gains also increased the shares of assets held in equities by balanced funds, the report said. Balanced funds invest in primarily in stocks and bonds, although a few also include other asset classes.

Weightings in equities at balanced funds offered by U.K. firms increased in the second quarter from 73.6% to 76.6%, while holdings in cash, bonds and property fell.

Alan Wilcock, a performance and risk-analytics manager at BNY Mellon Asset Servicing, said, "Positive returns from all the main equity markets, combined with good results from the corporate bond market, meant that the majority of equity and bond funds were in positive territory for the second quarter of the year; a welcome change to prior period results."

Over the three years to the end of June, only U.K.-based emerging-market equities and bond funds reported positive average performance, according to BNY Mellon.

U.S. stocks came under pressure after a report showed a slide this month in consumer confidence.

In early afternoon in New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 68.84 points, or 0.7%, at 9043.67.

The Conference Board reported that its index of consumer confidence fell to 46.6 in July from 49.3 in June, a bigger decline than analysts were expecting. That report helped drive stocks lower after major indexes spent early trading moving between small gains and losses.

Energy stocks, including Dow components Exxon Mobil and Chevron, led the market's decline. Exxon Mobil was down 1.2%, while Chevron slipped 1.3%. In London, their rival BP reported a 53% year-to-year drop in net profit as oil prices slumped.

The Nasdaq Composite Index slipped 0.7% to 1954.30 and the Standard &Poor's 500-stock index fell 1% to 972.85, led by declines in its energy, basic-materials and utilities sectors. The slide in the broad measure was softened by a slight gain in health care, which benefited from safe-haven buying and favorable profit news.

Earnings season has dominated traders' attention recently, with most companies beating expectations. Amgen shares rose 2% after it raised its earnings guidance. Coventry Health Care rose 9.8% after lifting its guidance as well.

Shares of SPSS, a Chicago business-analytics company, rose 41% after International Business Machines said it would pay $1.2 billion, or $50 a share, to buy it. IBM, a Dow component, edged 0.6% lower.

Office Depot fell 19% after reporting that its second-quarter loss widened from a year earlier as sales declined. The result fell short of analysts' expectations.

European markets

Key indexes in Europe closed mostly lower as earnings news weighed on prices.

The pan-European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index fell 0.9% to close at 218.54, the U.K.'s FTSE 100 index slipped 1.3% to 4528.84 and the German DAX index slid 1.5% to end at 5174.74. The French CAC-40 index dropped 1.2% to settle at 3330.97.

Deutsche Bank shares fell 11% amid concern over rising charges for bad debts.

Stock in EADS rose 2.3% as second-quarter earnings rose and the aerospace and defense company raised its forecast for cash flow for the year.

Pace of commercial mortgage charge-offs picks up --- Losses of $30 billion possible by year's end; small banks trail big

U.S. banks have been charging off soured commercial mortgages at the fastest pace in nearly 20 years, according to an analysis by The Wall Street Journal. At that rate, losses on loans used to finance offices, shopping malls, hotels, apartments and other commercial property could reach about $30 billion by the end of 2009.

The losses by regional banks on their commercial real-estate loans will be among the most watched details as thousands of banks report second-quarter results over the next two weeks. Many of the most troubled banks have heavy exposure to commercial real estate.

The $30 billion estimate is based on financial reports filed by more than 8,000 banks for the first quarter. The trend continued as a handful of big banks reported second-quarter results, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. and Bank of America Corp. Regional banks tend to have higher exposure to commercial real estate than these big financial institutions.

The commercial real-estate market, valued at about $6.7 trillion, represents 13% of the U.S.'s gross domestic product. But the recession and scarce credit are pushing more commercial developers and investors into default. Meanwhile, property values continue to decline, and banks are required to record a loss on any troubled real-estate loans where the appraised value falls below the amount owed.

Delinquencies on commercial mortgages held by banks more than doubled to about 4.3% in the second quarter from a year earlier, Foresight Analytics estimates. Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D., N.Y.), who heads the House's Joint Economic Committee, said she is on a plan to try to head off rising defaults on commercial mortgages before a crisis.

In contrast to home loans, the majority of which were made by about 10 lenders, thousands of U.S. banks, especially regional and community banks, loaded up on commercial-property debt.

Ironically, small banks appear to be much less aggressive in recognizing losses than their bigger brethren. According to the Journal analysis, the largest banks, with assets of more than $100 billion, saw charge-offs roughly quadruple last year, while losses at many medium-size banks rose at a much smaller rate of 120%.

One monument to both the excessive froth of the real-estate boom and the morning-after headache setting in for lenders is the landmark Equitable Building, rising 33 stories above downtown Atlanta.

In 2007, San Diego real-estate firm Equastone LLC paid $57 million for the office tower and took out a $51.9 million mortgage from Capmark Bank, a Utah unit of Capmark Financial Group Inc. in Horsham, Pa. Equastone planned to expand the tower and attract a tenant with pockets deep enough to rename the building. Shortly after the purchase, the economic slump pushed vacancies higher and rents down. In April, Capmark Bank foreclosed on the building after Equastone defaulted.

In June, the Equitable Building was sold in a foreclosure auction for $29.5 million, 43% less than the original loan. And the buyer? It was 100 Peachtree Street Atlanta, a company formed by Capmark Bank for the purpose of acquiring the building. There were no other bidders.

Steven Nielsen, Capmark Bank's chief executive, said the mortgage was written off to the "estimated value" of the building. He wouldn't specify the size of the related charge-off on Capmark's books. Property-tax records show the building was valued at about $44.8 million at foreclosure, which would equal a $7.1 million loss for the bank.

Some bankers say they feel growing pressures from regulators to take losses on commercial real-estate exposure as a way of reducing the possibility of a catastrophic hit later.

"We recognize losses as quickly as any bank, partly because bank regulators dictate that," said Ed Garding, chief credit officer at First Interstate Bank, of Billings, Mont. More than 40% of the bank's loans are in commercial real estate, but according to the Journal analysis, annualized charge-offs in 2009 would be just 3% of its nonperforming commercial mortgages as of the end of 2008. That compares with an average of 34% for all U.S. banks.

Mr. Garding said the commercial real-estate market has held up relatively well in First Interstate's markets in Montana and Wyoming. Meanwhile, "we're strongly collateralized so the loan doesn't result in a loss," he added.

Among other banks with notably low charge-offs: Based on the Journal study, annualized write-offs this year would be only 9% of all nonperforming commercial mortgages at a Wachovia Corp. unit in Charlotte, N.C. A spokeswoman at Wachovia declined to comment.

At New York Community Bank, a New York State-charted savings bank, that ratio would be a meager 2% in the first quarter. Ilene Angarola, director of investor relations at New York Community Bancorp., the bank holding company, credited the bank's strong underwriting standards. "Even though we have seen a decline in property values, our loan-to-value ratio is conservative enough that we haven't experienced anywhere near the degree of the charge-offs our peers have experienced," Ms. Angarola said.

Some analysts, meanwhile, worry that banks aren't sufficiently recognizing losses on their commercial real-estate loans, thereby exposing themselves to bigger losses later. According to Deutsche Bank AG, since the beginning of last year, the amount of charged-off commercial mortgages as a percentage of such debt outstanding has ranged from a high of 3.2% to as low as 0.3%.

"This is clearly a problem that is being pushed out into the future," said Richard Parkus at Deutsche Bank.

More Index Funds Sought for 401(k)s

By Eleanor Laise

Employers are making it easier for workers in 401(k)s to own low-cost index funds and exchange-traded funds, a move that has implications for the mutual-fund industry.

As it stands, roughly 90% of the $1.5 trillion in 401(k) and other defined-contribution assets in mutual funds are in actively managed offerings. This is the case despite clear evidence from studies that index funds tend to outperform their actively managed rivals.

The stodgy 401(k) world won't change strategies overnight. Fund companies won't easily relinquish their active-management fees, which tend to be higher than those charged on index-tracking products, especially at a time when rocky markets are pinching profits. And actively managed funds tend to do more "revenue sharing," which involves fund companies making payments to plan administrators.

While total index mutual-fund assets jumped 84% over the past six years, the funds grew at a substantially slower pace inside defined-contribution plans.

Still, some big players are betting that the stars will begin realigning.

Money manager BlackRock Inc., known largely for its actively managed products, last month stressed the potential for index funds' growth in retirement plans in announcing its acquisition of indexing giant Barclays Global Investors. BGI is among several firms that recently launched 401(k) programs designed to make it easier for employers to add index-tracking ETFs to their plans.

Ascensus Inc., a large 401(k) recordkeeper, says it has received inquiries from more than 100 employers since adding ETFs to its platform in May.

In a recent survey of about 150 employers by consulting firm Hewitt Associates, 17% of them said they are likely this year to replace some or all of their plan's actively managed investment options with index funds. That is up from 8% a year earlier.

While the largest employers have long had access to the lowest-cost index funds, many small and midsize plans, which have typically been sold pricier funds, are now demanding passively managed products, too.

Service organization Rotary International, for example, last year added more index funds to its $15 million 401(k), helping to reduce plan costs, while Fremont, Calif.-based Accept Software Corp. in recent weeks dumped actively managed funds completely from its $1.5 million plan.

Some smaller plans that don't have the purchasing power to access the lowest-cost index funds on their own are banding together in multiple-employer plans that take a passive approach.

The Hawaii Prosperity Plan is one such index-based multiple-employer plan started earlier this year; it was co-founded by a former active fund manager, Cris Borden, who acknowledges that his own fund trailed its benchmark and says he is now "reformed."

All this occurs as regulators and plan participants take a hard look at 401(k) fees. Poor recent performance by active stock-pickers has forced employers to ask what value their workers are getting from these higher-priced funds.

In a spate of recent lawsuits, workers have claimed their 401(k) plans charged excessive fees and offered actively managed funds that failed to beat cheaper index-tracking alternatives. And a bill working its way through Congress would require clear disclosure of 401(k) fees and effectively mandate that plans offer at least one index fund.

But even including nonmutual-fund 401(k) investment options, such as collective investment funds, growth of indexing strategies in the plans has been relatively modest. Further, total indexed 401(k) assets declined substantially last year as workers fled to stable-value and money-market funds, retirement experts say.

A longer-term factor slowing 401(k) acceptance of index funds is "revenue sharing," experts say. In revenue-sharing arrangements, plan administrative costs are often built into the expenses of funds offered in the plan.

To avoid breaking out these administrative fees separately, which might prompt employers to more closely examine plan costs, plan advisers tend to promote the use of funds -- often actively managed -- that have plenty of revenue sharing to cover all these costs, critics say.

"Obscurity allows fees to stay higher for longer," says Ryan Alfred, the president of 401(k) data and analytics firm Brightscope.

Many retirement-plan experts are hoping the 401(k) fee disclosure bill recently approved by the House Education and Labor Committee will help remedy that. The bill would require plan fees to be broken out into separate categories for administrative, investment management, transaction and other expenses.

With such fee disclosure, employers and employees may well discover that index funds will deliver better returns at a lower cost, says the committee's chairman, Rep. George Miller, a California Democrat. As workers struggle to save, their nest eggs "should not just be the happy hunting grounds for fees and commissions," he says.

The fund industry criticizes the bill, saying the disclosure required would be confusing to participants and costly to prepare and that the government shouldn't be mandating investment options for 401(k) plans.

Ironically, the steep market slide, which spurred many employers to consider index funds for their 401(k)s, also has made some employers reluctant to jostle participants with investment-menu makeovers.

Abrix Group LP, a health-care accounting firm, wanted to shift its 401(k) to a passive approach but didn't want participants temporarily barred from making investment changes -- a typical side effect of a plan makeover -- while stocks were in free fall last year. Now that markets have stabilized somewhat, the plan is switching to a 100% index-fund-and-ETF lineup.

While plenty of obstacles remain, those who have long fought to expand 401(k) plans' use of index funds are relishing some newfound success. Invest n Retire LLC, a 401(k) service provider that started offering ETF-based plans in 2003, managed to attract only about $50 million in assets through the end of last year. But this year, assets are on pace to rise at least tenfold, says Chief Executive Darwin Abrahamson.

Matthew Hutcheson, an independent pension fiduciary, says in the past three months he has met no resistance as he converted three plans to a 100% indexing approach. That is a big change from years past, he says, when he would propose that plans switch to index funds and "people would scream bloody murder."

CIT Rescue Talks Collapse --- Impact on Small Firms Feared if Lender Fails; Stress Test Finds Need for $4 Billion

Ailing business lender CIT Group Inc. said Wednesday "there is no appreciable likelihood" it will receive fresh government support in the near future, marking the first time since the collapse of Lehman Brothers that the U.S. has declined to aid a struggling financial company of significant scope and size.

What happens next will be a major test of whether the financial system and economy are sufficiently healed to absorb CIT's problems.

The company is a source of funding for thousands of small and midsize businesses. It's also a big player providing cash advances to clothing manufacturers and suppliers, and credit to retailers to pay off invoices. The impact could be especially acute in California because of the state's large apparel-import business.

CIT representatives scrambled Wednesday night to line up at least $2 billion in rescue financing from existing debtholders, according to people familiar with the matter. CIT has given the debtholders 24 hours to decide if they will come up with new cash. The company indicated to investors that without the rescue financing, it would likely have to file for bankruptcy protection as more borrowers draw down credit lines, these people said.

In its written statement, issued after the market's close, CIT said it was "evaluating alternatives."

The collapse of the government talks appears to be rooted in CIT's worsening financial situation and disagreements among regulators as to the best way to proceed.

The Federal Reserve conducted a stress test on CIT Tuesday night, much like the ones performed on the nation's largest financial institutions earlier this year. The test found the company would need $4 billion to cover losses under the most stressed economic conditions, people familiar with the matter said.

Government officials suggested they could offer a bridge loan if CIT could convince policy makers it had a solid restructuring plan in place, these people said. Government officials also considered injecting more money into CIT under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, but it is unclear under what conditions. Those talks broke down Wednesday afternoon.

U.S. officials ultimately decided CIT's problems were too severe to be solved by any of the plans under review, said a Treasury spokeswoman. Government officials didn't want to pump more money into the company because it didn't seem to have a viable business plan, she said.

Whatever the eventual outcome, Treasury officials believe they will have lost their entire $2.3 billion investment in CIT, made last year under TARP, the spokeswoman said. That would be the first acknowledged loss of public money injected into financial companies.

The fate of CIT has posed a dilemma for the Obama administration and a test for its stance on bailouts. CIT is much smaller than other firms that received exceptional government assistance, such as Citigroup Inc. and American International Group Inc. Many Washington officials felt it was the type of company that should be allowed to fail.

But its role as a key lender to small businesses, combined with heightened concerns about unemployment, put government officials at odds over how to respond. Some officials worried about being seen to aid big firms while ignoring one that was billing itself as vital to the health of small businesses across the country.

White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel suggested that the decision to cut off CIT is a turning point in the government's financial-industry rescue. "Given the sense of calm, it is a symbol of a different phase," he said.

But the news was unsettling to some businesses. "In a time when the U.S. apparel and footwear industry is experiencing the most gripping credit crunch in memory, I fear this may only further hinder any opportunity for economic recovery," said Kevin Burke, chief executive of the American Apparel &Footwear Association.

Nick Vojnovic, president of Tampa, Fla.-based FSC Franchise Co., said he is now rethinking expansion plans for his family sports-pub chain, Beef 'O' Brady's, which has some 270 pubs across the country, after CIT stopped making new loans to his franchisees last year.

"It's been extremely difficult with them pulling back, and there's no sense that things are loosening up," he said. "If you're trying to raise money to build a restaurant right now, it's virtually impossible."

One possibility raised by analysts and others is that CIT's struggles could spook investors and counterparties in one of its biggest competitors, General Electric Co., which would potentially represent a more complex problem for the government. GE declined to comment.

In a written statement, a Treasury spokeswoman suggested CIT, run by Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Peek, didn't meet the bar for getting emergency aid.

"Even during periods of financial stress, we believe that there is a very high threshold for exceptional government assistance to individual companies," the statement said.

It added that the administration has "a comprehensive and aggressive strategy to restore stability to the financial system as a whole so that credit flows to both businesses and consumers and puts us on a path to sustainable growth."

Treasury officials said they believe CIT's problems won't have as big an impact as some fear because the company had already slowed its lending. Others appear willing to step up and make more loans to small businesses, they said.

In December, the Federal Reserve allowed New York-based CIT to become a bank-holding company, enabling the Treasury to simultaneously pump $2.3 billion of public money into the firm.

But CIT continued to struggle under the limitations of its business model and the woes of its customers in hard-hit areas such as retail, media and commercial real estate, including retailers Eddie Bauer and Filene's Basement, which both sought bankruptcy-court protection.

CIT had relied heavily on funding from capital markets, which have been closed to the lender for the past two years as its credit ratings fell into junk territory. CIT has posted net losses for eight consecutive quarters, and has said it doesn't expect to return to profitability until 2010 at the earliest. It hasn't been able to secure retail deposits fast enough to make up the difference.

Its most recent troubles were prompted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which balked at requests to guarantee the firm's debt. CIT had been banking on that program for its short-term survival.

"CIT needs a massive deleveraging, which would save the company, provide better returns for its unsecured creditors, and certainly be better for the economy and the country," said Jeffrey Werbalowsky, CEO of investment bank Houlihan Lokey, which advised GM and Lehman Brothers bondholders and is pushing to represent CIT bondholders.

Talks with the government were complicated by conflicting signals over who was leading them. Some say Treasury officials were in charge, others say the Federal Reserve headed the talks, while still others say that the main focus was on decisions at the FDIC.

"There are no clear lines of authority about who should do this," said Brian Gardner, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette &Woods. "You have different programs and different authorities, and there is not a clear delineation of who should be dealing with CIT."

Customers, alarmed by news that CIT was preparing for a possible bankruptcy, rushed to draw down on credit lines this week, draining hundred of millions of dollars from the lender and deepening its liquidity crisis.

A review of CIT's loans by Foresight Analytics on behalf of The Wall Street Journal found that CIT's overall delinquency rate was 4.7%, compared with an average of 2.8% for other U.S. lenders. Foresight Analytics, an Oakland, Calif., financial-research firm, analyzed the company's first-quarter filings, and the economy has only worsened since then.

The Obama administration is trying to rework regulation of financial markets to tackle the matter of companies operating on the margins of finance with no clear regulatory supervision.

That framework hasn't been approved by Congress, which means CIT's problems caught government officials flat-footed.

Regulators thought they had moved past the ad hoc rescues that led to near-chaos last fall, and see their current task as cleaning up the problems. The unknown impact of a CIT collapse, however, gave some observers pause.

"If I were at the Fed or Treasury, I would think about: Will we spook the markets if we let this one go?" said Bill Isaac, former chairman of the FDIC. "It's not a time for philosophy. It's a time to be practical."

Barry Sternlicht's Starwood Capital Group, a private-equity firm specializing in real-estate investments, is bidding on assets of Corus Bankshares Inc., according to people familiar with the matter.

"We're bidding on a bank," Mr. Sternlicht said during a conference call with investors in Starwood funds on Monday. Without naming the bank, he said it is heavily concentrated in real-estate lending and has more than 110 construction loans. People with knowledge of the matter identified the bank as Corus.

Starwood is one of several companies that have shown interest in Corus, which concentrated heavily on condominium construction lending in South Florida and other now-troubled housing markets. Investors don't appear to be interested in buying the entire bank, but instead are looking at buying the bank's assets out of receivership if regulators take over.

Mr. Sternlicht declined to name the bank he referred to during the call. He said, however, that Starwood Capital is "looking at many banks. The government is trying to figure out a way to get private-equity firms" to help recapitalize banks. Mr. Sternlicht said on the call that Starwood could benefit from favorable financing provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to acquire assets from troubled banks.

Chicago-based Corus didn't return calls for comment.

Earlier this year, bank regulators gave Corus a June deadline to raise capital or find a buyer, and Corus last month tapped a crisis-management firm that specializes in restructuring distressed, midsize companies. If it were placed into receivership, Corus would represent the first major bank failure brought on by deteriorating commercial real-estate loans in this downturn. Construction loans accounted for 88% of Corus's outstanding loans at the end of the first quarter.

More than half of the bank's $3.9 billion in condo construction loans were in nonaccrual or foreclosure at the end of March.

Corus's potential liquidation is expected to set off a scramble among investors for some of the bank's individual properties, which are generally seen as high-quality products. Other possible bidders have included real-estate developer Related Cos., of New York, and private-equity firm Colony Capital LLC, of Los Angeles. Buyers with a long-term view could hold the properties as rental apartments until the market recovers.

Fifty-three U.S. banks have failed this year. Corus's failure could cost the government between $1 billion and $1.9 billion in losses, depending upon the performance of the bank's outstanding loans, according to estimates by Foresight Analytics.

Real-Estate Finance: Sale-Leaseback Sticker Shock

By David A. Graham

NEW YORK -- Demand for corporate sale-leaseback real-estate transactions is picking up across the U.S. as companies seek a fast way to raise cash to ride out the recession. But a scarcity of buyers and low bids mean fewer deals are actually getting done. Sale-leaseback transactions -- where a company sells its office building, plant or other property and then leases it back from the new owner -- is an alternative form of financing that some companies turn to when traditional financing, such as bank loans, are harder to obtain. During the first five months of this year, the value of U.S. sale-leaseback transactions declined to $853 million, compared with nearly $3 billion in the year-earlier period, according to Real Capital Analytics, which tracks deals greater than $5 million.

Part of the drop in transaction value reflects lower real-estate values, but the biggest issue is that buyers and sellers are so far apart on price that many transactions fizzle when sellers walk away. Just 63 deals were completed between January and May, compared with 174 in the first five months of2008, according to Real Capital Analytics.

"It's the pricing," says David Steinwedell, a managing partner of AIC Ventures in Austin, Texas, which buys properties via sale-leaseback transactions. "There's some sticker shock for sellers, the same as there is with houses right now."

AIC, which specializes in properties owned by manufacturers with low investment-grade credit ratings, expects $5 billion in potential deals to cross his desk this year, up from $3 billion in 2008. In addition, Mr. Steinwedell says many of the companies seeking to sell properties to AIC are healthier and in more stable industries than those in the past.

That, of course, is great news for AIC and other buyers, which say they are seeing the best bargains since the early 2000s. "It's a fantastic time to be in the market," says Mr. Steinwedell, who expects to purchase about $300 million in property this year. With so many transactions on the market, "we're able to be highly selective in both markets and companies themselves."

Shelby Pruett, managing principal of Chicago-based private-equity company Equity Capital Management, which focuses on acquiring office buildings from companies with investment-grade credit ratings, says his firm is doing deals that "couldn't have been done in terms of pricing and terms" a few years ago.

In one of the largest sale-leasebacks this year, New York Times Co. in March raised $225 million for debt relief by completing a sale-leaseback with New York sale-leaseback firm W.P. Carey &Co. for 21 floors of its 52-floor headquarters building in Manhattan.

The terms of deal stunned some would-be sellers who thought the price was unusually low. W.P. Carey paid around $300 a square foot. In comparison, the mean price for comparable Class-A office real estate in New York was an average $839 a square foot last year and $434 a square foot in the first quarter of 2009, according to Reis Inc., a real-estate-research firm. W.P. Carey said the New York Times deal carried an unusually deep discount because the deal gives the company an option to buy back the space for $250 million at the end of the leaseback in 2019.

Meanwhile, the number of buyers has fallen sharply due to the credit crunch. And with fewer bidders, there is less competition to drive up prices. "For people expecting pricing and leverage levels to revert, I don't think that's a realistic expectation," says Benjamin Harris, W.P. Carey's head of domestic investments.

Two of the largest participants in sale-leaseback financing last year, iStar Financial Inc. and First Industrial Realty Trust, have been sidelined by their own financial problems. First Industrial Realty Trust has decided not to seek new deals this year in order to retain capital, according to a spokesman. IStar didn't respond to requests for comment.

That leaves just two or three large firms, including W.P. Carey and Angelo, Gordon &Co., along with smaller companies such as AIC, Equity Capital and Mesirow Financial.

The dearth of buyers is making it difficult for companies like Atlanta-based furniture retailer Havertys to get the prices for which they had originally hoped.

Haverty Furniture Cos. Chief Financial Officer Dennis Fink said Havertys began marketing one of its stores in July but saw a potential deal grind to a temporary halt amid worries about the economy. By the time the sale was completed, they sold an approximately 45,000-square-foot store at a prime location in Charlotte, N.C., for $6.8 million in February. "We had somewhat higher expectations" in July, Mr. Fink says. He wouldn't disclose what it cost Havertys to build the store -- the land was bought for about $2 million in 2000 -- but said the deal brought a modest profit.

BlackRock's Fed Fees: $42 Million

Money-management firm BlackRock Inc. is set to earn tens of millions of dollars for managing assets that once belonged to Bear Stearns Cos. and American International Group Inc.

BlackRock will earn minimum asset-management fees of $42 million in the first year for running three vehicles holding mortgage-related securities and other investments, according to agreements recently posted on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Web site. The money manager also will get one-time advisory, analytics and structuring fees of $13.5 million, according to the agreements.

The first vehicle, Maiden Lane, was established by the Federal Reserve to fund the purchase of mortgage-related holdings from Bear Stearns. The other two vehicles, Maiden Lane II and III, were set up as part of the Fed's support for AIG.

BlackRock is playing a role in a number of government programs designed to stabilize the financial system. The company was one of nine managers tapped by the Treasury to buy toxic securities from financial institutions as part of the Public-Private Investment Program.

Lawmakers have raised questions about the lack of competition in awarding contracts to manage the Bear Stearns and AIG assets. In the case of selecting BlackRock to manage the Bear Stearns assets, "we had to move very, very quickly in that time frame, and we believed at that moment we had no alternative," Timothy Geithner, then-nominee for Treasury secretary, told a Senate panel in January.

The New York Fed performed a confidential review of the fees BlackRock charges public and private clients, and the Maiden Lane contracts were priced accordingly, said a Fed official.

BlackRock "fully supports disclosure of fees and terms across all of the Federal Reserve's advisers," BlackRock spokeswoman Bobbie Collins said, adding that the Maiden Lane fees "are significantly lower than commercial rates."

Deal of the Week: Denver Icon for Sale As New Benchmarks Help Check Out Prices

By Maura Webber Sadovi

The owners of Denver's iconic cash-register building could be inching closer to ringing up a sale for as much as $330 million, people close to the transaction say.

The 52-story granite and glass building, designed by Philip Johnson and John Burge and completed in 1983, was nicknamed after its distinctive top that looks like it could be at the end of a checkout line. It has collected about 10 written bids from interested buyers in the past month or so. Now about 96% leased and with Wells Fargo &Co. as one of its largest tenants, the 1.2 million-square-foot building formally known as the Wells Fargo Center was put on the block early this year by Macquarie Office Trust, an Australia real-estate investment trust.

If there is a deal, and there isn't any guarantee there will be one in this turbulent market, brokers believe it would be in the $290 million to $330 million range, and most estimate it will be at the lower end of that range. Back in 2006, Macquarie purchased an 80% stake in the building in a deal that valued the building at $355 million, according to Real Capital Analytics, a real-estate-research firm. The seller at that time was Maguire Properties of Los Angeles, which retained ownership of 20% of the property through a joint venture. Macquarie and Maguire declined to comment on the proposed sale.

So far, Macquarie has met the bids with radio silence. That has led to speculation from some brokers that the deal has stalled because the sellers aren't satisfied with a potential sale price that barely covers the building's debt. About $275 million in debt is secured by the building, say people close to the transaction.

The potential transaction's halting progress also highlights the interconnection of regional U.S. real-estate markets. Some sellers, scrambling to raise cash, are scouring the country for new benchmarks to help them weigh which properties to cut loose from their portfolios -- and for what price -- as values have slumped because of the recession. "Market participants are trying to get comfortable with where true values reside," says Dan Fasulo, a managing director at Real Capital Analytics. "Every additional sale brings us closer to consensus."

The Australian seller may be looking to gain some traction by closing another deal roughly 1,000 miles away from Denver's Wells Fargo building, in Los Angeles. Macquarie won't turn its attention to selling the Denver building until it unloads the L.A. building, people close to the transaction say. That strategy may in part reflect its wish to gauge pricing patterns, though it also could be an internal decision related to financial demands it faces or an effort to marshal limited negotiating resources, brokers say.

It is likely the Los Angeles benchmark will be sobering. Macquarie and Maguire are negotiating to sell One California Plaza, a trophy tower in downtown L.A.'s Bunker Hill submarket, to Metropolitan Real Estate Investors LLC for somewhere between $200 million and $240 million, people close to the transaction say. The Bunker Hill area is popular with financial companies and law firms and home to Frank Gehry's Walt Disney Concert Hall. The price range it is expected to fetch is well below the $325 million value placed on the building when Macquarie bought a majority stake in it in 2006. Metropolitan, which didn't respond to requests for comment, also owns the Lipstick Building in New York.

In Denver, Macquarie's negotiators recently got a substantial peg on how far values have fallen in the Mile High city. Seventeenth Street Plaza, a 666,653 square-foot building located along a corridor popular with financial firms, was sold last month by J.P. Morgan Asset Management for about $135 million. While it was the biggest office sale so far this year in Denver, it didn't provide much of a bargaining chip for Macquarie. The J.P. Morgan Chase unit paid about the same price for the building, which is 93% leased, when it bought the property in 2000, before the most recent real-estate boom.

Mary Sullivan, an executive vice president with CB Richard Ellis in Denver who represented J.P. Morgan in the sale, says the deal translates into a capitalization rate of about 8.5% to 9%, well above the 4% range seen at the peak of the market two or so years ago. A so-called cap rate is a closely watched metric used to value buildings derived by dividing a building's annual net operating income by the price paid. The rate has been on the rise nationwide in part because buyers can no longer assume rents will rise as they did at the market's peak. Rents are falling and vacancies rising in Denver, though the metro area's first-quarter vacancy rate was 16.2%, compared with a national average of 17.5% for the major markets surveyed by Property &Portfolio Research Inc., a real-estate-research firm.

"It's good to see people are still interested in Denver as a long-term play," says Sam DePizzol, a senior vice president with CB Richard Ellis in Denver, referring to the Seventeenth Street Plaza sale. "But it was a steal."

Berkshire culls reinsurance --- Credit-rating cut, limited cash hammer catastrophe coverage

By Scott Patterson

Berkshire Hathaway's reinsurance business, a big profit center for the diversified company, has pulled back from one of the more volatile corners of the reinsurance market: catastrophic property damage.

In recent years, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group made a push into the profitable business, in essence writing insurance for other insurers that wished to offload some exposure to big losses like hurricane damage. Just a few years ago, Berkshire pulled in $2.2 billion in premiums on a year that saw no major storms.

But recently, Berkshire has become more cash-constrained. Its retreat in "cat" reinsurance suggests it has become more risk averse amid a recent downgrade to its credit rating, a series of hits to Berkshire's bottom line and ongoing turmoil in the economy.

In May, at the company's annual meeting in Omaha, Neb., Berkshire Chairman Warren Buffett said the company is "doing less natural risk in terms of hurricanes because . . . we don't have as much excess capital as we had a couple years ago." At the end of the first quarter, Berkshire had slightly less than $20 billion in cash, its lowest level in years.

The crucial midyear renewals period for catastrophe insurance policies in June and early July demonstrated Berkshire's curtailed presence, market participants say.

"It's apparent that they've reduced their property-cat exposure," said James Kent, executive vice president at Willis Re, the reinsurance unit of Willis Group Holdings Ltd.

Mr. Buffett and Ajit Jain, his chief reinsurance lieutenant, declined to comment.

Cat policies are risky for insurers, which can be on the hook for billions if a catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina hits. And these events are impossible to predict. But Mr. Buffett has said he believes Berkshire gets well paid for taking that risk.

Earlier in this decade, Messrs. Buffett and Jain leveraged the conglomerate's top-shelf credit ratings and vast cash hoard to become a major player in the market.

"If prices seem appropriate . . . we continue to have both the ability and the appetite to be the largest writer of mega-cat coverage in the world," Mr. Buffett wrote in his annual letter to shareholders in 2006.

Over the last two years, Berkshire continued to be a player, but the market for reinsurance softened, contributing to a decline in the premiums the company took in.

In 2008, Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance pulled in $955 million in premiums in catastrophe and individual risk reinsurance, down from $1.6 billion in 2007 and $2.2 billion in 2006. That year, the amount Berkshire could command for reinsurance surged following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005.

This year, due to Berkshire's changing risk posture, the decline is expected to be the biggest yet, analysts say.

A factor behind Berkshire's stance could be a game plan to improve its credit rating. In April, Moody's Investors Service lowered Berkshire's long-term issuer rating, a gauge of its ability to meet long-term commitments, to Aa2 from its top Aaa rating, citing the economic downturn and big stock-market decline that pounded Berkshire's investment portfolio.

In its credit opinion, Moody's also cited the potential volatility of Berkshire's "catastrophe-exposed business." Berkshire is a major investor in Moody's Corp., parent of the ratings group.

It is not clear how, if at all, the pullback will affect Berkshire's earnings. Messrs. Buffett and Jain might be finding better opportunities elsewhere, notes Morningstar analyst Bill Bergman. If so, that could offset the decline in premiums from the property catastrophe side of the ledger.

Another reason Berkshire could be holding back is that prices for this type of insurance are lower than they were in 2006 and 2007, when Berkshire was writing far more policies. While premiums for hurricane coverage are up, prices for other forms of catastrophe coverage, such as earthquake reinsurance, have been relatively flat, says Bryon Ehrhart, chief executive of insurance advisory service Aon Benfield Analytics, who also has noted the pullback by Berkshire. Struggling companies have cut back on insurance, in turn leading to less demand for reinsurance.

Given concerns about its ratings, Berkshire might need to see far more attractive pricing to be enticed.

If Berkshire's finances improve, in part thanks to an improved stock market, that could reenergize its approach to the business. The stock market rebound during the second quarter should provide a roughly 20% boost in Berkshire's investment portfolio. A higher book value and a rising cash stockpile could eventually lead to a reinstatement of Berkshire's Aaa rating, though Moody's isn't likely to reverse itself soon.

If and when Berkshire wins back a higher rating, that could pave the way for the company to move aggressively back into the property catastrophe market.

International Invetsor: Vornado makes a big bet on distressed properties --- REIT seeks to raise private-equity fund totaling $1 billion

Vornado Realty Trust, one of the biggest real-estate investment trusts in the U.S., is seeking to raise $1 billion for a private-equity fund to invest in the wave of distressed properties expected to hit in the next few years.

The move signals that Vornado, which has one of the industry's most respected management teams, believes it can raise equity more cheaply from private investors than in the public market. But the company risks dismaying shareholders who hoped Vornado would use its investing expertise to do deals on its own balance sheet.

Vornado says the proposed fund, Vornado Capital Partners LP, would be the company's "exclusive vehicle for real-estate and real-estate-related investments," according to a presentation to potential investors that was reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. In the presentation, Vornado said the fund would aim to generate returns of over 20% by taking advantage of distress in the real-estate market. Vornado would focus on office and retail properties in New York and Washington.

The company would provide 20% of the capital in the fund. That means Vornado would generate management fees and a big chunk of any profits. But if Vornado hits a home run, much of the profit would go to private investors, as opposed to Vornado's common shareholders.

"This has long been a company that has created an awful lot of value by taking advantage of opportunities on its own balance sheet," said Green Street Advisors analyst Mike Kirby. "If you're bringing in outside partners, granted you can make outsize fees, but the challenge will be convincing [shareholders] that those fees are as lucrative as the opportunities themselves."

For Vornado Chairman Steven Roth and Chief Executive Michael Fascitelli, the fund is a chance to do more of the bottom-of-the-market deals that made the company successful after previous downturns. As an example, in the early 1990s, Mr. Roth made a bet on Alexander's, a bankrupt Manhattan retailer, that paid off years later when the Bloomberg LP headquarters was built on Alexander's land. Messrs. Roth and Fascitelli declined to comment on the proposed fund.

Some analysts believe other bargains will emerge as real-estate deals completed at the top of the market return to the market at much cheaper prices. On Friday, a partnership led by developer George Comfort &Sons agreed to buy Worldwide Plaza in Manhattan from Deutsche Bank AG for about $600 million. According to Real Capital Analytics, the building was purchased in 2007 for $1.74 billion by developer Harry Macklowe. Unable to refinance short-term debt, Mr. Macklowe handed back control of Worldwide and six other Manhattan skyscrapers to lenders led by Deutsche Bank.

Analysts believe Vornado is well positioned to ride out the real-estate downturn. The company played defense by raising $710 million through a stock offering in April.

In all, REITs raised some $13 billion in the stock market this spring. Much went to pay down loans, but analysts and REIT executives have said they expect REITs to continue raising capital in the public market to buy properties from distressed landlords. "Most smart observers feel like the cheapest capital for the next few years is going to be in the public market, not the private market," Mr. Kirby said.

Vornado's move appears to counter that view. The company will try to tap private investors, a tall order in today's market. "Vornado has some marquee strength because of the people," said Geoffrey Dohrmann, who heads Institutional Real Estate Inc., an industry consulting firm. But "a lot of folks are feeling that while there are going to be tremendous opportunities, they haven't unfolded in wholesale fashion yet, and there's no penalty for waiting."

Mr. Dohrmann said some institutional investors still have money to invest. And he argued that an opportunity fund is the best structure to invest in distressed real estate, which may not generate cash flow for years.

Yet Vornado faces a tough fund-raising environment. Many pension funds and endowments doubled down on highly leveraged real-estate "opportunity funds" during this decade's boom. Those are now posting dismal returns.

Michael Restuccia, chairman of the San Joaquin County Employees' Retirement Association in California, said the pension fund isn't looking to commit new money to real estate. The fund had $136 million invested in real estate at the end of 2008, and Mr. Restuccia isn't happy with the results. "I'm very disappointed with all of these real-estate funds," he said. "I'm not so sure that I have enough confidence that somebody's going to be able to go out there and convince me that they're getting such a great buy."

Subprime Resurfaces As Housing-Market Woe --- In Atlanta, a Foreclosure Dichotomy Threatens Homes Values

By Carrick Mollenkamp

The U.S. housing market is facing new downward pressure as holders of subprime-mortgage bonds flood the market with foreclosed homes at prices that are much lower than where many banks are willing to sell.

While nationwide figures are scarce, a review of thousands of foreclosures in the Atlanta area shows that trusts managing pools of securitized mortgages sold six times as many properties as banks during the six months ended March 31. And homes dumped by subprime bondholders sold for thousands of dollars less on average than bank-owned properties, the data show.

Experts say this is a bad omen for residential real-estate prices and homeowners trying to sell or refinance, because the fire sales, many to cover soured subprime loans, put downward pressure on the value of nearby homes. All of this undermines federal efforts to stabilize the housing market and revive the broader economy.

"While the banks are trying frantically to get loans off their books, they face the problem of large shadow inventories of housing being dumped on the market, which would depress prices further," said Anthony Sanders, real-estate finance professor at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va.

In the Atlanta area, hit hard by foreclosures and declining home values in the past two years, mortgage-backed securitization entities completed 6,260 foreclosures in last year's fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2009, according to data compiled by Data Intelligence Corp., a Marietta, Ga., real-estate analytics firm which reviewed the records for The Wall Street Journal. That was more than double the 2,737 foreclosures by banks in the same period.

Of those foreclosures, securitization entities sold 2,963 homes during the same period for an average of 62% of the original loan amount. Banks unloaded just 442 of the homes they foreclosed upon, with an average selling price of 69% of the original loan amount.

There still is much more inventory that mortgage-servicing firms are racing to sell for securitization trusts. Such entities tend to sell in bulk so that they can cut losses, finding it more cost-efficient to move homes through foreclosure and subsequent sale than to try to restructure the mortgage with the borrower. Securitization trusts also realize that potential buyers won't step in unless the price is attractive.

"You have to haircut that in a big way," said Christopher Marinac, managing principal at FIG Partners, a bank-research firm in Atlanta.

According to Karen Weaver, global head of securitization research at Deutsche Bank AG, the steepest losses are on subprime loans, where lenders generally are recovering just 26% of the original loan amount.

Analysts said Atlanta is typical of a pattern that is emerging across the U.S. In the first quarter, Atlanta had the 35th-highest foreclosure rate out of 203 metropolitan areas with a population of at least 200,000, according to RealtyTrac Inc. Nine Georgia banks have failed so far this year.

On a nationwide basis, foreclosures were started on a record high of nearly 1.4% of all first-lien mortgages in the first quarter, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. U.S. home prices in 20 major cities fell an average of 0.6% in April, a smaller decline than March's drop of 2.2%, according to the Standard &Poor's/Case-Shiller index released last week.

Residential mortgage-backed securities helped feed the subprime boom, winding up in the hands of investment funds or in more complicated pools known as collateralized debt obligations, where underlying mortgage pools were ultimately sliced into different risk tranches. Insurance contracts known as credit-default swaps often were sold on top of the CDOs.

Securities sold by Bear Stearns Cos., Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and Merrill Lynch &Co., companies that filed for bankruptcy protection or were sold in the past 14 months, included residential loans from Atlanta.

In March, the mortgage-processing firm that works on behalf of a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. mortgage trust sold a house in southwest Atlanta for $17,000 -- a markdown of 87% from the original loan value. A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment.

In the fourth and first quarters, Bear-issued trusts sold 29 properties in Fulton County, which includes Atlanta, for a total of $3.5 million. That was 60% of the combined original loan amounts of $5.8 million.

The loans were pooled in the vehicle during a period of Bear securitizations that were sold to investors prior to the firm's sale to J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. a little more than a year ago.

A J.P. Morgan spokesman said the depressed prices are representative of a housing market correcting itself in a period that is vastly different from a few years ago. Many of the regions facing the largest declines in value are the same ones that soared and saw a frenzy of construction during the housing boom.

In comparison, Countrywide Financial Corp., now owned by Bank of America Corp., completed the sale of 23 properties in Fulton for $3.7 million, or 86% of the original loan amount during the same time period, the real-estate records analyzed by Data Intelligence show.

A Bank of America spokesman said prices being fetched in the Atlanta area for the Countrywide portfolio reflect a reluctance to dump properties far below prevailing market values. The bank is getting an average of 99% of the appraised value of homes on an average sale, while selling within one year 99% of the properties that end up on its books.

"We see local and regional banks having to withstand continued devaluation pressure from the disposition of mortgage-backed securitized properties," said Mason Maynard, founder of Data Intelligence.

The good news is that at least foreclosed homes are moving -- up to a point. And buyers of houses being dumped by securitized trusts are getting a very good deal. Late last year, for example, a property at 1169 Old Fincher Trail in Cherokee County, Ga., that was in a Bear trust was foreclosed on, Data Intelligence said. The original loan was $292,000. When the owners couldn't keep up with the payments, the home fell into foreclosure.

Realtor Tim Hamill of Re/Max Greater Atlanta, who was handling the sale for an asset-management firm working on behalf of the trust, said his mandate had been to sell homes in 30 days.

Greg Foster, a neighbor who built the home 13 years ago, saw an opportunity to buy it for his 25-year-old daughter, Ashleigh, a nurse and single mother of two children. When she wasn't able to secure financing in time, her grandfather bought the house for $164,000 -- or 56% of the original loan amount -- and then sold it to Ms. Foster.

MSCI Inc.'s fiscal second-quarter profit rose 5.3% on higher revenue and lower operating expenses.

For the three-month period ended May 31, MSCI posted income of $19.6 million, or 19 cents a share, up from $18.6 million, or 18 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue increased 1.1% to $109.4 million and operating expenses fell 3.4%. Subscription revenue rose 4.7%, although stock-index asset-based fees fell 17%.

Chairman and Chief Executive Henry Fernandez said a recovery in revenue from exchange-traded-fund licenses, as well as expense management, contributed to what he called a "strong financial performance." He said the frequency of client inquiries increased and the tone of client dialogue improved, but said the improvement hasn't yet contributed meaningfully to subscription sales.

But Mr. Fernandez said the company's retention rate still is under pressure as many of its clients have budget constraints.

MSCI produces indexes that track stocks, and is best known for its MSCI international stock indexes. It also produces risk and return analytics for use by portfolio managers.

Most of its revenue comes from annual subscriptions, while another source is generated from licensing fees charged to other companies that create investing products linked to MSCI's indexes, such as exchange-traded funds.

In 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, MSCI's shares rose 67 cents, or 2.8%, to $24.74.

In May, as part of its capital-raising efforts, Morgan Stanley raised $595.7 million as it sold off its remaining 27.7 million shares of MSCI, which went public via a November 2007 initial public offering.

U.S. News: Unemployment Vexes Foreclosure Plan

By Ruth Simon and James R. Hagerty

Rising unemployment is complicating the Obama administration's effort to reduce foreclosures and stabilize the housing market.

The first wave of mortgage delinquencies was sparked by borrowers who took out subprime mortgages and other risky loans that became unaffordable, causing them to fall behind on their monthly payments. But the current wave is increasingly driven by unemployment or underemployment, economists and housing counselors say.

The Obama foreclosure-prevention plan was "built around the subprime crisis model, not the unemployment crisis model," said Michael van Zalingen, director of homeownership services for the nonprofit Neighborhood Housing Services of Chicago.

The Obama program provides financial incentives to mortgage-servicing companies and investors to reduce mortgage-related payments to 31% of monthly income.

But many borrowers don't have sufficient income to qualify for a loan modification under the plan. Mr. van Zalingen said roughly 45% of the more than 900 borrowers who sought help at two recent counseling events would fall into that category even if their interest rate were dropped to 2% and their loan term were extended to 40 years.

Many of those unqualified borrowers suffered job losses or a reduction in income, Mr. van Zalingen said. Roughly 27% of borrowers who called the mortgage industry's national "Hope Hotline" in the second quarter of 2009 cited unemployment as the primary or secondary reason for their mortgage problems, up from 9.7% in the second quarter of 2008.

The administration is considering making changes to the loan-modification program to address the current employment landscape.

"We recognize that unemployment is a significant complicating factor," said Deputy Assistant Treasury Secretary Seth Wheeler. "We are studying what more we can do."

The Obama program currently calls on mortgage-servicing companies to consider options other than loan modifications for borrowers who can't qualify for them for a range of reasons, including loss of income.

One possibility is a forbearance plan that allows borrowers to hold off from making mortgage payments for several months while they look for work. But there are no specific guidelines for determining who should get forbearance and for how long.

The administration is weighing whether it should provide more specific guidelines for how mortgage companies should work with borrowers who have lost their jobs but are believed to be good candidates for re-employment. It is also considering providing additional incentives to encourage servicers to offer forbearance plans.

Several Federal Reserve economists, meanwhile, have suggested the government pay a share of the mortgage payment, for a limited time, for borrowers who see a significant disruption in their income.

Other options include providing short-term loans to borrowers who have lost jobs, or giving special treatment to borrowers likely to become re-employed soon. Administration officials haven't taken a position on these options, and said each brings its own challenges.

The rise in unemployment-related delinquencies comes as 20 mortgage-servicing companies are ramping up efforts to modify troubled loans under the Obama plan. More than 200,000 borrowers have received modification offers under the program, which could help as many as four million borrowers, according to administration officials.

Housing counselors say that modifications under the plan are producing substantial payment reductions for some borrowers. But they complain that many are being kept waiting for help as mortgage-servicing companies get up to speed.

In the meantime, there are signs the overall mortgage-delinquency problem is getting worse. The percentage of mortgage loans that were at least 30 days past due but not yet in foreclosure climbed to a record 8.49% in May, up from 8.08% in April and 5.66% a year earlier, according to LPS Applied Analytics.

TARP's Legacy of Winners and Losers

It is no longer a five-alarm fire. But the blaze hasn't left the banking sector altogether.

The Treasury announced Tuesday that some large banks can now pay back the emergency equity investments made last October under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. It was a landmark moment, suggesting a meltdown of the financial system has been avoided.

One benefit of TARP was that it bought time for banks to repair their balance sheets by issuing large amounts of new stock. That strengthened the overall system. It punished shareholders, through dilution, who had turned a blind eye to excessive risk.

Today's higher capital ratios are a rebuke to regulators who long blessed inadequate buffers.

But it would be overly confident to say terminating TARP presages a quick return to health. More likely, the system still faces an old-fashioned banking-sector crunch that usually occurs in a recession.

One of the hallmarks of such a crunch is that you can have winners and clear-cut losers. In a sense, the winners are those firms that announced they can pay back TARP, like J.P. Morgan Chase and American Express.

Of course, being in the winners' camp may not always feel like victory. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group, among the early repayers, now operate under tougher regulation and have retreated from nosebleed leverage ratios.

Meanwhile, because of the boom's excesses, there was always going to be big losers. Unbelievably, Tier 1 capital ratios for Bank of America and Citigroup declined 21% and 17%, respectively, during 2007. So, in a sense, TARP merely put certain banks where they should have been going into a recession.

Because of this, some of TARP's losers should emerge intact, including BofA.

It took two large government investments totaling $45 billion, but the bank could repay TARP by year-end.

For investors, the post-TARP outlook is most confusing for Citi and Wells Fargo. The former is unique because it likely is the only large bank that will end up with the government owning a large slug of voting common stock.

Other shareholders may fear government interference will hurt the bank. For instance, Sheila Bair at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. is pressing for a management shake-up. Then again, the government may feel changes will maximize the value of its stake.

Wells is in better shape than Citi or BofA, but it isn't repaying TARP yet. At 8.3%, Wells's Tier 1 ratio is lower than most of its peers, and may drop if it pays back its $25 billion of TARP without raising an equivalent amount of new equity. That would limit its room for maneuver. And any big earnings disappointments could force the bank into more equity offerings.

The New iPhone Polishes Up Apple

Pity Palm. Just days after its much-hyped new Pre phone hit the market, the iPhone is again dominating the headlines.

It says a lot about Apple's marketing power that it was able to divert attention from the Pre with largely expected announcements about a new version of the iPhone and a price cut for the old model.

The aggressive pricing move was a sensible step to maintain the iPhone's momentum. Its global smart-phone market share doubled to 10.2% in the first quarter from a year earlier. It expanded faster than its bigger rival Research In Motion, which makes the BlackBerry, according to Strategy Analytics.

But as the Pre shows, competition is heating up.

The iPhone is important for Apple's bottom line. It generated 19% of Apple's net sales in the March quarter, although its true significance is greater. Apple recognizes iPhone revenue over a 24-month period.

While Apple has long targeted the premium end of the market, it already has shown a willingness to cut prices, Majestic Research analyst Richard Klugman notes. Apple cut the price of its Shuffle iPod to $49 and introduced new cheaper iPods as SanDisk was offering cheap alternatives. It worked: Apple's share of the MP3 player market rose a point to 71% in the first quarter from a year earlier, while SanDisk's dropped, according to NPD Group.

Apple is trading at what appears to be a pricey 26 times 2009 earnings. But Barclays Capital estimates the multiple falls to 14 if iPhone revenue is recognized immediately and Apple's $32 a share in cash is stripped out.

It may be worth taking another bite of the Apple.

Winding Down Armageddon

The sharp rise in short-dated government-bond yields marks a shift in investor strategies: The global Armageddon trade is being unwound.

Investors this year have made huge gains betting on a steepening of government-bond yield curves. They bought short-dated bonds, betting yields would remain low thanks to accommodative monetary policy and continued risk aversion. And they shorted longer-dated bonds, expecting yields would rise due to inflation fears and massive government-bond supply.

By June 4, the gap between two-year and 10-year Treasury yields had widened to 2.74 percentage points from 1.33 percentage points at the start of the year. Investors could have juiced this gain with leverage.

But Friday's better-than-expected U.S. jobs data caused investors to rush to lock in profits by unwinding the trade, as they were reminded the Federal Reserve will ultimately have to start withdrawing its financial stimulus. That pushed short-dated yields higher, a move exaggerated to the point that the market appears to be betting interest rates could rise by the end of the year.

Curves also have been steepening in the corporate-credit market. However, unwinding an old trade isn't the same as putting on a new one. While investors have locked in big profits unwinding the Armageddon trade, that doesn't mean they are betting on a vigorous recovery.

Barrel of Oil

For Sputtering

M&A Engine

Amid rising energy prices, the sector's dormant mergers-and-acquisition market is waking up. About $10 billion of announced and rumored transactions has surfaced this week. It is life, but not as we know it.

Two situations involve Iraq. London-listed Heritage Oil is merging with Turkey's Genel Energi to form the largest Kurdistan-focused exploration-and-production company.

Heritage is paying roughly $2.6 billion in stock, which has tripled in value since the start of the year. In return, it gets cash flow from Genel's producing fields and, with a pro forma market capitalization of more than $5 billion, according to RBC Capital Markets, a shot at joining the FTSE 100 index.

Meanwhile, several Chinese and Korean state-linked companies are said to be sniffing around Canada's Addax Petroleum, valued at C$6.7 billion ($6 billion) and active in Kurdistan and West Africa. The Chinese, in particular, want direct access to energy sources and enjoy support from a wealthy government.

The international oil majors are conspicuous by their absence. They have good reason to avoid Kurdistan, however. Foreign companies entering into deals there risk being blacklisted by Baghdad for bigger potential transactions elsewhere in the country.

The majors also are absent from a couple of recent deals in the U.S. unconventional natural-gas sector, the latest being Kohlberg Kravis Roberts's $350 million investment in closely held East Resources.

For the majors, such deals are too small to move the needle. Meanwhile, the run-up in commodities prices has taken financial pressure off some of the larger prey they might target. If anything, a little cooling off in energy markets might help kick off more deals.

Overheard

Looking for clarity on what the Web does to Hollywood? Don't ask Sanford C. Bernstein. Tuesday two Bernstein analysts published reports on the subject that flatly contradicted each other. Internet analyst Jeff Lindsay asserted that "online video has become a widespread phenomenon." He cited a survey showing half the respondents watched TV or movies over the Web.

Twenty-three minutes later, a report from media analyst Michael Nathanson said, "the intense focus on this issue is materially overstated." He noted that "technology analysts" were "perhaps the greatest advocates of the Web as an emerging (and soon to be dominant) form of video distribution." But, citing different research, he argued "current consumption appears greatly exaggerated."

The reports highlight internal differences that were displayed at a Bernstein conference last month. Three cheers for independent research.

The Property Report
In a Hunt for Cash, Macerich Looks to Sell Stakes --- While Competitors Issue More Stock, Mall Owner Wagers That Parting With Parts of Some Assets Is a Better Idea

By Kris Hudson

As other real-estate companies sell piles of stock to raise capital, debt-heavy mall owner Macerich Co. is betting that it can do better for its shareholders by selling stakes in some of its malls first.

Macerich, a real-estate investment trust that owns and manages 72 U.S. malls, intends to cinch two deals within the next two to three months to raise at least $350 million and perhaps as much as $600 million by selling stakes in a few of its malls, including the Queens Center mall on New York's Long Island. The Santa Monica, Calif.-based REIT hasn't identified its potential partners, but people familiar with the talks say the investors are pension funds.

Macerich's strategy, as outlined by Chairman and Chief Executive Art Coppola, hinges on whether the REIT can get joint-venture partners to pay a higher price for stakes in certain Macerich malls than the REIT's stock now implies its portfolio is worth. In short, the deals under discussion assign a capitalization rate for the properties of between 7% and 8.5%, while the current value of Macerich's stock implies an average cap rate for the REIT's portfolio of 9.4%.

The capitalization rate, often used to measure the value of income-producing properties, is the net operating income in the first year of ownership divided by the property's purchase price. A high cap rate generally indicates a low price paid for the asset; a low cap rate indicates a high price.

Macerich's stock, which closed at $20.53 Tuesday in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, down 1%, has declined about 70% in the past year because of investors' concerns about Macerich's ability to refinance chunks of its $7.9 billion debt load as they come due. Thus, the stock implies a higher cap rate -- and, by extension, a lower price -- for Macerich's assets than the REIT might actually get by selling stakes in various assets.

"They can get more on Main Street for their real estate right now than they can on Wall Street, but only for their best assets," said Jim Sullivan, an analyst with Green Street Advisors Inc.

That discrepancy is what has kept Macerich so far from joining many other REITs that have sold loads of new common stock to raise capital to reduce debt, though Macerich said last month that it might eventually sell as much as $500 million of stock as its final step in retiring as much as $2 billion in debt. Among the REITs that recently sold stock is shopping-center owner Kimco Realty Corp., which in April sold 105 million new shares for roughly $715 million, resulting in Kimco expanding its shares outstanding by 40%. Warehouse REIT ProLogis in April sold 175 million shares for roughly $1 billion, expanding its share base by 65%.

"We understand the risk of relying upon asset equity and executing on that strategy as opposed to jumping the gun and doing an overnight [stock sale]," Mr. Coppola said in a presentation last Thursday at a New York conference hosted by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts. "But the math is so compelling for the company -- and the dilution of doing a common-equity deal today in this environment is so permanent -- that we feel this is appropriate for our balance sheet."

Macerich executives sketched out details of the REIT's asset-sale strategy for investors during its May 5 conference call to report its first-quarter results. Mr. Coppola said then that Macerich hopes to sell $500 million of assets this year, partly through joint ventures and partly through outright sales. Of that, $125 million of sales is pending at cap rates averaging 8.5% to 9%. Last week at the REIT conference, Mr. Coppola said Macerich has since decided to do larger joint-venture deals than it initially envisioned. "The timing is imminent" on the joint ventures, he said. "That means we're in the documentation phase. So this isn't just romance anymore."

The trick will be finalizing the deal. Sales of U.S. retail properties were down by 72% in value in the first four months of this year from the same period last year, according to Real Capital Analytics.

Shopping-center owners Centro Properties Group and Developers Diversified Realty Corp. both announced in the past year that they had reached deals to sell properties -- in both cases to DRA Advisors LLC -- only to see the deals fall apart before closing. Mall owner General Growth Properties Inc. last year banked on raising capital through joint-venture deals to pare its $27 billion debt load, but such deals weren't consummated. General Growth filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on April 16.

If Macerich can't finalize its joint-venture deals, it may have missed the best opportunities for selling stock in the interim, depending on how the economy influences the equity markets.

Other REITs are attempting to raise capital by selling properties, but many of them have supplemented those efforts by selling stock, too. Shopping-center owner Weingarten Realty Investors has roughly $600 million of assets on the market, of which it hopes to sell half this year. Developers Diversified hopes to sell $200 million to $400 million in properties this year. Developers Diversified executives said last week that Germany's Otto real-estate family, which is buying a 20% stake in the company, has brought three other German institutional investors to Developers Diversified to discuss joint ventures.

Big U.S. banks sell shares to exit federal bailout program

Morgan Stanley joined J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. and American Express Co. in selling stock after the U.S. government said large banks must first prove they can raise money from private investors before exiting the federal bailout program.

The new rules -- laid out Monday by the Federal Reserve and affecting the 19 largest bank-holding companies -- appear to be more stringent than what has been required of smaller banks.

The announcement came as several financial giants prepare to repay some of the hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer money they received under the Troubled Asset Relief Program set up at the height of the financial crisis.

Separately, Bank of America Corp. said Tuesday it will "comfortably" exceed the government's $33.9 billion capital-raising mandate, the largest amount required of any financial firm. It said it has already raised $33 billion.

Morgan Stanley said Tuesday that it plans to raise $2.2 billion through a stock offering, a deal that will include China Investment Corp. and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. CIC took a 9.9% stake in Morgan Stanley in December 2007. Mitsubishi UFJ said in late April that it had increased its stake in Morgan Stanley to 21.47%.

The financial-services giant, which last month sold $8 billion in shares and debt, said it expects to repay the $10 billion obtained from the government rescue program by the end of the month. It had also been instructed in May to raise $1.8 billion as the result of government stress tests.

Morgan Stanley priced 80.2 million shares at $27.44 each, an 8.2% discount to Monday's closing price on the New York Stock Exchange. Up to 5% more shares could be sold if there is sufficient investor demand, less than the typical 15% overallotment. At midday Tuesday, Morgan Stanley's shares were down 3.1% at $28.97.

J.P. Morgan, the nation's largest bank in terms of stock-market value, sold $5 billion in stock. It sold 142 million shares at $35.25 a share, a 2.4% discount to Monday's close. Credit-card giant AmEx raised $500 million after it priced 19.8 million shares at $25.25 a share, a 2.8% discount to Monday's close.

At midday Tuesday, J.P. Morgan's shares were down 3.8% at $34.73 on the NYSE.

J.P. Morgan said Monday that the $5 billion was the amount that government regulators said would be required for the bank to repay its $25 billion in TARP. The move should set the stage for the company to fully repay TARP by the end of June. AmEx received $3.4 billion in TARP funds.

Both J.P. Morgan and AmEx had intended to repay TARP without raising capital. Many other banks affected by the Fed's decision already have raised capital in recent weeks.

J.P. Morgan's chief executive, James Dimon, in particular has insisted that the bank could afford to repay the $25 billion in TARP funds it received last year without raising capital.

Mr. Dimon, who had said J.P. Morgan didn't need the TARP funds in the first place, has expressed frustration with the program. On Monday, when asked by an analyst why the government required J.P. Morgan to raise capital when the bank passed a government-conducted financial stress test last month, Mr. Dimon said: "Any argument you can think of, you can assume we made with our regulators. And as you could also expect, they won."

In the Monday conference call, he also said, "We believe we've met all the terms to get out of TARP," in response to an analyst question. "If we don't get out of TARP, we would be very surprised. We don't think we should be surprised."

In recent weeks, investors have been snapping up shares in sales by many banks -- including some that had been forced to raise capital by their stress-test results.

Morgan Stanley, which has recorded two consecutive quarterly losses, has been raising capital through a number of avenues, including selling its remaining stake in indexing and analytics business MSCI Inc. Last month it sold $8 billion in stock and debt.

Current shareholders CIC and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group agreed to purchase 44.7 million and 16 million shares, respectively, through Tuesday's sale.

Bank of America said Tuesday that it has now entered into agreements to swap $9.5 billion perpetual preferred stock for 704 million common shares, boosting Tier 1 common capital by that $9.5 billion.

It had announced last week that it reached deals to exchange $5.9 billion of perpetual preferred stock into 436 million common shares and that it was offering other holders to swap into as much as 200 million common shares. Tuesday's announcement tops that target, and the company can still swap other perpetual preferreds not offered yet into 296 million shares.

The Fed, which will make its recommendations to the Treasury Department, said that repayment approvals for some of the banks will likely be announced next week. Some smaller institutions already have repaid TARP funds without tapping public markets; it isn't yet clear what will be required of other smaller banks that want to exit TARP down the road.

In addition to proving they can get access to public markets, the Fed said the banks must prove they can get access to long-term-debt markets without relying on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.'s program that backs certain debt issuances.

The Fed said it would also consider whether repaying the money would keep the company "in a position to continue to fulfill its role as an intermediary that facilitates lending to creditworthy households and businesses."

Regulators will also look at whether after returning the TARP money the bank-holding company would retain a capital level "consistent with supervisory expectations."

Designed to provide investor confidence in the banking system, TARP placed various restrictions on institutions that received funding, and many chafed under the terms. Banks that received TARP funds were scrutinized for their executive-compensation programs.

Home-loan banks run into trouble; directors faulted

Financial troubles at some of the U.S. Federal Home Loan Banks are raising questions about how well directors of these institutions are supervising their executives.

A plunge in the value of mortgage securities bought by several of the regional home-loan banks has forced them to halt dividends and curtail funding for housing projects. An annual report issued by the banks' regulator last week says some of them "paid insufficient attention" to credit risks.

Unlike giant banks or government-backed mortgage companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the 12 regional home-loan banks draw little public scrutiny. Created by Congress in 1932 to support the housing market, they are cooperatives owned by more than 8,000 banks, thrifts, credit unions and insurers. Because investors assume the government would bail them out in a crisis, they can borrow money cheaply in the bond market.

If the home-loan banks ever stumble badly, U.S. taxpayers would be called on to "rescue yet another financial entity," warns Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics, a research firm in Washington. These banks have about $1.26 trillion of debt outstanding, putting them among the world's biggest borrowers.

In some cases, the directors of home-loan banks are cracking down. The Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston's board nudged its chief executive into retirement, according to three people involved in the discussions, but softened the blow with a severance package -- later rejected by regulators as overly generous. The Pittsburgh home-loan bank eliminated bonuses for its top executives last year. But the Atlanta and San Francisco banks gave top executives hefty bonuses despite losses on mortgage securities.

Ms. Petrou argues that the home-loan banks need more directors willing to ask tough questions of the executives. Most of the directors are representatives of banks that rely on the home-loan banks for funding. Some other directors represent nonprofit groups that receive grants from the home-loan banks, which are required by law to devote 10% of their profits to housing projects benefiting poor people.

The Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates the banks, says their governance is improving as they comply with a 2008 law requiring that 40% of directors be independent. John von Seggern, president of the Council of Federal Home Loan Banks, a trade group representing all 12 of them, says they have faced complex challenges as financial markets crumbled over the past two years and are committed to improving their governance and risk management. He and other supporters say the home-loan banks have proved stronger financially than many other big U.S. financial firms.

The home-loan banks' main business is making loans to their owners, or "members." But they also park some of their cash in housing-related securities. Some of the banks went awry by purchasing large amounts of "private label" mortgage securities, ones that were packaged by Wall Street during the housing boom and don't carry any government guarantee.

News in Depth: Activist financier 'terrorizes' bankers in foreclosure fight --- Influence of homeowners' advocate is growing, but some of his targets deplore his tactics

BRUCE MARKS doesn't bother being diplomatic. A campaigner on behalf of homeowners facing foreclosure, he was on the phone one day in March to a loan executive at Bank of America Corp.

"I'm tired of borrowers being screwed!" Mr. Marks yelled into the phone. "You're incompetent!" Before hanging up, he threatened to call bank CEO Kenneth Lewis at home to complain about the loan executive.

Mr. Marks's nonprofit organization, Neighborhood Assistance Corp. of America, has emerged as one of the loudest scourges of the banking industry in the post-bubble economy. It salts its Web site with photos of executives it accuses of standing in the way of helping homeowners -- emblazoning "Predator" across their photos, picturing their homes and sometimes including home phone numbers. In February, NACA, as it's called, protested at the home of a mortgage investor by scattering furniture on his lawn, to give him a taste of what it feels like to be evicted.

In the 1990s, Mr. Marks leaked details of a banker's divorce to the press and organized a protest at the school of another banker's child. He says he would use such tactics again. "We have to terrorize these bankers," Mr. Marks says.

Though some bankers privately deplore his tactics, Mr. Marks is a growing influence in the lending industry and the effort to curb foreclosures. NACA has signed agreements with the four largest U.S. mortgage lenders -- Bank of America, Wells Fargo &Co., J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. and Citigroup Inc. -- in which they agree to work with his counselors on a regular basis to try to arrange lower payments for struggling borrowers. NACA has made powerful political friends, such as House majority whip James Clyburn of South Carolina, and it receives federal money to counsel homeowners.

Some 1.7 million U.S. households will lose their homes in foreclosure this year, according to a forecast by Moody's Economy.com, versus under 500,000 a year early in the housing boom. Banks want to show they are making every effort to keep people in their homes. That can mean working with housing-advocacy groups that routinely bash the industry, increasing the clout of such nonprofits. Less certain is whether these groups can translate their new leverage into long-term influence over how mortgage lenders treat customers.

"We have the opportunity to change how lending gets done in this country," says Mr. Marks, whose group is itself a mortgage broker and has 40 offices staffed with housing counselors. He favors a return to more traditional standards, with full documentation of income and the same fixed interest rate for everyone.

Instead of relying on credit scores, he thinks lenders should look into the reasons for any late payments in prospective borrowers' past and prepare renters for the responsibilities of home ownership. Then, if people are given a loan they can afford, they shouldn't be required to make a down payment, he argues.

Critics doubt some of these changes would be helpful. Having to use a single interest rate for all would make banks less likely to lend to people with blemished credit records, says Richard Riese, an executive at the American Bankers Association.

A single rate also could lead to higher rates for everyone, adds John Courson, chief executive of another trade group, the Mortgage Bankers Association.

Mr. Courson declined to comment on Mr. Marks. "You're not going to drag me in there," he said.

For now, NACA's main focus is fighting foreclosure, and the 53-year-old Mr. Marks pursues it relentlessly. NACA holds mass "Save the Dream" gatherings, flying in hundreds of counselors to work with borrowers who hope to restructure their mortgages.

At one in Columbia, S.C., in March, a line of homeowners stretched around an arena waiting to meet counselors in canary-yellow T-shirts reading "Financial Predators Beware." Mr. Marks, dressed in black and wearing a NACA cap, circled the arena with a bullhorn. "We're gonna get it done!" he bellowed.

Erick Exum, a NACA official, told those present: "What happened is not your fault. The mortgage crisis is the result of abuses and exploitation by Wall Street." Even so, he said, they might have to make sacrifices: "If you have a car payment and a boat payment, the boat may not make sense."

Counselors discussed borrowers' incomes and spending, calculating how big a monthly payment each could afford. For most, NACA later came up with a proposal to lower the interest rate, reduce the principal or both. NACA took the proposals to banks -- many of which had someone at the event -- and negotiations often followed.

While in Columbia, Mr. Marks made his angry cellphone call to Bank of America executive Steve Bailey. Pacing a hall, Mr. Marks accused Mr. Bailey of reneging on the bank's agreement with NACA by failing to reduce borrowers' payments on their second liens, in addition to their first mortgages.

"You eat that second!" Mr. Marks shouted.

Mr. Bailey says Mr. Marks was mistaken about what the bank had agreed to. "I think Bruce was having a bad day," Mr. Bailey says. He and Mr. Marks agree that their dispute has since been resolved, but differ on the details.

NACA seeks to limit mortgage payments to whatever a borrower can afford, and doesn't favor stretching out payment periods. That contrasts with a loan-modification plan pushed by the Obama administration, which aims to limit payments to 31% of income.

One borrower at Columbia was Kenneth Brown, a truck driver from Richmond, Va., who had driven about 500 kilometers to attend. Though he said he was still current on his mortgage, Mr. Brown hoped to get his monthly payment of about $1,600 cut in half by lowering his loan's 12.5% interest rate. "I'm not leaving till I get something in my hand," he said as he sat in the arena.

Two months later, Mr. Brown said he had given up on waiting for NACA to find a solution and was trying on his own to refinance. Mr. Marks said NACA tried to help Mr. Brown but ran into complications documenting his income as a self-employed trucker.

The Columbia event drew people from 10,000 households, and more than 3,000 loans have since been modified, Mr. Marks says. He won't disclose NACA's success rate but says that it wins some change in loan terms in the vast majority of cases, including about 24,000 mortgages last year. Hope Now, an alliance of a wide array of mortgage companies, investors and counselors, estimates the mortgage industry modified 969,000 home loans in all last year, a figure that would include NACA's total.

Mr. Marks grew up in affluent Scarsdale, N.Y., and Greenwich, Conn. He says a childhood stuttering problem gave him sympathy for underdogs, which evolved into a career as an activist. He studied business to "know the enemy," earning an M.B.A. and working briefly for the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. A later job for a labor union stirred his interest in reviving poor neighborhoods and helping people afford homes.

In 1988 he launched NACA. It soon began arranging loans for Boston-area banks that were eager to show they were serving poor neighborhoods, in compliance with the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act.

The organization has been allocated $34.5 million from a new federal program to counsel distressed mortgage borrowers, to be paid to groups such as NACA little by little as they provide counseling. NACA's slice is nearly 10% of the program's funds; the rest goes to more than 100 other nonprofits and state agencies. Besides these grants, most income to cover NACA's roughly $40 million annual budget comes from the fees lenders pay it for arranging new mortgages, typically $2,500 per loan.

Another NACA event is the "predator's tour." In February, it sent hundreds of protesters to the homes of bankers and investors in posh New York suburbs such as Rye, N.Y., and Greenwich. One stop was the home of William Frey of Greenwich Financial Services, a broker-dealer specializing in mortgage-backed securities. He was a target because he resisted some aspects of a settlement that called for modifying loans.

State attorneys general had accused Countrywide Financial Corp. of predatory lending, and Countrywide's new owner, Bank of America, settled the suit last year by agreeing to modify many mortgages. A fund Mr. Frey controls then sued the bank. The suit didn't take issue with the settlement but complained that the bank had passed on most of the cost of it to buyers of securities backed by Countrywide's loans.

Mr. Frey was the target of the protest in which NACA dumped furniture on the lawn. "They had hundreds of people trespassing on my property," he says.

"I have a difference with Bank of America. I have a substantial amount of assets with them," Mr. Frey says. "We take them to court. This is how we do it in this country. . . . It's a civilized society." The response from NACA, he adds, "is a mob showing up at someone's house to intimidate them to drop this suit. At what point do people say, 'This is starting to be uncomfortable'?"

"It should be uncomfortable," says Mr. Marks. "You win a campaign by being relentless. Everybody has a breaking point. . . . At some point they say, 'How do I get these crazies off my back?'"

Some lenders have refused to sign contracts to work with NACA, among them HSBC Holdings, Barclays and Credit Suisse Group. All declined to comment. Mr. Marks says some banks that won't sign agreements do negotiate individual cases with NACA. Even so, NACA sometimes pictures their executives and the executives' homes on its Web site.

It recently added a photo of William Gross of Pacific Investment Management Co., the big bond house known as Pimco, along with pictures of his home and other information. Mr. Marks says his contacts in banking and government tell him Pimco doesn't support the administration's push to modify mortgages. "We're exposing them," Mr. Marks says. A spokesman for Pimco said neither it nor Mr. Gross would comment.

Mr. Marks says financial executives should be held personally responsible for actions that affect people's lives, and "if they interpret that as intimidation, so be it." He says that "we're not talking about violence. We don't do violence."

NACA says it arranged $367 million of mortgages last year. Those borrowers must become members of NACA, agreeing to participate in its protests or help out at its offices, and for several years must contribute to a fund for homeowners who fall behind because of sickness or job loss. All NACA members pay the same interest rate, currently 4.375%.

Mr. Marks says 3.67% of loans NACA originated were 90 days or more overdue as of March 31. The industry average was 3.49%, according to LPS Applied Analytics, a data firm. According to Mr. Marks, 0.68% of the NACA loans were in foreclosure. The industry average was 2.45%, says LPS.

Bank of America says home loans originated by NACA "are equal to and in some cases are performing better than our prime book of business." A bank spokesman added, "There are few organizations that can bring a buyer to the table who has been through such extensive pre-buying counseling."

Despite receiving taxpayer money, NACA doesn't provide public reports on either its loan-brokerage business or its campaign to modify mortgages. Jim Campen, an economics professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, says he tried in the 1990s to analyze the performance of loans arranged by NACA, but Mr. Marks refused to provide data.

Mr. Marks says he feared the data would be used by another nonprofit to discredit his group. NACA does provide information to lenders that work with it, he says, but sees no duty to disclose it to the public.

"He's been very effective in shaking money out of the banks," says Mr. Campen, but "he's not one to open up his records to public scrutiny."

Deals &Deal Makers: In crisis, BlackRock is seller, buyer, adviser

Laurence Fink has parlayed a lifetime of contacts and computer models into a powerful, controversial role for his firm in the financial crisis.

The U.S. has selected BlackRock Inc., a money manager and risk-advisory firm, to manage mortgage assets once owned by Bear Stearns Cos. and American International Group Inc.

Separately, the firm also has been tapped to analyze hard-to-price assets of Freddie Mac and Morgan Stanley, among other financial institutions.

Now, the U.S. Treasury Department has preliminarily granted BlackRock a coveted second-round interview to become one of a few money managers to buy toxic assets from U.S. banks, using taxpayer money, people familiar with the matter say. Mr. Fink aims to raise as much as $7 billion to invest through the program, which could yield his firm millions of dollars in fees. A Treasury spokesman says it is in negotiations to prequalify several fund managers.

BlackRock helped shape the government's toxic-asset plan, which critics have said helps vulture investors buy assets on the cheap while exposing taxpayers to the bulk of losses if the investments sour. Meantime, BlackRock continues to manage $132 billion in mortgage assets, some of which have defaulted.

BlackRock's multiple hats put it in the enviable position of having influence on setting the prices of the assets it is buying and selling.

Some critics say financial firms stand to benefit from the process, after Wall Street helped to create the problem.

"BlackRock is too close to the problem to be objective," says Janet Tavakoli, a former Wall Street derivatives trader and now president of a financial-consulting firm. "One should question how much they are part of the problem."

Mr. Fink, 56 years old, says the firm manages potential conflicts through what Wall Street calls a "Chinese Wall," or a separation within the firm of its analytics and asset-management businesses. The firm also physically separates its traders who work on government projects.

Aside from its government-mandated role, BlackRock is paid by clients to value $7 trillion of fixed-income securities -- more than the entire Treasury bond market. Through a separate unit, BlackRock manages $1.1 trillion of money.

"We have a two-decade record of managing conflicts, which is why we have been hired by many global institutions and governments," says Mr. Fink, a former Wall Street trader. "Our clients trust us."

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke wrote in a late-April letter responding to Congressman Alan Grayson (D., Fla.), who questioned BlackRock's role, that the firm must keep confidential any information it obtains as manager for the Fed and limit employees' access to it. He also wrote that the Fed may and has audited BlackRock's compliance with these rules and its methods for valuing securities.

Mr. Bernanke also wrote that the Fed had too little time to follow normal bidding processes when it hired BlackRock to manage portfolios relating to the Bear Stearns and AIG bailouts.

Mr. Fink's Rolodex reaches deep into Wall Street and Washington. He speaks frequently with Timothy Geithner, Treasury secretary and former New York Federal Reserve Bank president. It was Mr. Geithner who asked him to value the assets at Bear Stearns and AIG.

Mr. Fink talks with government insiders such as White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel and William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Peter Fisher, an ex-Fed official and Treasury undersecretary, is a top official at BlackRock.

His ties to Wall Street and Washington were evident in the collapse and rescue of Bear Stearns last year. As the securities firm teetered in mid-March, J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. asked Mr. Fink to value Bear Stearns's assets to help the big bank formulate a buyout offer.

Within 48 hours, Mr. Fink was called by Mr. Geithner, then New York Fed president. The request: to switch gears and help the Fed choose which of Bear Stearns's assets should be used to collateralize a $29 billion government loan as part of the deal.

Several months later, Mr. Fink paved the way to be involved in the problems at AIG. In June, Mr. Fink called Robert Willumstad, who had been named AIG chief executive, to ask if he needed any help. From then on, BlackRock provided AIG with regular risk assessments of the firm's portfolios.

In late October, when the government stepped in to rescue AIG, it selected BlackRock to manage the roughly $100 billion of portfolios, called Maiden Lane II and III, which consisted of soured mortgage loans, debt pools and other AIG assets. Those assets since have been marked down, according to the Fed.

If investors and traders knew exactly what was in these portfolios, they could get a better picture of the health of the Fed's bailout assets, says James Bianco, president of Bianco Research.

This would help investors in deciding whether to buy U.S. securities like Treasury bonds or mortgage-backed securities. Knowing how the Fed values certain types of assets also would help investors value their own portfolios, using the Fed's valuations as their guide, he says.

BlackRock also was involved in the fallout from the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in September. Ken Wilson, an adviser to former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, says Mr. Fink was the first executive he talked to after the Lehman collapse who had a strong understanding of what was going on in the money markets.

"People talk to him because he is substantive," says Mr. Wilson, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner now in private practice. "When I was at Treasury, he would phone all the time and point out things we sometimes hadn't seen that were going on in the market."

Mr. Fink had another role in crisis, without the government's help. In September Mr. Fink called Morgan Stanley CEO John Mack about his pending investment from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. BlackRock, which says it was subsequently hired by Mitsubishi, provided a financial opinion on Morgan Stanley's balance sheet. The opinion helped seal the deal.

In an interview, Mr. Mack says he often calls on Mr. Fink. "What I like is he tells you exactly what he thinks," Mr. Mack says. "We don't always agree but I get an unvarnished view." Mitsubishi declined to comment.

Meantime, BlackRock's own business structuring debt pools called collateralized debt obligations has contributed its share to the crisis. BlackRock executives say they typically use third-party pricing services and try to minimize the amount of securities they mark based on their own model.

The firm created about $5.5 billion of CDOs in 2007, most of which have defaulted, causing losses of more than 50% for investors in most cases, say analysts. It completed one $2 billion CDO deal in June 2007 called Pinnacle Point Funding II Ltd., just as the subprime-mortgage crisis was boiling over. The deal fell apart by December of that year. It has caused its underwriter, Bank of America, to initially write down that holding by about $1 billion by the end of 2008, according to people familiar with the deal.

In its latest role, BlackRock has advised the government on how to craft what is called the Public-Private Investment Program. BlackRock was preliminarily chosen from 104 applicants to get it off the ground. The plan hopes to create a market for mortgage and other securities that have been difficult to sell, which will help stabilize banks' financial assets and allow them to lend more.

At Japan's Banks, Few Recovery Signs

TOKYO -- Japan's recession is likely to bottom out around September, but bad debts at the nation's banks will remain high throughout this year, said Katsunori Nagayasu, chairman of the Japanese Bankers Association.

His comments come as hopes mount that the world's second-largest economy is pulling itself out of its deepest recession since World War II and that the government's measures to reboot the economy may be paying off.

Bank of Japan Governor Masaaki Shirakawa on Wednesday noted signs of recovery, and Japanese industrial-production data racked up its first increase for six months during March.

In the banking sector, however, signs of a broader recovery are still scarce. Bank lending has grown during the financial crisis but largely because capital markets were frozen, hindering companies' efforts to raise commercial paper.

Also the number of Japanese corporate bankruptcies, which drive banks' credit costs higher, rose 9.4% in April from a year earlier to 1,329 cases, the 11th straight monthly rise, data analytics firm Tokyo Shoko Research said on Wednesday.

"The economy may bottom out in September, but credit costs and the economy do not move exactly in tandem, so I think bad debts at banks will remain quite high all this year," said Mr. Nagayasu, who is also the president of Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, the main banking unit of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.

Banks reported bankrupt and quasi-bankrupt loans at 877 billion yen ($9.2 billion) at the end of December, up from 478 billion yen in March 2008, according to analysts at broker CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets. Japan's so-called mega banks will report results in the coming week, starting with Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc., both on Friday, and MUFG on Tuesday.

The Property Report
Corus Has Buyers for Its Condos: Vultures --- Prime Properties Have Investors Interested and Circling if Lender Fails

Corrections &Amplifications

The delinquency rate on condo-construction loans reached 32.2% in the first quarter of 2009, up from 13.4% in the year-earlier quarter, according to Foresight Analytics. An article in Wednesday's Property Report incorrectly said delinquencies reached 32.2% in the first quarter of 2008.

(WSJ May 14, 2009)

(END)

Corus Bankshares Inc.'s recent warning that it could be placed into receivership by federal regulators has set off a scramble among real-estate investors who hope to pick up the lender's nonperforming loans.

The Chicago-based firm, which became one of the leading lenders to high-end condominium towers from Miami to Los Angeles, faces a mid-June deadline to sell itself or raise at least $390 million in capital. If Corus, which had $7.7 billion in assets as of March 31, can't survive, it would rank as the largest bank failure this year by assets and the fourth largest of the current downturn.

While it is possible that Corus will find the capital it needs or a buyer, many analysts believe the deck is stacked against the bank because its problems are so complex. "Just given the environment that we're in and given the condition of their balance sheets, those tasks would prove to be rather difficult," said Daniel Cardenas, senior vice president at Chicago brokerage Howe Barnes Hoefer &Arnett Inc.

Corus didn't respond to requests for comment.

Condos have been one of the hardest-hit segments of the real-estate market. Buyers have been walking away from their deposits on units, leaving developers with mostly empty buildings. The delinquency rate on condo-construction loans hit 32.2% in the first quarter of 2008, from 13.4% a year ago, according to Foresight Analytics.

While many lenders are being hurt by the condo crash, Corus is particularly vulnerable. Condo-construction loans accounted for nearly 75% of the lender's commercial real-estate loans. Some 41 of the bank's 85 condo-construction loans were in default at the end of 2008, and an additional 23 condo loans were considered "potential problem loans" at risk of default. In Florida, all but three of 20 condo loans were in nonaccrual, the company said last month.

The prospect of Corus's empire being sold off in pieces has attracted interest from a diverse group of buyers: private-equity funds, individual investors, and multifamily-rental operators, according to brokers familiar with the company's assets. "There's lots of capital out there looking at the product, but it's one thing to look and another to get to a price that makes sense," said Lewis Goodkin, a real-estate analyst based in Miami who says he is working with two funds interested in buying some of Corus's assets.

One more group of interested buyers includes condo developers. Related Group, the biggest condo developer in south Florida, is looking at individual Corus assets, said Matthew Allen, the company's operating chief.

Another developer frequently mentioned as a possible buyer of assets is New York-based Related Cos., the closely held real-estate developer that is behind numerous condo and office complexes including New York's Time Warner Center. Related Group of Florida and Related Cos. of New York are separate companies, although the Related Cos. has a small stake in the Related Group and occasionally they enter joint-venture projects together. A spokeswoman for Related Cos. wouldn't confirm or deny that the company is looking at Corus properties.

Analysts say that Corus's loans could be attractive because they weren't syndicated or sliced up into securities. As a result, foreclosures on the properties wouldn't be subject to lawsuits from other lenders. In addition, many developments financed by Corus are high-quality properties in major metropolitan markets.

"Corus made loans on many of the most important properties in Florida, and control of those assets could translate into a very significant windfall" over the long term, said Robert Kaplan, chief executive of Olympian Capital Group, a real-estate investment firm.

Any potential buyer would need deep pockets and a long-term view, converting mostly empty condo buildings into rentals until the market recovers. Some 577,000 condo and cooperative apartments were on the market in March, a nearly 15-month supply, according to the National Association of Realtors.

Corus shares rallied on Monday, more than doubling to 96 cents on news that troubled Florida lender BankUnited Financial Corp. had become the target of a bidding war by private-equity firms. Corus shares fell 5% to 91 cents on Tuesday.

An agreement between Corus and its regulators, meanwhile, has made life more complicated for its developers, since the bank must receive federal approval for most loan extensions. "It's brought Corus to a standstill in terms of what they can try to do to renegotiate loans," said Peter Zalewski of Condo Vultures Realty LLC in Bal Harbour, Fla.

On Monday, Corus's operating chief announced his resignation, effective next month, following other senior departures. The company's chief executive of 25 years resigned in April and the finance chief took a leave of absence in March.

As Manhattan condo market unravels, developers are hit

Kent Swig, the scion of one of San Francisco's most prominent real-estate families, is no stranger to conflict.

Two years ago, he hired a marching band that drowned out the noise of a protest mounted by tenants he was trying to evict. Last fall, one of his partners allegedly hurled an ice bucket at Mr. Swig during an argument at a business meeting, an incident that led to the filing of assault charges.

But nothing likely could have prepared Mr. Swig for the wars on numerous fronts that he has faced as the Manhattan condominium market has unraveled. He has faced a range of financial problems on his four condo projects, including the 597-unit Sheffield57, one of the largest condo projects in the city.

Mr. Swig's battles are a sample of what is happening nationwide in the condo-development sector as thousands of new units keep being delivered into a market in which demand has evaporated. In Manhattan, where vacant inventory stands at record levels, some 4,500 new condo units in 44 buildings are expected to come online this year, according to Reis Inc., a real-estate research firm.

Many condo projects throughout the country are going bust as developers default on construction loans. Delinquencies on condo construction loans jumped to 32% in the first quarter, up from 25% in the previous quarter, while defaults on nonresidential construction loans rose to 8.9% in the first quarter, from 6.6% in the previous period, according to Foresight Analytics LLC.

Last summer, Mr. Swig sold a condo-conversion project on the Upper West Side after its lender, iStar Financial Inc., launched a foreclosure action. More recently, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. filed to foreclose on Mr. Swig's 25 Broad Street, a luxury condo steps from the New York Stock Exchange, and an adjacent condo-hotel that Mr. Swig was developing. An iStar spokesman said the sale resolved the lender's issues with Mr. Swig. Lehman declined to comment.

Closings of sales at Sheffield57 have stopped, according to sales records. Contractors have slapped liens on the building for unpaid bills, court records show. And an appellate court in March said that the building's remaining market-rate tenants could challenge a court ruling that had paved the way for their eviction. Since March 2008, the $32 million senior mortgage has been on loan servicer KeyCorp's watch list for potential default, according to Trepp, a firm that tracks the commercial-property finance market.

The fate of the building now rests largely on the six mezzanine lenders, who hold some $255 million in debt, according to Realpoint, a Horsham, Pa., ratings firm that tracks commercial mortgage-backed securities. The mezzanine lenders, which include Gramercy Capital Corp. and Square Mile Capital Management LLC, didn't respond to calls seeking comment. Mezzanine debt fills the gap between the borrower's equity and the first mortgage.

A Sheffield57 spokesman acknowledged that the sales market has been "a challenge," but said the building has more than $59 million of contracts waiting to close and has seen "increased new sales activity."

In Manhattan's high-priced market, which resisted the downdraft of the housing collapse until recently, the struggles of Mr. Swig and others are being watched. "Everybody's sort of looking over their shoulder" to see who will be the first to fail, said Jonathan Miller, a New York appraiser.

Mr. Swig is the grandson of Benjamin Swig, a real-estate magnate who became one of San Francisco's leading philanthropists and businessmen. The younger Mr. Swig moved to Manhattan in the mid-1980s, going into business for his father-in-law, New York real-estate mogul Harry Macklowe. After going out on his own, Mr. Swig became best known for his joint ownership of two residential brokerage firms, Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens.

Mr. Swig's foray into Manhattan residential development follows his unsuccessful bid in the late 1990s to build luxury condos in downtown San Francisco.

In Manhattan, Mr. Swig got into condo development in 2005 as the market neared its peak. One of his first deals was 25 Broad Street, a 346-unit rental-apartment building that he bought in 2005 with plans to convert into condos. But sales were slow, according to brokers familiar with the project. After 25 Broad's lead lender, Lehman Brothers, sought bankruptcy protection in September, it filed a foreclosure action against the project, alleging that it was in default on three mortgages, including a senior loan valued at $231.7 million.

Lehman filed separately in January to foreclose on the adjacent 45 Broad, claiming that the project had defaulted on two loans valued at $49 million, according to New York state Supreme Court records.

A group led by Mr. Swig paid $418 million for the Sheffield building in 2005, a record for an apartment building at that time. Now, it is slightly less than 50% sold and there have been no closings since mid-February, according to sales records.

Mr. Swig's partner on the project, Yair Levy, faces a hearing later this month for two misdemeanor assault charges stemming from the ice-bucket incident. A spokesman for Mr. Levy said the incident "was completely made up by Mr. Swig."

Commercial-property debt is stressing banks

Thursday's "stress-test" results will bring fresh scrutiny to the biggest U.S. banks. They also are likely to highlight the woes from commercial real-estate loans that are piling up at large and small banks alike.

In the worst-case scenario, federal regulators examining the 19 largest U.S. banks are projecting losses of up to 12% on commercial real-estate loans over two years, according to a document viewed by The Wall Street Journal. The regulators are likely to cite commercial-property debt problems as a major reason why at least some of the large banks need additional capital.

Such losses likely would cause even deeper misery, and risk of failure, at small and medium banks because they tend to have disproportionally more exposure to commercial real-estate loans than giant institutions. While regulators have indicated they won't allow the 19 stress-tested banks to fail, that group doesn't include more than 500 banks with assets of less than $1 billion that have too much exposure to commercial real estate and are at the most risk of failing, according to an analysis by Foresight Analytics LLC.

During the housing boom, small and regional banks doubled down on lending to home builders and commercial-property developers and investors as they were largely squeezed out of the home-mortgage market by large banks and Wall Street firms. Now many of those loans are going bad as vacancies rise, rents fall and developments open to anemic demand.

Analysts already had been forecasting hundreds of bank closures in the next five years. The stress-test assumptions, including a 10.3% jobless rate at the end of 2010, raise the specter that some of the failures could occur sooner.

The 12% loss rate being used by regulators to scrutinize commercial real-estate loans surprised some analysts because default rates on such debt remain lower than those on home mortgages. The loss rate implies that the nation's banks and thrifts, which hold $1.8 trillion of commercial real-estate debt on their books, would incur $216 billion in losses by the end of 2010.

With that loss rate, "you're talking about a depression in the U.S. economy and a major crisis in the banking system," says Richard Bove at Rochdale Securities LLC.

In addition to the commercial real-estate loans clogging bank balance sheets, an additional $700 billion of those loans were packaged as securities and sold to investors. In light of plummeting property values and surging defaults, credit-rating firms have imposed downgrades on those securities. On Monday, Moody's Investors Service said it downgraded $52.9 billion in so-called collateralized debt obligations stuffed with commercial real-estate debt as part of its review of $83.1 billion in such CDOs amid worsening market conditions.

While bank regulators aren't immediately applying the stress-test criteria to small and midsize institutions, banks with high commercial real-estate exposures are drawing greater scrutiny from regulators. Nearly 3,000 banks and thrifts are estimated to have commercial real-estate loan portfolios that exceeded 300% of their total risk-based capital, according to Foresight. Regulators consider the 300% threshold as a red flag, although it doesn't necessarily mean all those banks are in danger of failing. Risk-based capital is a cushion that banks can dig into to cover losses.

While the failure of a single small bank is unlikely to cause wide damage to the financial system, such institutions could have a big impact as a whole. Banks with commercial real-estate loan portfolios exceeding 300% of their total risk-based capital have total assets of about $2 trillion, compared with $2.3 trillion in assets at Bank of America Corp.

Stress-tested banks that had a large exposure to commercial real-estate as of the end of 2008 include Regions Financial Corp., BB&T Corp., Fifth Third Bancorp and KeyCorp. "We are experiencing deterioration in other [commercial real-estate segments] such as the retail property group, which is dependent upon consumer spending to generally support rents," KeyCorp finance chief Jeffrey B. Weeden said in a conference call last month.

Commercial real-estate debt represented about 119% of the bank's total capital as of Dec. 31. "We remain well capitalized by any regulatory measure," Mr. Weeden said.

To be sure, banks wouldn't get hit as hard from commercial real-estate under rosier scenarios or if government programs succeed in pulling the U.S. economy out of its funk. The Federal Reserve, for example, announced on Friday new terms on one of its lending programs that officials hope will help revive the commercial real-estate market.

Since late 2007, 58 banks and savings institutions have failed, with assets totaling about $400 billion. About a dozen of the failed banks had unusually high commercial-mortgage exposure, according to Foresight.

Banks have been generally reluctant to sell their troubled commercial-property loans partly because they would be insolvent if they were to sell at prices being sought by investors. That might change if regulators put more pressure on banks to clean up their books.

Small Banks Face Hits on Commercial Real Estate

Thursday's "stress-test" results will bring fresh scrutiny to the nation's biggest banks. They also are likely to highlight the woes from commercial real-estate loans that are piling up at large and small banks alike.

In the worst-case scenario, federal regulators examining the 19 largest U.S. banks are projecting losses of up to 12% on commercial real-estate loans over two years, according to a document viewed by The Wall Street Journal. The regulators are likely to cite commercial-property debt problems as a major reason why at least some of the large banks need additional capital.

Such losses likely would cause even deeper misery, and risk of failure, at small and medium banks because they tend to have disproportionally more exposure to commercial real-estate loans than giant institutions. While regulators have indicated they won't allow the 19 stress-tested banks to fail, that group doesn't include more than 500 banks with assets of less than $1 billion that have too much exposure to commercial real estate and are at the most risk of failing, according to an analysis by Foresight Analytics LLC.

Since late 2007, 58 banks and savings institutions have failed, with assets totaling about $400 billion.

About a dozen of the failed banks, including Great Basin Bank of Nevada and First Bank of Idaho, had unusually high commercial-mortgage exposure, according to Foresight.

A bank currently on the ropes because of commercial real estate is Corus Bankshares Inc ., a big condominium-construction lender. In a securities filing Friday, the Chicago-based lender said it was "undercapitalized" as of March 31. Regulators might place the bank "into conservatorship or receivership," according to the filing.

So far, banks have been generally reluctant to sell their troubled commercial-property loans partly because they would be insolvent if they sell at bargain prices being sought by investors. That might change if regulators put more pressure on banks to clean up their books.

From January 2008 to the end of February, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . sold about $1.16 billion of distressed real-estate and other types of commercial loans from failed banks for about 59 cents on the dollar, according to industry data.

The Property Report
In Atlanta, Irrational Building Exuberance

ATLANTA -- A one-mile stretch of Atlanta's upscale Buckhead neighborhood shows why commercial real estate is emerging as an obstacle to pulling the U.S. economy out of recession.

Separate developers in Buckhead are building four speculative office buildings at the same time with virtually no leasing activity. The 35 recent condominium projects will help give Atlanta a 40-year supply at the current sales pace. A $600 million outdoor shopping mall under way has suspended construction to save money.

The glut threatens to worsen the clobbering that many U.S. banks already are getting from nonperforming loans made to owners and developers of office buildings, shopping centers, condos and other commercial real estate.

At Bank of America Corp., first-quarter results announced Monday included a surge in the percentage of commercial real-estate loans that are nonperforming to 7.5% of the Charlotte, N.C., bank's total portfolio of such loans.

In Buckhead, Bank of America financed two of the four speculative office buildings just steps away from each other, despite little evidence there was demand for more than one of them. It also provided a loan for the Streets of Buckhead luxury retail development, now struggling as some retail tenants flee and go bankrupt. There already are two other luxury malls there.

A Bank of America spokeswoman declined to comment.

The Federal Reserve's most recent "beige book" survey of regional economic conditions, released last week, found that commercial real-estate conditions "continued to deteriorate over the past six weeks." Demand for space fell, the supply of sublease space rose and property values moved lower as reality "set in," the survey found.

The Atlanta projects reflect the sort of exuberant reasoning that developers and their bankers used in justifying real-estate investments now facing declines in value. Atlanta also shows how the broader economic downturn and financing drought are hammering commercial real estate. Last month, a downtown office building bought at the top of the market was forced into a foreclosure proceeding. An auction is set for May 5.

The slump in the commercial real-estate sector could be a drag on the economic recovery. While some of the Atlanta projects already are defaulting on loans, others won't start running into financial problems for months or years, with a crescendo of loan maturities starting in 2010.

About $248 billion in commercial real-estate debt comes due this year, according to Foresight Analytics LLC. In 2010 and 2011, a total of $566 billion matures. While most other cities haven't seen as much speculative office development as Buckhead, many are suffering from an oversupply of new condos and retail space. Other places are hurting as surplus office space is dumped by companies and from declining values of properties purchased when times were good.

"This is about as bad as it's been in modern times, and we haven't even seen most of the commercial damage yet," said Tom Bell, chief executive of Cousins Properties Inc., the Atlanta developer of one of the four towers. "It's going to be a rocky road for a while." He, like his three competitors, is bullish about his own project over the long term.

Cousins led Buckhead's most recent development boom. Taking advantage of a sewage project that made development possible, the company built a glass pinstriped tower called Terminus 100. It filled quickly with financial-services firms and other tenants after opening in 2007. "It riveted the development community," said Ken Ashley, an office-leasing broker with Cushman &Wakefield.

The math was compelling. Office buildings were selling for $400 a square foot, while you could build one for $300 a square foot, according to Kris Miller, president of Ackerman &Co., an Atlanta real-estate firm. Fill a 500,000-square-foot building with tenants and then flip it to the next guy with various fees added, and you could make about a $45 million profit, he said.

The first building to follow Terminus 100 was a project by Regent Properties called the Sovereign. It opened in mid-2008 and has managed to lease three-quarters of its space. After the Regent building came Terminus 200, Cousins's encore to its successful first tower, built next-door. It broke ground in early 2007. Mr. Bell, of Cousins, figured the other companies planning towers would fall away when they saw his bulldozers preparing the site.

But the others didn't stop. Mr. Bell describes stages of bewilderment as the other three projects moved forward so quickly. The Buckhead market on average absorbs 300,000 square feet a year, said Lanie Rea, a research manager at brokers Jones Lang LaSalle. That is less than the size of each tower.

Tishman Speyer Properties, of New York, started the second tower of the bunch, just up the road. Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. is an equity partner, and Bank of America provided the $116 million construction loan.

A third building led by a consortium of developers including Pope &Land Enterprises and Duke Realty Corp., broke ground in mid-2007. Bank of America again provided the financing: $108 million for the office portion of the mixed-use project, which also includes condominiums. A spokeswoman for the developers said there has been a "tremendous amount of activity" among prospective tenants at the building.

Canadian insurer Manulife Financial Corp. and Crescent Resources, a developer owned by Duke Energy Corp. and a unit of Morgan Stanley, was last. It launched Phipps Tower in March 2008, days before Bear Stearns Cos. collapsed. Regions Financial Corp., a Birmingham, Ala., bank, arranged the $95 million construction loan. A Regions spokesman declined to comment. Mr. Bell, at Cousins, was incredulous that Crescent and Manulife went ahead. "I threw up my hands. The world's gone crazy," he said.

Terry Gilliam, Manulife's regional director in Atlanta, said Mr. Bell and the others knew the Phipps site, which some local brokers consider the best located, was ready to go. "I would ask why they would do it. They knew the Phipps site was there all along," said Mr. Gilliam. He said Manulife is pleased to be in the project and intends to stay for the long haul.

The Cousins building is the only one of the four to find a tenant: a 50,000-square-foot lease with Firethorn Holdings LLC, a mobile-banking company. Prospects that the Buckhead buildings will fill quickly are dim. Buckhead relies on financial-services companies as its best tenants. Those jobs are disappearing. What tenants they do attract are likely to poach from existing landlords, hurting the overall market.

The Property Report
Katzman Is Back on the Prowl to Expand His Global Empire --- 'This Is a Buying Opportunity,' He Says, as Price Discounts on Real-Estate Companies Offer an Attractive Lure

For international shopping-center magnate Chaim Katzman, retail-property stocks have fallen enough that the time is ripe to buy, even if his targets aren't keen on selling.

Mr. Katzman, the 59-year-old chairman of Gazit-Globe Ltd., of Israel, jumped back into the deal fray last month when his company's U.S. unit, Equity One Inc., made an unsolicited advance on smaller Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust. Ramco, of Farmington Hills, Mich., owns 89 U.S. shopping centers. Equity One, a real-estate investment trust in Miami, owns 146.

The overture, which Ramco has yet to embrace, is standard practice for Mr. Katzman, who started building his global real-estate empire in 1991 by buying Gazit, a shell company on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, and using it to raise money from Israeli investors. Since then, Gazit has expanded to control 650 shopping centers across the globe, largely by acquiring properties or taking big stakes in real-estate companies rather than developing shopping centers from the ground up.

Now that real-estate companies are selling at discounts from the cost to develop new properties, Mr. Katzman is on the prowl again. In the case of Ramco, Equity One offered to acquire the company in a stock-for-stock merger but didn't propose a set price. The price of Ramco's stock, which closed Tuesday at $9.77, down eight cents, or 0.8%, in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composite trading, puts the company's equity value at roughly $200 million.

Rich Moore, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said Ramco's stock would be trading closer to $22 a share, or a total of about $480 million, if the stock more closely reflected the value of Ramco's properties.

Another measure analysts use to value properties is the capitalization rate, which measures a property's income relative to its acquisition price. The higher the cap rate, the lower the property value.

Mr. Moore estimates that based on Ramco's stock price, the cap rate on Ramco's properties is 12.7%. In contrast, sales of U.S. retail properties this year have registered cap rates of 7% to 7.3% on average, according to Real Capital Analytics. That indicates higher prices than reflected in Ramco's share price.

It isn't clear that Mr. Katzman will be able to acquire Ramco at a 12.7% cap rate. Mr. Moore predicts a deal would be more expensive, with a cap rate closer to 8.75%.

Some analysts believe that commercial real-estate prices haven't hit bottom. Many investors who were lured back into the market by the siren's song of discounts since the recession began have gotten smashed on the rocks as values have fallen and vacancies have risen.

"There are some great values out there, but . . . there are some opportunities to really get hurt as well," said Yaacov Gross, a partner at law firm Morrison &Foerster LLP, which specializes in REIT investment banking.

Mr. Katzman believes real-estate prices are at bargain levels. The Dow Jones Equity All-REIT index of 113 stocks has declined 50% on a total return basis in the past year, and prices paid for U.S. retail property have declined 25% from last year's levels, according to Real Capital Analytics.

"We definitely feel that this is a buying opportunity," Mr. Katzman said. "I'll be surprised if you don't see us trying to do more [buying]. I think the next couple of years will determine who the big players for the next 20 years are going to be."

Mr. Katzman and select others are among the few brave enough to buy while the property markets still are in turmoil. Germany's Otto family, which controls European mall owner ECE Projektmanagement, is paying $112.5 million for a 20% equity stake in Developers Diversified Realty Corp., the owner of 710 big-box shopping centers in the U.S.

Equity One has moderate debt and stable tenants, with three-quarters of its centers anchored by grocery stores such as Publix Super Markets Inc. Of its roughly $900 million in debt, none comes due in the balance of this year and only $72 million next year. Occupancy at Equity One's centers slipped to 92.1% in the fourth quarter from 93.2% a year earlier.

On a consolidated basis, Gazit has roughly $3.5 billion in equity, $8 billion in long-term debt and $1.2 billion in cash and borrowing capacity. It holds a 55% stake in Equity One.

The Ramco bid doesn't lack for drama. Equity One bought nearly 10% of Ramco's stock on the open market before meeting last month with Ramco executives to propose merger talks. Ramco didn't acquiesce, instead installing safeguards to thwart hostile bids and hiring Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch as an adviser. In turn, Equity One on April 9 submitted two nominees for Ramco's board.

Ramco said it will review the board candidates. The family-run company declined to comment.

Real Estate
Mall Titan Enters Chapter 11

Mall owner General Growth Properties Inc. sought bankruptcy protection early Thursday in one of the largest real-estate failures in U.S. history, capping a precarious, months-long effort to juggle the crushing $27 billion debt load it shouldered in past acquisition sprees.

The long-anticipated Chapter 11 filing might wipe out what remains of the Chicago company's stock, but it won't result in mall closures. Many analysts suspect General Growth will survive a lengthy bankruptcy intact, but perhaps smaller after selling properties, without resorting to liquidation. General Growth, which owns and manages more than 200 malls, is the second-largest U.S. mall owner by number of properties behind Simon Property Group Inc.

General Growth's board opted Wednesday to make the filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New York after efforts to piece together a plan for an out-of-court restructuring with a growing list of creditors failed to gain traction, according to people familiar with the talks. The filing includes General Growth, its Rouse Co. subsidiary and most of its malls. It doesn't include General Growth's management company or joint-venture holdings. All told, the filing covers roughly $24 billion of debt, these people say.

A General Growth spokesman didn't immediately return messages seeking comment. Trading of the company's stock closed Wednesday at $1.05, down 1 cent, in 4 p.m. composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has declined by more than 97% in the past year.

Finally forcing the bankruptcy filing after months of payment-deadline extensions was General Growth's failure to secure a deal with holders of $2.25 billion of its bonds to abstain from demanding immediate payment while the company tried to restructure its balance sheet outside of bankruptcy. Several holders of past-due bonds notified the company last Monday that they intended to sue for immediate payment. Meanwhile, additional debts came due on an almost weekly basis, making an out-of-court deal more challenging to reach.

General Growth has since November negotiated for with its lenders for reprieves, sometimes ending up at odds with the likes of Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs Group and occasionally going for weeks at a time with debts that were past due but not called for payment. Nonetheless, the company and its advisers continued to strive for a restructuring outside of bankruptcy in a bid to preserve as much value for shareholders and lenders as possible. In contrast, the bankruptcy process sometimes can result in divestitures or liquidation.

The bankruptcy will have far-reaching implications for the mall industry, including putting pressure on already declining property values of U.S. malls, and subsequently mall mortgages, if General Growth dumps property to pay creditors. It also could consolidate power in the oligarchic mall industry if major players like Simon Property Group Inc., Westfield Group and Taubman Centers Inc. can come up with the capital to pick up choice pieces.

The collapse points to an underlying concern for the commercial real estate industry, too. Developers and property owners that loaded up on debt during the past real-estate boom now face mountains of that debt coming due. But some of those borrowers, like General Growth, lack the cash or the borrowing capacity to refinance or pay those debts. Many lenders are granting cash-strapped borrowers extensions of their payment deadlines, but that only postpones rather than resolves the issue. This year alone, an estimated $248 billion of commercial mortgages will come due, up from $230 billion in 2008, according to real-estate research company Foresight Analytics LLC.

Meanwhile, commercial-property values have sunk, hampering the ability of owners to refinance or sell their properties. Real estate research company Green Street Advisors predicts a 40% overall decline in U.S. commercial property values in this recession.

Furthermore, General Growth's bankruptcy comes with the U.S. retail market under severe duress. Shoppers have cut their spending as they contend with mounting job losses, home foreclosures and depleted retirement savings. Additionally, a 1.1% decline in retail sales in March from the previous month, following recent gains, signaled that consumer spending probably won't bounce back quickly from the depths of the recession. Retailers, in turn, have slashed their expansion plans and closed stores a pace matched only in the recessions of 2001 and the early 1990s. By extension, mall owners have suffered rising vacancy rates and weakening rent growth at their properties.

Among real-estate failures, General Growth's bankruptcy has few peers. In 1992, Canadian developer Olympia & York Developments Ltd., developer of London's Canary Wharf complex, sought bankruptcy protection with $18.6 billion in debt. Last year, investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.'s real-estate assets were valued at $43 billion when it filed for bankruptcy protection, but that figure is mostly made up of loans on real estate.

For a mall company, the collapse of General Growth   a company founded by brothers Martin and Matthew Bucksbaum with a single shopping center in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in 1954 - likely is the largest ever. "A few years ago, they were one of the few gold-plated mall owners," says Bernie Haddigan, managing director of brokerage Marcus & Millichap Investment Services' retail division. "It is remarkable how a few wrong decisions made at the wrong time can become fatal."

With more than 200 U.S. malls and $27 billion in debt, General Growth is so large and its lineup of creditors so complex that, ultimately, it could take "a couple of years" to sort everything out in the bankruptcy case, said Heidi Sorvino, who leads the bankruptcy practice of New York law firm Smith, Gambrell & Russell LLP. "You have bank debt, bondholder debt, properties all over the U.S. and many levels of creditors. This is not a simple bankruptcy," she said.

It's possible that nothing will be left for shareholders when the bankruptcy concludes. The stock already had declined by more than 97% from its all-time high of $67 in March 2007. What remains of that equity could be wiped out if General Growth's $27 billion debt load eclipses the aggregate value the company could reap in an outright liquidation -- a scenario in which debt holders would claim all the proceeds.

Some say that, even if General Growth's equity value slightly exceeds its debt, that surplus will be gobbled up by the many fees and costs of the bankruptcy process. Others are betting that shareholders will salvage something if creditors are willing to forego a fire sale and allow a lengthy and orderly process to restructure General Growth's debt.

Activist investor Bill Ackman's Pershing Square Capital Management in recent months bought 7.5% of General Growth's stock on the cheap and put another 18% under swap contracts in a gamble that the stock will emerge from a bankruptcy unscathed. "I think a judge looking at the situation will conclude that a simple extension of [payment deadlines] will solve their issues," Mr. Ackman said in a March 16 interview. "I don't think they'll need to dilute shareholders" through issuing new stock to replace debts.

Mr. Ackman's Pershing Square has agreed to provide General Growth $375 million in financing during its bankruptcy, including $225 million to pay a past-due, bridge loan arranged late last year by Goldman Sachs. Listed among General Growth's largest creditors in its filing are German bank Eurohypo AG with a $2.6 billion claim, trustees representing billions of dollars of corporate bonds and several retailers owed small trade debts.

Many analysts suspect that, rather than liquidating, General Growth will restructure in bankruptcy court and emerge as a smaller company after shedding several malls to satisfy creditors. If not, a fire-sale liquidation of General Growth's malls would flood the already weak market for mall sales and hammer the value of those and other malls. "Just the sheer size of the thing and the capital-market climate right now make it impractical to liquidate," says Mike Magerman, senior vice president of credit-rating firm Realpoint LLC.

Selling any malls in this recession will be challenging, given that capital is scarce for would-be buyers. Last year, only eight regional malls traded hands in the largest 76 U.S. markets, down from 19 in 2007, according to real-estate research firm Reis Inc. In that span, U.S. mall values declined by roughly 30%, according to Green Street Advisors Inc. A liquidation of General Growth malls would deepen that decline, perhaps pushing the value of other malls below that of the debt they carry, which would make it tougher to sell or refinance those malls until their values recover.

"If even 10% of those 200 [General Growth] malls are sold, it will represent a deluge of regional malls on the market," says Victor Calanog, Reis' director of research. "Any increase in supply without a pickup in demand will depress prices."

Others are less pessimistic. William Taubman, chief operating officer of luxury mall owner Taubman Centers Inc., foresees the bankruptcy resulting in only a few General Growth malls trading hands. "I think there are plenty of financial players who are interested in buying well located, well-leased, high-quality property at decent pricing," he said. "It will take time, but I think this will resolve itself in a smoother manner than most would think."

Some complications will prove to be unavoidable, though. Several of General Growth's malls likely can't be sold because they're "under water," meaning their value has declined below what is owed on their mortgages. If so, lenders who provided those mortgages can ask the bankruptcy judge for permission to foreclose on the properties. However, they'll first have to convince the judge that those malls aren't critical to General Growth's restructuring or liquidation plan. Green Street Advisors estimates that roughly 60 of General Growth's malls   mostly those of average or below-average quality   are now valued at less than their mortgage amounts.

Other mall owners are acutely aware of the damage that a General Growth liquidation could do to the value of their own malls and to lenders' willingness to lend to the industry. Thus, many prefer that General Growth survive as a standalone company. "I believe that the most value will be preserved for all parties by a negotiated solution that keeps the company intact," said Edward Glickman, president and chief operating officer of Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust, which owns 38 malls.

Some, however, anticipate fortifying their dominance of the mall industry as General Growth crumbles, even if the collapse roils the industry for a while. That's the case for David Simon, chairman and chief executive of Simon, the largest U.S. mall owner by number of properties and one often mentioned as a potential acquirer of various General Growth malls. "The reason is very simple: You're the strong and you get stronger, and the No. 2 competitor, no matter what happens, is weakened for years to come," Mr. Simon said at an investment conference in March. "We should benefit from that in the long run. In that I feel confident."

One thing General Growth's bankruptcy doesn't signal is a widespread closure of the company's malls. The company's downfall didn't result from store closures and curtailed shopping. To wit, General Growth's malls, widely considered to be of above-average quality, posted a healthy occupancy of 92.5% in last year's fourth quarter, though the cash flow they generate was sapped by the recession's toll on retailers and shoppers alike. General Growth's undoing, instead, was its stockpiling of debt and its subsequent struggles to refinance or pay off that debt in this recession.

Furthermore, the bankruptcy process doesn't allow retailers to break leases if it is their landlord seeks protection from creditors. "The malls will continue to operate," UBS AG analyst Jeff Spector said. "Tenants are obligated to fulfill lease contracts."

Led by Matthew Bucksbaum and his late brother, Martin, General Growth initially specialized in building malls in secondary and tertiary cities. Humble and hard-working, the Bucksbaums named their company General Growth --rather than using the family name -- so that investors would find it in the stock tables between stalwarts General Electric Co. and General Motors Corp. General Growth turned aggressive after its 1993 public offering, making several big acquisitions in the following 15 years to become the second-largest U.S. mall owner behind Simon Property Group Inc. The company's more than 200 malls are scattered across 44 states and include high-profile venues Water Tower Place in Chicago, Faneuil Hall in Boston and Ala Moana Center in Honolulu.

With General Growth seeking bankruptcy, the Bucksbaums now are the saga's biggest losers. The family has seen its 25% stake in the company   worth more than $4 billion at its height in 2007   dwindle to less than $100 million. The family has sold no General Growth stock since the company's second stint as a publicly traded venture started in 1993. "These are basically great, hard-working, ethical people, and this saddens me," said Morris Mark, a New York investment manager and friend of the Bucksbaums who served on General Growth's board from 1992 to 2002.

The mall giant's collapse is a rare event for a real estate investment trust, the widely used corporate structure created by tax authorities during the real-estate bust of the early 1990s to allow big real-estate owners to raise much needed capital by selling stock. Most leading U.S. developers adopted the REIT structure, which allows them to pool money from numerous investors for use in buying or developing properties. Most publicly traded REITs are more conservative in their use of debt than are private developers.

But General Growth took a different tack, loading up on short-term mortgages to finance its acquisition sprees and counting on the deep lending markets of the real-estate boom for continuous refinancing. Ultimately, that heavy reliance on debt, coupled with the credit market's unraveling in the past year, led to the mall giant's downfall.

"It's a black eye for the mall [property] sector," Green Street analyst Jim Sullivan said. "But General Growth's problems were clearly self-inflicted."

General Growth's mountain of debt grew primarily because the company's executives, namely former Chief Financial Officer Bernie Freibaum, favored mortgages as a primary financing tool. A mortgage, which is tied to a specific property, doesn't place restrictions on how much debt a borrower can put on its other properties. In contrast, corporate bonds and bank loans   used more widely by other mall owners - restrict a borrower's overall indebtedness through debt covenants and credit ratings.

"If we wanted to use bonds, we would have to keep a significant amount of our malls [debt-free]. Otherwise, you don't get an investment-grade rating from the [credit-rating] agencies," Mr. Freibaum said in a March 2008 interview. General Growth considered mortgages "a lot more available" and more flexible than were bonds and bank lines, he said. He hasn't returned messages seeking comment in recent months.

Mr. Freibaum answered to John Bucksbaum, the founding-family scion who ascended through General Growth's ranks to become CEO in 1999. An avid skier and cyclist, Mr. Bucksbaum took a behind-the-scenes role overseeing leasing, development and other duties while Mr. Freibaum handled lenders and investors.

With Messrs. Freibaum and Bucksbaum at the helm, General Growth's debt swelled to $27 billion by 2007, amounting to one of the highest debt-to-asset ratios among publicly traded mall REITs. But as the capital markets dried up in 2008, General Growth found it couldn't refinance on affordable terms its many debts coming due. The company turned to selling equity, raising $822 million in March 2008. It also examined selling stakes in its malls, but it didn't complete such a deal.

On Oct. 3, the board dismissed Mr. Freibaum, reasoning that he no longer could handle delicate negotiations with lenders and that he was at odds with the company's main advisor, Goldman Sachs Group, these people say. Roughly three weeks later, the board requested the resignation of Mr. Bucksbaum as CEO after discovering that his family trust had, without seeking the board's approval, loaned Mr. Freibaum $90 million and President and Chief Operating Officer Bob Michaels $10 million to help them pay margin loans on their General Growth stock holdings. Mr. Bucksbaum remains as chairman and Mr. Michaels as a senior executive. Lead director Adam Metz stepped in as CEO and fellow director Thomas Nolan as president and, eventually, chief operating officer.

With General Growth now in bankruptcy court, a wide array of creditors will jostle to recoup as much as possible from the company. Roughly $18.3 billion of General Growth's debt is secured, meaning those investors have direct claim to one or more of General Growth's properties. Another $6.6 billion is unsecured in the form of bonds, convertible debt and a credit facility. The unsecured creditors can recoup their outlays only after the secured creditors have been made whole. Much of the rest of the debt is held by joint ventures in which General Growth teamed with partners to buy various malls.

A key battle in bankruptcy court will involve $3.1 billion in bonds that General Growth inherited from takeover target Rouse. General Growth operated Rouse as a separate subsidiary, meaning those bondholders can argue that they should have exclusive claim to Rouse malls, which are of higher quality than the rest of General Growth's portfolio. If a bankruptcy judge opts to consolidate those bonds with the rest of General Growth's unsecured debt, the fatter proceeds gained from selling the Rouse malls will be spread among all unsecured creditors rather than being set aside solely for Rouse bondholders.

Pang Steps Aside at Firm As U.S. Launches Probe

California money manager Danny Pang temporarily stepped aside at his investment firm, which says it runs assets worth $4 billion, as federal civil and criminal officials began to look into allegations of impropriety.

In the civil inquiry, an attorney for a former president of Mr. Pang's firm -- Private Equity Management Group Inc. -- said he has been contacted by the Securities and Exchange Commission's Los Angeles office. The lawyer, Jeffrey Benice, said he will meet with the agency early next week. An SEC official declined to comment.

Federal criminal investigators are also looking at the firm, known as PEMGroup, a person familiar with that matter said Thursday. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles didn't have any comment, nor did a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Los Angeles office.

PEMGroup, based in Irvine, Calif., was the focus of a Wall Street Journal article this week that said Mr. Pang's academic degrees and claim to have worked at Morgan Stanley couldn't be verified. The most serious allegation of improper behavior, leveled by the former PEMGroup president, Nasar Aboubakare, was that part of PEMGroup had been involved in a Ponzi scheme. PEMGroup strongly denied that and called other allegations fabrications. It also attacked Mr. Aboubakare as an ex-employee who had been terminated for taking kickbacks, and said that Mr. Pang stands by his credentials.

PEMGroup said Thursday its board had appointed a special committee to look into the allegations and had retained law firm Gibson, Dunn &Crutcher LLP to assist it. Mr. Pang voluntarily stepped aside as both chairman and CEO pending the outcome, PEMGroup said. Named interim chairman was Robert Anderson, formerly chief operating officer.

"PEMG takes very seriously the trust its clients have placed in it and as such, we intend to fully investigate allegations and issues raised," Mr. Anderson said in a statement provided by PEMGroup.

The firm said Chief Financial Officer Wilbur Quon also voluntarily stepped aside pending the outcome of the internal inquiry. A PEMGroup spokesman, Mike Sitrick, said last week that Mr. Quon is being investigated by the Internal Revenue Service for something related to a prior employer. It was unclear whether that contributed to Thursday's move. Mr. Quon, who hasn't been charged with anything, didn't return a call seeking comment, and an IRS official declined to comment.

The special committee will consist of Mr. Anderson and Sandra Chang, managing director, research and analytics.

PEMGroup raised most of its funds in Taiwan, where Mr. Pang, 42 years old, was born. The firm invests in U.S. assets such as company debt, time-share properties and life-insurance policies bought at discount.

Some of the Taiwanese banks that invested in PEMGroup say they're relying on insurance coverage that the California firm said it would buy to protect their principal and interest. It isn't clear how substantial that coverage is.

One of Mr. Aboubakare's allegations was that Mr. Pang asked him to create a fake insurance document to increase coverage. PEMGroup says it discovered the phony document only after Mr. Aboubakare had been fired and denies the firm or Mr. Pang had any role in faking it.

PEMGroup's main insurance coverage for its investors is provided by an affiliate the firm established in the British Virgin Islands, Fides Insurance Co. Asked how well Fides is capitalized, PEMGroup's spokesman said earlier this week that it met all statutory requirements in the British Virgin Islands and is audited annually. He said PEMGroup also bolsters its coverage with reinsurance.

One Taiwanese institution, Taichung Commercial Bank Co., said Thursday its PEMGroup investments were backed by German insurer Talanx AG. Talanx said its exposure is limited to $20 million. It couldn't be learned immediately whether PEMGroup has other reinsurance.

Taiwan's Financial Supervisory Commission said it is looking into the extent to which Taiwanese banks resold PEMGroup's financial products to investors. "We know we have banks that sell its products and are looking into the investments' structures -- and, most important of all, who takes the risks," said the head of the commission's Banking Bureau, Ming-Daw Chang.

Hua Nan Commercial Bank, a unit of Hua Nan Financial Holding Co., said in a statement it placed in a newspaper that PEMGroup products the bank sold to other investors were guaranteed for principal and interest by "large international financial institutions," which it didn't name. To be "prudent," the bank has asked lawyers to look into the contracts related to the products, the statement said. Two Hua Nan managers said the bank marketed about $200 million of structured notes linked to assets originated by PEMGroup.

Beijing Ponders One Slump or Two

Economists are roundly cheerful about China's worst quarterly economic performance in nearly 20 years.

The 6.1% rise in first-quarter gross domestic product, way down from the double-digit levels of recent years, does belie some encouraging signs for the economy.

Manufacturing output, up 8.3% on the year in March, is growing at a healthy clip again. A range of indicators, from rebounding car sales to faster fixed-asset investment growth, all look positive.

In sum, a belief that the past three months represents the trough of China's slowdown has taken hold -- with credit due to last autumn's $586 billion fiscal stimulus and a surge in lending from state-owned banks, mainly to state-owned enterprises.

Now the debate among economists is becoming more alphabetical. Is this recovery V-shaped, with China set to return quickly to the high-level growth of recent years? Or is it more W-shaped, as a government spending-led recovery this year peters out and China's longer term structural issues resurface?

The risk in Beijing's spending-and-lending stimulus measures is of an eventual, large misallocation of resources.

That the state-owned sector is driving the recovery is clear. There are two purchasing managers' indexes in China: The one that reflects activity among state-owned enterprises is now in positive territory, while the private-sector-weighted index, calculated by CLSA Asia Pacific Markets, is still contracting.

Optimists argue Beijing's stimulus spending via state companies will have a multiplier effect on the rest of the economy. For that to happen, it is important that it helps to stimulate consumer spending, which accounts for less than 40% of GDP, compared with about 70% in the U.S. So far, and China's data here aren't the best, the results on that front are mixed. Also, unemployment is rising and deflation is a danger. Prices have fallen for two months in a row, something that could discourage household outlays.

In reality, raising China's reliance on domestic consumption is a big long-term effort, involving the creation of properly functioning social-welfare and pension systems to encourage people to reduce their focus on saving. Stephen Green, a Standard Chartered economist, suggests radical policies are needed, including a huge rise in health-insurance funding, personal-income-tax cuts and recycling more profits from state-owned firms to consumers.

Meanwhile, the immediate danger of crowding out more efficient private-sector activity is high. Without external help, namely a resumption of Western demand for Chinese exports, the government pump will be the only thing preventing China's V-shaped recovery from turning W-shaped.

China's fiscal strength gives it leeway to keep money flowing into state enterprises and projects if need be -- Stimulus II, so to speak. But that isn't a long-term alternative.

-- Andrew Peaple

Static Is Spoiling Nokia's Optimistic Line

It doesn't take much to boost investors' spirits these days. Just look at the 11% rally that followed Nokia's first-quarter results.

Never mind that the company's net income was nearly obliterated, largely because of a severe rundown in distributor inventories. With any luck, that will soon reverse.

Instead, the focus was on Nokia's disclosure that it was seeing signs of stability returning to the mobile-devices market. As Nokia's CEO said, "The market is no longer falling in an uncontrolled manner" -- hardly inspiring, but it could have been worse.

Also encouraging were the signs Nokia may have halted its market-share slide. Its share of the overall handset market was 37%, flat with the fourth quarter, after falling from 39% in the first quarter of 2008, Nokia said.

Even so, Nokia continues to face intense challenges. In emerging markets, long a stronghold for Nokia, rivals such as Samsung are making inroads with low-priced phones. At the smart-phone end of the market, Nokia has been savaged by BlackBerry maker Research In Motion, iPhone maker Apple and HTC. Its share has fallen from above 50% in early 2007 to what Nokia estimates was 38% in the first quarter.

That is important because, while the smart-phone segment accounts for only about 15% of handset sales, it generates about half of the industry's profits, according to Strategy Analytics' Neil Mawston.

With a strong lineup of new phones, Nokia has a shot at regaining some lost share in smart phones. But competition in that segment is intensifying. Until it shows real progress, investors should be more skeptical.

Ackman DIPs Into GGP

In most bankruptcies, stockholders wait for scraps while creditors chew over a distressed company's fate. Not so for Bill Ackman, who as a shareholder in General Growth Properties has plumped out for a prime seat at the negotiating table.

The activist investor's firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, will provide $375 million in ultrasenior financing for General Growth while it reorganizes through bankruptcy. The so-called debtor-in-possession, or DIP, financing gives Pershing valuable sway to protect its roughly 25% equity stake.

Mr. Ackman is exploiting a cash-scarce environment to juice his bet on the company's operations. With many banks too constrained to provide DIP financing, Pershing Square is empowered to push for ways to reduce the company's $27 billion in debt.

The financing terms give a hint of how much Pershing Square can flex its muscles. The pact carries 7% in combined commitment and exit fees, among the highest for any DIP agreement since the credit crisis began, according to Standard &Poor's.

Pershing Square may be rewarded handsomely. The DIP terms include warrants to buy 4.9% of the company if it emerges healthy from bankruptcy, and General Growth also has the option to repay the entire $375 million to Pershing Square in stock. This time, Mr. Ackman may have truly gone all in.

A Favorable

Trade-Off

For J.P. Morgan

In a curious twist, banks' sometimes vilified trading operations have been the stars of the earnings season so far.

J.P. Morgan Chase echoed Goldman Sachs Group with results on Thursday that were heavy on investment-banking profits, but weaker elsewhere.

In terms of beating the consensus forecast, J.P. Morgan's 25% margin doesn't compare with Goldman's home run. But in other ways, its results look better. J.P. Morgan's big win came in fixed-income markets. Unlike Goldman, this didn't come with a big jump in the bank's overall value-at-risk measure, although in absolute dollars it remains higher. Nor did the skew toward trading revenue look as pronounced, with J.P. Morgan's equity underwriting and advisory businesses showing more resilience.

Both banks' results may reflect the emergence of industry haves and have-nots. Most banks rely on Washington's helping hand right now. Cheap government-guaranteed financing most likely helped institutions take trading risks they might otherwise have curtailed.

But the likes of J.P. Morgan are setting themselves apart. Even without TARP, J.P. Morgan says its Tier 1 capital ratio is above its target range of 8% to 8.5%.

J.P. Morgan's Achilles' heel is exposure to consumers, where guidance on losses accelerated in credit cards, home-equity loans and prime mortgages. At least, however, the bank can funnel investment-banking profits into loan-loss reserves.

With unemployment still rising and home prices still falling, those banks less able to take risk likely will struggle. That is bad for them, but no picnic for regulators trying for broad resuscitation, either.

-- Liam Denning

Overheard

Pity analysts compiling equity league-table rankings for their banks. Shares in language-software provider Rosetta Stone began trading on Thursday. The $112.5 million initial public offering of stock is one of only five in America so far this year.

In such thin markets, the leader board for U.S. IPO rankings can change radically with every small deal. Rosetta's flotation has established Morgan Stanley in a clear No. 3 position. But for how long?

Going, going, gone? Bean counters qualify their audit opinion of a company when they have some doubt it can remain a "going concern." Based on SEC filings up to March 26, research firm Audit Analytics reckons the proportion of companies with such accounts for 2008 could hit 23.4% -- well above 2003's low of 15% while also topping levels seen in the last recession.

NEW YORK -- J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. has disbanded a team of as many as 400 people working in a former Bear Stearns division that was viewed as a leading unit for advisory and technical work related to complex credit, according to a person familiar with the matter.

In an internal announcement Wednesday, the bank said members of the Financial Analytics and Structured Transactions team, also known as Fast and which offered analysis and intelligence on complex credit transactions, have been reassigned to other teams within the bank.

The Fast team was a unit within fixed-income and trading inherited as part of J.P. Morgan's purchase of Bear Stearns Cos. last year. At its height, the team was seen as key for Bear and had a high profile.

After taking break, banks ramp up foreclosures --- Increase in supply threatens prices of U.S. real estate

Some of the nation's largest mortgage companies are stepping up foreclosures on delinquent homeowners. That will likely lead to more Americans losing their homes just as the Obama administration's housing-rescue plan gets into gear.

J.P. Morgan Chase &Co., Wells Fargo &Co., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac all say they have increased foreclosure activity in recent weeks. Those companies say they have lifted internal moratoriums which temporarily halted foreclosures.

Some mortgage companies had stopped foreclosing on borrowers as they waited for details of the Obama administration's housing-rescue plan, announced in February, which provides incentives for mortgage companies and investors to reduce borrowers' payments to affordable levels. Others had temporarily halted foreclosures while they put their own programs in place, or in response to changes in state laws.

Now, they have begun to determine which troubled borrowers are candidates for help, and to move the rest through the foreclosure process.

The resulting increase in the supply of foreclosed homes could further depress home prices and put additional pressure on bank earnings as troubled loans are written off.

Some of the mortgage companies are themselves receiving funds under the U.S. government's financial-sector bailout, which could make their actions politically sensitive. But mortgage companies say they are taking steps to keep borrowers in their homes, and are only resorting to foreclosure when there are no other options.

Foreclosure sales had dropped in the second half of 2008 as mortgage companies delayed taking action against delinquent borrowers. But sales have been edging up this year, according to LPS Applied Analytics, which tracks loan performance. Foreclosure-related filings increased by nearly 6% in February from the month earlier, and were up almost 30% from February 2008, according to RealtyTrac. The backlog of seriously delinquent loans has been growing.

In California, notices of trustee sales, which are preludes to foreclosure sales, climbed by more than 80% to 33,178 in March, from February, according to data from ForeclosureRadar.com and the Field Check Group. The increase reflects both the expiration of foreclosure moratoriums and a California law enacted late last year that temporarily delayed default and foreclosure notices, says Mark Hanson, president of the Field Check Group, a research firm.

Ronald Temple, co-director of research at Lazard Asset Management, expects home prices to fall 22% to 27% from their January levels. More than 2.1 million homes will be lost this year because borrowers can't meet their loan payments, up from about 1.7 million in 2008, according to Moody's Economy.com.

Mortgage-servicing companies, such as J.P. Morgan Chase and Wells Fargo, collect mortgage payments and work with troubled borrowers, both for loans they own and those held by investors.

J.P. Morgan Chase has increased foreclosure actions since the expiration of a moratorium on new foreclosures that began on Oct. 31, and a later moratorium put in place at President Obama's request. The Oct. 31 moratorium delayed foreclosures on more than $22 billion of Chase-owned mortgages involving more than 80,000 homeowners.

"We had stopped putting additional loans into the foreclosure process so we could be sure that delinquent borrowers would have every opportunity to take advantage of new initiatives that we were putting in place," a Chase spokesman says. Borrowers who are now receiving foreclosure-sale notices, he said, "own vacant properties, have not been in contact with us and/or do not qualify for the modification programs."

Citigroup Inc. says it stopped all foreclosures until March 12, at the Obama administration's request, on loans serviced for Fannie and Freddie. Since then, says a spokesman, it has "reverted to our previous business-as-usual moratorium."

Under that policy, it won't initiate a foreclosure sale for any borrower who is working with Citigroup and is a good candidate for a loan modification, provided Citigroup owns the loan or has investor approval. "For borrowers who do not qualify under these criteria and where no other options are available, we will move forward with foreclosures," the spokesman says.

Wells Fargo has also increased foreclosure actions since the expiration of its foreclosure moratorium, put into place while it awaited details on the administration's plan.

Wells Fargo "will continue to work with our customers to find solutions up to the actual point of a foreclosure sale," a Wells Fargo spokesman says. "But the expiration of foreclosure moratoriums is having an impact."

Both Fannie and Freddie have stepped up sales of foreclosed properties since their moratoriums ended March 31.

Freddie says it has started to complete some foreclosure sales, such as those involving investment properties or second homes, though it continues to delay foreclosures on loans that may be eligible for modification under the Obama plan.

Fannie has told servicers that "a foreclosure sale may not occur on a Fannie Mae loan until the loan servicer verifies that the borrower is ineligible" for a loan modification under the Obama administration's plan, "and all other foreclosure prevention alternatives have been exhausted," a Fannie spokeswoman says.

GMAC's mortgage division, which had temporarily halted foreclosures while awaiting details of the Obama plan, is now reviewing loans to see which ones will qualify under the program. So far, about 10% of borrowers in some stage of foreclosure appear to be eligible for the federal program, a company spokeswoman says.

Although GMAC may be able to work with investors who own these loans to come up with another solution, she says, many borrowers who don't qualify for help under the federal program are likely to wind up in foreclosure.

Mortgage companies are sorting through loan files to determine which borrowers are candidates for help. "At the time a moratorium expires, we have a team of folks who will pore through all of those loans where borrowers have not paid before we will take the next step in the process," says Jim Davis, executive vice president for American Home Mortgage Servicing Inc. "If there is any borrower contact, we will hold off on the foreclosure process until we've exhausted every effort to assist that borrower."

Still, some borrowers who are currently talking to their mortgage companies are also likely to wind up in foreclosure once their files are reviewed. "We are getting so many of these cases where people don't fit the new [Obama] program," says Michael Thompson, director of Iowa Mediation Service, which works with troubled borrowers. Many borrowers are unemployed or underemployed or have credit problems that go well beyond their mortgage troubles, he says.

Many have been "playing for time" while the moratoriums have been in place, he says. But the delays have only increased the amount of interest and fees they owe, making their loans "nonviable in the long run."

Many troubled loans will ultimately wind up in foreclosure because the borrower doesn't have sufficient income to make even a reduced mortgage payment, or doesn't respond to the mortgage company's requests for information. "Certainly half of the loans that would have wound up in foreclosure before the foreclosure moratoriums went in place" will ultimately wind up in foreclosure, says Michael Brauneis, director of regulatory risk consulting at Protiviti Inc., a consulting firm.

While many troubled loans are held by hedge funds, pension funds and other investors, the expiration of foreclosure moratoriums could also put a dent in bank profits, says Frederick Cannon, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette &Woods.

The moratoriums "have to some degree postponed the realization of problems" and "may help bank earnings in the first quarter" by delaying charge-offs of some troubled loans, he says.

The Property Report
Deal of the Week: How the Developers Of 1101 K St. in D.C. Got a Loan -- and Rest

By Maura Webber Sadovi

Among the real-estate executives losing the most sleep in this credit-starved world are developers who are finishing up projects who need to take out construction financing with longer-term mortgages.

The developers of 1101 K St., a 310,824-square foot office building in Washington, can now rest easier. With only a few days to go before their roughly $100 million construction loan became due, the venture of JBG Cos. and Rockwood Capital LLC just got a new $100.5 million mortgage on the property. The new lender was Germany-based Landesbank Hessen-Thuringen Girozentrale, a sign that German lenders are active in the U.S. market.

But getting the loan wasn't easy.

Although the Washington office market is better than many, it is still suffering from anemic demand. Also weakening lender appetite: The building at 1101 K St. is only about 60% leased, even though the building opened in 2007 and is located near the convention center in a submarket popular with lobbyists and law firms. The area had a 6.9% vacancy rate in the fourth quarter compared with 12.4% metro-wide, according to Property &Portfolio Research Inc. But the vacancy rate downtown is expected to rise partly because about 1.6 million square feet of new office space is expected to be completed this year.

JBG, of Chevy Chase, Md., which developed the property for the venture, and Rockwood, of White Plains, N.Y., originally hoped to sell the building after completion. But the weak sales and leasing markets forced them to switch strategy. In November they began looking for a mortgage. But as the economic crisis deepened, some U.S. life-insurance companies expressed concern about the loan's size and took a pass at refinancing it, says Bob Donhauser, a senior managing director with mortgage-banking firm Holliday Fenoglio Fowler LP, which represented JBG and Rockwood.

Bank of America Corp., which provided the construction loan, considered extending the loan but its terms were too onerous, Mr. Donhauser says. The bank wanted 50% of the loan to be "recourse," meaning that it would have claims to other borrower assets besides 1101 K St. if there was a default. Bank of America couldn't be reached for comment.

Several German lenders nibbled. With credit tight and many U.S. lenders focused on managing their existing portfolios rather than offering fresh loans in an environment with uncertain building values, some European banks are still stepping up to lend more in the U.S., says Matthew Anderson, a partner with Oakland, Calif.-based Foresight Analytics LLC. "There still seems to be money available from European banks and German banks in particular," Mr. Anderson says.

The new three-year loan from Landesbank, has a fixed interest rate below 6% for the first three years and is due in March of 2012 though it includes an option to extend it for one-year, people involved in the deal say. The bank, also known as Helaba, didn't return calls for comment.

The developers were helped by JBG's strong reputation in the Washington area. The firm, which raises investment funds, has about $10 billion in office, residential and hotel assets under management or development. Its portfolio includes such other D.C. properties as the Department of Transportation's new headquarters and the I.M. Pei-designed L'Enfant Plaza Hotel. Joseph Gildenhorn, a one-time U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, was one of the founders and remains an investor though he is no longer active in the company, JBG says.

JBG also has been one of the few active buyers in the office market. In February it took a $60 million equity stake in the large two-building TechWorld office complex, located near the newer office building it refinanced.

Separately, JBG also recently paid about $35 million in equity and assumed debt for two suburban office buildings in McLean, Va.

James Iker, a managing director at JBG, says the 1101 K St. financing was helped by the low value of the loan to the property. The refinancing equates to about $325 a square foot for the property, which he says will be worth over $600 a square foot once it is leased up.

At the peak of the market, prime new office properties were selling for more than $800 a square foot, he says. "Financing is still out there selectively," Mr. Iker says.

Crisis looms in commercial real estate --- Delinquency rate at 1.8%, near the peak of the last recession; parallels to U.S. savings-and-loan debacle

Commercial real-estate loans are going sour at an accelerating pace, threatening to cause tens of billions of dollars in losses to banks already hurt by the housing downturn.

The delinquency rate on about $700 billion in securitized loans backed by office buildings, hotels, stores and other investment property has more than doubled since September to 1.8% this month, according to data provided to The Wall Street Journal by Deutsche Bank AG. While that is low compared with the home-mortgage delinquency rate, it is just short of the highest rate in the last downturn early this decade.

Some experts say it now looks as if the current commercial real-estate slump will rival or even exceed the one in the early 1990s, when bad commercial-property debt played a big role in dragging the economy into a recession. Then, close to 1,000 U.S. banks and savings institutions failed. Lenders took about $48.5 billion in charges on commercial real-estate debt from 1990 to 1995, representing 7.9% of such debt outstanding.

Since late 2007, 47 banks and savings institutions have failed, of which a dozen or so had unusually high commercial-mortgage exposure. Foresight Analytics estimates the U.S. banking sector could suffer as much as $250 billion in commercial real-estate losses in this downturn. The research firm projects that more than 700 banks could fail as a result of their exposure to commercial real estate.

Commercial property may not be hit as hard as many fear if the economy pulls out of recession more quickly, driving up rents and occupancy rates. And greater availability of financing -- a goal of the Obama administration -- could lift property values.

General Growth Properties Inc., one of the biggest mall owners, has been teetering on the brink of a bankruptcy filing and recently failed to repay maturing loans on shopping centers in Hayward, Calif., and Humble, Texas, according to Trepp, a firm that tracks the commercial-property debt market. John Hancock Tower in Boston is being sold in a foreclosure auction. The problem was underscored when Moody's Investors Service downgraded Bank of America Corp. Wednesday, citing likely increases in souring "credit cards, residential and commercial real estate loans." The bank declined to comment on the downgrade.

Commercial real-estate debt is potentially more dangerous to the financial system than debt classes such as credit cards and student loans because of its size. The Real Estate Roundtable, a trade group, estimates that commercial real estate in the U.S. is valued at $6.5 trillion and financed by about $3.1 trillion in debt. Partly because the commercial real-estate debt market is nearly three times as big as in the early 1990s, potential losses in dollar terms loom larger.

According to an analysis of bank financial reports by The Wall Street Journal, the broad shift to real-estate lending can be seen by comparing commercial real-estate loans -- including both mortgages and construction loans -- with banks' so-called Tier 1 capital, a key indicator of a bank's ability to absorb losses. In 1993, less than 2% of the nation's banks and savings institutions had commercial real-estate exposure exceeding five times their Tier 1 capital. By the end of 2008, that had risen to about 12%, or about 800 financial institutions. A higher ratio means a thinner cushion for loans that go sour.

The Federal Reserve and the Treasury are moving to adapt a funding program to make it attractive for investors to buy debt backed by office buildings, hotels, stores and other income-producing property. The program, called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, was begun to finance purchases of debt backed by consumer credit, and officials will expand its use to include commercial-property debt.

The Fed is an institution that typically made short-term debt available. In TALF, federal loans run three years, already a duration Fed officials are uncomfortable making. But even that might not be long enough to spur investor demand for commercial-mortgage securities, which typically mature over 10 years.

Real-estate industry executives have been trying to resolve these issues with Fed and Treasury officials in meetings led by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, say people familiar with the matter. The government officials are considering extending the TALF to accommodate the needs of the commercial real-estate industry, but no decisions have been made. In a statement Monday, the Treasury suggested the Fed might alter the terms of its loans to investors to make them more attractive for long-term securities.

Jeffrey DeBoer, CEO of the Real Estate Roundtable, said, "The danger is a repeat of what happened on the residential side: A complete choking up, foreclosure disasters and increased stress on the banking system."

As recently as last summer, delinquency rates on commercial mortgages were at historically low levels, and many experts thought problems wouldn't be as bad in this downturn.

But owners could borrow so much on the expectation of rising property values and cash flows that some are at risk now that rents and occupancy are falling. "In just seven months, we've gone from the best of times to the worst of times," said Richard Parkus, head of commercial mortgage securities research at Deutsche Bank.

Even some performing loans could face trouble because of a fall in values of the properties, making it hard for owners to refinance when loans come due. Currently, many banks are agreeing to grant short-term extensions on loans. But "that's just kicking the can down the street for a while," said William Rudin, an owner of New York City office buildings. "That doesn't solve the problem."

Of $154.5 billion of securitized commercial mortgages coming due from now through 2012, about two-thirds likely won't qualify for refinancing, Deutsche Bank predicts. Its estimate assumes declines in commercial-property values of 35% to 45% from the peak in 2007. That would exceed the price drops in the downturn of the early 1990s.

The bank estimates the default rates on the $700 billion of commercial-mortgage-backed securities could hit at least 30%, and loss rates, which figure in the amounts recovered by lenders, could reach more than 10%, the peak seen in the early 1990s.

Besides securities backed by commercial real-estate loans, about $524.5 billion of whole commercial mortgages held by U.S. banks and thrifts are expected to come due from this year through 2012. Nearly 50% wouldn't qualify for refinancing in a tight credit environment, as they exceed 90% of the property's value, estimates Matthew Anderson, partner at Foresight Analytics. Today, lenders generally won't loan over 65% of a commercial property's value.

In contrast to home mortgages -- the majority of which were made by only 10 or so giant institutions -- hundreds of small and regional banks loaded up on commercial real estate. As of Dec. 31, more than 2,900 banks and savings institutions had more than 300% of their risk-based capital in commercial real-estate loans, including both commercial mortgages and construction loans.

Geithner's Gamble Needs Speculators

As last throws of the dice go, this is midnight at the craps table for Timothy Geithner.

On Monday the Treasury secretary laid out plans aimed at cleaning up bank balance sheets and resurrecting the securitization market, which once helped credit flow through the economy.

The Treasury wants to persuade private investors to buy loans and asset-backed securities. It aims to do that by using dwindling Troubled Asset Relief Program dollars to invest in such assets alongside private investors.

The government will also provide and guarantee cheap loans so returns on these assets can be magnified with leverage.

This all will be done through public-private investment funds and through the expansion of the Federal Reserve's Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility.

The Treasury envisions $100 billion of equity being levered up to buy $500 billion of assets, and maybe as much as $1 trillion over time. The financing will come from government-guaranteed debt issued by the funds and from the Fed.

The first risk: Treasury may be trying to revive segments of the securitization market that only existed because of years of easy money, not because their practices and economics were sound.

As a result, when the government stops lending, the prices of leveraged assets could plunge. Knowing this, it might be hard to generate sustained buying.

Take securities and loans backed by commercial real estate. These have plunged in price, as investors fear issuers will find it hard to refinance this debt when it comes due.

And the numbers aren't small: Some $814 billion of these bonds and loans are set to mature from 2009 to 2011, according to Foresight Analytics.

If this market is merely experiencing a shortfall in confidence and liquidity, the Treasury's latest moves may work.

But if the underlying properties are worth much less today, the government is engaged in a game of price support it can't ultimately win.

This also applies to Treasury's aim for banks to use the schemes to sell off tainted assets. Investors, even with leverage provided by the government, will likely bid for assets well below what banks are willing to sell at.

After all, investors need to build in a big margin of error given that the range of estimated losses on bank assets is enormous. CreditSights projects collective losses of the four biggest U.S. banks through the end of next year could be anywhere from $250 billion to $450 billion.

Granted, the Treasury can fill any holes on bank balance sheets resulting from losses on asset sales with equity injections from the TARP. But it isn't clear there are enough TARP funds to do that on a big scale.

Mr. Geithner really has gone all in.

Suncor's Solution to the Riddle of the Sands

Suncor Energy's $15 billion merger with Petro-Canada recalls the megadeals of a decade ago. Similar to then, this is a defensive, all-stock deal following a collapse in oil prices.

The added twist is oil sands, which comprise virtually all of Suncor's reserves and 64% of Petro-Canada's. More important, though, most of the latter's current output comes from conventional oil fields.

In essence, Suncor, a pioneer of the oil-sands industry, is conceding that being a pure play on this high-cost resource is unsustainable in a world of volatile oil prices. Extracting oil from sands requires vast upfront investment.

On the other hand, oil from sands is mined, not forced out by underground pressure, as in regular fields. So once the upfront investment is made, oil sands don't require the maintenance capital expenditure needed by mature conventional fields. The merged company can now toggle capex more easily between conventional and sands projects, depending on economic conditions.

Despite offering a 33% premium to Friday's closing price, Suncor's terms equate to less than nine times 2010 earnings for PetroCanada -- using stock valued at more than 12 times.

What is more, government restrictions on ownership of Petro-Canada will transfer to the new merged entity. Last year, 40% of energy deals globally involved unconventional resources, according to IHS Herold. Foreign majors such as France's Total are attracted by the Canadian oil sands' large resources and relatively low political risk. With Suncor having seen its market capitalization drop from almost $68 billion last year to just $16 billion recently, linking up with Petro-Canada looks defensive in more ways than one.

Hungry for a Leader in Budapest

Help wanted: prime minister, one-year contract, medium-size and middle-income Eastern European country, economy on International Monetary Fund life support. Top priority: big cuts in public spending to keep budget deficit to 3% of gross domestic product this year ahead of an election due in spring 2010.

Whoever succeeds Hungarian Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsany, who tendered his resignation this weekend, has an unenviable task. The country now faces a far more severe correction than the one envisaged in the current budget, which was premised on a 3% contraction, and by the IMF and European Union when they agreed on a $25 billion credit line for Hungary late in 2008. Budapest may have to find $1.4 billion to $2.3 billion in budget cuts to hold the deficit to the level the IMF believes is necessary.

The political challenge of instituting big cutbacks in social spending as unemployment rises is huge.

Still, it isn't all gloom. Billion of dollars of IMF and EU aid have helped stabilize the forint and the local banking system. Hungary might muddle through for a few months. Should Hungary need more international support, it is likely to be available. But any further aid will depend partly on Hungary's commitment to reform. A fresh election and a new government would be preferable to a lame-duck prime minister.

Aabar Hopes

For Traction

With Daimler

What really lies behind Abu Dhabi's 1.95 billion euro ($2.65 billion) investment in Daimler? Aabar Investments, which is majority owned by the Gulf emirate, insists the deal is purely financial. But Abu Dhabi's motives may also be strategic.

Aabar is acquiring a 9.1% stake at a price equal to a 5% discount for Daimler based on Friday's closing share price. And with the shares down 60% in two years, Aabar may feel it is getting a bargain. But Abu Dhabi hasn't done well with past acquisitions of big stakes in Western companies. Its investments in Citigroup and Barclays, for example, are deep underwater. Even with a seat on Daimler's board, Aabar will struggle to exercise influence over the management of one of Germany's most prestigious brands.

The deal looks more promising from a strategic perspective. After all, Abu Dhabi's rulers can hardly be happy to see an industry whose growth guarantees high oil prices suffering a slow and agonizing decline. The Middle East's third-largest oil producer has been building a strategic presence in the auto industry for some time. It is in Abu Dhabi's interest to support auto makers like Daimler to ensure there is no shortage of cash to fund new models.

Indeed, the Kuwait Investment Authority is also an investor in Daimler, a company that was previously part of Dubai International Capital's portfolio. Other automotive companies that benefit from Arab money include Aston Martin, Ferrari and Fiat. And with U.S. auto makers begging President Obama's federal government for bailouts, it may only be a matter of time before Arab money comes to Detroit's rescue, too.

Overheard

Something has jolted the U.S. independent power sector to life. In the past five trading sessions, battered stocks such as Mirant and Reliant Energy have jumped by 15% and 19%, respectively. Dynegy is up 32%.

Investors' renewed taste for risk, alongside a jump in natural-gas prices, which often set power prices, have no doubt played a part.

The other possibility is the potential for M&A. Exelon is currently in the thick of a hostile bid for indie NRG Energy. Other big electricity companies such as Entergy or Duke Energy could be tempted to pick up independents at distressed prices. With the economy in the doldrums, a deal or two is probably mandatory to spark a sustainable rally.

GE property valuations come under scrutiny

Investors in General Electric Co. will get a more detailed picture of what the world's largest landlord holds in its commercial real-estate portfolio when GE's finance arm updates investors on its businesses and financials Thursday.

But the disclosure mightn't ease doubts about whether the Fairfield, Conn., conglomerate is owning up to the potential losses it faces from those investments.

Other companies have been clobbered by steep declines in the value of office buildings, apartments, stores, hotels and other commercial property. Private-equity firms that specialize in real estate are reporting losses of as much as 60% for funds invested recently.

GE has been much more generous in its approach to its holdings. So far, GE has said its $34 billion in property could fall in value by about 1.5% this year, amounting to a pretax loss of as much as $500 million.

When values were rising, real estate used to be a major earnings machine for GE's finance arm. By selling a few buildings, the company could immediately recognize profits. But, with the sales market at a virtual standstill, profits are plummeting and the risk of losses is increasing.

A GE spokesman declined to answer questions about the company's real-estate portfolio, citing plans to make an "in-depth public presentation" Thursday. But in the past, GE executives have said that, under accounting rules, the company doesn't have to "mark to market" its real-estate holdings as other investors do. In other words, the company doesn't have to value its properties at what they would be worth if they were sold today.

Why? GE says because properties are long-term investments, the company should book losses in terms of potential drops in cash flows and their expected long-term decline in value. Also, about 80% of its real-estate holdings were purchased with cash and have no mortgages. That means that, unlike other highly leveraged property investors, GE runs very little risk of having to sell properties to pay off creditors.

But many on Wall Street believe GE's approach doesn't sufficiently recognize the damage the recession is doing to commercial real estate, which is expected to get steadily worse. Last week, GE lost the triple-A credit rating it first achieved more than five decades ago, as Standard &Poor's lowered its view on GE's long-term debt by one notch, to double-A-plus. The bond-rating firm cited, among other concerns, GE's "large exposure" to commercial real estate in light of "mounting strains" in this sector.

Moreover, GE may still be too optimistic even using its more-conservative approach for estimating losses, analysts say. Looking at cash flow and long-term declines in value, the company's portfolio may lose a lot more than $500 million, they say.

"If commercial real-estate prices are down between 20% and 30% from the peak, it's not too hard to see that the downside could be a lot more than $500 million," said analyst Richard Hofmann at CreditSights.

Cash flow is a big problem right now for landlords, including GE, because vacancies are rising and rents are falling at nearly unprecedented rates.

Nationwide, as job losses accelerated, vacancies at office towers increased 0.8 percentage point to 14.5% in the fourth quarter, the largest one-quarter jump since the second quarter of 2001, and likely will rise to 16.7% this year, according to research firm Reis Inc. in New York.

Office and retail leases can run for as many as 15 years, meaning that landlords that sign deals today are locking in lower rents -- and lower values -- for the long term.

Also, GE's portfolio is vulnerable to steeper losses partly because the company bought so much at the top of the market. According to Real Capital Analytics, a research firm in New York, GE sold $7 billion of real estate world-wide in 2007 but acquired $16.6 billion that frothy year.

Some of GE's 2007 deals appear to be turkeys. For example, in July 2007, GE bought nine office complexes in Chicago from Blackstone Group LP for $1.05 billion. Those properties had been owned by Equity Office Properties, which Blackstone acquired for $39 billion at the beginning of 2007 and then sold off in large chunks. Vacancy is rising at most of those properties, according to real estate firms.

At Oakbrook Terrace Tower, a prominent 31-story building that is close to the finest shopping and restaurants in suburban Chicago, the vacancy rate has jumped to 33% today from about 16% at the time GE bought the property, according to CoStar Group Inc.

Overall, vacancies at the Equity Office properties acquired by GE have risen to more than 25% from 19%, according to the real-estate research firm in Bethesda, Md.

In the Chicago market, almost half of the office buildings showed rent declines in the fourth quarter.

"We have never seen this kind of marked acceleration in the number of office properties willing to lower rents to prevent further deterioration in occupancy," says Reis research director Victor Calanog.

Life insurers, hit by losses, ask U.S. for aid --- Rescue hurdles loom as industry totters; capital markets' fate

The tumbling financial markets are dragging down the U.S. life-insurance industry, an important cog in the American economy, as losses weaken the companies' capital and erode investor confidence.

A dozen life insurers have pending applications for aid from the U.S. government's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, and the industry is expecting an answer to its request for a bank-style bailout in coming weeks. The government hasn't said whether insurers will be eligible for the program.

Life insurers have taken a beating in recent weeks. Through Wednesday, the Dow Jones Wilshire U.S. Life Insurance Index had fallen 59% since the beginning of the year, leaving it down 82% since its May 2007 all-time high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had lost 21% year to date, off 51% since its October 2007 record.

Some of the hardest-hit companies are century-old names that insure the lives of millions of Americans. Shares of Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., which already received a capital injection from German insurer Allianz SE, are down 93% from their 52-week high as of Wednesday's close. MetLife Inc. and Prudential Financial Inc. are both suffering as the value of their investment portfolios declines.

Some life insurers are faring better than others, and some of the U.S. giants retain triple-A ratings, including Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co., New York Life Insurance Co., Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co. and TIAA-CREF.

But as the economy buckles, analysts say many insurers face losses that can eat away at the capital cushions regulators require them to maintain.

Longtime experts say the industry is going through its most tumultuous period in recent memory. "It's a pretty scary scenario right now," said Pete Larson, an analyst at Gradient Analytics, a Scottsdale, Ariz., research group.

Some state regulators have lately extended relief from certain capital requirements. But insurers haven't received the kind of injections banks got in recent months. That is partly because insurers didn't gobble up risky assets, and also because as long-term investors, they generally don't have to recognize on the bottom line short-term dips in values of their assets.

Ratings firms and stock investors are becoming concerned about how long the industry can avoid reckoning with the distressed assets on their books. Ratings companies Moody's Investors Service, Standard &Poor's and A.M. Best have cut the ratings of more than a dozen insurers in recent weeks.

The ramifications of a weakened life-insurance industry for the overall economy are significant. Life insurers are among the biggest holders of U.S. corporate debt. Together, they own about 18% of all corporate bonds outstanding, according to the American Council of Life Insurers, or ACLI, an industry trade group.

If life insurers stop buying bonds, the capital markets may not fully recover, say insurance industry representatives and analysts. Already, their buying activity has slumped. In the fourth quarter of 2008, life insurers agreed to buy $3.3 billion in stocks and bonds through private transactions, down 63% from the previous quarter, according to a survey by the ACLI. Insurers have been putting more cash into havens such as Treasury bonds.

Any sign of vulnerability among life insurers could further erode confidence and make consumers reluctant to buy insurance products, analysts and financial advisers say. "I get as many emails from subscribers who worry about their policies as they do about their stock," said Morningstar analyst Alan Rambaldini, who covers life insurance. Though life-insurance and variable-annuity sales fell industrywide in the fourth quarter of 2008, analysts say it is too soon to trace declines to concerns about the stock action.

Ratings firms and Wall Street analysts say another problem for some life insurers is obligations for variable annuities, a retirement-income product that often guarantees minimum withdrawals or investment returns. As stock markets plunge to lows, life insurers need to set aside additional funds to show regulators that they can meet their obligations, further crimping spare capital.

The industry has several things in its favor. Life insurers will likely continue to generate cash from the premiums on their policies, some analysts and executives say. And unlike investment banks and many other financial firms, life insurers don't need to routinely raise money in the capital markets to fund daily operations. Few of the biggest ones have any sizable debt of their own maturing in 2009. Many insurers have built up big cash chests by hoarding premiums.

For now, the U.S. Treasury Department hasn't said whether life insurers will be eligible for TARP funds. Industry group ACLI expects the Treasury to decide whether insurers will be eligible for federal aid some time this month. "We don't have a clear picture of which way that clarification would tend to go," said ACLI representative Gary Hughes.

The Treasury Department didn't return calls for comment.

One stumbling block is that the industry is overseen by state regulators, not a single federal agency. That means there is no group of federal officials responsible for it or with a deep understanding of its challenges.

The problems plaguing life insurers aren't the same as those at insurer American International Group Inc., which has received a $173 billion aid package. Its losses stemmed largely from derivatives, primarily credit-default swaps, tied to complex securities that turned sour in the credit crunch.

Life insurers' woes have come largely from investment-grade corporate bonds, commercial real estate and mortgages, regulatory filings show. Many insurers ended 2008 with high levels of losses that, due to accounting rules, they haven't had to record on their bottom lines. MetLife, the biggest U.S. life insurer by assets with $380.84 billion in its general account, had $29.8 billion in unrealized losses at the end of 2008.

MetLife says it is amply capitalized, with more than $30 billion in cash, and that it doesn't expect to realize significant losses from its investment portfolio. "We strongly believe that the way we've looked at our unrealized gains and losses is appropriate for our liabilities and for the most part that these [investments] will pay off," said MetLife spokesman John Calagna.

Hartford Financial had $14.6 billion in unrealized losses at year end. Prudential, the second-largest insurer by assets, had nearly $11.3 billion in unrealized losses, up $5.4 billion in the fourth quarter from the previous quarter. Hartford didn't respond to requests for comment. A Prudential spokesman said, "We believe that we are adequately capitalized based on our objective of a double-A rating."

Spitzer back in Washington, as an investor --- New York ex-governor who exited in disgrace buys office building

Eliot Spitzer is returning to Washington, D.C., this time as an investor in the commercial real-estate market.

The former New York governor, who resigned in disgrace a year ago after getting caught patronizing a prostitute in a Washington hotel, has purchased a prominent office building blocks from the White House through his father's real-estate company.

The Spitzers are paying $180 million to buy 1615 L St. NW, a 13-story dark-glass building whose tenants include the public-relations firm Fleishman-Hillard, the Washington outpost of the Nixon Presidential Library and the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries.

The move is part of the ex-governor's re-emergence into public life and a renewed interest in the successful real-estate business founded by his father, Bernard Spitzer. In an interview, Mr. Spitzer spoke about the investment, the economy and about his new life in business after "a detour along the way" as New York's attorney general and governor.

"Obviously it brought great joy for a great period of time," Mr. Spitzer said about his years in government. He declined to discuss the scandal that led to his resignation.

The purchase comes at an inauspicious time in commercial real estate, amid falling prices and high debt. Any deal of this size is getting a lot of attention for what is happening to values.

The Spitzers are buying the building from a distressed seller that defaulted on part of its debt. Private-equity firm Broadway Partners bought the tower at the end of 2006 for $209 million, according to Real Capital Analytics. Broadway's lenders have moved to foreclose on several buildings.

The Spitzers aren't paying a bargain-basement price. While $180 million is well below what the previous owner paid, it is more than what the building sold for five years ago, $124 million.

Mr. Spitzer said his family intends to hold the property for years and is unconcerned that values might fall further. "We aren't trying to time the global market," he said.

The building is one block from the Mayflower Hotel, the location of Mr. Spitzer's tryst, which led to his undoing. Asked if the proximity to the hotel creates mixed feelings, Mr. Spitzer demurred. "No. We are buying a great building. That's why we are buying it," he said.

Mr. Spitzer reflected on his new professional duties in light of his time in government, during which he often tangled furiously with Wall Street titans. "There were folks in the market, on Wall Street in particular, who tried to challenge my dedication to the market and to market forces. I said to them repeatedly that I'm a capitalist who believes in the market, but also knows how to protect the market," he said.

Mr. Spitzer said his positive outlook for real estate despite today's troubles is girded by his father's 60 years in the business. "We are optimists," he said. As for the economy overall: "What we are facing is as much a psychological hurdle as a real economic hurdle," he said.

The family's company owns several prominent towers, including the Crown Building at 730 Fifth Ave. in Manhattan. They rarely sell property. "We have a longtime horizon and little debt," Mr. Spitzer said.

The elder Mr. Spitzer built some of the largest, most expensive apartment buildings in Manhattan, including the 56-story Corinthian and several luxury buildings on Fifth Avenue.

This is the first major deal for the Spitzers in years and represents as much Mr. Spitzer's first act after his fall from grace as a passing of the torch. Mr. Spitzer falls short of saying he is picking up the reins.

The purchase was made possible largely because the Spitzers will inherit a $138 million existing mortgage and will pay the balance -- $42 million -- in cash.

Deal of the Week: Inland, a Nontraded REIT, Flashes Its Cash

While transactions have slumped in most corners of the real-estate world, the recent sale of a New Jersey office complex for $230 million highlights the unusual position of a suburban Chicago-based company that is still ready and able to buy.

Inland American Real Estate Trust Inc., a so-called nontraded real-estate investment trust sponsored by one of the Oak Brook, Ill.-based Inland Real Estate Group of Cos., last month paid $40 million in cash and assumed a $190 million mortgage to acquire a three-building office complex in Bridgewater, N.J., from SL Green Realty Corp., a New York-based office REIT, and property financing specialists Gramercy Capital Corp. The approximately 670,000-square-foot office property is the North American headquarters of Sanofi-Aventis SA, a France-based pharmaceutical company.

The sale is one of the highest prices paid in the U.S. this year for an office property, according to Real Capital Analytics, a New York-based real-estate-research firm. It also is part of a string of acquisitions valued at a total of about $700 million that Inland American has agreed to or completed so far this year.

Inland American's acquisitions are fueled by more than $7 billion that it has raised since 2005 from investors, largely individuals, who have bought the shares that aren't traded on a public exchange. That inflow has slowed somewhat but has continued even as Inland has faced pressure from some investors seeking to sell back their shares. Inland American raised about $91 million last month, according to Robert A. Stanger &Co., a Shrewsbury, N.J., investment-banking firm that specializes in nontraded REITS.

"Many nontraded REITS are still flush with cash," says said Paul Adornato, a senior REIT analyst with BMO Capital Markets in New York. "That's not to say the value of their property isn't going down."

SL Green, which like many publicly traded REITS is struggling to increase its liquidity, recognized a sizable gain in the deal, accordingly to Isaac Zion, managing director of SL Green. In 2005 SL Green and a predecessor partner to Gramercy paid about $125 million for the property that was being vacated by AT&T.

G. Joseph Cosenza, a former fourth-grade teacher and Chicago-area native, and three other former teachers founded the Inland Real Estate Group of Cos. more than 40 years ago. The group, through its various affiliates, owns more than 105 million square feet of commercial real estate that it values at about $26 billion.

Mr. Cosenza, who is also president of Inland Real Estate Acquisitions Inc., said the Sanofi-Aventis property is a good example of the type of properties Inland looks to buy. He prefers occupied properties in well-populated areas. "I'm so glad people are hesitant and sitting on the sidelines because it opens up a field for me of deals that I might have never seen before," he says.

Nontraded REITS have been controversial. They have been criticized by some analysts partly because they are sold through brokers who charge higher commissions than would be paid buying public REITS. This depresses total return, notes Mike Kirby, director of research for Green Street.

Nontraded REITs also are less liquid. Inland will buy shares back from investors after they have held them for at least a year. But Inland also reserves the right to suspend redemptions if investors try to sell back more than 5% of all shares in a 12-month period.

Last fall Inland Western Retail Real Estate Trust Inc., another nontraded REIT sponsored by a member of the Inland Real Estate Group of Cos., suspended its program to buy back shares after that same 5% limit was reached. Martel Day, executive vice president of the Inland securities arm that raises the capital, acknowledges that Inland American also could reach that point because an increased number of investors are interested in selling back their shares.

On the other hand, Inland American's shares appear to be performing better than public REITs. An investor who paid $10 for a share in Inland American one year ago could sell it back for $9.25, a mere 7.5% drop, according to company executives. By comparison, the Dow Jones Equity All REIT Index, which doesn't include dividend returns, is down 58% for the past 12 months.

The New Orleans mall on which General Growth Properties Inc. recently received a loan extension is Oakwood Center. A Plots &Ploys item on the Property Report page Wednesday incorrectly identified it as Oakbrook Center.

[What's Brewing in the Real-Estate Market]

CBRE Back in 1540 Broadway Mix

CB Richard Ellis Investors is back in the bidding for the office portion of 1540 Broadway, a skyscraper in New York's Times Square connected to landlord Harry Macklowe.

A deal hasn't closed, but a person familiar with the matter said CBRE Investors, the asset-management unit of CB Richard Ellis Group Inc., would pay as little as $355 million, a major drop in value.

"That's a harsh price for a very well located building," said Dan Fasulo, managing director of property-tracking firm Real Capital Analytics.

According to city records and loan-marketing documents, Mr. Macklowe attributed the value of the office building to over $950 million when he bought it in February 2007 as part of a $7 billion skyscraper spending spree. The tower's 880,000 square feet of office space had sold in 2006 for $525 million.

In early 2008, unable to refinance short-term debt, Macklowe Properties handed back control of the seven skyscrapers to lenders led by Deutsche Bank AG. Deutsche has been trying to sell 1540 Broadway along with the nearby Worldwide Plaza, also part of the Macklowe portfolio. Eastdil Secured is the sales broker. CBRE was in the mix early for 1540 Broadway, then hedge fund Fillmore Capital Partners LLC was close to securing both towers. The Fillmore deal died last week, putting CBRE's deal back in the saddle, according to several people familiar with the matter.

GGP's Juggling Act

As General Growth Properties Inc. juggles several expiring loans, it has caught at least one break: Lenders have granted the mall owner an extension to March 16 of a $95 million loan tied to the Oakbrook Center mall in New Orleans. The loan matured Feb 9.

The extension is notable for several reasons. First, the agent on the loan is Citigroup Inc., the same lender that gave General Growth heartburn in December by holding up an extension of a $900 million loan on two Las Vegas malls. Second, Oakbrook Center was gutted by a fire in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and has been rebuilt. Third, the extension means that General Growth now has only four loans that are due and must be extended.

General Growth representatives confirmed the extension of the Oakbrook Center loan. Citigroup declined to comment. A representative of Pembrook Capital Management, another lender in the loan, didn't return messages seeking comment.

Post Says Goodbye to Bonuses

Post Properties Inc. Chief Executive David P. Stockert won't receive his 2008 bonus that had been budgeted at $420,000, and board Chairman Robert Goddard III gave up a $100,000 retainer and any stock compensation for 2009, a Securities and Exchange Commission filing says.

Three other top executives saw bonuses cut 70%, while most officers had their bonus pay cut in half. A Post spokeswoman declined to comment.

The Atlanta REIT, which owns and operates more than 14,000 apartment units, reported an annual loss in 2008 of $16.3 million, compared with profit of $171.1 million for the previous year.

The move to slash bonuses drew praise from company founder John A. Williams, who has criticized management in the past and who made and then withdrew an offer to buy the company last year. "I give them kudos for managing the balance sheet better than most REITs," he said.

International Investor
Mead IPO whets appetites of starved investors

After last week's successful debut of baby-formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition Co., all eyes are searching hungrily for the next IPOs that have a chance of making it in the U.S. markets.

No one expects a deluge of offerings to follow on the heels of Mead Johnson's initial public offering, which closed up 10% on its first day of trading. The company was considered a sure bet due to its strong financials, brand awareness of its Enfamil line of products, and world-wide demographic trends.

It could pave the way for more companies to consider launching their own deals, particularly if they have strong businesses that are somewhat sheltered from the economic downturn. The notion that investors are unwilling to take a risk on any new stock doesn't hold water in an environment where portfolios are starved for some growth, says Michael Wise, co-head of U.S. equity capital markets at Morgan Stanley.

Of the deals that already have registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the most commonly cited candidates for IPOs are Rosetta Stone Inc. and Verisk Analytics Inc.

The buzzword on Rosetta Stone, which makes foreign-language learning software, is scalability -- its products can easily expand to new countries without much cost because it doesn't teach by translating languages. Verisk, which is owned by a group of major insurers, provides data and analysis that helps firms in the insurance and mortgage industry evaluate and avoid excessive risk.

Weak banks to be exposed U.S. review to gauge need for more capital at some institutions

By Damian Paletta

WASHINGTON -- The rigorous review the Obama administration plans to conduct of the U.S.'s largest banks as part of its revamped financial-sector bailout could reveal a troubled network of financial institutions that have been slow to acknowledge bad loans and are struggling to build reserves.

If the condition of many banks is as weak as some analysts predict, regulators could be faced with tough decisions: Do they use federal money to help prop up flailing banks, or do they shut down some firms and limit the cost to taxpayers?

"If they are trying to dig deeper and essentially do some sort of quasi-appraisal of the underlying assets behind the loans, both on commercial and residential real estate, then they are going to see very widespread problems," said Matthew Anderson, a partner at Foresight Analytics in Oakland, Calif., who conducts extensive reviews of troubled banks.

The "stress tests" are mandatory for nearly 20 of the country's largest banks, regardless of whether they are seeking additional federal aid. Any of the 8,500 other federally insured financial institutions can voluntarily submit to the review, people familiar with the matter said. It isn't clear whether the Treasury Department will use the tests as a condition of granting aid for these smaller banks.

Government officials say that the tests, in which they try to gauge a bank's condition under a worst-case scenario in two years, won't be used to separate banks that survive from those that are liquidated.

"I don't think there is a pass-fail on the stress test," a government official said. "This stress test is not a test for who is insolvent or not."

Rather, government officials say the tests will be used to gauge how much extra capital big banks might need as a buffer to continue lending through the economic downturn. The Treasury said Tuesday that it would invest an additional $100 billion to $200 billion into banks on top of the $250 billion it has already said it would put in.

Lawmakers, analysts and some bankers argue that the banking system is worse off than many acknowledge. David Burg, a portfolio manager at Alpine Mutual Funds who previously advised financial institutions at Citigroup, said a severe stress test could show that 98% of banks "need a lot more capital."

Regulators are moving aggressively to contain the wobbling banking sector after being accused of moving too slowly in the past year. Thirty-four banks have failed in the past 12 months, a faster pace than any period since the savings-and-loan crisis. Dozens more banks are on the verge of collapse, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. had 171 banks on its "problem" list at the end of the third quarter.

"Essentially what you've got are a set of banks that have not been as transparent as we need to be in terms of what their books look like," President Barack Obama said in an interview with ABC News Tuesday. "And we're going to have to . . . just be clear about some of the losses that have been made because until we do that, we're not going to be able to attract private capital into the marketplace."

Regulators said Tuesday that the purpose of their new comprehensive reviews and severe stress tests is to "clean up and strengthen" the banks they oversee. They said that if they find institutions that need more capital, the government will offer funds as a "bridge" to money from private investors.

"We are going to bring together the government agencies with authority over our nation's major banks and initiate a more consistent, realistic, and forward-looking assessment about the risk on balance sheets, and we're going to introduce new measures to improve disclosures," Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Tuesday.

The regular exams that banks undergo with state and federal examiners tend to focus on a bank's current health. The new uniform reviews will include submitting a bank's finances to worst-case scenarios and could create a better way for the government to assess the state of the industry.

The tests could signal a willingness by the Obama administration to extend money to troubled banks. The Bush administration resisted giving money to banks it deemed weren't "viable." For example, National City Corp. was forced to sell itself after regulators argued that it wouldn't qualify for federal aid. National City had more than $100 billion in assets and would likely have undergone the government's new stress test.

Some bankers and finance executives were alarmed by the purpose of the stress test, saying it could cause investors to flee from suspect banks and paint a gloomy picture of the industry's condition.

Other industry officials said the review, if done properly, could reassure the public about the overall health of most banks.

"I think if done right, it can be a positive in terms of perception and confidence," said Ed Yingling, chief executive of the American Bankers Association trade group. "There are so many exaggerated views in the marketplace of the strength of these institutions that assuring the public that a full-scale review is taking place could be helpful in terms of confidence."

Mr. Anderson estimated that more than 100 banks will fail this year, while RBC Capital Markets estimated this week that more than 1,000 banks will fail over the next three to five years.

The Condo Boom Goes Bust for Corus

By Jonathan Karp

(Copyright (c) 2009, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

The bank that funded a big part of the condominium boom is considering selling all or part of itself as rising defaults force it to seek capital.

Corus Bankshares Inc., a symbol of the exuberance for glass-and-steel condo towers from Miami to Los Angeles, reported a $260.7 million quarterly loss late Friday and said that more than one-third of its $4.1 billion in outstanding loans were nonperforming. Amid what it called a "precipitous decline" in property values, the Chicago lender also warned that banking regulators may soon strip Corus of its standing as a well-capitalized bank and impose higher cash requirements.

Mike Dulberg, Corus's chief financial officer, said in an interview Tuesday that management is exploring options, including selling the bank or finding a strategic investor. "We are working with investment bankers and searching for capital, but it's a very tough market," he said. Mr. Dulberg said Corus still has $758 million in capital and nearly $4 billion in liquid assets that can be tapped to "meet the demands of borrowers and depositors." The vast majority of its $7.6 billion in consumer deposits is federally insured.

Corus is one of the few lenders to report that the Treasury Department intends to reject the bank's application for funds from the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP.

Some analysts don't believe the bank can raise the capital necessary to survive.

"The company is in dire straits," said Daniel Cardenas, senior vice president at Chicago brokerage Howe Barnes Hoefer &Arnett Inc. "Barring a surprise injection of private capital and/or a dramatic rebound in condo values, Corus appears unlikely to survive 2009."

Mr. Cardenas on Monday reduced his 12-month target price for the stock to zero. In the two trading days since it reported its quarterly results, Corus has shed 63% of its value. Tuesday, Corus's shares fell 30%, or 18 cents, to 41 cents, in 4 p.m. composite trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Corus's market capitalization has withered to some $22 million, limiting its financing options.

Condos are one of the hardest-hit segments of the housing market. Many of them were bought by speculators who walked away from deposits when the market soured and never closed on their units, leaving developers with empty condos.

Also, much of the new condo development is located in second-home markets, such as Florida, where prices have crashed and foreclosures have risen. There was a glut of 588,210 condo and cooperative apartments on the market in December, close to a 15-month supply, according to the National Association of Realtors.

While it has been clear for months that thousands of condo projects were doomed, the full impact on financial institutions is only now being felt. Construction loans were structured with "interest reserves," provisions that gave developers funds to pay interest until the projects were complete. Now that projects are completed and failing to sell, the loans are going into default.

Banks and thrifts had $36 billion of condominium debt on their books as of the end of the fourth quarter, according to Foresight Analytics. Over the past year, the delinquency rate rose to 26% from 10%, estimates the Oakland, Calif., research firm.

Conditions are likely to get worse before they get better because many cities still are getting hit by a deluge of new supply. In Chicago, 5,570 units are scheduled to be delivered this year, up from 4,018 in 2008, according to Reis Inc., a real-estate market-data firm. Deliveries are expected to increase in 16 other markets as well, including New York City, Phoenix, San Diego and Seattle, Reis said.

With $8.4 billion in assets as of Dec. 31, Corus ranks as one of the biggest banks to flirt with failure this recession. The bank has been in regulators' cross hairs for months because its once-diversified lending unit, Corus Bank, bet almost exclusively on condos during the housing boom. More than four-fifths of Corus's loans are concentrated in construction and development projects, mostly condo buildings in speculative markets such as South Florida and Nevada and overbuilt cities such as Atlanta and Phoenix.

The strategy reaped often-huge profits, but in the second quarter of 2008 Corus reported the first loss in its 50-year history. As condos failed to sell and developers defaulted, Corus last year suspended new condo loans and later halted all commercial lending, among other steps, to preserve cash.

President and Chief Executive Robert Glickman, scion of the Minneapolis family that founded the bank, had maintained that Corus could weather the storm. In the latest financial results, the company conceded that the "housing calamity is worse than even the 'severe downturn' for which we had planned."

Treasury officials have said that a bank's viability is a prime consideration in determining whether to grant TARP funds, but the denial of a request can depend on other factors. One red flag for regulators is a concentration in commercial real-estate loans, such as Corus has. Yet the move to establish a bank for toxic debt and other measures in the pending stimulus bill could offer relief for Corus.

Corus offers the starkest case study of the condo frenzy.

In Sunrise, Fla., west of Fort Lauderdale, Corus lent $126 million for two 26-story buildings with 396 luxury condos. The Tao Sawgrass complex stands empty, and Corus has repossessed the property. Corus also took over -- and then sought bankruptcy protection for -- a 765-condo complex in Panama City, Fla., where only 65 units had been sold.

Mr. Dulberg, the Corus CFO, said the company's strategy for troubled projects is to reduce condo prices and provide consumer mortgages in order to stimulate sales. "Our focus is to move those units," he said, adding that the traditional spring buying season will measure the plan's success.

Corus has about $2 billion in unfunded construction commitments and that in the event of a federal takeover, regulators wouldn't be obligated to fund these commitments.

Defaults climb on option ARMs --- Falling home values, economy spur trouble in $750 billion market

Defaults on a popular form of mortgage that gave home buyers a choice of how much to pay each month are rising and could rival those on subprime loans, potentially causing more trouble for investors and banks.

Nearly $750 billion of option adjustable-rate mortgages, or option ARMs, were issued from 2004 to 2007, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry publication. Rising delinquencies are creating fresh challenges for companies such as Bank of America Corp., J.P. Morgan Chase &Co. and Wells Fargo &Co. that acquired troubled option-ARM lenders.

Option ARMs typically were made to borrowers with higher credit scores than those getting subprime mortgages. But many of these borrowers were stretched thin even when they were making payments, and are particularly vulnerable to a weakening economy and falling home prices. Borrowers can face payment shock when they must begin making payments of full interest and principal.

Often, these loans were taken out without full documentation of borrowers' incomes and assets, and the reported incomes were often overstated, analysts say.

Option ARMs, which have been largely abandoned, give borrowers multiple payment options, including a minimum payment that often was less than the monthly interest due. Borrowers who made the minimum payment on a regular basis often saw their loan balances grow, also known as "negative amortization." And with home prices falling, more than 55% of borrowers with option ARMs owe more than their homes are valued at, according to J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.

As of December, 28% of option ARMs were delinquent or in foreclosure, according to LPS Applied Analytics, a data firm that analyzes mortgage performance. That compares with 23% in September. An additional 7% involve properties that have already been taken back by the lenders. By comparison, 6% of prime loans have problems. Problems with subprime are still the worst. Just over half of subprime loans were delinquent, in foreclosure, or related to bank-owned properties as of December. The nearly $750 billion of option ARMs issued from 2004 to 2007 compares with roughly $1.9 trillion each of subprime and jumbo mortgages in that period.

Nearly 61% of option ARMs originated in 2007 will eventually default, according to a recent analysis by Goldman Sachs, which assumed a further 10% decline in home prices. Goldman estimates more than half of all option ARMs outstanding will default.

In a recent conference call, Bank of America said it had added $750 million to its impaired-portfolio reserves to offset higher-than-expected losses related to its acquisition of Countrywide Financial Corp. The company said the increase "was focused principally in the pay option ARM product." Wells Fargo said $59.8 billion of its "Pick A Payment" option ARM mortgage portfolio was "credit impaired," including $24.3 billion in loans on which the company has taken a credit write-down.

Banks and investors face a 'jumbo' threat --- Mortgage industry faces another cloud as delinquencies rise

Rising defaults by affluent homeowners are raising the specter of another cloud over banks and investors, which could get stuck with thousands of expensive homes.

About 6.9% of prime "jumbo" loans were at least 90 days delinquent in December, according to LPS Applied Analytics, a mortgage-data research firm. The rate was up sharply from 2.6% a year earlier. In comparison, delinquencies of non-jumbo prime loans that qualify for backing by government agencies climbed to 2.1% from 0.8% in December 2007.

Jumbo mortgages average about $750,000 and can run as high as $5 million or more. More borrowers with such loans are being hit by layoffs that are spreading through practically every sector and pay level of the U.S. economy.

Tuesday, the Labor Department reported that the jobless rate rose in December in all 50 states, hitting at least 10% in Michigan and Rhode Island. States that suffered the biggest jumps in unemployment in the past year include California and Florida, where the largest number of jumbo loans were made.

That means trouble for banks that made those loans when times were good and investors who snapped up jumbo loans packaged into mortgage-backed securities. Defaults on jumbo mortgages tend to result in especially steep losses for lenders, because pricier homes are tough to sell in the current market.

"There is more pain to come," says Herb Blecher, vice president of analytics at LPS.

Last month, the mounting defaults prompted Moody's Investors Service to downgrade hundreds of tranches of prime jumbo loans sold to investors as securities. Moody's has downgraded more than 75% of all prime jumbo loans originated in 2006 and 2007 that carried the top rating of triple-A.

From 2002 to 2006, banks originated an average of $557 billion a year in jumbo loans, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication. About 40% of the total was sold to investors as securities.

Three lenders accounted for nearly half of all jumbo loans made in the first nine months of 2008. The top two originators, Chase Home Finance and Washington Mutual, both part of J.P. Morgan Chase &Co., made more than 25% of all jumbo loans, while Bank of America Corp. and Wells Fargo &Co. each accounted for 11% of the jumbo market.

Some of the largest financial institutions held on to many of their loans. Last July, J.P. Morgan disclosed that it had $34.4 billion in jumbo mortgages. Chairman and Chief Executive James Dimon acknowledged that the New York bank expanded too aggressively into the market in 2007, particularly in places such as California, where home prices later collapsed.

"We were wrong," Mr. Dimon says. "We obviously wish we hadn't done it."

Jumbo mortgages aren't a big part of J.P. Morgan's loan business anymore; government-backed loans now account for more than 90% of originations. "We continue to make [jumbos] as an accommodation to customers," said spokesman Thomas Kelly. "It's not a big part of what we do."

Jumbo loans shriveled when credit markets seized up in July 2007, and originations slid 71% to $87 billion in the first nine months of 2008, down from $303 billion a year earlier. Only 7% of the loans made last year were securitized, according to Inside Mortgage Finance.

Originations are expected to fall even further in 2009. Earlier this month, Wells Fargo stopped buying jumbo mortgages originated by mortgage brokers. The San Francisco bank still is making loans through retail channels.

Other big jumbo-mortgage lenders still are advertising their loans but have "intentionally priced themselves out of the market" by charging high rates, says Peter Boger, operating chief at Ridgewood Savings Bank. The Queens, N.Y., bank was one of several regional banks, including Hudson City Bancorp, of Paramus, N.J., and Astoria Financial Corp., of Lake Success, N.Y., that increased jumbo lending in 2008.

Conforming-loan limits top out at $625,000 in the highest-cost housing markets. To buy a more expensive home, buyers must put up larger down payments -- between 30% and 40% -- and pay higher mortgage rates. Rates on 30-year fixed jumbo mortgages stood at 6.87% last week, compared to 5.34% for conforming mortgages, a difference of 1.53 percentage points, according to HSH Associates, a financial publisher.

"Your potential community of buyers for a particular house . . . is smaller because you've got fewer people who can afford the payment," says Jay Brinkmann, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association. "That is going to have an impact on price."

Some analysts believe tighter credit could be exacerbating jumbo defaults by making it harder to refinance.

"Throughout 2008, even in the worst of market conditions, conforming borrowers had some access to refinancing," says Navneet Agarwal, a senior mortgage-backed securities analyst at Moody's. "But most of the private-label borrowers have been shut out."

Nearly 25% of prime jumbo mortgages exceeded the value of the homes they backed in September, according to Credit Suisse. That figure would increase to 42% given home-price declines of 15% over the next two years.

The delinquency rate on jumbo loans still is far lower than that of subprime mortgages and Alt-A loans, a category between subprime and prime. Both those delinquency rates now exceed 17%.

Deal of the Week: Maul Market: Cincinnati Mall Sells on the Cheap

With the commercial real-estate market at a virtual standstill, there is much to be learned from the sale of one of the Cincinnati area's largest malls by retail giant Simon Property Group Inc.

But be warned: It isn't a pretty picture. Not only was the price abysmally low, but the buyer, North Star Realty of suburban Atlanta, also had to agree to onerous personal-recourse provisions to obtain financing.

North Star paid about $9.2 million and assumed debt on $18 million in bonds for Cincinnati Mills, a 1.4 million-square-foot mall whose anchor tenants include a Kohl's department store and a Bass Pro Shop, according to people familiar with the matter. That values the property at less than $20 a square foot. The price is a fraction of the average national rate of $134 a square foot paid for the few malls that traded hands last year, according to Marcus &Millichap Real Estate Investment Services.

To be sure, the property is in sad shape. Some 40% of its non-anchor retail space is empty and it has suffered a bruised image marked by several failed redevelopment efforts since L.J. Hooker Development Corp. opened it in 1989, when it was known as the Forest Fair Mall. It now faces headwinds as the economy sours. The Cincinnati region posted third-quarter estimated retail vacancies of 20%, the eighth highest of the 54 markets surveyed by Property &Portfolio Research Inc., a Boston-based real-estate research firm.

From its earliest days, Cincinnati Mills has had difficulty competing with two other larger malls nearby, says Jeffrey Johnston, senior sales vice president with commercial real-estate advisory firm Grubb &Ellis/West Shell Commercial in Cincinnati. It also got off on the wrong foot with an early failed concept that tried to bring higher-end retailers into a largely blue-collar area, Mr. Johnston says.

But financing the deal was brutal even for such a challenged property. Tom Robinson, the 52-year-old principal of North Star Realty, says he financed the deal by obtaining mostly recourse loans, which require personal guarantees, from a number of wealthy individuals in Georgia and elsewhere. Mr. Robinson acknowledges the deal's risks. "It's sort of like walking a tight rope without a net," Mr. Robinson says.

So-called hard money that includes recourse debt is increasingly behind the smaller commercial-property sales that are getting done. Indeed, thanks to this financing, it is often easier to put together smaller deals than larger ones. The volume of retail-property sales valued at $1 million to $20 million fell just 53% to $17.4 billion last year nationally from 2007, compared with deals valued at $40 million or more, which fell 77% over the same period, according to Marcus &Millichap and CoStar Group Inc.

Mr. Robinson says he doesn't yet have a firm plan for redeveloping the property. Still, he sees opportunity in the property located in Fairfield and Forest Park, Ohio, roughly 20 miles north of downtown Cincinnati along Interstate 275, a major highway. He is planning a name change and would like to bring in more traditional retailers as well as some non-traditional mall tenants to fill empty spaces, such as entrepreneurs, as well as doctors that bring needed foot traffic or dialysis centers. "We have to be very innovative because we've tackled a big old white elephant and it takes a lot to keep it going," Mr. Robinson said.

Simon, along with hedge fund Farallon Capital Management LLC, acquired Cincinnati Mills in 2007 as part of its acquisition of Mills Corp. The mall was a "failed redevelopment that was never true to the unique, value-orientation of the Mills format," Simon said in a statement. "Upon our acquisition, it was always our intention to sell the asset and we are pleased with the result." The Indianapolis-based company is the country's largest mall owner by number of properties.

Just five malls valued at $5 million or more sold in the second half of last year in the U.S., down from 68 in the second half of 2007, according to Real Capital Analytics, a New York-based real-estate-research firm.

"The market for malls is dead," says Dan Fasulo, RCA's managing director of research. "These properties are very capital intensive and without the debt markets it's impossible to make them work."

Limitations of computer models

In recent years, Goldman Sachs has become renowned as one of the savviest players on Wall Street. This week, however, the mighty US bank was forced into an embarrassing admission.

In a rare unplanned investor call, the bank revealed that a flagship global equity fund had lost over 30 per cent of its value in a week because of problems with its trading strategies created by computer models. In particular, the computers had failed to foresee recent market movements to such a degree that they labelled them a  25-standard deviation event    something that only happens once every 100,000 years or more.

 We are seeing things that were 25-standard deviation events, several days in a row,  said David Viniar, Goldman s chief financial officer.  There have been some issues [before] in some of the other quantitative spaces, but nothing like what we saw last week. 

By any standards, it is a striking admission, given that these losses at the Goldman fund could top $1.5bn (750m,  1.1bn). But what is more startling still is that Goldman Sachs is not alone in seeing its models go haywire. On the contrary, in recent days a host of other funds have experienced similar difficulties, including highly renowned funds at Renaissance Technologies.

James Simons, founder of Renaissance and one of the most respected quantitative fund managers, last week "http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2007/08/13/6516/catching-up-with-the-rumours-and-the-pain-of-the-quants/" to investors saying losses were about 9 per cent in the first few days of August (the funds have since recovered at least some of the losses). He also tellingly wrote that  we cannot predict the duration of the current environment,  highlighting the fact that even a group such as Renaissance   whose flagship fund, Medallion, has had an annual return of 30 per cent since 1988   is suffering badly from recent movements.

Other big-name funds that have been hit include Highbridge Capital (controlled by JPMorgan), DE Shaw, AQR Capital and Barclays Global Investors   as well as funds run by groups such as Lehman Brothers.  Models (ours including) are behaving in the opposite way we would predict and have seen and tested for over very long time periods,  said Lehman Brothers last week.

A glance at recent financial history shows that this type of  rare  event is not so unusual at all. Back in 1998, for example, a key reason for the near-implosion of Long Term Capital Management was that the fund s economic whizzkids   who included some Nobel prize-winning economists   had devised model-based trading strategies that turned sour when markets moved in unforeseen ways. Similarly, two years ago the financial industry received a shock when General Motors, the US car group, was downgraded   a move that left the price of financial assets gyrating in relation to each other in ways computers had not predicted.

The question now being asked by some bankers   and regulators   is whether this week s events show that the modern financial industry is foolish to be placing so much faith in these complex computer-driven models.

 People say these are one-in-a-100,000-years events but they seem to happen every year,  says Satyajit Das, a consultant to hedge funds and investment banks.  This episode should make people ask questions about models   I think it could lead to a real reassessment. 

Any such reassessment could have far-reaching consequences. The spread of financial models is at the heart of the growth of modern banking. Indeed, were it not for modern computing power, this decade s remarkable explosion in finance would not have occurred at all.

The roots of this revolution go back to the 1970s, when computers became small and flexible enough to be easily used by bankers   and bright minds in the world of economics started to move into finance. Initially, their techniques were mostly used to help asset managers decide which equities to buy. But in the 1980s, bankers started to use these tools to analyse complex debt securities, a development that later enabled them to create, price and trade instruments such as derivatives.

This decade, the use of models has moved on to a whole new plane. As computing capabilities increased and global markets became more closely integrated, asset managers started relying on models to track asset prices and detect tiny anomalies that a human eye might struggle to see. Initially, people then traded on these anomalies; but soon they started using computers not just to spot anomalies but to execute trades too. Computers are thus now using models to make trades   and often trading with other computers   with barely any human intervention.

This shift has delivered many powerful benefits for finance. Trading by computer is cheaper than using humans and can be quickly expanded in scale. It tends to be more consistent, since machines   unlike people   never get tired. More important still, computers can trade faster than humans, which is crucial when investment groups are racing one other to exploit tiny price differentials.

As a result, computer-driven trading has proliferated, particularly in markets such as equities that tend to be readily accessed and highly liquid. In many cases, these strategies have delivered excellent investor results, as highlighted in Mr Simons  letter.

But while computers are often able to operate better than humans in  normal  markets, this month s events demonstrate that during times of stress they have some crucial flaws. One problem is that models typically predict the future on the basis of past data. This can lead to distortions, given the speed at which the financial industry is currently evolving. Indeed, many of the instruments at the heart of the current credit storm barely existed before this decade   which means that computers can only model these markets based on the benign conditions of the past few years.

Another big problem is that computer models do not always take account of the way that their own behaviour is affecting markets. The essential danger, as Donald Mackenzie, a British finance professor, points out, is a tendency to view models as  cameras , snapping pictures of market movements. However, models are now so widely used that they often drive markets as well, Mr Mackenzie says, which means they are probably better viewed as an  engine .  The emergence of modern economic theories of finance [have] affected markets in fundamental ways 	. 	. 	. 	models are not simply external analyses but intrinsic parts of economic processes,  he notes.

In practical terms, this means that when models evaluate markets, they often fail to recognise how their own behaviour is distorting prices. Take the case of Amaranth, the hedge fund that imploded with $6bn of losses last year. Before this collapse, Amaranth was so dominant in the natural gas market that when it bought it tended to push up prices. These prices were then used in models that calculated Amaranth s trading risk.

But when Amaranth was forced to sell, gas prices collapsed much faster than any model might have predicted. Although Amaranth itself was not trading on the basis of models, this pattern of events can be doubly dangerous for asset managers using computer-driven programmes, for these computers have a nasty habit of all using similar strategies   partly because they are created by humans who have studied at the same institutions. Thus they can all dash for the exits at the same time.

The issue of computer  herding  appears to be a key factor behind this month s problems at the Goldman Sachs funds and others. Although aspects of this saga are still unknown, it appears to have started a few weeks ago when some large investment managers suffered losses on subprime securities. This prompted investment banks to demand that hedge funds post more cash against their trades   which in turn forced these funds to sell assets.

However, since subprime securities were hard to trade, the forced sales occurred in other, more liquid markets such as equities. The consequence was a wave of triggered price movements that seemed utterly  irrational , according to models. Last week, for example, the stock price of some highly valued companies suffered in relation to lowly-rated stocks such as US homebuilders. This appears to have been particularly devastating for the computer strategies used by Goldman s fund, since such programmes typically assume that low-rated stocks will perform badly in a credit crunch.

Since then, many of these extreme market swings have corrected themselves. Consequently, many of the so called  quants  (experts in quantitative models) who work in the financial industry insist that it is premature to criticise all these strategies. After all, they point out, the vast majority of models that are used in the markets work perfectly well. Moreover, efforts are under way to address problems such as the  feedback loop , or danger of computer herding. One key focus of some banks, for example, is the search for ways to apply research in the field of artificial intelligence, or neural networking, to financial models. This, they hope, will enable them to  learn  from mistakes and bouts of irrationality   and thus perform better at times of market stress.

 Academic research has been shifting to some degree from a focus on  efficient market  theories to focus more on  inefficient market  theories [and] there is an increased recognition of inefficient market trading strategies,  says Colm Fitzgerald, head of quantitative trading at the Bank of Ireland.  Investors in funds with strategies based on the latter models are not likely to be currently facing any trouble. 

Nevertheless, whether these new  super-intelligent  models will do better remains to be seen.  Bankers talk about self-learning models, with neural networks and things, but a lot of that is hogwash,  says Mr Das.

Consequently, the lesson that some bankers and policymakers may yet draw from this month s events is arguably the simplest: namely that it could be time to reinsert humans into the trading process. One way to do this would be to improve risk management functions; another key step is to ensure that banks have the ability to switch off the models during times of stress.  Anyone using a human brain, rather than algorithms, could have made money in recent days in the equity markets,  chuckles one banker. One unexpected winner from this month s market turmoil, in other words, may be a newfound appreciation of human intuition   and old-fashioned common sense.

Moving the Market: Mortgage-Backed Securities Become Riskier

With real-estate prices still sky high, some new players are emerging to challenge the most powerful investors in the commercial mortgage-backed securities.

But the new entrants' willingness to buy the riskiest parts of mortgage securities that even the top investors might not touch could make the market less safe, industry executives claim.

For years, real-estate executives and bankers felt they were at the mercy of "the cartel": four investment firms that are or were part of larger financial-service or real-estate firms. These four typically bought nearly all of the riskiest real-estate debt, which also has the highest potential return. That gave them a lot of influence over which bonds were created.

The four were GMAC Institutional Advisors, a subsidiary of General Motors Corp.'s GMAC Commercial Mortgage; real-estate investment trust ARCap REIT Inc.; the former Allied Capital Corp., now a division of CDP Capital's CW Capital; and real-estate investment and management firm LNR Property Corp., which recently was swallowed up by an offshoot of private New York investment group Cerberus Capital Management.

Their influence dates back to the creation of the CMBS market by Resolution Trust Corp. after the real-estate meltdown of the late 1980s and early '90s. The RTC packaged mortgages on properties and sold them off as securities, slicing them up to appeal to buyers with different risk tolerances. It is now a $550 billion market.

To create the securities, investment banks pool a variety of loans together as bonds. Each bond typically includes some low-grade and unrated loans, known as "B pieces." In years past the B pieces have represented loans on some strip malls, run-down office buildings or hotels in default. These days B pieces tend to come from the riskier slices of otherwise high-quality commercial properties. Without B-piece buyers, the bonds can't be sold.

In good times, B-piece buyers can make more than 20% a year on the bonds. The trade-off is that they suffer if borrowers in the underlying loan pool default, which happens a little over half of the time, according to analytics firm Trepp LLC.

That concomitant risk encouraged the big B-piece investors to make demands on bond issuers. In the early days of the CMBS market they met for annual ski retreats in Aspen and agreed to push back against banks and require them to disclose more information about borrowers. The upshot: The four made issuers throw out nearly 10% of the loans in the pool.

That's when banks snidely dubbed the four "the cartel," claiming their tactics robbed other investors of potential returns. "Some people still grouse that the riskiest piece is driving the structure of the deals," says Ren Hayhurst, an attorney at law firm Bryan Cave who mediates discussions between banking clients and B-piece buyers.

But the way the big buyers look at it, they are exerting quality control before the bonds are built, which they say protects all CMBS investors.

And that isn't an easy job, says Keith Belcher, managing director of J.E. Robert Cos., one of the early B-piece investors. "We see the property," Mr. Belcher says. "We verify the occupancy. We spend a tremendous amount of time reviewing the individual credit aspects of these pools."

But now, as investors reach for returns, more players have entered the B-piece market. Last year, according to J.P. Morgan and L.J. Melody, the four big players bought just 50% of the securities issued. In 2003, GMAC stopped buying newly issued B-piece debt because executives felt that the loan pools had gotten too risky.

Established buyers say the newer players are willing to accept bonds backed by mortgages that carry too much default risk. "There are so many participants at every level that it's difficult for any investor or any market participant to impose any discipline," says Larry Duggins, president of ARCap, which bought 10% of all B-piece deals in 2004, compared with nearly 24% in 2001.

Sure enough, there have been stumbles. The CW Capital division, CW Capital Investments, might have lost $10 million on a bond backed by the loan on a Tulsa, Okla., warehouse owned by well-known real-estate firm W.P. Carey &Co.

Still, CMBS issuers welcome these new investors, whose willingness to buy allows them more leeway over what loans can be included in a bond. "I can push the limits more," says Randy Reiff, a Bear Stearns executive whose group issues CMBSs. "My competition can push the limits more."
