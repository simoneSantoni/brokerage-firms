Mall Landlords Embrace High-Tech to Entice Shoppers; Mapping functions for parking, mall navigation are among the digital offerings

Shopping malls are going high-tech.

Making technology investments to improve customer experiences has traditionally been the domain of retailers, which have introduced robots, touch-screen mirrors and virtual-reality goggles to attract shoppers to their stores in recent years.

But as pressure from store closures continues to mount, some mall landlords also are pouring money into technology, investing in mapping functions to help shoppers find parking spaces, navigate mall corridors or check out a flash sale at a store one floor above.

The goal: to better connect with shoppers in hopes of sparking more activity and possibly giving themselves an edge in lease negotiations with retailers.

 What differentiates GGP is the ability to make this kind of investment so that we have the best mousetrap in the market," said Sandeep Mathrani, chief executive officer at General Growth Properties Inc., the second-largest mall operator in the U.S. by number of properties.

Investment from mall owners is also fueling a cottage industry of technology startups peddling software and services that create interactive mall maps and mobile advertising, as well as assist in real-estate maintenance and security operations.

Jibestream, a firm that creates interactive mall maps to guide customers from store to store on their mobile phones as well as help them find parking, has rolled out its technology to hundreds of malls run by Westfield Corp., General Growth and Dubai-based shopping mall owner and operator Majid Al Futtaim.

 When driverless cars are available, how will they find your mall and how will they find parking? We'll integrate mapping with the real-time parking system and make sure where we're guiding people is closest to where they are going inside the mall," said Chris Wiegand, CEO at Jibestream.

Other vendors are offering ways for landlords to better analyze foot traffic in malls, a key metric cited by landlords and retailers as online shopping continues to gain traction and pose greater challenges to bricks-and-mortar stores.

Mall owners, who are focused on leasing out their properties and charging the highest possible rents, are constantly in need of more precise methods of calculating the number of visitors to their malls and how they behave.

 We're bringing the same analytics Amazon used to crush bricks-and-mortar retailers into the real world," said Sage Osterfeld, chief marketing officer at Palo Alto, Calif.-based Sysorex.

The data analytics firm uses a real-time location technology that measures the number of visitors and their dwell times in various parts of the mall using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and cellular data signals emitted by cellphones.

By tracking the cellphone signals in a mall, companies can study the paths visitors take as well as how effective display windows and in-mall advertising are in drawing customers.

This is similar to how Amazon.com is able to measure user engagement by how long cursors hover over a certain part of a webpage, said Mr. Osterfeld. The technology is able to distinguish between visitors and staff, and provides insight as to which storefronts are most popular and which retailers have customers that fan out to other stores in the mall.

For instance, Apple Inc.'s stores are a huge draw for shoppers, allowing the tech giant to bargain for lower rents. With this technology, mall owners will have data regarding how many customers head straight for the Apple store and then leave without cross-shopping at neighboring retailers. This could help to put the floor on rent negotiations.

 Mall operators and developers are very interested in using data for their advantage in the same way online retailers have been using data," said Sean Harrington, chief operating officer at Sensity Systems Inc.

His Silicon Valley-based firm offers smart lighting and sensor data services that reduce energy costs with added security features for mall owners. The largest U.S. mall owner, Simon Property Group, has tapped Sensity's technology for its Brea Mall in California to improve parking lot lighting, helping illuminate areas that were too dark for shoppers to find their cars at night.

Some larger mall owners also are investing in startups and developing their own technology teams to build more intelligent infrastructures. Simon's venture-capital arm, Simon Venture Group, invests in retail technology, while Australia-listed Westfield built its own Westfield Labs in 2012 to address issues on how to embed digital technology in their projects.

But for landlords who are trying to catch up, it could be daunting to ferret out which investments might deliver.

 Retailers have been more advanced and sophisticated at embedding technologies into their business for a long time and landlords have been a bit behind," said Melina Cordero, CBRE Group chief of retail research in the Americas.  It can be confusing for landlords to understand it's new technology, new methods of doing business."

Jeff Clavier s SoftTech VC Collects $150M for Two Funds

SoftTech VC has wrapped up the fundraising for two funds, a $100 million seed fund, the firm's fourth institutional pool of capital, and a $50 million growth fund that marks its first foray into late-stage investing.

The Palo Alto, Calif., firm closed both funds at their hard caps, with interest boosted by recent exits, said Jeff Clavier, founder and managing partner of SoftTech. The firm's biggest hit was last year's initial public offering of Fitbit Inc., a wearable electronics maker that Mr. Clavier had backed in "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJVWR20081010166774", and which became the first SoftTech VC portfolio company to go public.

SoftTech's move to create a late-stage fund grew out of its experience watching from the sidelines as it missed "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120150619eb6jifgd8".

Even though the firm made a great return on Fitbit, it could have done even better had it invested in the company's Series D round in 2013, Mr. Clavier said. Fitbit sold Series D shares at $1.48 each, according to regulatory filings. It's now trading at around $14.41.

 It's a 10 to 12  X' in three years, right there," Mr. Clavier said of the returns SoftTech missed out on.

The firm didn't have reserves in its seed fund to make the Series D investment, Mr. Clavier said, and had to pass on the deal, watching True Ventures, Foundry Group, and SoftBank Capital share in the spoils. That experience has led his firm to launch SoftTech VC Plus LP.

SoftTech's strategy seems similar to that of co-investor Foundry Group, which had created its "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00020131025e9apt0kh3" and used it to make a Series D investment in Fitbit. Both of these funds seek to continue investing in their best existing portfolio companies.

SoftTech had explored other ways to take advantage of the firm's rights to reinvest. But it opted against setting up special purpose vehicles, sometimes called SPVs, a "http://www.wsj.com/articles/in-silicon-valley-frenzy-vcs-create-new-inside-track-1427992176" by pooling money from limited partners and others who want to back a specific highflying startup.

 I'm actually anti-SPVs. They are dangerous vehicles," Mr. Clavier said, saying such deals may encourage general partners to take greater risks.

Late-stage investing can seem enticing to early-stage investors who bemoan their inability to reinvest, but it can also be a risky game. There have been plenty of instances in recent years "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120150805eb85ihb4t" by buying shares at prices much higher than later exits warranted.

Mr. Clavier says he's aware of that and intends to proceed cautiously with the new fund. Already, it has invested $3 million in the"http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120160126ec1qbnubb", a company that tracks the effectiveness of corporate video use.

SoftTech's main seed fund will pursue a strategy the firm has honed earlier. SoftTech VC V LP will first invest between $500,000 and $1.5 million in startups primarily located in the San Francisco Bay Area. It will reserve about 60% of its capital for follow-on investments.

Meantime, the firm will pursue investments in connected devices, as well as newer areas such as artificial intelligence, Mr. Clavier said, but they will be balanced out with software-as-a-service deals that will take up about half of the portfolio.

 SaaS and [business-to-business software] is a bit more predictable," Mr. Clavier said.  But it's hard to get multibillion-dollar outcomes."

SoftTech returned to the fundraising market fairly soon after closing its $85 million Fund IV in 2014. Mr. Clavier said he wanted to be sure to be one of the first to get on the radar of limited partners this year, as competition for LP dollars is very high.

 All of our LPs told us: As much as 80% of our managers were coming back in 2016," Mr. Clavier said.

The first quarter of 2016 set a record for fundraising by venture firms.

That meant that even though all of SoftTech's investors returned to back the new fund, some had reduced their allocation, Mr. Clavier said, as they are trying to spread their cash to make sure they have enough to back all the general partners who are raising new funds that seem promising.

Limited partners in the new funds include Cendana Capital and Northern Trust, as well as FG Next and Glenmede, both of whom are new backers. Knollwood Investment Advisory and the State of Wisconsin Investment Board are also investing.

Stephanie Palmeri and Andy McLoughlin are partners in the fund.

Security Startup Cylance Nabs $100M at More Than $1B Valuation

The machine-learning security startup "https://www.cylance.com/" is the latest private company to reach a valuation of more than $1 billion.

The Irvine, Calif., company announced on Wednesday it raised $100 million in Series D financing led by Blackstone Tactical Group. Insight Venture Partners as well as an undisclosed strategic investor in the financial services and all previous investors participated in the round.

Less than a year ago, the company announced it raised a $42 million financing round. Cylance Chief Executive Stuart McClure said the company decided to raise more capital after seeing broad interest from investors who wanted to be part of the Series C round. He said the new funding will allow Cylance to break into new international markets and  weather any storms that might be coming."

The funding round more than tripled the company's valuation from the previous round. He said he had seven term sheets in hand.

 I've never seen growth like this, certainly not first hand," said Mr. McClure, who was an executive at McAfee, now Intel Security, after the company acquired his previous startup Foundstone.

Mr. McClure declined to disclose revenue figures. The company has more than 1,000 enterprise customers using its CylanceProtect product.

Cylance is now one of several cybersecurity startups that have commanded a valuation of $1 billion or more, called  unicorns" in Sillicon Valley. Others include CloudFlare Inc., ForeScout Technologies Inc. and Tanium Inc.

Recently the glut of private technology companies with valuations of more than $1 billion has come under scrutiny. Cylance board member Alex Doll said Cylance's valuation validates the company's growth.

 It is neat that Cylance is really rare among a rare species already," Mr. Doll said.  I'm not sure that security was too prone to the unicorn valuation; the unicorn herd didn't really speed into security too fast."

The four-year-old company uses machine learning to create a system that can determine if a file is  good" or  bad."

The company was also recently credited with identifying the malware that caused "http://www.wsj.com/articles/opm-breach-exposed-19-7-million-background-clearance-forms-1436469626" at the Office of Personnel Management, which left more than 21 million Social Security numbers vulnerable.

Mr. McClure said recently the product was able to stop 22 new ransomware variants at a global mining company. He said 21 had never before been identified.

Mr. McClure attributes much of the company's growth in the past year to  The Cylance Unbelievable Tour," a product tour he took around the country to show off the software's abilities. He said the company is more than 99% effective at stopping attacks.

Cylance works with enterprises in a wide spectrum of industries, ranging from financial services to construction.

In addition to expanding into new markets, Mr. McClure said Cylance is seeking to broaden its product line. He said within the next year, Cylance will release a product for consumers with a user-friendly display that works on mobile.

 We're still in development of it," he said.  It will be the same core technology, but very focused on the consumer which needs a very different interface, interaction."

London Brokerage Deal to Face Antitrust Inquiry

LONDON -- Tullett Prebon PLC's GBP 1.1 billion ($1.6 billion) deal to buy a voice-brokerage business from British rival ICAP PLC faces an inquiry from the U.K.'s competition watchdog.

The Competition and Markets Authority has referred the deal, which would significantly reshape the interdealer brokerage landscape in the U.K., for an "in-depth investigation" to determine whether it would reduce competition in the sector.

The investigation could take as long as six months, a representative of the regulator said Tuesday.

The deal between Tullett and ICAP, founded by high-profile City of London figure Michael Spencer, was announced last November.

The combination would create the world's largest interdealer brokerage house with revenue of GBP 1.5 billion a year. Interdealer brokers, which match buyers and sellers of securities on behalf of investment banks, have struggled since the financial crisis.

Tougher financial regulations have crimped the trading activity of banks on which the brokers were heavily dependent.

Despite fierce competition in the sector, Mr. Spencer said in November that the two companies had become "a happily married couple." Upon completion of the deal, ICAP plans to change its name to NEX Group, with a focus on electronic trading and post-trade services, such as trade reporting and risk-management analytics.

The CMA said its investigation will look at just oil products, where the merger might give rise to "a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition," because rivalry from other brokers is more limited.

Andrea Coscelli, CMA executive director of markets and mergers, said, "In this area, the parties have a strong market position, there is more limited competition from brokers and other electronic platforms, and the CMA has heard a number of third-party concerns."

The CMA said there are 20 product categories in which the two companies' services overlap.

Arnaud Giblat, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said he doesn't see the CMA action as a "stumbling block" for the deal to close. A carve-out of the oil-brokerage business could be one possible solution, Mr. Giblat said.

Commodities represent roughly 20% of ICAP's voice-brokerage revenue, with the oil business representing a smaller percentage within that, he said.

Patrick Young, an exchange consultant and director at DV advisers, described competition concerns over oil and voice brokerage as "hardly material."

"There is no material impact, and the investigation escalation is difficult to justify when applying even a local lens of perspective," Mr. Young said. "Given that the vast bulk of revenue at ICAP comes from the brokering of money, there may even be a form of relief at ICAP and Tullett that only oil voice-brokering is being targeted here."

He added that the merger changed "the entire market-structure parish and is a potential 'win-win' for both parties."

Tullett Prebon said it "intends to explore how best to satisfy the CMA's concerns." ICAP said it is confident that the CMA will clear the deal.

Both companies said they still expect the transaction to close later this year.

WSJ.D Technology: Baidu Joins Venture For Car Insurance

BEIJING -- Chinese internet company Baidu Inc. is shoring up its auto ecosystem, as it continues to develop a driverless car and looks to ramp up investment in areas outside of its core search business.

This week, Baidu announced a joint venture with a subsidiary of China Pacific Insurance (Group) Co. to form an online auto-insurance company with a registered capital of two billion yuan ($305 million), and a $50 million investment in Bitauto Holdings Ltd., a Chinese auto-marketing provider.

The new online company will provide auto insurance, enlisting big data to help assess risk for consumers and to offer competitive pricing for car owners. As of 2015, China's total auto-insurance premiums reached about $100 billion, according to the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, and the market is expected to double by 2021.

Baidu joins JD.com Inc. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. in the Bitauto investment, with each company contributing $50 million to purchase newly issued Bitauto shares for $20.23 a share.

The strategic investment will give Baidu a 3.2% stake in Bitauto; Tencent and JD.com will have stakes of 7.1% and 23.5%, respectively.

Analysts say these tie-ups show Baidu's mission to create an end-to-end vertical of auto products and services, as it continues its ambitious plan to develop an autonomous car and mass produce them within five years. Baidu is already testing its driverless cars on open roads in Beijing and Wuhu, in China's Anhui province, and hopes to conduct testing across 10 Chinese cities.

The investments also reflect the company's desire to catch up to rivals Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent's flurry of investments, as well as draw attention away from the recent government investigation of its search and advertising practices.

Baidu's stock was hit hard after the announcement of the investigation, as online-advertising revenue makes up 94% of the search giant's revenue.

Baidu has been making investments in auto-related businesses in recent years, including deals with Uber China and used-car-auction company Uxin Ltd.

"They want to have coverage in the auto industry, whether it is for ride-hailing applications or insurance so they can have end-to-end service," said Nicole Peng, an analyst at Canalys. "They want to understand consumer behavior, regardless of if it is before a person purchases a car, during ownership or getting insurance."

Bitauto Founder William Li, meanwhile, has backed NextEV, considered the Chinese Tesla rival for electric cars. NextEV has also garnered support from Tencent and Richard Liu, the founder of JD.com.

Indonesia s biggest bank is hurting but its boss is all smiles

 I m used to dealing with trouble,  said Kartika Wirjoatmodjo, president and chief executive of Bank Mandiri, after less than two months at the helm of Indonesia s largest lender by assets.

Just as well, because the bank s new boss has already had to deal with plunging profits and a slipping stock price. And indeed, Mr Wirjoatmodjo looked anything but troubled as he faced a room full of analysts in Jakarta on May 16, flashing a ready smile.

Still, the subject matter was serious, and he had a lot of explaining to do. Over the weekend, Mandiri had announced that its first-quarter profits were down 26 per cent on the year, with non-performing loans ballooning. As if to highlight the bank s woes, its two closest domestic competitors, Bank Rakyat Indonesia and Bank Central Asia, were both basking in profits.

Mandiri has a larger corporate loan exposure than its rivals, and hence has suffered more from the decline in the credit quality of companies   especially those in the oil, gas and coal sectors. The bank s provisions for bad loans tripled to 4.59tn rupiah ($337m), and its gross non-performing loan ratio surged by nearly 1 percentage point to 3.18 per cent.

By the time Mr Wirjoatmodjo had begun speaking with analysts, everyone in the room knew that Mandiri s shares had shed another 3 per cent since the morning. The chief executive appeared to take it in his stride.  There are cycles, and I have come at the end of a cycle,  he said.  So I have to deal with bad loans and all   but that is OK. 

In his early 40s, Mr Wirjoatmodjo   called Tiko by his associates   is unusually young for the head of an Indonesian state-owned enterprise. But he has been involved in pivotal moments at Mandiri and is respected as a professional banker with no political strings attached. Those qualities are said to have caught the eye of President Joko Widodo, who is on a mission to reform state enterprises.

 The president did not want this position to be used politically,  an economic adviser to the government told the Nikkei Asian Review. The Ministry of State Owned Enterprises   Mandiri s majority shareholder   appointed Mr Wirjoatmodjo on March 21.

 I have quite a detailed understanding of how the bank evolved during the last 15 to 16 years,  Mr Wirjoatmodjo told the analysts.  I hope with that I can give you more background on how we transformed the bank, and how we see ourselves developing into one of the most important institutions in Asean [the Association of Southeast Asian Nations]. 

Mr Wirjoatmodjo s confidence seemed infectious. After he wrapped up the proceedings, the room erupted into applause. His fellow executives, who had braced themselves for a harsh grilling, appeared visibly surprised   and relieved   by the positive reception.

Mr Wirjoatmodjo has always had a certain star quality. He graduated from the elite University of Indonesia with a degree in economics and accounting, then received an MBA at Rotterdam s Erasmus University.

The young chief executive started his career as a financial consultant, and in 1996 became an analyst at the Industrial Bank of Japan, now Mizuho Bank. When the Asian financial crisis struck the following year, Indonesia s banking sector was thrown into turmoil. Mr Wirjoatmodjo moved to Boston Consulting Group and worked on the merger of four banks that needed to be bailed out. Bank Mandiri was the end-product.

Mr Wirjoatmodjo was tapped to lead strategy and financial analysis at the new bank. There was no shortage of problems. In 2005, Mandiri s non-performing loan ratio jumped from 7 per cent to 25 per cent as economic conditions deteriorated. Net profit was down nearly 90 per cent. During the time that the bank was headed by Agus Martowardojo, now governor of the central bank, Mr Wirjoatmodjo was instrumental in a sweeping restructuring of Mandiri s loan book.

In 2014, Mr Wirjoatmodjo was put in charge of Indonesia Deposit Insurance Corp, which was established after the global financial crisis to protect depositors in the event of bank collapses. His biggest headache was finding a buyer for Bank Mutiara, formerly Bank Century, which had been bailed out in 2008 at the height of the crisis.

The rescue stirred controversy because the government needed to inject 6.7tn rupiah   a substantial amount for a middling lender. Mr Wirjoatmodjo sought to reassure bidders worried about the political implications that the bank was now healthy, and Mutiara was sold to Japan s J Trust in November 2014 for about 4.4tn rupiah. Although that was below the bailout cost, it was a premium valuation   3.5 times Mutiara s book value.

Heading Mandiri is likely to be Mr Wirjoatmodjo s biggest challenge yet. This year s first-quarter profit slide was due to a surge in non-performing loans. At 3.18 per cent, the figure is still much lower than in 2005. But Mr Wirjoatmodjo expects the economy to take longer to recover this time, which means many bad loans are going to linger, perhaps even until early 2017. But there is ample room for improving the bank s operations.  We admit that we have to fix some of our basic banking practices, especially in credit and portfolio management,  Mr Wirjoatmodjo said.

To prevent further bad loans and cope with existing ones, Mr Wirjoatmodjo is creating a new panel that specialises in restructuring and collecting repayments. It will be staffed by senior managers who report directly to him. One big target is sorting out a 1.5tn rupiah loan extended to a bottled water company in Bandung that is struggling to compete with larger rivals.  Their manufacturing standard is good,  said Mr Wirjoatmodjo.  What they need to do is find a buyer. 

Whipping the bank into shape is not his only mandate. Mr Widodo wants lenders to lower interest rates to help revive economic growth. The central bank has already cut its policy rate three times this year, and said after its last board meeting in May that there was further room for monetary easing.

In response to the central bank s moves, Mandiri plans to lower its lending rates   which stood at around 12 per cent at the end of 2015   to single digits this year. The potential squeeze on its profits concerns investors: the bank s market capitalisation is hovering around $15bn, far below its target of $55bn for 2020.

Mr Wirjoatmodjo has also been charged with expanding Mandiri s business in Southeast Asia. With only eight overseas operations, the bank greatly lags behind its Malaysian and Singaporean counterparts in internationalisation.

 If we look at the next five years, we want a substantial presence in the regional market,  Mr Wirjoatmodjo said. He has been on the road, looking for possible acquisitions in high-growth markets such as the Philippines, Myanmar and Vietnam.  We need to be sure that the growth rate and profitability is equal to or bigger than the Indonesian market,  he said.

One of Indonesia s broader challenges is transforming its fragmented banking industry. Loans to the private sector are less than 40 per cent of gross domestic product, compared with over 100 per cent in Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand.

Limited funding sources in Indonesia mean banks there can charge high interest rates, making them the most profitable lenders in Southeast Asia. Net interest margins   the difference between lending and borrowing rates   are higher than 5 per cent, compared with under 2 per cent in Singapore, according to S&P Global Ratings. Such fat margins have given Indonesian banks little incentive to expand abroad, where profits are more elusive.

But Mr Wirjoatmodjo is full of confidence, and he has proved that he can bring positive change at difficult times. So what s next? He has been looking for a strategic partner to develop the bank s Islamic finance unit, Bank Syariah Mandiri, which thus far has been a drag on the bank s overall performance.

 2016 will be a tough year,  he said.  But we will still push 	. 	. 	. 	for a high growth rate. We believe Mandiri is well positioned in terms of revenue growth.

TULLETT PREBON

ICAP Deal Faces Competition Probe

Tullett Prebon PLC's 1.1 billion ($1.59 billion) deal to buy a voice-brokerage business from British rival ICAP PLC faces an inquiry from the U.K.'s competition watchdog.

The Competition and Markets Authority has referred the deal, which would significantly reshape the interdealer-brokerage landscape in the U.K., for an  in-depth investigation" to determine whether it would reduce competition in the sector.

The investigation could take as long as six months, a representative of the regulator said.

The deal between Tullett and ICAP, founded by high-profile City of London figure Michael Spencer, was announced last November. The combination would form the world's largest interdealer-brokerage house, with revenue of 1.5 billion a year. Interdealer brokers, which match buyers and sellers of securities on behalf of investment banks, have struggled since the financial crisis. Tougher financial regulations have crimped the trading activity of banks on which the brokers depend.

Despite fierce competition in the sector, Mr. Spencer said in November that the two companies had become  a happily married couple." Upon completion of the deal, ICAP plans to change its name to NEX Group, with a focus on electronic trading and post-trade services, such as trade reporting and risk-management analytics.

The CMA said its investigation will look at just oil products, where the merger might give rise to  a realistic prospect of a substantial lessening of competition," because rivalry from other brokers is more limited.

Andrea Coscelli, CMA executive director of markets and mergers, said,  In this area, the parties have a strong market position, there is more limited competition from brokers and other electronic platforms, and the CMA has heard a number of third-party concerns."

The CMA said there are 20 product categories in which the two companies' services overlap.

Arnaud Giblat, an analyst at Exane BNP Paribas, said he doesn't see the CMA action as a  stumbling block" for the deal to close. A carve-out of the oil-brokerage business could be one possible solution, Mr. Giblat said.

Commodities represent roughly 20% of ICAP's voice-brokerage revenue, with the oil business representing a smaller percentage within that, he said.

Patrick Young, an exchange consultant and director at DV advisers, described competition concerns over oil and voice brokerage as  hardly material."

 There is no material impact, and the investigation escalation is difficult to justify when applying even a local lens of perspective," Mr. Young said.  Given that the vast bulk of revenue at ICAP comes from the brokering of money, there may even be a form of relief at ICAP and Tullett that only oil voice-brokering is being targeted here."

He added that the merger changed  the entire market-structure parish and is a potential  win-win' for both parties."

Tullett Prebon said it  intends to explore how best to satisfy the CMA's concerns." ICAP said it is confident that the CMA will clear the deal.

Both companies said they still expect the transaction to close later this year.

TRAFIGURA

Dutch Trader Posts Lower Earnings

Trafigura Group Pte., one of the world's biggest commodity traders, reported a drop in net profit as lower commodity prices offset higher trading volumes.

The Netherlands-based company said profit for the six months ended March 31, the first half of its financial year, was $601.8 million, down 10% from a year earlier.

The total volume of commodities traded  rose substantially," Trafigura said, as it found opportunities in volatile oil and refined-fuel markets. The company said it traded more than four million barrels a day of oil and petroleum products during the first half, a 46% increase from a year earlier.

That wasn't enough to make up for the deep slide in raw-materials prices, however, and revenue declined 8.5% to $44.1 billion, the company said.

Commodity-trading firms have been under strain as prices dived. Swiss trader Glencore PLC said it lost almost $5 billion in 2015, while Vitol Group reported a decrease in 2015 revenue. Another rival, Noble Group Ltd., which has faced pressure from the price downturn and from scrutiny into its accounting methods, said last week its chief executive resigned.

Trafigura said the environment for metals trading remains difficult given the lack of clarity over China's prospects for economic growth.

Tighter Regulations Weigh on Global Wealth Management, Study Says; Average revenue, profit margins declined from 2012 to 2015 while legal and compliance costs doubled

An increasing regulatory burden is one of several challenges facing the global wealth management industry as growth in global private wealth slowed last year, according to a new study.

Global private wealth grew by 5.2% to $168 trillion last year, compared with a 7.5% increase in 2014 as weak market performance of existing assets weighed on overall growth, despite roughly $5 trillion of new wealth creation, according to The Boston Consulting Group's"https://www.bcgperspectives.com/content/articles/financial-institutions-consumer-insight-global-wealth-2016/"released Tuesday.

The slowdown in North America was significant, falling to 2% growth in 2015 compared with 6% growth a year earlier. Still, the report noted that those clients with higher net worths continued to see strong growth, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, and millionaire households are expected to hold more than half of global private wealth in 2020.

Meanwhile, average revenue and profit margins declined for global wealth managers from 2012 to 2015 while legal and compliance costs doubled over the same period, according to the report.

Tighter regulations around the globe, including the U.S. Department of Labor's new "http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-unveils-retirement-savings-revamp-but-with-a-few-concessions-to-industry-1459936802", are likely to continue to weigh on wealth management firms' revenue in part because of an emphasis on price transparency and limits on products that can be offered in certain circumstances, the report also noted.

The pressure underlines the need for firms to invest in newer technology, such as innovations around automated investment advice, and embrace data and analytics, the consulting firm said.

 Wealth managers are really just dipping their toe into" using more sophisticated data analytics and aren't  anywhere near where they could be" in terms of using data to understand their clients' actions, interacting with clients, digital marketing and targeting, among other things, said Brent Beardsley, the global head of BCG's wealth and asset management practice.

A client who focuses on trading and has a high risk tolerance, for instance, will have  markedly different research requirements, price sensitivities, and investment horizons than a client who delegates investments decisions," according to the report. Wealth managers, then, can use certain behavioral, demographic and lifestyle data to  think ahead of the client in determining the next logical investment."

Leveraged ETFs on SEC's List To Rein In

By Dave Michaels

The Wall Street Journal (Europe Edition)

It is a rare case of regulator's remorse.

During a deregulatory heyday a decade ago, the Securities and Exchange Commission approved a type of exchange-traded fund allowing mom-and-pop investors to try to double or even triple the daily return of stock markets, or bet on such swings in the opposite direction.

Now, after nearly $30 billion has flowed into the products, the SEC is moving to limit them, citing 76-year-old restrictions on how much mutual funds can use potentially risky borrowing to try to juice returns.

The SEC's plans, part of an effort to rein in the riskiest activities of mutual funds, threaten the most-aggressive funds, known as triple-leveraged and triple-leveraged-inverse ETFs. Under an SEC rule proposed late last year, the funds could lose the advantages that stem from being regulated like mutual funds,including access to a broader group of investors.

Chairman Mary Jo White said on May 20 that the agency was moving ahead and would make a final decision on the rule this year.The proposal was designed "in light of the significant growth in the volume and complexity of derivatives over the past two decades," Ms. White said at a conference sponsored by the mutual-fund industry's primary trade group.

In making its case, the agency is relying on a landmark federal law passed in 1940.It tightly controls how much debt mutual funds can assume, partly because they were deemed a critical part of the way Americans invest their savings. In 2006, the SEC allowed ETFs that use derivatives to seek the magnified returns that often come from using borrowed money.

That year, the agency approved 12 leveraged ETFs, all managed by ProShares, based in Bethesda, Md. Two years later, the agency approved 32 leveraged and inverse ETFs sold by New York-based Direxion Funds. Today, the two companies account for almost all the 170 leveraged and inverse ETFs, with total assets of $29.8 billion, according to data from Morningstar. A smaller group of traditional mutual funds, introduced during the 1990s, also use derivatives to try to double the daily or monthly return of an index they track.

The approvals came during more upbeat economic times, when ETFs, which are built like mutual funds but trade on exchanges like stocks, rapidly caught on as a cheaper and easier-to-trade form of mutual fund.

"It was still a good economy and people were thinking about innovative products, and the SEC was really trying to facilitate the creation of innovative products," said Kathleen Moriarty, a partner at law firm Kaye Scholer LLP who shepherded the novel ETFs through regulatory hurdles and said the products have worked as advertised.

Even as regulators approved the ETFs, they have long worried that retail investors could misunderstand how the funds work. An inverse fund, for example, that should rise in value when the market declines, can actually lose value during extremely volatile periods. That outcome stems from the effects of daily compounding, which over longer periods produces returns that can vary from a leveraged or inverse ETF's objectives.

Regulators published a warning letter in June 2009 saying some retail shareholders didn't understand that the ETFs aren't buy-and-hold products and cautioning brokers against selling them. Regulators later fined four large brokerages -- Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, UBS Financial Services and Wells Fargo Advisors LLC -- $7.3 million, saying they failed to adequately supervise sales ofleveraged ETFs during 2008 and 2009 and recommended them to investors who preferred more-conservative investments. The firms didn't admit or deny the claims.

Meanwhile, some investors filed lawsuits in 2009 against ProShares and Direxion Funds, claiming shareholders were misled because the companies didn't adequately explain the risks of holding the products over time. Direxion agreed in 2013 to pay $8 million to settle the lawsuit while denying there was anything wrong with its inverse ETFs. A judge dismissed the suit against ProShares in 2012.

ProShares and Direxion say trading data show that most investors treat leveraged ETFs as short-term investments. In a recent letter to the SEC, Direxion estimated that its shareholders hold triple-leveraged funds for between one and four days.

"Certainly if you talk to folks who are actively using these, they tend to be day traders and they tend to be hedge funds," said Dave Nadig, director of exchange-traded funds for FactSet, a financial data and analytics company.

The SEC's rule suggests that "3x ETFs" may be "unduly speculative" and clash with the 1940 restriction on how much mutual funds can borrow to finance investments. It would cap the leverage created by a fund's use of derivatives to 150% of, or 1.5 times, its net assets. While the 1940 law was written long before most derivatives existed, the SEC has treated those assets like borrowing, because they require only a small down payment to increase a fund's exposure to stocks, bonds or commodities.

Direxion could be affected the most because about two-thirds of its 76 ETFs seek to triple the daily return, or inverse return, of a market. Fifteen of ProShares's 151 ETFs are triple-leveraged or triple-leveraged-inverse products.

In a letter to the SEC in March, the company managing Direxion ETFs, Rafferty Asset Management, called the regulator's plan "arbitrary and capricious" saying its 3X funds have operated for close to a decade "with no regulatory issues." A spokesman for Direxion declined to comment beyond the company's letter.

The rule could still be changed in a way that reduces the impact on 3X ETFs. Separately, leveraged funds seeking just two times the return of an index would probably be able to comply with the cap by investing mainly in securities and using derivatives to enhance their potential returns, according to the SEC.

EU Lending Rule Could Upend Trade Finance

By Jon Sindreu

From the Chinese Tang Dynasty in the eighth century to Lombard Street in Victorian London, trade finance has always greased the wheels of global commerce. But this legacy is under threat in Europe from new regulation aimed at preventing another bank bailout.

Banks and commerce bodies are increasingly jittery about the potential effects of European Union regulation on the short-term financial instruments that connect buyers and sellers of goods across countries.

EU authorities have included trade-finance instruments, such as letters of credit, in the list of bank liabilities that could be written down if a bank goes under. This decision, the banks say, creates an enormous compliance headache and a competitive disadvantage and could leave unsuspecting parties holding the bag if foreign buyers fail to pay their bills.

The spat comes amid a challenging backdrop. The World Trade Organization warned in a report this month that a "trade finance gap" is hurting global commerce, especially for smaller companies. The Bank for International Settlements estimated that "reduced trade finance could have accounted for as much as two-fifths of the fall in export volumes" between the 2008 financial crash and 2014.

"Every bank is squirming, thinking about how they can avoid" the regulation, said Geoffrey L. Wynne, a London-based partner at American law firm Sullivan & Worcester. But banks and trade associations don't have high hopes of getting a last-minute opt-out.

Data for trade finance are scarce, but the BIS says banks serve as intermediaries for between $6.5 trillion and $8 trillion of it a year. It makes up roughly 4% of the revenue of the world's 12 largest banks, according to figures by analytics firm Coalition Development Ltd.

A spokeswoman for the European Commission said members would be "considering these concerns," among other issues, when the results of a consultation on the new financial regulation are published at a date yet to be confirmed.

The rules are designed to shield taxpayers from bailing out distressed financial institutions again, shifting the brunt to a "bail-in" by investors instead.

All EU bank contracts that fall outside the bloc's jurisdiction are mandated to include a clause obliging liability holders to accept the possibility of a bail-in. This regulation, introduced in January, was intended to stop creditors from seeking the protection of foreign courts.

Trade credit is usually provided by a chain of financial institutions across countries, meaning each of those banks needs to hold another's liability. EU banks worry that a "bail-in stamp" would put them at a disadvantage relative to U.S. banks.

U.S. trade credit faced its own uncertainty last year, when the U.S. Export-Import Bank's charter was allowed to expire for five months before finally being renewed in December. A lobbying effort by business groups, and the vocal complaints of large exporters including General Electric Co. and Boeing Co., eventually overcame opposition to Ex-Im Bank from congressional Republicans who insisted that its existence unfairly put taxpayers at risk.

Deutsche Bank AG's global head of trade finance, Michael Spiegel, warned "there's a possibility that non-EU counterparties would be reluctant to accept such clauses, because many of them won't understand them."

Banks also argue that logistical complications are insurmountable, as these decades-old contracts don't operate under any specific law. Furthermore, they are usually transmitted over the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication network, which banks use to send information to one another in a standardized way, making them hard to amend.

Commerce bodies are highly critical of the regulation as well, saying it could especially hurt smaller companies with less access to trade credit.

"It's a poorly thought-out regulation that will hurt EU businesses," said Emily O'Connor, senior policy manager at the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce.

Letters of credit guarantee a seller will get paid even if the buyer fails to make good, which enables unknown parties in different countries to trade by putting their faith in banks rather than one another.

A bank issues the letter of credit against a promise by the importer that it will pay up and then sends it to a confirming bank, which is the one the exporter uses. At a specified time after proof the product was shipped is presented, the confirming bank will pay the exporter.

While sellers are promised payment by both buyer and confirming bank, the latter -- more often a chain of them -- is directly exposed to the risk of the issuing bank going under. Although this risk was there before, traditional bankruptcy procedures used to be protective of trade finance, whereas the new regulation pinpoints it as liable to be written off.

People familiar with the matter said banks across different EU countries are testing the waters and slowly starting to phase in these rules in some trade-finance instruments. But there is little sign it has affected their corporate clients.

"We aren't aware of these new regulations," said Aner Garmendia, general manager at EGA Master SA. For this Bilbao, Spain, industrial manufacturer, which exports 85% of its sales, trade finance is essential, Mr. Garmendia said.

Implementation of the EU directive is dependent on each country's regulators. There, results have been uneven.

U.K. regulators have suggested letters of credit could be exempted from the directive because they "may not be practicably amendable by firms." The final decision will be made public this month.

In France, amendments to national legislation to allow the rule to be applied in a "proportionate" manner have been proposed, but the timing is unclear. But other major EU countries have taken no such actions. This means British and French banks would have little reason to cheer, even if their own regulators exempted them from the rules, because different measuring sticks in every country would pose hefty complications.

"It's just a huge documentation nightmare," said Adam Cull, director of financial policy at the British Bankers' Association. "Trade finance is about certainty."

Payday Loans, a Crony Capitalist Target

By Holman W. Jenkins, Jr.

To voters living comfortably in Cambridge, Mass., or the suburbs of Seattle, the payday lending crackdown sounds just right: Those storefront entrepreneurs of dubious extraction are preying upon the poor. They should be banned.

But for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a slogan that polls well with liberal voters is only a starting point. The end result of its new payday rules, like all Obama regulatory endeavors, is to concentrate more power in the hands of Washington lobbyists and politicians and the companies that can afford to pay for them.

CFPB director Richard Corday's 1,300-page regulatory edict will require payday lenders, an industry largely made up of thousands of storefront operators, to run full credit checks on prospective borrowers (average loan: $392) to test their sources of income, need for the loan and ability to keep financing their living expenses while paying it back.

This will make it hard to serve those customers who use the payday lending service most appropriately -- who borrow when pinched but then promptly repay and don't roll over their debt. The industry will become more focused on retaining habitual users, those who take out loans many times a year and get caught in "debt traps," continually rolling over what are supposed to be short-term, high-margin loans.

The massive record-keeping and data requirements that Mr. Corday is foisting on the industry will have another effect: It will drive out the small, local players who have dominated the industry in favor of big firms and consolidators who can afford the regulatory overhead.

It will also favor companies that can substitute big data for local knowledge, like LendUp, the Google-backed venture that issued a statement Thursday applauding the CFPB rules. Google's self-interest has become a recurrent theme in Obama policy making. A study in April that found that 250 Googlers had come or gone from administration employment, and Google lobbyist visits to the Obama White House vastly outnumbered those of any other company.

Just before the CFPB issued its proposed payday-lending rules, Google announced it would banish ads from traditional payday lenders from its Google search results and web services. This received the usual unthinking applause from tech media mavens, who would perhaps think differently if they knew Google intended to compete with payday lenders. Google's interest is clear: a regulatory structure that favors its centralized, big-data approach and influence in Washington, and disfavors the informal, local knowledge of the mostly small operators who built the $46 billion small-loan industry.

Promoters of the payday-lending crackdown have worked hard to make sure payday lending has an offensive odor in the nostrils of classes unlikely ever to turn to a payday lender to get through the week. But it strains credulity that the liberal gentry are supplying all the oomph behind this battle.

A new tax-exempt group, Allied Progress, popped up last year, started by a veteran liberal Democratic activist, and was soon running "Debt Trap Debbie" ads against South Florida Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Hillary Clinton supporter and chairwoman of the Democratic National Convention, because she opposed the federal government's bulldozing of Florida's own regulatory regime for payday lenders. Under the TV onslaught, Ms. Wasserman Schultz on Friday recanted her opposition.

"Ban payday abuse" is obviously a slogan to rouse the liberal voter. But as with every Washington regulatory campaign, especially in the Obama era, a lot more is going on here: Payday lending won't go away. The industry is being reshaped to suit the interests of players whose strength is pulling strings in Washington.

Storage Analytics  Startup Qumulo Raises $32.5M in  Down  Round

Qumulo Inc., a maker of network-attached storage analytics, joins a growing list of companies taking down rounds as investors continue to scrutinize corporate fundamentals.

The Seattle-based startup announced a $32.5 million Series C round this week, but its share price has dropped by more than 35%, according to Pitchbook, from $6.02 in February 2015 to $3.91 now.

Qumulo declined to comment on the share price or valuation. Board member and Madrona Venture Group Managing Director Matt McIlwain said Qumulo's valuation was up but did not elaborate.

The new funding follows layoffs in April, which Mr. McIlwain described as  trimming on the sales side." He said the layoffs and the funding round were not related.

 It's a hard thing to make an adjustment [in sales], but given how rapidly the company is growing, I think we did the right thing," Mr. McIlwain said.

Co-founder and Chief Executive Peter Godman said the funding round was oversubscribed and called it  further validation of the business."

The startup was founded four years ago by veterans of Isilon Systems, a data storage company that went public in 2006 and was acquired by EMC Corp. in 2010.

Qumulo created a software file system that runs on commodity hardware and can scale across multiple machines, letting customers analyze in real time, on a file-by-file basis, how their data is being accessed and how storage is being used.

It has been shipping its product since August 2014 and has several corporate and university customers.

Down or flat rounds are becoming more common for enterprise tech companies, many of which enjoyed run-ups in valuation over the past several years.

In March, database company Couchbase Inc. took a 41% drop in a down round, taking its share price to slightly above what it was in August 2013.

Also in March, the security startup Bromium Inc. took a down round, slicing its share price by more than 58%.

Sales software maker Insidesales.com Inc., meanwhile, elected not to raise a new round and instead added a new investor to the Series D round it raised in March 2015, keeping its valuation flat at about $1.5 billion.

Founder and Chief Executive Dave Elkington in May said that he expects fundraising for companies at every stage over the next six months to get harder.

 I think you will see a big group of companies not get funded, and sold for cash value &in fire sales," he said, adding that he hopes Insidesales.com will be one of the companies scooping up assets.

New investors for the Series C round include Allen & Company, Top Tier Capital Partners and Tyche Partners. Current investors Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Madrona, Highland Capital Partners and Valhalla Partners also participated in the round.

Qumulo has now raised a total of $100 million.

U.S. Government Bonds Strengthen as ECB and OPEC Stand Pat; No deal to curb oil output, and European Central Bank leaves interest rates unchanged

U.S. government bonds strengthened Thursday as investors took a cautious view of the economy after the European Central Bank left interest rates unchanged and oil producers failed to reach a deal to curb output.

After the ECB meeting, bank President Mario Draghi said little that surprised investors but did leave the door open for more monetary stimulus as the eurozone continues its slow recovery.

Government bond prices in the eurozone ticked higher during the ECB news conference, providing a lift to U.S. Treasurys. Bonds also benefited from a temporary flight from stocks and commodities as an Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting ended without an agreement to set a production ceiling, though oil and stock prices later recovered as new data showed a drop in U.S. crude supplies.

Before Mr. Draghi spoke,  there was a sense that he was going to come out a little more upbeat regarding the prospects of the eurozone," said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak.  The interpretation was that his guarded tone left the door open to more action later in the year."

Also providing a reason to buy bonds was a new report on New York City-area business activity that showed a sharp slowdown in May, Mr. Karydakis said.

The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note settled at 1.811%, compared with 1.844% Wednesday. Yields fall when bond prices rise.

Despite the activity overseas, investors remained largely focused on the state of the U.S. economy, with a major data point coming Friday when the Labor Department will release its nonfarm employment report for May.

On Thursday, payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody's Analytics said private payrolls rose by 173,000 last month, roughly in line with expectations.

Treasury yields have climbed in recent weeks as a number of Fed officials have warned investors that a rate increase as soon as June isn't off the table. Last Friday, Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen reinforced that message, saying a rate increase  in the coming months" "http://www.wsj.com/articles/janet-yellen-says-fed-could-raise-rates-in-the-coming-months-1464372155" if the economy and labor market continue to strengthen.

Fed-funds futures, used by investors to place bets on U.S. central-bank policies, showed Thursday the chances of the Fed raising interest rates were 23% at its June 14-15 meeting and 61% by its July 26-27 meeting, according to CME Group.

One reason why investors are skeptical that the Fed will raise interest rates at its June meeting is that a referendum in the U.K. on remaining in the European Union will take place just one week later, creating uncertainty about the European economy and global financial markets.

Even if the Fed does raise rates soon, many analysts think the move likely won't lead to a big increase in bond yields because of the large demand for Treasurys from overseas investors, who are struggling to obtain income at a time when ultraloose monetary policy from central banks in Japan and the eurozone have sent yields on a record amount of government debt into negative territory.

In the midst of a number of take-private transactions in the software space, Thoma Bravo LLC said it acquired data-analytics software company Qlik Technologies Inc. in a deal valued at about $3 billion.

Under the deal, which is expected to close during the third quarter, Qlik shareholders would receive $30.50 a share, a 5.3% premium to the stock's trading price at 4 p.m. Wednesday.

Shares rose 4.% to $30.13 in late morning trading. The company's stock rose to a record of $42.90 in early October, but declined amid concerns about its growth and margin pressures.

The maker of user-friendly software for analyzing business trends came under pressure from activist investor Elliott Management in March to sell the company. Qlik serves a number of sectors, including retail, health-care, life sciences, communications, energy and utilities and the public sector, among others.

The sale of Radnor, Pa., company followed a review of strategic alternatives, according to a news release.

Morgan Stanley, Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP and Gunderson Dettmer Stough Villeneuve Franklin & Hachigian LLP advised Qlik on the deal. Goldman Sachs & Co. and Kirkland & Ellis LLP advised Thoma Bravo.

Ares Capital Corp. is the administrative and collateral agent, joint lead arranger and joint bookrunner for a nearly $1.08 billion unitranche credit facility to support the acquisition. Ares Capital Management is leading the syndication. Golub Capital LLC, TPG Specialty Lending Inc. and Varagon Capital Partners LP also are joint lead arrangers.

Thoma Bravo, with offices in Chicago and San Francisco, invests $100 million to $750 million in companies with annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of over $20 million. Thoma Bravo states on it website it has particular focus on enterprise, infrastructure and security software and technology-enabled business services

The firm is slated to wrap up Thoma Bravo Fund XII LP at its roughly $7.2 billion upper limit in the second quarter, according to a previous report by WSJ Pro Private Equity.

The deal for Qlik comes on the heels of two other take privates in the technology sector this week. On Tuesday, business software company SciQuest Inc. said it agreed to be acquired by Accel-KKR in a deal that valued the company at $509 million. That same day, Vista Equity Partners announced that the firm would acquire publicly traded engagement marketing software provider Marketo Inc. in a deal valued at $1.79 billion.

NantHealth Inc., a biomolecular medicine company that bets on  big data" in the growing field of personalized health care, on Wednesday said its initial public offering of 6.5 million shares would price at $14 each, the midpoint of the previously announced range.

The company's stock is scheduled to begin trading Thursday on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker symbol  NH."

Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the company's chairman and chief executive, could retain about 58% of the voting power after the IPO, according to regulatory filings. Dr. Soon-Shiong's voting control could be as much as 67% under certain conditions, according to the filings.

Other investors have included Allscripts Healthcare Solutions Inc., Kuwait Investment Authority, BlackBerry Ltd. and Celgene Corp.

Dr. Soon-Shiong's control as well as his interest in other companies that may compete with NantHealth, are listed as risk factors. Dr. Soon-Shiong, a billionaire entrepreneur whose investments include the Los Angeles Times' parent Tribune Publishing Co. and the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team, hasn't signed a contract with NantHealth.

The California-based company, which he founded in 2010, said there are no plans to sign a work agreement with the 63-year-old Dr. Soon-Shiong and that he is expected to work at least 20 hours a week, on average, for NantHealth.

As of March 31, it reported $19.5 million in revenue and an accumulated deficit of $324.3 million.

Banks turn to software to ease stress as regulations tighten around the globe

Revelations about offshore accounts around the world, designed to shelter billions of dollars from tax, have thrust financial regulation into the spotlight.

At the heart of the Panama Papers were banks and financial services firms that had hatched thousands of shell companies in murky territories for clients, as revealed in files leaked from law firm Mossack Fonseca.

The debacle exposed how legal corporate structures were abused to enable money laundering and tax evasion in some instances. It highlighted a big challenge for banks: the need to tighten checks, controls and more effectively police customer data.

Experts believe banks will increasingly turn to external technology providers to help them comply with a mounting regulatory burden.

Financial services providers are under pressure to stop abuse and comply with a stream of regulations that vary across jurisdictions. These range from anti-money laundering rules to country-specific regulation such as ringfencing in the UK, which requires banking groups to hive off their retail arms from riskier divisions by 2019.

Most recent reforms have come in response to the 2008 financial crisis. In the UK, the bank levy was created in 2011 to make banks contribute to economic recovery. The Dodd-Frank act in the US aimed to lower risk in the financial system with measures including a requirement for banks to have contingency plans for a quick and orderly closure.

 There are huge regulatory costs and overheads, which are something of an issue for banks,  says Cliff Moyce, global head of finance practice at technology consultancy DataArt.  Banks are using screening software, plugging in extra IT tools to core systems to pick up any activity that might not be compliant  	. 	. 	. 	you don t want to screen everything but you don t want to miss anything. 

In the UK, more than 80 per cent of banks  technology budgets for the past five years have been spent on addressing regulatory requirements, mitigating litigation and streamlining, according to estimates from consultants KPMG.

In 2013, the Basel Committee released its principles for risk-data aggregation and reporting after it found banks had been unable to efficiently quantify their exposure to the collapsed Lehman Brothers. In the US, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued  heightened expectations  to enhance the risk management practices of large national banks   including a focus on data and reporting.

The Panama Papers leaks highlighted the need for banks to have strong  know your customer  checks in place and the ability to find information quickly for regulators. The UK s Financial Conduct Authority gave banks about a week for urgent reviews looking into whether they were linked to Mossack Fonseca.

Plugging in third-party technology requires banks and financial services companies to have sufficient customer data, without which the software cannot screen for anomalies or areas that do not comply with regulations. Any instances of insufficient data would require reinputting client information, wasting time and resources, says Joe Cassidy, partner at KPMG. For example, documents such as passports must be scanned, kept in a database and be easily retrievable. But third-party software adds to costs for banks already suffering from lower profits and fines for behaviour such as mis-selling mortgage-backed securities and rate rigging. And their systems can be old and complex.

Bruce Laing, partner at consultancy Deloitte, says:  There are lots of regulations in many different jurisdictions, but a lot of the technology only focuses on one problem. Banks don t want to have 10 different sets of regulation technology.  He says some technology vendors are writing artificial intelligence programs that aim to create a single compliance software.

Increasingly sophisticated programmes are being developed. One type used by various banks, especially those with trading divisions, is voice surveillance. Some consultancies have developed a technology that can capture voices across the trading floor, take recordings and match conversations against lexicons to highlight anomalous words or patterns. This can send an alert to prompt human intervention. This process means that someone is not burdened with listening to all conversations.

Scott Weber, managing director of cyber-risk specialist Stroz Friedberg, says:  Communications can show increased levels of stress and disgruntlement and could highlight the potential for someone to do something risky. 

As the Panama Papers affair has shown, businesses need strong customer checks and clear processes for using data. Technological developments offer banks and finance companies more tools to comply with an increasing number of rules.

Microsoft Ventures is moving to reorganize, turning its focus to cloud computing-related, early-stage investments under a new leader.

Nagraj Kashyap, who joined Microsoft in January from Qualcomm Ventures, said in a "https://blogs.microsoft.com/?p=68947" on Monday that Microsoft now has a formalized venture fund that will identify and harness  disruptive technology trends" as early as possible.

The post offered no financial details, and Microsoft wasn't available for comment.

What used to be called "http://www.microsoftventures.com" is now Microsoft Accelerator. That organization will help startups with tools, technology and consulting and run Microsoft's seven accelerators, which are scattered around the world.

It is the second reorganization in three years for Microsoft Ventures, which "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00020130626e96qsatqf" in 2013 before former Steve Ballmer stepped down as chief executive and Satya Nadella was named to succeed him.

The venture arm was first intended as a vehicle for investing globally out of the Bing Fund, which was started in 2012 by Rahul Sood to encourage adoption of Microsoft's Bing search engine.

Mr. Sood was named general manager of Microsoft Ventures, but he left Microsoft in 2014 to work on a game startup.

Scott Coleman, a former Bank of America senior vice president who has been general manager of Microsoft Ventures, is now GM of Microsoft Accelerators.

As for the new Microsoft Ventures, the move to cloud computing remains  the single largest priority for the industry," Mr. Kashyap wrote. So Microsoft Ventures plans to invest in startups that complement Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure, build new business apps, promote personal computing through the Windows and HoloLens ecosystems and enhance Office 365.

The venture arm is also looking for startups working in machine learning and security. So far it is targeting four regions the San Francisco Bay Area, Seattle, New York and Tel Aviv, Israel.

Clear Ventures Launches With $120M Fund

Two technology industry veterans on Wednesday launched Clear Ventures, a Silicon Valley firm with a $120 million fund that wants to be the first investor in early-stage companies.

Between them, Rajeev Madhavan and Chris Rust have founded four startups, including LogicVision Inc. and Road Runner, which is now known as Time Warner Cable Internet. They plan to use their experience as founders to help early-stage companies navigate the  peaks and valleys" they once faced themselves.

Although they intend to think like founders as they launch Clear Ventures, Mr. Madhavan and Mr. Rust are no strangers to investing. Mr. Rust worked as a partner at Sequoia Capital and U.S. Venture Partners for 14 years, and both have acted as independent investors. Combined, they have backed more than 50 startups and were, by their count, the first investors in some 90% of those companies.

 We invest in the early stage much earlier than others; the company may not have formally validated a product yet," Mr. Madhavan said.

Based in Palo Alto, Calif., Clear Ventures is starting out with a portfolio of eight companies, including Cyphort Inc., Reflektion Inc. and Vera Security Inc. Enterprise companies initially will be their focus given the duo's experience in IT. But they're open to making investments in the right consumer companies, noting they have backed GoPro Inc. and Groupon Inc. as independent investors.

Mr. Madhavan and Mr. Rust have opened Clear Ventures as funds continue flowing to venture-capital firms. Data from industry tracker Dow Jones VentureSource said U.S. venture funds "http://www.wsj.com/articles/funds-flow-to-venture-firms-1459295426?mod=ST1" about $13 billion in the first quarter of 2015.

The fund initially targeted an $80 million funding, but increased it to $120 million to accommodate demand. Limited partners include institutional pension funds, educational endowments, charitable foundations and industry executives.

Mr. Rust said the firm will invest in companies at the intersections of the macro trends affecting the tech industry, which he identifies as cloud computing, the ubiquitousness of mobile and applied big data.

Because they plan to spend so much time helping to develop these companies, Mr. Madhavan said they would back about two to four companies a year over the next three years.

They plan to back companies primarily in Silicon Valley, where they can more easily take a hands-on approach, but they have previously made investments in India, Israel, China and Europe.

 We prefer to invest within driving distance," Mr. Rust said.

With decades of experience in tech industry, the pair isn't deterred from investing at a time when other venture capitalists are hitting the brakes on investing in startups.

 Founders help startup teams win," Mr. Rust said.  We're only as good as the next company we invest in."

C-Suite Strategies (A Special Report) --- Why the Global Risks Are Growing for Companies: Marsh CEO Peter Zaffino says one big reason is that we're all connected

Corrections & Amplifications

Marsh LLC is an insurance broker. An interview with the company's chief executive, Peter Zaffino, in Tuesday's C-Suite Strategies special report incorrectly said Marsh is an insurer.

(WSJ June 1, 2016)

(END)

As the size, scope and array of risks increase world-wide, companies need better ways to forecast possible threats. Better ways to respond, too.

Cyberattacks, a phenomenon whose impact isn't yet fully understood, are just one facet of a world that is more interconnected and interdependent than ever. As chief executive of Marsh LLC, Peter Zaffino oversees a company that provides insurance and insight in this dangerous and unpredictable environment. Marsh, an insurer that also provides analytics and risk-management services, is part of Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc., where Mr. Zaffino serves as chairman of the risk and insurance services segment.

One might think, with the rise of Big Data, that it has become easier to plan against risk. Some 75% or more of the data and analytics companies now use to make decisions wasn't available just two or three years ago, Mr. Zaffino says. Such an increase, however, also means there is more complexity in evaluating risks, and in making good choices on strategy and investment.

The Wall Street Journal spoke to Mr. Zaffino about risk, planning -- and their rewards -- at his New York office. Edited excerpts follow.

WSJ: How will the risk environment change in the next year or two?

MR. ZAFFINO: Cyber is going to continue to be a more prevalent risk issue. While it started off more in the IT world, it has become a board issue, and the C-suite needs to deal with the complexities of cyberrisk and what are the potential ramifications for the organization in the event of a cyberattack.

WSJ: How would you rate the current environment for risk?

MR. ZAFFINO: A significant factor that makes the complexity of the risk landscape seemingly double every couple of years is the global interconnectedness of risk, how the impact of one risk is increasingly likely to correlate with other risks.

In a Marsh survey of C-suite executives and risk professionals, we asked companies about their ability to forecast emerging business risks -- 48% said this type of forecasting will be significantly harder three years from now, while 26% said it would be about the same.

Recent geopolitical issues are a good example. In Syria, within a span of just five years, we witnessed an extended drought, which led to increased urban migration, which in turn led to increased tensions in the nation's cities, which created conflict and ultimately sparked a civil war. The Syrian civil war started a refugee crisis that is now causing the European Union to question its open border policy and, ultimately, several of its fundamental tenets.

Companies that take a more long-term view are better prepared to deal with some of the short- and medium-termed risks.

They have a discipline from a risk-committee standpoint or an executive group dealing with complicated risk issues.

WSJ: How does a company disseminate its risk message throughout the organization?

MR. ZAFFINO: When the CEO is very proactive about thinking about risk, it becomes part of the DNA of the organization. You're thinking about risk and how you can translate that into opportunity, because it becomes how the organization thinks. Risk isn't a negative, risk is a reality and you have to think about how to position the organization to take advantage of the opportunities.

Collaboration is key to an organization's ability to understand the impact of emerging risks on business strategy decisions. Cross-company collaboration can be fostered in numerous ways by a CEO. For example, making sure that the company's risk committee includes voices from across the entire company, and that the committee's regular agenda includes discussions of broad global trends and how they may manifest as risks inside the organization. These regular meetings allow for the emerging risks to be identified and debated.

CEOs should leverage the power of data and analytics to identify, assess and manage emerging risks -- and share the results. A company's culture also plays a role in the dissemination and buy-in of its risk message. Companies that are rooted in integrity and strive to conduct business with the highest ethical and professional standards already have a built-in advantage when new risks and opportunities inevitably emerge.

WSJ: What are the most common mistakes as companies try to tackle these risk issues?

MR. ZAFFINO: Companies that are thinking cyber is an IT issue, or that it just resides within IT and operations, are not thinking about the risk in a holistic way.

WSJ: How is the current risk environment affecting the risk-management business?

MR. ZAFFINO: In the risk-management field within insurance, in particular, it is very much focusing on policy forms, contracts and modeling. Today I see that modeling is a lot more prevalent in decision making, so I think we're making better decisions, understanding how to learn from data, understanding how to learn from predictive [analytics]. I think it's a much more sophisticated approach than it would have been five to seven years ago.

There are several levels of modeling involved with analytics, including deterministic modeling, which uses claims data to project a company's average expected losses for a given year; and stochastic or probabilistic modeling, which determines how likely a company's losses are to deviate from the expected average. Ultimately, these modeling approaches can be leveraged to determine how much risk a company can tolerate, whether the company is adequately protected against risk, and if the company is getting the expected value from its insurance program and other risk-management efforts.

Analytics is a game-changer. By leveraging a deep pool of data related to claims, exposure and placement across industries, geographies, products and different sizes of companies, senior leaders can access a clear, informed view of future loss potential and volatility. Ultimately, it allows them to evolve to being proactive rather than reactive -- and to turn uncertainty into opportunity.

Nuns With Guns: The Strange Day-to-Day Struggles Between Bankers and Regulators; Lenders are awash in new regulations, and growing armies of rule enforcers are forcing striking changes on banks  internal cultures

SAN DIEGO Among the new federal banking regulations there is one that financial wonks call  TRID," the TILA-Respa Integrated Disclosure rule.

Attendees at a recent training school here for bank compliance staff, who must learn and enforce such rules, said they deciphered TRID's true meaning:  The reason I drink."

The sobering reality of banking in 2016 is that lenders are awash in new regulations, and growing armies of rule-interpreters and enforcers for good or ill are bringing striking changes to banks' internal cultures.

"http://topics.wsj.com/subject/D/dodd-frank-act/6557", passed in the wake of the financial crisis and designed to prevent another, is one of the most complex pieces of legislation ever. At more than 22,200 pages of rules, it is equivalent to roughly 15 copies of  War and Peace" and covers matters from how much capital banks must set aside to how they can advertise.

Those rules and others have spawned a regulatory apparatus that is the fastest-growing component of the financial sector, with "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304163604579531263107487566"whose job is to keep their employers right with the new regime. Federal agencies have dispatched thousands of their own minders to set watch at banks.

The regulatory tightening has helped change the profile of a big bank in the postcrisis era. It now looks more like a utility, subject to complex rules about how it can do business and answering to government watchers whose careers depend on enforcing those rules with vigor.

 The regulatory environment is completely different than it was five years ago," said Greg Imm, chief compliance officer at M&T Bank Corp. in Buffalo, N.Y.,  and you can accept it and move on, or fight it and lose."

While the 2008 meltdown still inspires spirited debates about where to draw the regulatory line, there is general agreement that lack of oversight by regulators and banks contributed to the debacle and consequent government bailout. By some measures, the banking system is safer than it was.

At the same time, there are trade-offs. Banks pulled back from financing areas ranging from student lending to certain types of mortgages. They no longer make bets with their own money, known as proprietary trading, and have collectively ceased working with hundreds of thousands of individual or company accounts.

The heightened regulatory environment led 46% of banks to pare back their offerings for loan accounts, deposit accounts or other services, according to an American Bankers Association survey of compliance officers last year.

It is also costly. The six largest U.S. banks by assets in 2013 together spent at least $70.2 billion that year on regulatory compliance, up from $34.7 billion in 2007, according to the most recent study by policy-analysis firm Federal Financial Analytics Inc., which said costs have continued to mount since then.

Wells Fargo & Co. Chief Executive John Stumpf in an interview with an industry group last year said  one of the real benefits of our regulatory system is a strong, well-capitalized transparent financial services industry." Still, he said:  We need balance, and our nation's leaders have to understand some of the unintended consequences of regulation, which ultimately hurt consumers."

Bank "http://www.wsj.com/articles/for-traders-no-more-privacy-on-the-phone-1442168422" looking for signs of collusion and watching to make sure market bets don't include excess risk. Teams inside banks are devoted to ensuring that mortgage officers are making proper disclosures to borrowers and that advertising offering  free checking" isn't proven false by the fine print. Compliance employees often walk bank executives through rules and explain potential customer impact.

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304763704576394610591065334" sent by branches of the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. More than a dozen other agencies regularly send staff to conduct exams or ask questions.

The dynamic can be maddening for all sides, with regulators, internal compliance executives and employees operating like rival tribes, according to interviews with more than three dozen current and former employees who have worked on these issues inside the country's banks and regulatory agencies.

At a Barclays PLC town hall after Dodd-Frank rules began to go in place, bank compliance executives shared images of how each group thinks of the other, said someone familiar with the meeting. To represent bankers, compliance executives showed an image of the Wild West: cowboys on horses with guns.

* "http://graphics.wsj.com/citi-revenue/"

On the other side, to show how bankers view compliance officials, the executives revealed a picture of nuns carrying guns, an indicator that the group was seen as ultraconservative but still dangerous. Barclays declined to comment.

Each side needs the other, said "http://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-sec-official-gallagher-joins-regulatory-consultant-1451865600", and now president of regulatory consultancy Patomak Global Partners LLC, who has criticized what he calls a  crazy quilt" of regulation.

 The industry is more than ever yearning for guidance and interaction," he said. And  after the crisis, the regulators had a lot of egg on their face as much as the firms," he said, so  the government needs the compliance people in place. They're part of the oversight system."

 Fire warden'

William Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, testified in 2014 before Congress about what he sees as the role of his people:  I think of it more like a fire warden makes sure that the institution is run well so that it's not going to catch on fire and burn down."

Bank executives largely avoid publicly voicing frustrations with the regulatory regime, and most wouldn't comment on the record for this article. In April 2015, Citigroup Inc. Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said on an earnings call:  The cost associated with regulatory and compliance efforts has continued to increase. It's consumed a fairly significant portion of the efficiency savings that we've been generating in the business."

At J.P. Morgan, the nation's largest bank by assets, the head count associated with what it calls  controls," which includes many compliance-related staff, has grown to 43,000 in 2015 from 24,000 in 2011.

Colonial Savings in Fort Worth, Texas, with eight branches, had three to four people in its compliance department two years ago, said Richard Harvey Jr., its chief compliance officer. It now has 14, and  it's very tough to find good compliance help."

Before the crisis, bankers could make decisions more autonomously, said people on all sides. Most viewed compliance officers and regulators as sounding boards. A banker could run into a regulator at a Starbucks and chat informally about lending.

Now, formal and informal rifts are defining features of life in a bank. At one midsize bank in the Western U.S., a compliance officer was reprimanded after complaining about an individual regulator to a colleague in the bathroom, only to find out the regulator had been in a stall. The bank's compliance department now sends a firmwide email before each sensitive regulatory exam, warning employees to watch what they say in shared areas, including bathrooms, said a person familiar with the emails.

Compliance employees serve as middlemen between the regulatory agencies and bank staff, fielding data requests and overseeing exams. They also help test products and services to make sure their banks are following rules and aren't taking unacceptable risk.

That go-between role, some compliance employees said, makes them feel like hallway monitors. A compliance officer at a large bank said that when he approaches employees' offices or cubicles to discuss issues, they usually drop what they are doing, close computer screens and hang up phones.

 They'll get a headache look on their face and rub their temples," he said.  It's not like I'm hated but they know if I show up, there's a problem."

At large banks including Bank of America Corp., Citigroup, J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo & Co. there are as many as 200 examiners on site from different agencies at all times, a number that has swelled by at least 20% over the past several years, bank executives said.

Those outsiders can create predicaments, such as where to seat officials from rival agencies. At J.P. Morgan, New York Fed and OCC staff a few years ago sat on one floor. J.P. Morgan had to separate the groups in part because of infighting, said people familiar with the episode. One set of examiners, they said, didn't want the other to know what they were working on. Both regulatory groups were also expanding their teams and needed more space, they said.

No happy hours

Navigating personal interactions can be a challenge, said Irene Guzman, a compliance officer at International Bank of Commerce in Texas. She describes regulators as  pleasant."

Employees know, though, they can't fraternize with regulators: no lunches, no happy hours, no dinners. If you see them at a restaurant, she said,  you can wave."

Many rules are designed to prevent "http://www.wsj.com/articles/gao-to-probe-regulatory-capture-at-new-york-fed-1457134763" they work near. There used to be few regulators working on-site at banks, and interactions were sparse. After the crisis, on-site examiner roles ballooned across the industry. More recently, some are beginning to pull back on-site examiners in favor of teams looking at multiple firms and conducting regular visits.

Interactions between compliance officers and regulators have become much more formal since the crisis. Before, compliance executives could bump into a regulator in the hall and ask about an exam. Now, the two groups host formal meetings to discuss any issue, with prepared agendas and both sides documenting what is said.

At Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan, in-house regulators have bank email addresses spelling out  EXAMINER" or  CONTRACTOR" to reduce chances employees mistake them for colleagues. J.P. Morgan sometimes scripts out what employees will say before they speak with regulators, said a person familiar with the interactions.

One former Consumer Financial Protection Bureau deputy said he frequently gave his examiners pep talks before sending them into banks, reminding them to  never let it be personal" and not to go in  with a chip on your shoulders."

CFPB spokesman Samuel Gilford said the agency  works closely with our fellow state and federal regulators to ensure that consumer protections are applied consistently across markets."

Regulators sometimes struggle to decipher new rules the same way compliance officers do. Mike Maher, chief compliance officer for Wells Fargo's consumer-lending group until last year, recalls a monthslong discussion between the bank and regulators over whether it should let customers pay ahead on mortgages. And if they did, would the bank consider borrowers delinquent if they later missed a month?

The regulators, themselves unsure of the rules, were hesitant to take a position or provide guidance.  There are no written rules sometimes" about how to interpret the law, said Mr. Maher.  You're in this space of  what is fair?' "

It isn't uncommon for regulators from different agencies to issue conflicting opinions, said some bank employees. Mr. Imm of M&T, who was Fifth Third Bancorp's chief compliance officer until 2014, said one of that bank's regulators requested an exam; two weeks later, another agency requested the same. The agencies came back with different results. After Mr. Imm informed them, they conferred and returned with the same result. Fifth Third declined to comment.

Some of the new corps of watchers get training at operations like the one in San Diego, hosted by the American Bankers Association, where attendees were greeted with a 300-page instruction manual. About 200 students trooped into a room each morning at a DoubleTree hotel, leaving only for snack breaks and lunch.

Attendees learned procedures ranging from properly overseeing an ATM transaction to how to speak with regulators. They learned about new rules such as the October 2015 TILA-Respa rule, for "http://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-backs-borrowers-right-to-rescind-mortgages-1421169619". Also called  Know Before You Owe," it requires more-integrated disclosure forms for consumers at the time of application and settlement.

Instructors made light of the tension between banks and regulators, performing a skit parodying the Wizard of Oz during one class. A male instructor dressed as Dorothy wondered why one of her regulators hadn't told her something.

 Oh you gullible, innocent girl!" replied an instructor dressed as the Wizard.  Don't you know there's no such thing as a good regulator?"

LUMA Capital Partners, New York

LUMA Capital Partners, a firm focused on investments in marketing technology, closed its first fund on an undisclosed amount. The firm was seeking $100 million for LUMA Capital Partners Venture Fund I LP, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

Mayfield, Menlo Park, Calif.

Mayfield raised $525 million across two new funds: a $400 million early-stage fund, Mayfield XV, which is consistent in size and focus with its three previous funds; and a $125 million later-stage fund called Mayfield Select. The Select fund permits Mayfield to reinvest in Mayfield portfolio companies from its 13th, 14th and 15th early-stage funds, which are largely focused on Series A rounds. In some cases, Mayfield will also use the Select fund to co-invest with the 15th fund in companies that are new to Mayfield. Both of Mayfield's funds were oversubscribed, said Mayfield Managing Director Navin Chaddha.

Open Prairie Ventures, Effingham, Ill.

Open Prairie Ventures said it would oversee a $100 million fund formed in partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The Open Prairie Rural Opportunities Fund will invest in food and agriculture businesses, with a focus on crop protection, agricultural production and processing, precision agriculture, and information and data management. The fund is the fourth Rural Business Investment Company the USDA has helped create since 2014 through its Rural Business Investment Program, which aims to provide equity capital in rural communities by licensing funds as RBICs.

The firm expects to invest $15 million to $75 million in companies with at least $10 million in revenue.

venBio Partners, San Francisco

Life sciences investor venBio Partners closed its second strategic fund at $315 million, exceeding a $250 million target. VenBio Global Strategic Fund II LP is anchored by investments from three strategic limited partners: Amgen Inc., Merck & Co. and Baxalta Inc. The firm raised at least $177 million for its previous fund, which was seeking $237 million, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. It is unclear on what amount that fund ultimately closed. VenBio invests across various stages, including early- and late-stage companies. The firm's two strategic funds have invested in 14 companies to date.

Pro Private Markets
VC Focus: Valuation and Exit Concerns Hit IT Sector Investments

By Deborah Gage and Scott Martin

The Wall Street Journal Online
WSJO

As the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite index clawed back in the first quarter from steep declines, venture-capital investors remained cautiously optimistic about bets on information technology in the period.

Venture capitalists seeking a stake in the next Salesforce.com Inc. or other IT megahit injected $3.34 billion into U.S.-based companies in the quarter, a 4% uptick from the same period a year ago.

Tentative venture investments for IT came amid an across-the-board pullback in capital deployed in the first quarter, which slid 25% compared with the fourth quarter.

There were some blockbuster financings in the quarter, too. Among massive venture-capital deals was the $794 million investors put into Magic Leap Inc. The South Florida startup has been in skunkworks development of a head-mounted device to view 3-D imagery that overlays with the real world. Magic Leap's financing was the second largest U.S. venture deal, according to industry tracker VentureSource, a data provider owned by Private Equity Analyst publisher Dow Jones & Co.

Other notable IT-related fundings in the quarter included Thinking Phone Networks Inc.'s $112 million, Skybox Security Inc.'s $96 million and Razer Inc.'s $75 million.

Still, first-quarter declines in software bets overall weighed heavily against broader IT investments, as venture capitalists put less money into software companies in the period.

Software's pullback came as cloud companies and other IT-related businesses traded lower in public markets and spurred valuation concerns for private markets, spooking enterprise technology investors.

 There has been an overreaction in the public market and the venture world around opportunities," said Peter Sonsini, a general partner with New Enterprise Associates.  That said, most of the really exciting stuff is in the cloud."

Software investments declined to $1.84 billion from $2.48 billion in the fourth quarter, a 26% drop. That's also a big slide from the third quarter's $3.37 billion, which was the highest level on record since the dot-com boom, in 2000, according to VentureSource.

A bellwether of broader IT investments, software companies make up the biggest component.

Frozen tech initial public offering markets also weighed heavily on the psyche of venture investors. The first quarter saw not a single new tech issue go public. Shortly after the first quarter, IT company SecureWorks Corp. staged an IPO. The company priced below its expected price range and traded below its IPO price of $14 per share.

Investors and entrepreneurs said there was still too much uncertainty about IPOs, and no one wants to risk being a flop.

Other concerns loom as well, particularly in the political arena. Apttus Corp. co-founder and Chief Executive Kirk Krappe, whose business software company was valued at $1 billion in September, said he'd expected to take his company public this year.  What we all forgot is that it's an election year," he said.

The uncertainty created by the election coupled with a drop in valuations for software-enabled services companies by as much as 50% means Apttus will likely wait it out for an IPO. The timing of an Apttus IPO is more likely the first half of 2017, he said. The company is working with Morgan Stanley and was cautioned by a few bankers.  Any uncertainty is just bad," Mr. Krappe said.

Another issue is price. With the stock market correction in January, valuations of private companies also plunged, according to investment documents and venture capitalists, but entrepreneurs are still adjusting to the idea their companies are worth less than they were before.

The database company Couchbase Inc., which in March raised a $30 million down round, wiped out its valuation gains from 2014 and 2015 and is now back to 2013 levels.

Companies that are overvalued in this climate may be in for a tough slog as the year progresses if they can't raise capital, especially if their valuations top $1 billion. The Wall Street Journal's Billion Dollar Startup Club in May had 87 U.S. companies valued at $1 billion or more.

Despite software's slide, IT investments edged slightly higher in the first quarter to $3.34 billion, up from $3.23 billion in the fourth quarter. Still, that was well below its peak of $4.44 billion in the fourth quarter of 2014.

To be sure, some software startups are having no problem raising capital. Levyx Inc., which makes big-data storage and management software and is less than three years old, raised $5.4 million in Series A funding in just a couple months. The funding closed in mid-March.

 There's still a lot of interest in big data technology like ours," said Chief Operating Officer Luis Morales.  We got an excellent group of investors."

Plus, there are promising tech trends on the horizon. Investors continue to show interest in software's potential for automobiles. Pivotal Software Inc. in May rode off with $253 million in a round of funding that included Ford Motor Co. and Microsoft Corp.

That came after General Motors Co. in March agreed to acquire Cruise Automation Inc. in a deal valued at $1 billion, offering an encouraging sign for software investors.

Software is playing a bigger role in car makers' plans. It has become necessary to compete to provide cars that are more sophisticated and more automated but still operate safely, even when they drive themselves. Cloud-based wireless software updates promise auto makers to head off recalls and upgrade cars, extending their value. The investment in Pivotal vaults its valuation to $2.8 billion.

 As we look at tech and software and how it is opening whole new areas for us to provide experiences for consumers, it is important that we get a level of fluency" in software, said Ford Chief Executive Mark Fields.

Many tech startups, including those in the IT sector, loaded up on capital and may just conserve cash to wait it out for better times.

There are those, too, that are quietly growing and running profitably. These companies can weather tough times and will be fine, said Industry Ventures Managing Director Hans Swildens at a WSJ Pro Venture Capital event in San Francisco in April.

These companies just don't talk about it, said Mr. Swildens.  Why should they?"

Mizuho builds war chest to target fintech opportunities

Mizuho Financial Group is building up a pot of money for global acquisitions of financial technology companies as Japan's second-biggest bank attempts to leapfrog its local rivals after years of industry torpor.

Despite its strong position in consumer technology, Japan has lagged behind its global peers in harnessing the so-called "fintech" wave of digital disruption in banking. The country's lenders, felled by the bursting of the bubble in the 1990s, have long lost their appetite for risk and continue to struggle as negative interest rates erode profits from bread-and-butter lending.

In an interview with the Financial Times, Mizuho president Yasuhiro Sato described plans to build the next generation of consumer lending on smartphone services and using "big data" analysis to manage credit risk.

Further down the line targets include peer-to-peer lending and investment "robo-advisers", he said.

Mizuho is targeting US acquisitions in artificial intelligence and "big data" processing. "We currently have several targets . . . some of the deals will be done this year," said Mr Sato.

"The key issue is speedy decision making, and the fact that I myself will decide on the acquisition. That is a weapon for us."

Like Japan's other megabanks - Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFG) and Sumitomo Mitsui (SMFG) - Mizuho's share price has been dragged down by the Bank of Japan's negative interest rate policy.

Although Mizuho has not disclosed the size of its fund, it is expected to be about $50m-$100m and to expand this year. Banking law is due to be amended to allow Japanese lenders to exceed the limit of 5 per cent voting rights in a non-financial company.

Fintech companies fall into this non-financial category, stymying attempts by Japanese banks to participate in a global flurry of investment into fintech start-ups that analysts say surpassed $10bn last year.

"If you don't have to open a physical branch network to do consumer lending for these people [the smartphone generation], you can make money from them," said Mr Sato.

Bitcoin companies come of age; start moaning about unfair playing fields

Blockchain/fintech/bitcoin conferences are ten a penny these days, and we don t mean to bore you with the minutiae of what went on at yet another one. But there was one thing that came out of a "http://www.istanbultalks.com.tr/fintech/en/" we attended in Istanbul this week that does bear noting.

We ll call it the coming age of bitcoin companies, by way of the moan factor.

On a 30-minute panel with Paul Gordon*, CEO of Quantave, Kristen Stone, head of partnerships at Coinbase, and Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of BitX   and in the context of a conference where moaning about compliance and regulatory costs was kinda de rigeur for all parties involved   we heard a lot about the regulatory environment. The following is a summary and by no means a verbatim account of what went on, but the sentiment is faithful.

What s the problem? An idiosyncratic market is not an efficient market

Bitcoin s free market structure has opened the door to an unprecedented amount of fintech innovation. In an extremely short space of time, an endless array of exchanges, wallets, analytics firms, payment processors and investment companies has sprung up specialising in making bitcoin accessible to the average person. But it s also created chaos. Without industry standards or a single regulatory framework, companies really do end up doing whatever they want, cultivating a disjointed market structure where consumers never know what to expect. Caveat emptor squared for you and me.

The irony of all this is that in liquidity terms it s the antithesis of an efficient network.

So yes, once you get into bitcoin s closed system, it s a smooth ride   albeit only for those well versed enough in IT stuff to be able to manage their keys securely (and even bitcoin s own founder has famously had key issues). But getting in or out of the closed system involves navigating a Wild West environment where nothing, as far as the punter is concerned, can be presumed   not least liquidity.

Most of the major exchanges, broker dealers or wallet managers facilitating entry and exit into bitcoin do so as classical intermediaries. Customers don t hold bitcoins but rather these companies  liabilities. It s deposit taking by any stretch of the imagination ( "http://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/business/dealbook/mt-gox-creditors-seek-trillions-where-there-are-only-millions.html" ahem) with all the same fractional reserving incentives and counterparty risks, which come with it. The difference is, without any regulatory consensus on reserve limits or credit risk, no-one can really be sure of the risks being taken. There s no disclosure.

Coinbase, for example, will not say what percentage of transactions it processes on an  off chain  basis   the nomenclature used by the cryptocurrency faithful for off bitcoin balance sheet transactions, aka, fractional reserving, aka internalisation, aka netting, aka history repeating itself.

Since liquidity remains the central factor determining usability and cost of service, it s no surprise a market structure made up of opaque and uncooperative dealers, all boasting varying risk and credit standards, leads to a costly web of non-interoperable systems. With that come arbitrage chasms, reflecting the cost of cashing out real value from bitcoins transferred from one closed system to another.

Cue Paul Gordon s "http://www.quantave.com/" which touts itself as a CLS-type solution for alleviating the idiosyncrasies   a.k.a a continuous linked settlement system which would act like a trusted third party for all members, aggregating liquidity in the process. The irony is, for a CLS type system to work it would need all subscribing members to agree to minimum standards, reserves and risk requirements just like in the real world. History and self-regulation repeating itself once again.

What s the problem? Fractional reserving

We know about bitcoin s scaling challenges and how opinion is split on whether the system should stay as it is   using a fee structure to prioritise and order transactions   or  fork  to allow larger block sizes to be processed.

A fee structure, critics say, would make bitcoin transactions prohibitively expensive. On the flip side, simply increasing the blocksize would create uncertainties over how the underlying costs of the network are funded.

A fork, however, could also be used to bolt additional clearling layers onto the bitcoin network, allowing private networks to "http://lightning.network/how-it-works/", so that only the differentials are processed through the core bitcoin blockchain, freeing up capacity. These private networks, it is further envisioned, would use minimum reserve requirements and escrow arrangements to protect each other against systemic deficits. The reserves, it is believed, would be the skin in the game needed to enforce compliance with the master bitcoin chain. So, history repeating itself (as far as the existing financial industry is concerned.)

The only difference is, if things don t square off continuously with the master chain, the transaction fails, the deficit entity is forced to scrounge for capital from surplus parties   and if they re not obliging he goes bankrupt. There is no lender of last resort and thus no moral hazard factor, either. The network is self-funding with reserves.

Except, as we have learned from conventional markets, what s really stopping a rival network boasting lower reserve requirements and poorer credit criteria from running its own off-shooting system for the purpose of grabbing market share?

What the dispute really amounts to, we think, is the eternal narrow banking/fractional reserve dispute all over. We won t revive the details of that "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/34cbca0c-ad28-11de-9caf-00144feabdc0.html". But we do think it s funny that even in bitcoin the divide remains between the full reserve radicals (those who would rather their economy was stifled in the name of keeping idle assets unencumbered and positive yielding) and the fractional reservists (those who understand trust must be distributed and money expanded in line with the demands of the real economy if the system is to remain lubricated, but in doing so are inadvertently remaking the standing system.)

What s the problem? Unfair playing fields

Many of the established bitcoin exchanges and broker dealers have come to realise that quality control, risk management and general jurisprudence is essential for creating a sustainable and user friendly bitcoin system. As a consequence they ve come to appreciate regulation (whether instituted by government or industry) isn t really the enemy. To the contrary regulation is their friend   albeit only until someone who doesn t understand this comes along, undercuts them on standards, and sabotages the business for everyone.

Cue the woes of Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of BitX. He s worked hard to create a responsible, risk focused, KYC/AML compliant exchange in South Africa. In accordance with that mission, the company recently took the bold step of blocking accounts associated with the MMM ponzi scheme. A pat on the back for BitX for taking KYC seriously. But, as it happens, also a major shot in the foot. The move, says Swanepoel, has lost his exchange valuable market share because in no time at all new entities have sprang up to pick up the discarded business.

Swanepoel feels hard done by because here he is trying to do the right thing, instituting standards and rules, but gets burned anyway because there s no end of parties who have no qualms about acting less scrupulously. He says the result is unfair playing field. Though he thankfully acknowledges this is no doubt how the regulated banks felt about his business.

What s the problem? Small is unregulated and beautiful, but nobody wants to be small

In fintech, the smaller you are the easier it is to benefit from regulatory arbitrage. For the most part, this isn t a huge issue. If you re small, there s not that much damage you can do. And if you re unlikely to be hugely damaging, you re unlikely to be systemically risky. On that basis, it is plausibly unfair for a small entity to be regulated as strictly as a too big to fail institution.

There s only one problem with that set up. Most fintech start-ups don t aspire to stay small. They aspire to get big and to get big very quickly   not least because that s what the VCs which funded them expect. At the same time, ask these startups if they re likely to be profitable in an environment where they were to be regulated as fiercely as banks, and most will confess the answer is a probable no. Herein lies the paradox.

The success of these firms is directly linked to their small size and their capacity to operate under the regulatory radar. Some do boast viable business models, but often only for as long as they stay small. The smaller and more idiosyncratic the market, however (see the first problem), the greater the cost of intermediation and the greater the need for industry-wide harmonisation. The more harmonisation, however, the greater the potential returns from free-loading on the cooperation of others without complying with the rules directly yourself. And thus the cycle repeats ad infinitum.

Additional notes and caveats:

One of the biggest critcisms of a "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/34cbca0c-ad28-11de-9caf-00144feabdc0.html" is its incapacity to keep up with the rate at which trade and transaction occurs in the real world, and its inability to allocate capital efficiently. Narrow banking by definition demands that only highly liquid money is allowed to be used for final settlement. But efficient capital allocation doesn t work unless some portion of capital is permanently locked up in risky projects and by that process made temporarily inaccessible. It stands to reason, as a consequence, if liquid money alone is allowed to settle transactions, the system must keep a permanent surplus in reserve to ensure liquidity can be maintained on tap. But this by definition can t be available to everyone. Nor can it be permanently reinvested in the system in such a way that ensures the preservation of existing capital but also its growth.

As the FT s Martin Wolf "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/34cbca0c-ad28-11de-9caf-00144feabdc0.html#axzz49sdQXe8X" with respect to the risks of instituting a narrow banking system:

Here there are two opposing risks. The first is that the supply of funds to riskier, long-term activities would be greatly reduced if we did adopt narrow banking. Against this, one might argue that, with public sector debt used to back the liabilities of narrow banks, investors would be forced to find other such assets.

The opposite (and greater) risk is that the fragility of banking would be re-invented, via  quasi-banks . This is what has just happened, after all, with  shadow banking . In the end, those entities, too, have been rescued. The big point is that a financial structure characterised by short-term and relatively risk-free liabilities and longer-term and riskier assets is highly profitable, until it collapses, as it is rather likely to do.

Update: An earlier version of this post incorrectly named the CEO of Quantave as Paul Donovan instead of Paul Gordon.

Bregal Sagemount said it acquired a majority stake in Discovery Data Inc., a provider of data on the retail financial service industry, from Ipreo LLC.

Hunton & Williams LLP advised Bregal Sagemount on the transaction, the financial terms of which weren't disclosed in a news release.

As part of the deal, Discovery Data acquired Meridian-IQ, a New York provider of online databases and adviser market information, from AIQ Inc.

The acquisition of Meridian-IQ expands Discovery Data's client coverage to nearly 900 institutions and more than 20,000 users across asset managers, wealth managers, custodians, clearing firms, insurance companies and service providers.

The deal was a result of a relationship between Discovery Data and Meridian-IQ forged over a number of years, said Arjun Mehta, a senior associate at Bregal Sagemount.

Discovery Data provides access to all broker dealers and registered investment advisers, including more than 680,000 reps, 2,300 trust companies and 1.8 million insurance agents, according to the release. The Eatontown, N.J. company also provides a  data hygiene" program and the Salesforce CRM data-integration app, among other services.

Ipreo, of New York, provides financial services technology data and analytics services.

Mr. Mehta said Bregal Sagemount plans to help the company grow organically as well as consider possible acquisitions of businesses that have similar data sets or complementary data.

The New York firm was interested in the companies because of their place in the data market for insurance or registered investment advisers, as their numbers are rising, Mr. Mehta said.

 The market is shifting in a direction that a merger of these two companies would form a strong market leader," he said.

Bregal Sagemount invests in business and consumer services, health-care information technology, financial technology, digital infrastructure and software. The firm typically invests $8 million to $30 million for credit transactions and $15 million to $75 million in equity investments. Bregal Sagemount targets companies with annual revenue of $15 million to $250 million.

The firm is investing from Bregal Sagemount I LP fund, which has $650 million of commitment capital, according to the firm's website.

Bregal Sagemount is the growth-equity business of Bregal Investments, the private-equity investment operation of Cofra Holding AG, an European holding company for a closely held group of businesses.

Intel Capital led a $20 million Series C round in Lightbend Inc., whose software helps developers build fast applications that can run on mobile devices or cloud-based clusters and manage large volumes of data.

Lightbend changed its name from Typesafe in February and has broadened its business beyond the Scala programming language, which was created by one of Typesafe's founders.

Intel's and Lightbend's relationship began when Intel built a big data streaming framework on top of Lightbend-supported software so it could monitor data streams and understand where errors were, said Intel Capital Managing Director Ken Elefant.

Lightbend will be introduced to Intel's global network of corporate chief information officers, Mr. Elefant said, and it will also work with Intel's software and services group on issues such as fast compilation of apps.

Current investors Bain Capital Ventures, Polytech Ecosystem Ventures and Shasta Ventures also participated in the round. Greylock Partners, which was Typesafe's original investor, did not participate.

As part of the funding, Intel Capital Director of Enterprise Software Vibhor Rastogi joins Lightbend's board. Lightbend has now raised about $37 million.

Chinese Investors Pour Money Into U.S. Property; China Life Insurance teams with U.S. developer to purchase Manhattan office tower that houses UBS

Commercial property sales have slowed in the U.S. this year but Chinese investors are continuing to plow money into the market.

So far in 2016, Chinese companies have purchased or are buying 47 U.S. properties worth $9.3 billion, according to deal tracker Real Capital Analytics. That makes them the most active foreign buyers in the U.S., with more than double Canada's $4.2 billion worth of deals.

By contrast, for all of last year Chinese investors did 71 U.S. deals worth $6 billion.

Chinese investment abroad has soared as the Chinese economy has slumped over the past year. Investors are looking abroad to protect their wealth against the volatility at home, analysts said.

* "http://www.wsj.com/articles/will-fannie-and-freddie-need-another-bailout-1464118496"

 They're parking more capital in the safe locations in the West," said Jim Costello, senior vice president with Real Capital.

In the most recent high-profile transaction, China Life Insurance Group Co. last week provided an unspecified piece of the equity toward the purchase of the Manhattan office tower at 1285 Sixth Ave. in New York, according to people familiar with the matter. A venture led by developer Scott Rechler including China Life paid $1.65 billion for the 1.8 million-square-foot building, whose tenants include UBS Group AG and the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison.

Mr. Rechler said his firm, RXR Realty LLC, attracted participation from institutional investors because it was able to convince UBS, which occupies about half of the building's space, to renew its commitment through 2032. Other investors were wary of buying the building as long as UBS's status was uncertain, especially with signs cropping up of a market slowdown.

 That chilled other investors," Mr. Rechler said.

The Chinese are streaming into the U.S. even as overall deal activity slows. In the four months of 2016, all investors purchased $135.9 billion worth of commercial property, compared with $171.4 billion during the same period last year, Real Capital said.

The slowdown comes six years into a bull market for commercial property. Many investors have moved to the sidelines because they believe values, which have risen steadily since 2009, might level off or even begin falling.

Debt financing also has become more difficult to obtain. As of May 10, Wall Street has issued just $28.5 billion in commercial mortgage-backed securities, compared with $44.1 billion during the same time last year, according to Commercial Mortgage Alert, a trade publication.

But buyers from Asia, the Middle East and other parts of the world often are more motivated than domestic U.S. investors. Many are eager to diversify. Others are concerned about risk in their own countries.

Until 2012, the Chinese government prohibited the country's insurance companies from buying foreign property. With those restrictions lifted they are flexing their muscles throughout the world.

Last year, China Life made its first U.S. investment along with Ping An Insurance Co. They purchased a majority stake in a $500 million Boston development in the city's popular Seaport District.

Mr. Costello said foreign investors used to focus on buying trophy assets such as New York's Waldorf Astoria hotel, but lately have been expanding out of downtowns in top cities in a search for higher yields. Last week, the sovereign-wealth fund of Bahrain purchased a 49% stake in a portfolio of seven office buildings between Phoenix and Dallas. The deal valued the 1.2 million-square-foot portfolio at about $250 million.

Mr. Rechler, for his part, has garnered a reputation as a good market timer. He sold his earlier real-estate company for $6.5 billion in early 2007 as storm clouds were forming over the economy and then started buying property just as the market began to recover in mid-2009. His RXR Realty controls 87 commercial properties and had $12.7 billion of assets under management as of the end of last year.

Mr. Rechler initially wasn't interested in 1285 Sixth Ave. when it was put on the market last year by J.P. Morgan Asset Management and AXA Financial Inc. But he began talks after he came up with a plan to add value to the property by extending UBS's lease.

To execute that plan, Mr. Rechler first had to deal with UBS's neighbor, Paul, Weiss, which had an option to take more space in the building. As long as that option hung out there, UBS wouldn't renew.

Mr. Rechler eliminated that problem by cutting a deal with the law firm to modify its expansion option. He also agreed to sell some Paul, Weiss partners stakes in the building, according to people familiar with the matter.

Besides China Life, Mr. Rechler's group included New York developer David Werner, who at one point was competing against Mr. Rechler for the property. J.P. Morgan and AXA were represented by Doug Harmon and Adam Spies of Eastdil Secured.

Health Plans Turn to Data Analysis Startups for Help With Disease Prevention

Health insurers that have struggled to curb rates of chronic illnesses are turning for help to innovative data-analysis startups.

Diseases such as Type 2 diabetes, which affects around 30 million Americans, have grown more common despite intensive efforts by health plans and employers to steer people toward healthier lifestyles.

But through more robust data-analysis innovations, insurers and other groups believe they can target their prevention programs more effectively by heading off health problems before they can emerge in the first place.

Health insurer Horizon Healthcare Services Inc. has just joined a Series C financing for GNS Healthcare, which uses its technology to identify risks in people and then match them with specific preventive tactics. Medicare Advantage plans are turning to cognitive-computing technology from Apixio Inc., which has just closed a $19.3 million Series D round, to gain insights into chronic conditions of their members.

Meanwhile, cognitive-computing company Digital Reasoning Systems Inc. is helping health-care providers identify patients at risk for serious medical conditions. The company disclosed a $40 million Series D round earlier this month.

Early efforts to guide large populations of people to better health were broad-based and treated people as if they were all the same, according to GNS Healthcare Chief Executive Colin Hill. Today, insurers and other groups can mine various types of data to develop more tailored programs. Information sources can include electronic-health records, insurance claims data, genomics data, and data from mobile-health devices.

GNS, which is collaborating with Horizon Healthcare, applies its causal machine-learning technology to various data sources. The goal is to identify cause-and-effect relationships and match someone at risk for a condition with an intervention most likely to work for that person, according to Mr. Hill.

More precise targeting doesn't guarantee the success of large health programs. Health plans, employers and other groups must develop effective interventions. Given the cost of treating diabetes and other diseases that affect people for many years, there is an incentive to make these efforts pay off.

Pizza Hut Asia Tests Robots

By Kim S. Nash

Copyright  2016, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 

The next battle in the pizza techology wars has dawned as Pizza Hut Asia announced Tuesday that it will test an order-taking robot that uses artificial intelligence to interact with customers. Rival Domino's Pizza Inc. said in March that it is testing an autonomous vehicle for delivering pies to customers in Australia.

With Pizza Hut Asia, MasterCard announced that it is has embedded its MasterPass mobile wallet into the robot, dubbed Pepper, that the pizza chain plans to test in an undetermined number of restaurants in Japan.

The move is part of MasterCard's effort to integrate its digital wallet and other payment technology into numerous Internet-connected devices. The company early this year worked with Samsung Electronics Co. to launch a connected refrigerator that includes an app from MasterCard to reorder groceries as they run low. Last year, MasterCard worked with Whirlpool to build washers and dryers for Laundromats and dormitories that can be controlled by mobile app and paid for with MasterCard's Qkr mobile payments system.

Pizza Hut Asia, owned by Yum Brands, plans to test the robot Pepper in stores by the end of the year. MasterCard and Pizza Hut Asia haven't yet decided how many stores will participate, a MasterCard spokeswoman said. As customers approach and speak to Pepper, the robot can read facial expressions and understand natural language. The robot was developed by SoftBank Robotics Corp. in Tokyo. SoftBank didn't respond to an email request for an interview.

Domino's announced early this year that it is testing an autonomous vehicle, called Domino's Robotic Unit, to deliver pizza in Australia. DRU interacts with customers through lights on a display and navigates around obstacles on footpaths and roads. The pizza companies have long battled on the technology front, including promoting smart watches, connected cars and retinal scanning for order and delivery.

Internet connected machines, including wearable devices and robots, can help companies personalize service in retail stores and other venues by accessing data about customers and applying algorithms to make tailored offers on the spot, said Betty DeVita, chief commercial officer of MasterCard Labs, in an interview. By experimenting with robots, MasterCard hopes to learn how customers react to the technology and whether they begin to conduct financial transactions with the machines, Ms. DeVita said.

"Our interest is in exploring and understanding how a humanoid robot can deliver better in-store transactions and payment experiences," she said.

The number of Internet of Things devices is expected to jump to 21 billion by 2020, from about 6.4 billion today, according to Gartner. But there are few standards for security and interoperability for the devices, leading some observers to worry about vulnerability to hackers. Ms. DeVita sees potential in Pepper and other connected hardware as vehicles for commerce. Pepper, for example, can use facial recognition systems to judge a customer's mood and perhaps offer add-on products, trying to capitalize on how the customer is feeling. MasterCard plans to study the Pizza Hut transactions to see if there is an increase in order size for customers who interact with the robot, she said.

Lenders trim budgets for maths and models; Banks: Capital incentives

Regulatory crackdown is stripping away the financial benefits of measuring risk

Banks are cutting back their nine-figure budgets for PhDs and complicated risk software ahead of a regulatory clampdown on lenders that use models to make themselves look safer and reduce their capital needs.

Investment banks have been spending up to  150m a year building and maintaining complex internal models to measure risk in areas ranging from deadbeat homeowners to interest rate rises and market movements.

The models help lenders spot looming problems, but up to now they have also come with big financial benefits. In the years before the financial crisis, global regulators rewarded institutions that could show a better understanding of risk by allowing them to hold less capital against their lending and trading.

Now those benefits are fading fast, as policymakers at the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision (BCBS) strip away the capital advantages of using many of the models.

"Part of the . . . philosophy was to incentivise banks to have better risk modelling methodologies through capital," says Andrs Portilla, head of regulation at industry group the Institute of International Finance. "That has been abandoned."

Policymakers changed their mind after the financial crisis. The wide variation in banks' risk calculations stoked fears that some lenders were gaming the system to look less risky.

The Basel group has already banned the use of internal models for calculating operational risk, and it is reducing the capital benefits that banks can get from using their own models to calculate the riskiness of securities and loans.

"The banks say that if everything is going to be standardised, why spend a lot of resources to maintain the models that inform the advanced approach," says Guy Moszkowski, New York-based analyst at Autonomous.

Right now most large banks use internal models to calculate at least some of their risk-weighted assets - essentially computer programs assign risk scores to the loans and securities that each lender holds, with 100 per cent being the highest.

Individual banks use quite different calculations, although some of it has to do with their mix of assets: home loans have much lower risk scores than products like derivatives.

UBS's RWAs are just 25 per cent of its total assets, while Goldman Sachs's are 67 per cent of total assets, according to banks' published numbers adjusted for different accounting treatments.

The differences matter because RWAs, rather than total assets, are used to calculate common equity capital ratios, the most important measure of a bank's safety and soundness.

Investment banks with extensive internal model capabilities could spend anything from  50m- 150m a year maintaining them, according to Donal Gallagher, head of Quaternion Risk Management, a risk analytics firm working on behalf of large banks. That figure captures the headcount and IT costs, but not one-off costs like new regulatory initiatives.

No one thinks that models will be eliminated altogether, since they still carry a real economic benefit, and regulators want them preserved for bank safety reasons.

But bank executives, traders and modellers all believe that the bar to clear for investment in future models will be higher.

A senior executive at a large European bank said it was "inevitable" that banks would do less modelling over time "to the extent that internal models don't give you a [capital] advantage".

Mr Gallagher estimates that a bank that now spends  100m annually could save about  40m a year. "That's a conservative estimate, the true savings could be higher," he adds.

"Then there is the additional reduced cost of a more straightforward implementation of . . . regulatory initiatives in the future."

Total operating costs for a midsized investment bank are about  4bn a year. Large US and European banks declined to comment on their plans.

But cutbacks are particularly attractive in a market where investment banks face plunging trading revenues and a slow market for new floats and dealmaking.

The European bank executive argues that regulators "haven't thought through" the longer-term consequences of their decisions which he believes will encourage banks to "spend less time identifying the risk and more time thinking about the capital".

Regulators argue that banks still have to manage their risks, so they will invest in modelling even without the capital benefits. One stresses that what they are trying to eliminate is "aggressive modelling" not modelling altogether.

The IIF's Mr Portilla says a key question is whether banks need financial incentives to build risk models.

"The answer is yes and no," he says. "'No' in the sense all banks perfectly know that they need to assess risks in the correct way.

"But in today's world regulatory capital incentives within organisations do drive behaviour, do drive pricing, do drive portfolio composition," he adds. "We can pretend that doesn't happen but in reality it is a key factor."

March Capital Partners, a two-year-old firm based in Southern California, closed its first fund at $240 million.

The firm did a first close on the fund in late 2014 and said it has already invested more than $100 million in more than 15 companies.

 We still think the classic A, B, C rounds &are a great place to invest if you have the experience to do so," said Managing Director Jim Armstrong.

The four founders of "http://www.marchcp.com", which is based in Santa Monica, Calif., have a variety of experiences. Mr. Armstrong started 21 years ago as an associate at Austin Ventures. He later went to Idealab Capital Partners and Clearstone Venture Partners, where he is still helping to wind down an old fund.

March Capital's other founding partners are Sumant Mandal, who is also wrapping up at Clearstone and is based in India; Jamie Montgomery, who founded the Montgomery & Co. investment bank and runs the Montgomery Summit, a Southern California investor conference; and Gregory Milken, a board member of the Milken Institute and the Milken Family Foundation.

In addition to investing in companies, March Capital has invested in "http://hivedata.com/", a Palo Alto, Calif.-based big data incubator, and "http://www.thefabricnet.com/", a cloud infrastructure incubator with offices in Mountain View, Calif., and India. In addition to big data, March Capital invests in areas including digital security, enterprise software and marketing technologies.

Although Southern California is a smaller market for tech companies than Northern California, the southern region is growing in prominence, according to Mr. Montgomery.

Southern California universities graduate more engineers, the cost of living is lower and  the lifestyles are great," he said.  This is the first time I've seen a migration of talent" from north to south.

Limited partners of March Capital's fund, called March Capital Partners Fund I L.P., include unnamed family offices and institutions, Mr. Armstrong said.

Tribune Sells 13% Stake to Ally

Tribune Publishing Co. rejected Gannett Co.'s latest takeover offer and said a billionaire health-care entrepreneur would take a $70.5 million stake in the company, adding another hurdle to Gannett's pursuit.

Tribune said it would receive a capital investment from Nant Capital LLC, which was founded by medical doctor and investor Patrick Soon-Shiong, in return for 4.7 million shares of Tribune stock at $15 apiece -- the price Gannett had proposed in its sweetened bid.

After the investment, Nant Capital will own about 12.9% of Tribune's shares outstanding, making it the company's second-largest shareholder.

If Gannett's offer remains at its current level, the issuance of shares would make Tribune more expensive for Gannett. Its previous offer valued Tribune at about $475 million, and it would presumably now have to purchase Dr. Soon-Shiong's additional shares, which could push the total cost of the company up nearly 15%.

Oaktree Capital Management, which had been Tribune's second-largest shareholder before Dr. Soon-Shiong's investment, said in a regulatory filing that Tribune Chairman Michael Ferro Jr. asked the company Friday if it would sell its stake, which totals 4.7 million shares according to FactSet, to an unidentified party at $15 a share.

Oaktree, which publicly has urged the company to negotiate with Gannett, rejected the offer, saying it "believed that a better price than $15 per share would be available if the Tribune board would engage constructively with Gannett."

In an interview, Dr. Soon-Shiong said he was approached within the past month by members of the Tribune board, but he declined to offer specifics. A person familiar with the matter said Dr. Soon-Shiong was approached about the investment in the past week by Mr. Ferro.

Mr. Ferro, through his prior work in the medical-software industry, had been acquainted with Dr. Soon-Shiong and knew that he previously had expressed interest in possibly acquiring the Los Angeles Times.

During a trip to California to meet with people about possibly investing in Tribune, Mr. Ferro reached out to the doctor, another person familiar with the matter said. The Los Angeles Business Journal had reported in September that Dr. Soon-Shiong was interested in buying the Times.

Gannett, meanwhile, signaled on Monday that it could abandon its bid if not enough Tribune shareholders indicate support for a tie-up, saying it would wait until after Tribune's June 2 annual shareholder meeting to decide whether to continue the pursuit.

Gannett has urged Tribune shareholders to show support for the deal by withholding votes for Tribune's eight directors.

Tribune's stock fell 15% to $12.09 in Monday trading, casting doubts over a Gannett deal at $15 a share. Shares of Gannett fell 2.4% to $15.74.

In rebuffing the offer, Tribune Chief Executive Justin Dearborn on Monday said he has "serious doubts" about Gannett's proposal, but "we stand ready to work with Gannett to assess whether there is a path forward that will create more value for both sets of shareholders."

Tribune said it had invited Gannett to seek an agreement under which the companies could engage in discussions to see whether a transaction was in the best interests of shareholders.

Gannett, in its statement on Monday, said: "Tribune has been in possession of a customary nondisclosure agreement provided by Gannett for more than a month."

Mr. Dearborn said the investment "demonstrates strong support for our plan and provides additional capital to accelerate our growth strategies for the benefit of our shareholders and all other Tribune stakeholders."

Dr. Soon-Shiong won't be able to vote his new shares at the company's annual meeting; shareholders need to have owned their stock by the close of business on April 15 to vote.

Dr. Soon-Shiong has been invited to join the company's board as a vice chairman. He will begin serving on June 2 -- the day of the annual meeting.

"Tribune again changed the composition of its board without stockholder participation," Gannett said in a statement.

Dr. Soon-Shiong, who launched and sold two biotech startups together worth nearly $8 billion, heads a firm that funds ventures related to health care, life sciences, medical diagnostics, mobile technology, semiconductors, nano-optics, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, alternative energy and scientific innovations. He said his professional background in artificial intelligence and his longtime interest in journalism happened to collide at the right moment.

"I think it's an opportunity to really benefit the local community with a medium that I think should be protected as a natural treasure," Dr. Soon-Shiong said. "I think there's a mutual benefit to both of us."

As part of the deal, Tribune will have access to more than 100 technology patents from Dr. Soon-Shiong's NantWorks LLC for use in news-media applications.

Asset managers step up 'smart beta' rivalry; Financial services

Takeover pace builds as niche is predicted to grow to $2.4tn by 2025

The jostling for territory in the swelling " smart beta " investment industry has heated up in recent weeks, with a flurry of acquisitions by asset managers that fear losing out in the next big battleground for investor money.

In a spate of deals established money managers have acquired stakes or bought so-called smart-beta providers, and BlackRock has predicted that the niche will grow from about $282bn to $2.4tn by 2025.

Hundreds of billions of dollars have seeped out of asset managers' traditional mutual funds into passive index-tracking and exchange traded funds that aim to give investors a return linked to an underlying market - or "beta" in finance industry parlance.

With the first-generation passive investment industry dominated by three companies - State Street, Vanguard and BlackRock - many groups are making a play for the smaller and more fragmented smart-beta world, where financial engineers tweak indices and investment rules to beat the returns of the broader market passively. The latest deal came last week, when Hartford Funds, a $74bn asset manager, acquired Lattice Strategies, a San Francisco-based smart-beta company with $215m under management.

It followed Columbia Threadneedle buying Emerging Global Advisors earlier in May, and JPMorgan Asset Management buying a stake in Global X, a New York smart beta ETF provider with more than $3bn in assets. Last year Oppenheimer bought VTL Associates and Legg Mason acquired QS Investors.

Many of the deals are small but they give smart beta ETF providers the vast distribution platforms of the established asset managers, while the acquirers get a toehold in an area of investment management that many expect to grow in the coming years.

Other companies are attempting to expand their smart beta ETF businesses organically rather than get a jump-start via acquisition. Fidelity last month filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a suite of smart beta ETFs, while Franklin Templeton last year hired a former BlackRock executive to build its own business.

"The rise of smart beta - propelled by advances in technology and data analytics - is helping to democratise factor investing, putting investment solutions once only accessible to large institutions within the reach of all investors," Andrew Ang, head of factor investing strategies at BlackRock, said in a recent report on the industry.

Nonetheless, some experts and asset managers remain critical, concerned that investors are blindly rushing into products they do not fully understand or that could lead to market distortions.

Andreas Utermann, chief investment officer of Allianz Global Investors, has argued that "smart beta is neither smart nor beta", and Rob Arnott, head of Research Affiliates, warned that there could even be a " smart beta crash ".

Technology likely to cause huge disruption to the fund industry

Asset management insiders believe blockchain, the nascent technology behind bitcoin , the controversial digital currency, will cause huge disruption to how the fund industry operates, prompting significant changes to its business model.

Blockchain, which is a giant, online public ledger, was developed to keep track of who owns bitcoins and who owned them in the past. But now the fund industry is examining how it could use the technology.

Proponents say blockchain will revoluntise the finance industry. They believe it could eradicate the need for clearing and settlement , the long-standing process whereby ownership of a security is moved from one investor to another. This could mean fund managers and banks would need fewer staff for some roles, while investors would probably benefit from lower fees.

Asset managers, including a cohort of UK managers, are also looking into employing the technology to trade directly with each other, cutting out traditional middlemen such as brokers and bringing their costs down in the process.

According to a survey of 125 asset management professionals across fund houses, custodian banks and consultancies, blockchain is expected to be a very disruptive force within the fund industry.

Asked which areas of financial technology will have the biggest impact on the fund industry, 42 per cent of those polled listed blockchain, while 43 per cent nominated big-data analytics, where large sets of information are analysed to uncover market trends or other useful information.

In contrast, only a fifth listed robo-advisers , which provide automated online investment services.

Keith Hale, executive vice-president for client and business development at Multifonds, the software provider that carried out the survey, says the possibility of blockchain disrupting so many different parts of the asset management industry has left many concerned.

"There is quite a lot of the fear of the unknown with blockchain," he says.

Michelle Seitz, head of William Blair Investment Management, the $64.7bn US asset manager, says: "I do believe that [blockchain] has the power to disrupt the plumbing of the asset management industry, and if it does, it will speed the service and the delivery of what we do for the client, and cut out costs.

"It could be a massive disrupter to the industry, but in a good way."

The fund industry is still trying to get to grips with the impact blockchain could have. Experts say it is difficult to understand the wider implications of the technology.

Olivia Vinden, principal at Alpha FMC, the consultancy, says that as well as having the potential to eradicate the traditional settlement process, blockchain could also be used across other functions in the fund industry.

This could include providing a new way for asset managers to interact with regulators or helping to prevent money laundering by making it easier for asset managers to keep track of their investors.

"Blockchain could be totally transformative for the [fund] industry, both in how it operates and in terms of costs," says Ms Vinden.

Richard Hinton, a partner at KPMG, the professional services firm, says it is likely to take some time before blockchain's impact is seen in the fund industry.

"There is a still a lot of work to be done before it is adopted in a widespread fashion," he adds.

Advances in artificial intelligence  attract the money managers

In 1957 Frank Rosenblatt and the eggheads of the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory invented the "Perceptron", a machine that the New York Times wrote could be "the embryo of an electronic computer that [the Navy] expects will be able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence". In short, artificial intelligence.

The clunky, wire-laden Perceptron turned out to be a damp squib. Humans are still far from producing the kind of intelligent, conscious machines made famous by the movie industry. The occasional breakthrough has periodically spurred excitement that eventually dissolved into cynicism. There has been a lot of progress, but mostly in "narrow" AI suitable for specific tasks, such as movie suggestions, playing games or spotting friends on Facebook.

However, recent advances across several fields of artificial intelligence have triggered a renewed spasm of enthusiasm, with many experts predicting that we are on the cusp of some genuinely transformational developments. The investment management industry is taking note.

Big, established asset managers and hedge funds such as BlackRock , Bridgewater and Schroders are pouring money into technology and data management, snapping up computer scientists to help build and develop next-generation investment systems that can outperform any human. This may sound fantastical, but the possibility is real enough to trigger some serious thinking about the future of the investment industry.

Even some old AI fields are getting revisited. Google's triumph over mankind at Go - the ancient Chinese board game long thought to be too complex for computers to master - has even reawakened interest in so-called "neural networks", an AI area that was long out of favour among quantitative fund managers.

Some sophisticated hedge funds began experimenting with neural networks in the 1990s, but to little avail. The tendency of neural networks to make obtuse - and often poor - investment decisions saw them fall from favour. Other related AI fields, such as " machine learning ", have become ascendant.

However, some experts have kept tinkering with the algorithms, and modern neural networks are now more commonly called "deep learning". This is what Google's DeepMind AI subsidiary used to create a machine that mastered Go, a game so complex that there are more possible permutations than there are atoms in the universe.

Deep learning builds on the neural network developments of the 1990s, where a machine uses matrices of artificial neurons that scan through information, look for patterns and make decisions, much like how the human brain operates but at hyper-fast speeds.

Deep learning powers such things as the image search tool in Google Photos and Facebook's face-recognition ability. But DeepMind juiced up its system by using two complementary "deep" neural networks to calculate the impact of moves both in the short and long term. It also added a layer of "reinforced learning", where AlphaGo constantly played against itself to learn further, and used a technique known as a "Monte Carlo tree search" to map millions of possible scenarios resulting from every move.

The net effect is arguably the closest a machine has come to intuition. In Go terms, DeepMind's creation demonstrated tesuji , or, as a teenager might put it, mad skills. Fan Hui, the first human Go champion bested by AlphaGo, was so impressed by one particularly brilliant gambit he told Wired magazine : "I've never seen a human play this move. So beautiful."

For money managers trying to navigate the chaos of financial markets, this sounds enticing. AHL, the quantitative arm of Man Group, the hedge fund manager, is among those now exploring whether deep learning can be applied to investing. Euclidean, a New York money manager, said in a recent note that it is also intrigued by the possibilities.

Deep learning is just one area of the multi-faceted AI world. Much of the current excitement will undoubtedly fizzle eventually. It is one thing to best a game with clear rules; mastering markets is an order of magnitude harder. Many of the new AI-focused hedge funds will probably go nowhere - or fail spectacularly.

However, the feeling that the investment industry is on the cusp of some big changes is inescapable.

Urban China leapfrogs credit cards on route to cashless society

When diners ask for the bill in an urban Chinese restaurant, they are more likely to reach for their mobile phones than their wallets.

This reflects the rapid spread of mobile payment platforms, which are pushing urban "http://www.ft.com/world/asia-pacific/china" towards becoming a cashless society, leapfrogging credit cards in the process.

In a survey of 1,000 urban consumers "https://www.ftconfidentialresearch.com/Sectors/Consumer/Retail/Retail-trends/China-Mobile-payments-killing-cash-threatening-consumer-finance", a unit of the Financial Times, 98.3 per cent of respondents said they had used mobile payment platforms over the past three months, with little difference across city tier, age group or income level.

Alibaba s Alipay was the most frequently used payment platform, cited by 79.5 per cent of respondents, as the first chart shows.

That is a far greater proportion than those who said they most regularly used credit cards (45.5 per cent), debit cards (30 per cent) or even cash (79 per cent).

Alipay s chief rival Tenpay, owned by Tencent, was cited by 26 per cent of respondents. Just 0.3 per cent said they used Apple Pay.

Alipay s dominance is nationwide, selected by 79.3 per cent of respondents in first-tier cities, 80.2 per cent in second-tier cities and 79 per cent in third-tier cities. It was 5.9 percentage points more popular than cash in first-tier cities, though narrowly lost out in second and third tiers.

The rapid adoption of such platforms means credit cards may never gain traction in China. Credit card penetration fell to 0.29 per person at the end of last year, after peaking at 0.34 at the end of 2014, according to central bank data.

The number of users of mobile payment platform grew 64.5 per cent in that time to 357.7m.

Respondents said they most often used them for payments in supermarkets and shopping malls, but they are also popular for paying utilities, ordering food, buying travel tickets or eating out, as the second chart shows.

Unsurprisingly, the younger the respondent, the more likely they were to have adopted this relatively young technology: only 56.1 per cent of respondents aged 35 or older said they prefer making mobile payments to paying via PC, even though almost all owned smartphones. In contrast, 88 per cent of 18 to 24-year-olds preferred paying via their mobile device.

Mobile platforms are now trying to move beyond a simple scan of a QR code for a retail transaction. Taking advantage of the big data resources of their parent companies, they are expanding into consumer finance, some with a view to challenging the traditional banks.

The central government has given its blessing. Tencent s WeBank was launched at the start of last year by Premier Li Keqiang, who approved its first loan in a PR stunt designed to signal Beijing s determination to increase financing support for underserved parts of the economy.

The take-up has not been entirely smooth, however. The new online banks have not overcome a central bank regulatory hurdle to become deposit-taking institutions, which requires in-person verification of an account holder s identity.

Predictably, China s big banks are refusing to co-operate with the upstarts, limiting the range of services they are able to offer. The head of WeBank lasted just 10 months before resigning in September last year.

Regulators have cause to be nervous. The proliferation of online financial services in China has brought with it a wave of under-regulated lending practices and outright fraud.

On the other hand, China s banks, particularly the big four state lenders, are known to fiercely guard their turf.

Both regulators and China s well-entrenched banks will need to adapt if these online lenders are to succeed. As is so often the case with new technologies in the Chinese economy, mobile payment platforms have grown despite, rather than because of, the government and state companies.

Even the act of paying for dinner ends with a reminder of how far the state needs to come.

Having effortlessly used their mobiles to settle the bill, diners still need to wait for a machine to slowly print out the all-important fapiao, the official, government-issued invoice used to record taxable transactions in the economy.

Japan s Nowcast Is a Real-Time Challenge to Official Data; Japanese big-data  startup provides up-to-date economic indicators to help anticipate the Bank of Japan s actions

TOKYO The Bank of Japan's policies haven't delivered much economic stimulus yet except at a Tokyo data-collection startup that is trying to help investors divine the central bank's next moves.

Nowcast Inc. is beginning to draw a following among investment banks by distributing consumer-inflation and retail-sales indicators every day, based on data obtained daily from bar-code scanners at 800 supermarkets across the country. That compares with the government's monthly inflation indicators, which are announced weeks after the data are collected and are based on less-frequently updated samples of goods.

The Bank of Japan's "http://www.wsj.com/articles/as-he-runs-out-of-options-boj-chief-kuroda-faces-new-challenges-1455289831" aims to "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323485704578256701087555208". Because it hasn't succeeded yet, the BOJ is frequently adopting or considering further easing measures that can drive wild swings in stocks and currencies. That makes investors eager to get the clearest possible picture of prices in Japan.

Japan reported better-than-expected "http://www.wsj.com/articles/japans-economy-rebounds-sharply-in-first-quarter-1463530307" for the first quarter this week, but Nowcast data show a continued deceleration in consumer prices through May, suggesting that the first-quarter recovery may not prove so durable.

The company's venture is one example of Asian financial markets catching up with the kind of services already popular in other advanced markets, such as the University of Michigan's "http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-consumer-confidence-rebounds-in-may-1463148859". The demand for privately generated data may be even higher in developing markets such as China and India where investors often doubt the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/on-close-inspection-indias-sharp-growth-picture-gets-fuzzy-1462122704".

Nowcast was founded last year by Tsutomu Watanabe, a former BOJ official and longtime skeptic of government inflation data. When he first released an alternative consumer-price index on a University of Tokyo website in 2013, many people asked him why he wanted to challenge official data, he said.

 They complained and said,  There are already official data. If you produce alternative data, the public would become confused,'" said Mr. Watanabe, a University of Tokyo professor.

Some investors share Mr. Watanabe's dissatisfaction with the government inflation figure, which they find to be slow and incomplete. Akiyoshi Takumori, chief economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co., is a Nowcast customer. He said Nowcast indicators reflected changes in Japan's inflation trend  very early."

 Nowcast data aren't perfect. But when they show a big fall in prices as it did this month, it's safe to assume that a change is in the offing for the official CPI," Mr. Takumori said in an April interview. Since January, Nowcast's data have been pointing to lower inflation, and one widely cited government measure consumer prices excluding fresh food fell to minus 0.3% in March from a flat reading in February.

Nowcast is targeting mostly investors such as Mr. Takumori and JPMorgan Securities economist Masamichi Adachi, who said he used Nowcast to look beyond official data.

The Statistics Bureau of Japan, which compiles consumer-price-index data, said its data were superior to Nowcast's. A bureau official responsible for collecting consumer-price data said its 880 price collectors, who usually live in the areas they survey, know their local retail markets intimately and are well-positioned to judge which items to monitor.

By combining modern sampling theories with the human touch, the official price figures are more trustworthy than those relying on big amounts of data crunched by computer programs, the bureau official said.

Though Nowcast isn't yet profitable, the startup is looking ahead to an initial public offering. It has received slightly more than $1 million in funding from investors including University of Tokyo Edge Capital Co., a venture-capital firm affiliated with the university, and Nikkei Inc., a data provider and publisher of Japan's largest business newspaper.

So far Nowcast doesn't face much competition in Japan, aside from the official figures. Large corporations haven't shown much interest in producing real-time measures, focusing instead on the more lucrative business of providing customized data analysis for individual clients.

Still, winning clients hasn't been easy for Nowcast.

 People in this country still have high regard for economic data from the government," said Satoshi Imai, chief executive of Nowcast and a former official at the statistics bureau.  We are not trying to take the place of the government. We are saying our data can be better in some areas."

Mr. Watanabe said Nowcast wanted to introduce more real-time indicators, including those on wages, retail sales and consumer sentiment, through partnerships with job-placement agencies, major retail chains and auto dealers.

Nowcast is also looking to track inflation in other Asian countries, such as China and South Korea, Mr. Imai said. In South Korea, the company has helped Lotte Members Inc., a unit of Korean business conglomerate Lotte Group, analyze customer-spending data obtained from Lotte's customer-loyalty cards.

Mr. Imai envisions data companies across Asia eventually working together to produce common economic indicators.

 I believe private companies can produce common indicators across Asia before the governments can do it," he said.

DEUTSCHE BANK

Lender Is Upbeat

About Legal Costs

Deutsche Bank AG expects to see a conclusion to the significant litigation against the bank this year and put the legal costs that have hobbled performance in the past year behind it, Chief Executive John Cryan said at the bank's annual shareholder meeting on Thursday.

Germany's largest bank, in the midst of a far-reaching overhaul, reaffirmed its goal of becoming a less complex institution with fewer risks and a stronger capital base by 2020. Mr. Cryan also addressed worries about the need for a capital increase, saying the bank could achieve its goals with its own means.

Mr. Cryan cautioned that it was too early to tell whether the bank would have a small profit or loss this year, after it recorded a loss of 6.8 billion euros ($7.76 billion) in 2015, its first annual loss since 2008.

With provisions of 5.4 billion euros set aside this year for legal costs, he also said that such expenses aren't a permanent condition.

"Litigation expenses of this magnitude are completely unacceptable," Mr. Cryan said. "I am cautiously confident that we are gradually approaching the home straight as far as our litigation is concerned."

Mark Wiseman will join the world's largest money manager in September as head of global active equity, charged with leading a continuing turnaround of its stock-picking unit. He will also become chairman of the firm's global investment committee a subunit of its executive committee and chairman of its alternatives business, BlackRock said.

Mr. Wiseman will leave the Canadian fund in June, but will be an adviser to the board until September.

DEUTSCHE BANK

Lender Is Upbeat About Legal Costs

Deutsche Bank AG expects to see a conclusion to the significant litigation against the bank this year and put the legal costs that have hobbled performance in the past year behind it, Chief Executive John Cryan said at the bank's annual shareholder meeting on Thursday.

Germany's largest bank, in the midst of a far-reaching overhaul, reaffirmed its goal of becoming a less complex institution with fewer risks and a stronger capital base by 2020. Mr. Cryan also addressed worries about the need for a capital increase, saying the bank could achieve its goals with its own means.

Mr. Cryan cautioned that it was too early to tell whether the bank would have a small profit or loss this year, after it recorded a loss of  6.8 billion ($7.76 billion) in 2015, its first annual loss since 2008.

With provisions of  5.4 billion set aside this year for legal costs, he also said that such expenses aren't a permanent condition.

 Litigation expenses of this magnitude are completely unacceptable," Mr. Cryan said.  I am cautiously confident that we are gradually approaching the home straight as far as our litigation is concerned."

Avrio Capital has tapped its new food-and-agriculture fund to invest 15 million Canadian dollars ($11.4 million) into three new portfolio companies.

Agriculture-focused startups have gained greater attention from venture investors. Investment in the sector hit a record high last year, and "http://www.wsj.com/articles/agtech-startups-find-more-sources-of-capital-1462467164" have been raised in recent months. In February, Avrio announced a "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120160212ec2ct6078" of its third fund.

Avrio's new portfolio companies include Intelia Technologies Inc., which makes a line of control systems and data analytics for the poultry and swine markets; Alasko Inc., a supplier of frozen fruits & vegetables; and Cadcan Marketing & Sales Inc., which sells the CheeCha Puffs line of better-for-you snack foods.

Avrio said it has invested over C$225 million in more than 50 companies in the agriculture and food technology sectors.

Business Search Company ThoughtSpot Raises $50M

"http://www.thoughtspot.com/" announced it raised $50 million to expand its Google-like search that caters to business applications.

The Palo Alto, Calif., company sees itself as part of a new generation of enterprise tools like Slack Technologies Inc. and Dropbox Inc. that are as user-friendly as the consumer apps that employees use on their own time. ThoughtSpot is able to produce easy-to-read data for employees almost instantly by searching data sets previously isolated throughout the company.

General Catalyst Partners led the round, with participation from Geodesic Capital as well as existing investors Lightspeed Ventures and Khosla Ventures. The company, which has raised $90 million to date, declined to disclose its valuation but said it doubled it from its valuation at the time of its last funding in summer 2014.

General Catalyst Partner Hemant Taneja said the firm rarely makes later-stage investments. He bet on ThoughtSpot, however, because he considers it the first category-defining player to hit the business intelligence space since analytics startup Tableau Software launched in 2003.

 You think about how quickly business apps are being adopted," Mr. Taneja said.  It's because consumers have become fairly sophisticated in the apps that they use on the mobile application side. The opportunity for ThoughtSpot that was really exciting for us was to see them do the same thing around business intelligence and analytics."

The tool can be used to search data like loans or sales, and then it generates charts that can be shared and edited. Ajeet Singh, the chief executive and co-founder, said it was important for him to build a tool people could easily use without a background in data science.

 It's time for the generation of companies that will be much, much easier to use and bring data to a much larger group of people," Mr. Singh said.

The funding comes as ThoughtSpot, which launched in 2012, is seeking to expand in international markets. The company opened a London office earlier this year.

Mr. Singh said the company now has close to 50 customers, and it is frequently used by retail and financial services companies. Customers include Bed Bath & Beyond, Primary Capital Mortgage, Automated Financial Systems, Collegis Education, Batteries Plus Bulbs and Nutanix.

Mr. Singh said the classic search model doesn't work for business intelligence. The company calls its technology relational search, a type of search to analyze data stored in databases, cloud applications, Hadoop clusters and spreadsheets. It differs from the kind of searches used on social networks like Facebook Inc. or on Web pages like Google Inc.

 It's a very ambitious take on the product, but we call it 2% done, so we continue to invest there," Mr. Singh said.

Facebook Co-Founder Saverin s Venture-Capital Firm Raises $143.6 Million; Founders expressed particular optimism in startups in Southeast Asia and India due to large populations and anticipated economic growth

SINGAPORE A venture-capital firm launched last year by Facebook Inc. co-founder Eduardo Saverin and a partner has raised more than $143.6 million in the first close for its first fund, according to a regulatory filing Thursday.

B Capital Group, which was founded in 2015 by the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303877604577380131964661806" and Raj Ganguly, a veteran of private-equity firm Bain Capital LLC, said in a document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal Thursday that it sees promising opportunities to invest in innovative tech firms around the world, not just in traditional hot spots like Silicon Valley.

The company has offices in Manhattan Beach, Calif., San Francisco and Singapore.

The fundraising comes as some venture capitalists are starting to "http://www.wsj.com/articles/asian-startups-hit-by-venture-capital-slowdown-1462986692" amid weakness in the global economy, worries over "http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-market-plunge-has-investors-wondering-about-more-turmoil-1451919595" and talk of a bubble in the U.S.

In a posting on the LinkedIn Corp. social network Thursday by Mr. Ganguly, however, the two founders expressed their particular optimism in startups in Southeast Asia and India due to the large populations and anticipated economic growth in the years to come in the regions.

The"http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2016/01/08/india-sheltered-from-global-economic-heavy-weather-world-bank-says/""http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2016/01/08/india-sheltered-from-global-economic-heavy-weather-world-bank-says/", which is home to some 1.3 billion people, will be the world's fastest-growing developing economy until at least 2018. Many Southeast Asian economies are also expanding, and the region is home to some 600 million people.

Across Asia, the proliferation of low-cost smartphones and increasing Internet access mean millions of people have been getting online for the first time.

But in India and Southeast Asia,  current levels of funding still pale in comparison to the U.S. and China," Mr. Ganguly said in his post.

In India, venture-capital investors pumped $736 million into startups in the first quarter of this year, down from $891 million in the first quarter of 2015, according to Hong Kong-based AVCJ Research.

In Singapore, a hub for venture-capital investment in Southeast Asia, funding rose to $199 million in the first quarter of this year from $53.1 million in the first quarter of 2015.

Funding for U.S. startups, by comparison, amounted to $13.9 billion in the first quarter of this year, according to data from Dow Jones VentureSource.

Last month, Chinese Internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. said it "http://www.wsj.com/articles/alibaba-to-invest-1-billion-in-e-commerce-startup-lazada-1460445117"in Southeast-Asia focused e-commerce startup Lazada Group, betting on growth in the region.

B Capital Group also said in a document reviewed by The Wall Street Journal that it had already invested undisclosed amounts in its first two portfolio companies.

One is Ninja Van, a Singapore-based startup that provides e-commerce logistics services in Southeast Asia. The other is Menlo Park, Calif.-based Evidation Health Inc., a digital health and analytics firm.

Mr. Ganguly declined to comment on the size of the Ninja Van and Evidation investments, or on a possible time frame for investing the new funds.

Software Company Adds $17 Million

InsideSales.com Inc., the software company that correlates people's willingness to buy with apparently unrelated events like phases of the moon, added another $17 million as it prepares for what Chief Executive Dave Elkington expects will be a challenging year.

The new money comes from an unnamed strategic investor and is an add-on to the Series D round that InsideSales.com raised in March 2015. That round was led by Salesforce Ventures and included Microsoft Corp. With the Series D, the company was valued at about $1.5 billion.

The Provo, Utah-based company, which helps automate the sales process by directing salespeople on when and whom to call, moved up its date for cash-flow positive and expects to reach it now by the end of the year, he said.

For about the past 18 months, InsideSales.com has been firing salespeople who are underperforming, and while the company expects to add another 200 to 300 people this year to the 600 employees it already has, underperformers will continue to be let go.Investors have started to reward  best-in-class unit economics," Mr. Elkington said, and he expects fundraising for companies at every stage over the next six months to get harder.

UNACAST

Data Connector Seeks To Boost Sales Team

New York-based Unacast connects data collected from beacons and other proximity sensors to enable advertising platforms to target online ads based on customers' behavior in the physical world.

The company has raised $5 million in Series A funding to grow its proximity marketing network, called PROX. The round was co-led by Investinor AS and Open Ocean Capital, a European venture-capital firm concerned with software and data investments.

Unacast has partnerships with major advertising platforms such as MediaMath, Opera Mediaworks, Lotame, Adform and Oracle. The company partners with 52 proximity-service providers, including those that work with big-box retailers, airports and sports stadiums, collecting data from 1.4 million beacons world-wide. Unacast will use the new funding to grow its sales and marketing team, and to hire data scientists to expand its analytics offerings, said its chief executive, Thomas Walle.

Open Ocean Capital Partner Tom Henriksson joined the company's board in conjunction with the round, which closed on Monday.

BARK & CO.

Pet-Pampering Firm Raises $60 Million

Bark & Co., best known for its subscription box for pet owners who pamper their dogs, is expanding in a bid to be what it calls the  Disney for dogs," through e-commerce, events, and even a Manhattan shop where pooches will go  shopping" by themselves.

The New York company has raised $60 million in new Series C funding led by August Capital. Also participating were existing investors RRE and Resolute Ventures. The startup has previously raised $17 million. Launched in 2012, Bark & Co. says it has reached a $100 million revenue run rate and isn't yet profitable, but it is cash-flow positive. It doubled revenue in 2015 and expects to do so again in 2016, said Chief Executive and Co-founder Matt Meeker.

 What we really tapped into is a big audience of dog parents," said Mr. Meeker, who was a co-founder of Meetup Inc.  They treat dogs as children, love them and spoil them. What we discovered was a void of products, services, experiences and entertainment, so we created it for them."

The company raised the new funding aiming to become a major brand of products and services for dog owners and their pets, particularly to build out its emerging business lines in e-commerce, events and a pop-up brick-and-mortar store.

 The options (for activities with dogs) are pretty limited to going for a walk or going to the park," Mr. Meeker said.  So we had the idea to create events and experiences that you and your dog can do together."

Music Reports Inc. Retains Bank to Explore Sale; The Abry Partners LLC-backed company, which provides a technology platform for musician rights and royalties, hired Houlihan Lokey & Co.

Abry Partners LLC-backed Music Reports Inc., which helps track royalties for musicians, has retained Houlihan Lokey & Co. to explore a sale of the company, said people familiar with the situation.

Music Reports, of Woodland Hills, Calif., provides rights and royalty services, such as copyright analysis, licensing and royalty accounting, and software and data-processing services, such as data transformation, micropayment processing and settlement, and data analytics. The company also offers Songdex, a registry of music copyright and other information on songs, recordings and their owners.

The software company has earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of about $10 million and could attract an Ebitda multiple of 10 times to 12 times in the event of a sale, said two of the people. One of the people said Music Reports is profitable and has seen an increase because of digital and streaming music.

One person said the company may be attractive to a strategic such as the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers or Broadcast Music Inc. Private-equity sponsors also are taking a look at the company, the people said.

Clients of Music Reports include Apple iTunes, Amazon Prime Music, and SoundCloud, according to the company's website.

Abry invested in Music Reports in 2006, according to the firm's website. The company was founded in 1995 and its clients include record labels, digital-music services, wireless carriers and consumer products companies.

Music Reports has other products including its cue sheet management system that processes and delivers cue sheets to performing rights organizations and calculates performance royalties. Most recently in March, the company launched a claiming system for publishers and composers, allowing them to claim and license recordings that embody their songs.

In February, the company released a new advanced administration dashboard for music customers, in an attempt to address the data that is produced by streaming services, according to the company.

The estimated spending on online music content will rise to more than $10 billion by the year 2019, according to data from research and advisory firm Gartner Inc. The market snapshot noted that the biggest contributor to the market will move from download services in 2014 to subscription-streaming services by 2019.

Abry makes investments in the media, communications and business and information services spaces including media, online media and entertainment, among others. The Boston firm targets investments of $25 million to $150 million for its private-equity funds or $20 million to $90 million of senior equity capital.

WSJ Pro Private Equity previously reported Bankruptcy Management Solutions Inc. had mandated Houlihan Lokey Inc. for a sale of the chapter 7 bankruptcy and corporate restructuring software company.

Warren Buffett s Heirs Bet on Apple; Berkshire Hathaway investment, made by managers brought in by the legendary investor, shows leeway given to potential successors

Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. disclosed Monday that it had made a $1 billion bet on Apple Inc. stock earlier this year, boosting the iPhone maker's market value by more than $18 billion.

But to the cottage industry that fervently follows the world's most famous investor, it just didn't seem like a move Mr. Buffett would make.

It wasn't, as it turns out. Instead, "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/05/16/berkshire-bought-apple-but-warren-buffett-didnt/" by the two former hedge-fund managers that Mr. Buffett brought on board as potential successors to run his company's $129 billion stock portfolio.

Mr. Buffett has long voiced his aversion to investing in technology companies. Four years ago, he specifically ruled out investing in Apple.

But Todd Combs, who joined Berkshire in 2011, and Ted Weschler, who arrived a year later, have shown a willingness to wade into corners of the market that Mr. Buffett won't touch, including the tech sector.

The investment shows the amount of rope Mr. Buffett is willing to give his protgs, as the legendary stock picker, who turns 86 years old in August, prepares Berkshire for a future without him at the helm. In an email Monday, Mr. Buffett didn't say whether Mr. Combs or Mr. Weschler made the call. But he said they each make investment decisions without consulting him first.

The Apple position gives Berkshire a rare sizable stake in a technology company. Its first was Mr. Buffett's $11 billion investment in International Business Machines Corp. Mr. Buffett made that investment in 2011 and has expanded it, most recently early this year. IBM shares have dropped roughly 20% since Berkshire disclosed its stake, as the company tries to turn itself around.

The IBM investment left many Berkshire shareholders, analysts and others scratching their heads. Mr. Buffett had long expressed caution when it comes to tech companies. In his 1996 annual letter to shareholders, he wrote that  many companies in high-tech businesses or embryonic industries will grow much faster in percentage terms &But I would rather be certain of a good result than hopeful of a great one."

His opinion hadn't changed much as of Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in 2012, where Mr. Buffett said he wouldn't invest in Google Inc. or Apple.  I just don't know how to value them," he said.

That position changed sometime in the first quarter for Berkshire, when Mr. Combs or Mr. Weschler bought the stock. Apple's shares were trading in the mid-90s for much of that time. They closed Monday up 3.7% at $93.88 but are still down nearly 11% this year.

The tech giant's stock has been battered partly because of a slowdown in iPhone sales, as Apple struggles to keep up the strong growth that followed the introduction of its larger-screen smartphones in late 2014. The 2015 successors to those initial big-display models haven't garnered as much enthusiasm from consumers. Last month, Apple reported its first quarterly revenue decline since 2003.

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal at the time, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said it was  a challenging quarter," but he dismissed concerns that the company was in decline. He attributed the slump to short-term factors such as the strong dollar, difficult economic conditions and difficult comparisons for iPhone sales.  It's a tough bar to hurdle, but it doesn't change the future," he said.  The future is very bright."

Berkshire's investment managers, each of whom manages around $9 billion, appeared to agree. The Omaha, Neb., conglomerate said in a securities filing it owned 9.81 million shares of Apple as of March 31, valued at roughly $1.07 billion. Those shares are now valued at around $920 million.

Despite Mr. Buffett's concerns about technology, they are buying into a company "http://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-as-a-value-play-buffetts-berkshire-approves-1463426532". Apple arguably has a durable  economic moat" or competitive advantage in its more than one billion devices in active use and constellation of services like iTunes and the App Store that keep users tied to its devices. It also has a predictable cash flow, and the share-price plunge likely presented a buying opportunity.

On the other hand, Apple, like all technology companies, faces the risk that a competitor with a more compelling product could arise out of nowhere and reshape the industry as Apple did over the past decade, devastating once powerful companies like Motorola and Nokia.

 It appears to be a low-risk investment with considerable upside potential &however, I do not think this is an investment that Buffett would make," said David Kass, a Berkshire shareholder and finance professor at the University of Maryland business school.  Todd Combs and/or Ted Weschler &perhaps have a better understanding of the competitive advantages Apple possesses vis a vis the technological challenges it might face in the years ahead."

Berkshire's investment in Apple the firm's only new position taken in the quarter follows the exits of well-known investors Carl Icahn and David Tepper. Mr. Icahn said last month that he had sold his big stake, telling CNBC at the time that Apple is a great company but no longer a  no-brainer" as an investment choice. He said he worried about the company's ability to succeed in China.

Mr. Icahn made his initial investment, reported to be worth about $1.5 billion, in 2013. He subsequently bought more shares and called for the company to boost its stock buybacks.

Mr. Tepper's Appaloosa Management LP disclosed his sale in a securities filing Friday.

Mr. Combs received an endorsement of his stock-picking skills when Mr. Buffett closed a deal to buy aerospace company Precision Castparts Corp. for $32 billion earlier this year. Mr. Combs began buying shares of Precision in 2012, a year after he joined Berkshire, but Mr. Buffett hadn't followed the company closely until last year.

Although Mr. Combs didn't suggest the deal to his boss, many Berkshire shareholders were reassured that the investment managers were picking stocks that Mr. Buffett approved of. The two men are part of a succession plan that Mr. Buffett has put in place at Berkshire, where his roles as chief executive, chairman and investment manager will be split into three. Mr. Buffett has said his son, Howard Buffett, will be Berkshire's nonexecutive chairman. He hasn't revealed who will replace him as CEO and oversee the conglomerate's giant insurance, industrial, utility and other operations.

Berkshire's two stock pickers, along with Mr. Buffett's financial assistant Tracy Britt Cool he calls them the  three T's" are closely involved with various aspects of Berkshire's operations. Both Mr. Combs and Mr. Weschler have worked on deals for the conglomerate, for no extra money, as Mr. Buffett likes to say. Mr. Weschler flew to Germany several times in 2015 to negotiate Berkshire's deal to buy motorcycle gear maker Detlev Louis Motorradvertriebs GmbH.

The two managers also jointly bought DirecTV stock before it was acquired by AT&T Inc. in 2015, having built up a position worth nearly $3 billion to become the satellite company's second-largest shareholder. Berkshire made a tidy profit from the deal, given that they had bought DirecTV shares for much cheaper than what AT&T paid for them.

Mr. Buffett has said that the big, multibillion-dollar stock holdings are his picks, whereas his two investment managers typically buy smaller positions of a few hundred million dollars. Among picks thought to be theirs are companies such as Mastercard Inc., Visa Inc. as well as tech companies like Verisign Inc., an Internet domain name provider.

 Hiring these two was one of my best moves," Mr. Buffett said in his latest annual letter.

Corrections & Amplifications: Berkshire exchanged most of its position in Procter & Gamble in the quarter to buy Duracell. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the firm sold off the shares. (May 16) Berkshire invested in Verisk Analytics Inc. before Warren Buffett's likely successors to run the company's investment portfolio joined the company. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said Verisk was among the investments thought to have been made by them. (May 17)

Big data analysis has revolutionised many areas of modern life   from healthcare, to politics, to sport   yet not so far the property insurance market. That looks set to change.

 The insurance industry has been a little of a hold out,  says Lori Sherer, head of the advanced analytics practice at management consultancy Bain, but  is now on the brink of innovation .

More executives at property insurers   who worry about tight profit margins and growing competition   plan to take advantage of the potential benefits of the increasing amounts of captured data.

From weather patterns to social media, new sources of data could help them streamline costs, be more targeted with the risks they want to underwrite, identify new customers, predict fraud or identify which claims have the potential to become very expensive.

Property insurance executives have  fairly aggressive plans  for developing big data analysis over the next couple of years, says Klayton Southwood, director of risk consulting at Willis Towers Watson. He cites the results of a survey the consultancy conducted in the US last year.

If what the executives say in the survey holds true, the property insurance industry is soon to be significantly changed by its approach to "http://www.ft.com/intl/topics/themes/Big_data".

For example, fewer than half of the property and casualty insurance executives who took part in the survey reported that big data and the analysis of it help them now with pricing, underwriting and risk selection. On the other hand, just over three-quarters of the survey respondents expect big data to help them in this area in two years  time.

The survey suggests more management teams expect to gather data from a greater number of sources. These include data generated through website use, email and phone calls   and social media.

One emerging area of increasing interest to property insurers for generating data and serving customers is the smart home. This refers to household devices and systems   from doorbells to air conditioning   that produce data and can be controlled from anywhere by computer or mobile device.

Two US-based providers, Liberty Mutual Insurance and American Family Insurance, have partnered with Nest Labs, the smart-home tech company that Google acquired in 2014, to offer its smoke alarm and carbon monoxide monitor, Nest Protect, to customers for free. As part of the deal, customers can receive a discount from the insurers on their premiums and the insurers in return receive data from the device.

The data shared with the insurer are limited and include the status of batteries, sensors and internet connection as well as the location of the house and the room in which the device is located.

Data produced by customers are already used in other areas of insurance, such as car coverage, where telematics that monitor driving style help cut premiums for safe drivers. They are also used in retail, where supermarkets issue loyalty cards and offer discounts in exchange for data on customers  shopping habits.

John Davies, managing director of risk finance at broker Marsh, says customers will typically give up personal information under two conditions: if it is easy to do so and if they receive something in return.  In the insurance industry,  he says,  it s still not easy. 

Some information can be gathered without customers knowing and social media have made this much easier. Using sites such as Facebook and Twitter, insurers can get a better understanding of their customers  behaviour and risk profile.

The more insurers mine and use data, the more likely it is to become an area for regulators to address. Officials at the Switzerland-based International Association of Insurance Supervisors are discussing how insurers are using data in order to determine if the organisation should provide guidance.

In November, the UK s Financial Conduct Authority requested information on how insurers are using big data. It aims to publish its findings by mid-2016 and reveal its plans on what response it will make. This could include  a market study, adjustments to policy or guidance or another form of intervention,  according to its website.

Data protection laws in many countries put some limit on what insurers can do. That does not mean, however, that insurance executives are paying attention as much as they might.

 There are differences at different companies with how seriously they take data protection,  says Emma Bate, partner at international law firm DAC Beachcroft.  This needs to be discussed at the board level. 

Regulatory and legal risks aside, one of the biggest challenges facing property insurers is making sure they have the right people with the right skills to capture and analyse big data properly. Respondents to the Willis Towers Watson survey ranked this as the top big-data challenge.

 Big data can be paralysing,  says Helen Gemmell, catastrophe modelling manager at Liberty Specialty Markets.  Asking the wrong questions of it or using the data in isolation can lead to poor decisions.

Fintech takes off in Africa as lenders tap mobile technology

Finca, a US microfinance organisation, and First Access, a New York-based data analytics company, have formed a partnership to start making loans over east Africa using credit scores derived from mobile phone data.

This kind of uncollateralised lending has already started to transform Kenya s micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) sector. Hundreds of thousands of loans worth more than $150m have been issued since March 2015 when Kenya Commercial Bank, the country s largest bank, and M-Pesa, the mobile money platform of Safaricom, the dominant telecoms company, began collaborating.

The vast majority of borrowers were previously considered uncreditworthy because of their lack of credit history and access to financial services. However, KCB-Mpesa accepts about 80 per cent of applicants, with an average loan size of Ks4,000 ($40) and a default rate of just under 2 per cent.

 It s much more efficient and accurate than the old system and we re seeing much earlier repayments,  said Joshua Oigara, KCB chief executive.

Growth is proving exponential.  Every second a new loan is issued, and we re only a year into this service,  said Bob Collymore, chief executive of Safaricom.

Now Finca, which serves 1.8m people in 23 countries, said it would roll out this kind of lending in six African countries by the end of the year having completed a pilot study in Tanzania. 

Andree Simon, co-chief executive of Finca Microfinance Holding Company, said the partnership will give the organisation  more objective information to form a credit recommendation and more time to improve the quality of our relationship with our clients .

Shivani Siroya, chief executive of InVenture, a US start-up that launched its Mkopo Rahisi loan service via an Android app in March 2014, said it took 20 seconds to scan someone s phone and determine whether they were creditworthy.

Like the other providers, InVenture is using increasingly detailed data to make credit decisions. For example, the Santa Monica-based company found that if at least 40 per cent of an applicant s contacts were organised with both first and second names they were 16 times more likely to repay on time.

 Those indicators are just about invisible to the financial sector and the market place,  Ms Siroya said.  Now we re bringing this data to life. These people are becoming creditworthy. Our goal is to change the perception of risk and level the playing field. 

The demand is huge. In 2013 the International Finance Corporation, a branch of the World Bank Group, estimated that MSMEs in developing countries face a financing gap of up to $2.6tn and that more than 200m formal and informal enterprises do not have a loan or overdraft but are in need of one.

Mobile phone-based lending is likely to expand along with soaring smartphone use. Ericsson, the Swedish technology company, predicted last year that smartphone penetration would more than double to 6.1bn people by 2020, with the greatest uptake being in emerging markets.

Ms Siroya described Kenya as the  perfect test market  for her app, which today is being renamed Tala.  There are 26m people on mobile money, they re more sophisticated than elsewhere with loan products, there s a high penetration of smartphones and they re English speaking. 

But she and her start-up rival, Branch International, expect east Africa to be the springboard to greater things.  In five years the end goal is mortgages, insurance and other products,  said Daniel Szlapak, the Africa director of Branch, which also uses a phone app.  And it won t just be here. We re looking to spread around the world. 

Users say the services have completely transformed their businesses. Lawrence Thou, who owns Celtcom Systems   a Nairobi enterprise that buys and sells old computer equipment   said in the past it could take  days if not weeks  to borrow money.

 If you had a business opportunity that came up and you didn t have the money you would have to go to family or friends [to borrow the money] and you would usually lose out to competitors,  he said.  Now I can get a loan in real time and I don t lose out. 

Mr Thou, who has borrowed a total of Ks100,000 in about 20 tranches from KCB-Mpesa, estimates that his monthly earnings have trebled from Ks40,000 before the loans were available. His workforce has doubled to six people.

While the use of phone data raises privacy issues, thus far, borrowers have not complained.

Kelvin Aderi, who has borrowed Ks50,000 from Branch to build up his mobile phone shop in Naivasha, a town 80km north-west of Nairobi, said:  At first I feared they would give my data to the security services but actually they appear to have been very transparent. And anyway, the advantages of letting them take my data massively outweigh the potential risks.

The online lending hangover, part three

Last year, online lenders were generally spending their time raising "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0d27f406-678c-11e5-97d0-1456a776a4f5.html" and talking about how great the champagne tastes.

This year, they re busy firing employees, getting "http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/05/10/2161232/there-are-bigger-questions-for-lending-club-to-answer/" and getting used to the taste of water.

The problem, in lending as in life, is that yesterday s boozing is today s hangover. In 2015, investors were clamouring to buy loans from online lenders and the bottleneck was on the borrower side. We ve seen the effect of that in "http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/02/26/2154320/us-online-lending-credit-is-deteriorating-heres-the-data/" and bond deals "http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/03/15/2156425/dumb-money-meet-dumb-lender/".

We ve also seen signs of "http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/04/18/2159420/if-the-musics-playing-keep-on-lending/", something the industry is quick to downplay by pointing to stable FICO score trends   the argument is broadly that if the credit scores of borrowers haven t fallen, then underwriting standards haven t loosened.

But "https://www.monjaco.com/blog/marketplace-lending-understanding-delinquency-uptick", a data analytics company, which we missed last week in the maelstrom of Lending Club news, suggests that stable FICO scores disguise an underlying loosening in credit standards.

According to Vijay Rao and Kitty Lin, while FICO scores have remained consistent, and borrower standards for low-risk consumers have been relatively stable, the debt burden of higher-risk borrowers has increased:

We see a very different trend with the data from the lower rated High Risk Tiers borrowers. We have seen that the platforms have loosened their standards for the High Risk Tiers borrowers, despite maintaining FICO relatively stable FICO scores for these loans.

Here are our key takeaways for High Risk Tier borrowers:

* The average debt to income levels have creeped higher, from 18.26% in 2013 to over 21.69% in 2015.

* Additionally, the average income of these borrowers has dropped from $71,647 in 2013 to $69,555 in 2015.

* This suggests that the platforms are originating lower quality loans that they were in years past   and that the borrowers have less capacity to repay those loans.

Although they don t pick out any online lender in particular, there have been signs of loosening standards at Lending Club, which Michael Tarkan at Compass Point Research noted back in January:

LC does not take direct underwriting risk but we expect demand from institutional investors would fall if performance of its loans deteriorates. Credit has held up relatively well in a very benign environment but the portfolio remains unseasoned and it has yet to be fully tested through more stressed economic periods. Additionally, we are starting to see early signs of looser underwriting standards as levels of income verification have declined and the company is testing a new  Direct Pay  product that would ease borrower DTI requirements.

And there have been acknowledgements of rising losses, like in "https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1409970/000140997016002017/form8-k42016.htm" last month (click to enlarge):

By this point, the loosening trend is reversing, helped by the weakening investor demand for loans that began with the capital markets turmoil at the start of this year and has been compounded by the trouble at Lending Club. The question now is when the trend of increasing defaults will reverse too.

AtScale Raises $11M to Get at Data in Hadoop

Many startups have had a hard time raising money this year as valuations in some sectors continue to fall, but there are a few exceptions.

One is AtScale Inc., a startup that lets businesses use familiar tools like Excel and Tableau to analyze data sitting in Hadoop, the big-data software store.

AtScale closed an $11 million Series B round led by Comcast Ventures after less than 60 days of fundraising, according to founder and Chief Executive Dave Mariani. He said the round was $6 million more than the company was looking for and came in at more than twice the valuation of a $7 million Series A round "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120150623eb6nap0uy""http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120150623eb6nap0uy", which was much harder to raise.

Based in San Mateo, Calif., AtScale has developed patented technology that impersonates an SQL database on top of Hadoop. That means customers can use the tools they're comfortable with Excel, Tableau and so on to analyze and visualize data without moving them from Hadoop, which is cheap to procure but hard to use.

Previously, Mr. Mariani worked at Yahoo Inc., which created Hadoop from a paper published by Google Inc. He said he started AtScale to solve a problem at Yahoo and at his next job, which was figuring out how to get at data in Hadoop using older business intelligence tools.

 We had to build a product we couldn't buy," he said.  We're a bunch of people who suffered through this problem, and we built a product for ourselves."

Raising AtScale's Series A was tough, Mr. Mariani said, because Silicon Valley venture capitalists kept comparing the company to other big data startups that had created fancy new interfaces to visualize data.

As a customer,  I would never buy that," he said.

Now, however, AtScale has revenue and customers, including Comcast, American Express and Macy's.  We've proven our approach is the right approach," Mr. Mariani said.

The new money will be used to hire people in sales, support and engineering. Demand for AtScale's software grew faster than expected and the company got caught short-handed, he said.

But he also said he's through with raising money and dreams of taking AtScale public someday.

 I don't want to give up any more equity, nor do I want anyone in the company to give up more equity," Mr. Mariani said.  I really want to be just like Tableau [which raised well under $100 million before going public in 2013], being efficient from the ground up."

Current investors AME Ventures, Storm Ventures, UMC Capital and XSeed Capital also participated in the round, with Comcast Ventures Principal Matt Carbonara joining the board.

Total funding in AtScale is $20 million. Mr. Mariani said he expects the company to be profitable by the beginning of 2018.

Hewlett Packard Venture Groups Offer Insight Into Corporate Venturing

By Russ Garland

When Hewlett-Packard Co., one of Silicon Valley's oldest investors in technology companies, split in two last year, each of the offspring got a corporate venture group.

"http://hewlettpackardventures.com/" is tethered to Hewlett Packard Enterprise, the unit that makes server and storage systems. The venture group, which backed startups such as now-public database company Hortonworks Inc., is concentrating on providing expansion capital to startups working on technology for cloud computing and data centers, big data and security.

HP Inc., now home to the old HP's personal computer and printer businesses, last week "http://www.wsj.com/articles/hp-launches-group-to-invest-in-startups-1462885202" of HP Tech Ventures, which is taking aim at startups that could help its work. It has already made several investments.

The continuing commitment of the HP companies to corporate venturing provides fresh evidence of venture capital's importance to innovation. A look at the investment record of the old HP, however, also illustrates how corporate interest in venture capital isn't a steady proposition, even for a Silicon Valley legend that, like many startups, traces its origins to a garage.

HP has been an active investor in venture-backed companies since at least 1992, when Dow Jones VentureSource began tracking the industry. From 1992 until the dot-com boom, it made at least one equity investment each year in U.S. venture-backed companies, nearly all in the information technology sector.

It ramped up during the tech bubble, hitting of peak of 29 equity deals tracked by VentureSource in 2000. While the majority of them were in IT, 11 were for business and financial services companies.

Activity dropped off sharply after that and there was a string of years where HP made no equity investments in U.S.-based startups. Its funding pace picked up last year with six investments recorded by VentureSource.

HP was a troubled company during much of the past decade, changing chief executives and finally "http://www.wsj.com/articles/hewlett-packard-officially-files-to-split-1435783640" as a way to revive its businesses. To critics of corporate venturing, that pattern shows how corporate investors face a higher risk of being blown off course by their shifting business fortunes, compared to venture firms with funds built to last 10 years or more.

Paul Sestili, a general partner at "http://www.rogersvp.com/" and the new chairman of the corporate venture group at the National Venture Capital Association, thinks that corporate venturing has matured with more-experienced managers and a better sense of the investment process among corporate chiefs.

 It just feels to me when I talk to people that there's a much better understating at the C level on the importance of venture as a piece of your overall innovation puzzle," he said.

HP's two venture groups are worth watching as a test of that premise.

SOHO

New Office-Retail

Project Under Way

Related Cos. and LargaVista Cos. have broken ground on an office and retail building at a former gas station site in SoHo.

The $200 million, seven-story boutique building at 300 Lafayette St. will have about 30,000 square feet of retail and 50,000 square feet of office space. The developers have obtained $88 million in construction financing from Deutsche Bank, said Avi Kollenscher, a senior vice president at Related. Real-estate services firm JLL is the project's exclusive leasing agent.

"What has changed so much is the migration of Fortune 500 companies and financial and creative firms who want to locate companies downtown," said Mr. Kollenscher, who added that building a high-end office complex in SoHo is a "rare opportunity."

The building, designed by Rick Cook, a partner at COOKFOX Architects DPC, will feature terraces landscaped with native plants on each office floor. The building will front Crosby, Lafayette and East Houston streets.

FLATIRON DISTRICT

Castro Building Gets

Another New Tenant

A marketing analytics firm will move its Manhattan headquarters to the Castro Building, where the famed furniture maker Castro Convertibles once had its showrooms, according to the Castro family and brokers.

Datorama Inc. has signed a seven-year lease for 12,192 square feet at 43 W. 23rd St. Its Manhattan office, now located at 30 Irving Place, has grown from 10 employees in 2014 to 40 today, said Richard Posluszny, Datorama's marketing manager.

It expects to have about 65 staff in its New York office by year's end.

The lease caps the Castro family's repositioning of the building, a campaign that began three years ago with help from real-estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield. The family has made technological and aesthetic upgrades to the building, which it has owned since 1972. The goal was to create a hub for technology and creative tenants.

"We got lucky that the bones of the building allowed us to marry the new and keep the old," said Terri Keogh, president of Castro Properties LLC.

Robert Billingsley, vice chairman at Cushman, and Bryan Boisi, vice president, represented the landlord.

MIDTOWN

Retail Condo Unit

Fetches $9.5 Million

An investor group including principals of Okada & Co. is paying $9.5 million for a 5,000-square-foot retail unit in a condominium-conversion project tied to a recent money-laundering lawsuit.

The buying group, including Christopher Okada and Francis Leung, is expected to close on the retail space at 135 W. 52nd St. as early as Monday, according to Mr. Okada. He said the seller was a group including developer Joseph Chetrit and the space has been leased by a BLT Prime steakhouse.

Mr. Chetrit's group has been converting the building, the former Flatotel, into condos. It purchased the property in 2013.

A civil lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan in October by Kazakhstan's largest city, Almaty, and one of the its biggest lenders, BTA Bank, alleged that Mr. Chetrit conspired with two Kazakh men to hide $40 million by investing in the Flatotel and other property.

At the time, representatives of the two Kazakh men denied the charges and Mr. Chetrit didn't respond. In November, Mr. Chetrit and the two plaintiffs in the suit said they had "amicably resolved" the matter. Mr. Chetrit didn't respond to a request for comment last week.

Hedge funds and universities find mutual benefit from closer ties; Higher Education: Funding gap

Austerity cuts spark new links in search for patterns among vast amounts of data

Hedge funds are stepping in to fill a funding gap left by government austerity measures at universities that has made them more reliant on donations, tuition fees and investments.

The money is funding institutes focused on mathematics, data science and finance. While the motivation of the hedge funds varies, it is facilitating closer ties that some of them hope will create opportunities for research and to recruit sought-after holders of maths and physics doctorates.

Quant firms, which rely on computer algorithms to predict moves in the financial markets, often hire such experts straight from university. However, today the funds are up against the likes of Google, Facebook and others trying to make sense of an ever-expanding amount of data.

"The best decisions in life are when you tick a lot of boxes at once," said Ian Barnard, a partner at Capital Generation Partners, which invests on behalf of individuals, charities and endowments.

"I imagine it's partly a legacy or status thing, to have your name on the door," he said. "But the people who are doing this are true scientists, and one shouldn't underestimate their desire to support what they think is important."

This week, a centre at Cambridge university funded by Cantab Capital Partners opened; Man Group's quantitative trading division AHL launched a centre for machine learning at Oxford university; and Omni Partners bought a 50 per cent stake in a systematic trading company out of University College London.

It is not just quants that are giving money. Recently, hedge funds such as Lansdowne and Brevan Howard have provided millions of pounds to British universities.

Man AHL's relationship with Oxford is about a decade old, when the Oxford-Man Institute of Quantitative Finance was founded with 13.75m from the London-based hedge fund. Its centre is more of a collaboration between business and academia than the others. The firm aims to incorporate the research prod-uced at the centre, thought to be the first that will focus solely on machine learning in finance, into its trading algorithms.

"This is not like giving money purely philanthropically, it has to have a clearer objective behind it," said Sandy Rattray, chief executive of Man AHL. "The main driver is the research. We have more data than we ever had before and we'd like to find patterns in that."

There will be no restriction on academics publishing research, and it is up to AHL to translate how those ideas can be used for trading. "We're not expecting academics to do AHL's research, what we are expecting is that they'll introduce us to new techniques," Mr Rattray said.

Research from the institute has already been used by AHL, he said. Two such areas are galaxy classifications, which they found could be used to classify analysts' recommendations, and on the estimation of the height of tides.

The problem with measuring tides is that sensors often break due to weather and water damage, leaving gaps in information. Techniques were created to fill in holes in the data using machine learning, and these have been used by AHL to predict gaps in markets when exchanges are closed, Mr Rattray said.

One of AHL's competitors, Cantab Capital, said its 5m donation to Cambridge university to open the Institute for Mathematics of Information was purely philanthropic.

"I don't think the process of outsourcing your research to academia is the right approach," said Ewan Kirk, Cantab's chief investment officer.

Cantab Capital, which is based in Cambridge, will have no involvement or input into the work done at the school, but plans to offer internships. The institute opened this week and will take the first six PhD candidates in October.

"Information is the next frontier in science, and it's something that we find interesting," Mr Kirk said.

"We produce vast amounts of information; an un-thinkable amount. Managing and und-erstanding that data are a big problem."

Omni, a London hedge fund, has bou-ght a 50 per cent stake in Banking Scien-ce, a systematic trading company which emerged from UCL's Centre for Doctoral Training. The fund, BSL, will be part-owned by two members of UCL's staff.

One of the largest donations, 20.1m, has come from Alan Howard of hedge fund Brevan Howard to create a centre for financial analysis at Imperial College that will research market contagion.

FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - MONEY
UK lags behind on a pensions dashboard; Comment

Could you name all the pension schemes of which you have been a member through your working life, with a rough idea of how much money is in each?

Did you contact all of your past schemes every time you changed your home address? Unless you are extremely well organised, the chances are that your answer to these two questions would be no.

If you live in Sweden or the Netherlands, you can go online and see all of your pensions in one place. But in the UK this is currently impossible. Surely consumers deserve better?

The idea of a single place where you can see your state, company and private pensions is not new. For example, in 2014 the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) undertook a study of retirement incomes and recommended the creation of a " Pensions Dashboard " to help people know what pension rights they have. Yet, while other countries already have dashboards in place, in the UK we remain stuck in the slow lane with only a Budget promise of something by 2019.

Naturally, there are many practical issues that would need to be resolved for a dashboard to be successful, but none of these is insurmountable. First, given that state pensions are still a significant part of the retirement income of most people, the government needs to make sure that information about state pensions is part of any scheme.

But the work of digitising national insurance records is now well advanced and so this should not be a major problem.

Also relatively straightforward to include would be the pension arrangements which have been used for automatic enrolment . In general, these are on modern computer systems with reliable and up-to-date data and this could easily be the first information that could be added to a dashboard.

It is important to start somewhere and with frequent job changes many people will soon have two or more small pension pots because of automatic enrolment. This data needs to go on to the dashboard.

More difficult are the older pensions that were taken out decades ago.

The data quality for many of these is poor and there would be a big data matching job to be done. But with billions of pounds of unclaimed pension assets, reuniting these pension pots with their owners could be a big win for consumers.

Also tricky would be including traditional defined benefit pension rights (also known as final salary). Many such schemes have large numbers of "deferred" members who are no longer building up new pension rights but who have not yet retired.

Schemes do not routinely contact deferred members and may leave these accounts dormant until pension age. There would be considerable cost and complexity for schemes if they were asked to supply up-to-date information for deferred members to a central database, and they would be unlikely to do so unless it was mandatory.

Once you can see your pensions in one place you can start to make decisions about whether you have your money in the right place. But a note of caution - it can be very difficult to compare different sorts of pensions without expert advice.

For example, some pensions may have valuable guarantees attached to them which may not be apparent from a simple headline fund value.

Similarly, a scheme with higher charges is not necessarily worse than a scheme with lower charges. There is a danger that consumers may make the wrong choices if the information is presented in too simplistic a way. But this is an argument for helping consumers to make good decisions, not for delaying giving them information about their own pension rights.

There are many interested parties and many vested interests in this debate. But there is huge potential benefit for consumers in being able to see all their pensions in one place and to make more informed choices about their future.

This discussion will drag on for years more unless the UK government and regulators follow the lead of countries around the world and drive this process to a conclusion in the interests of consumers.

Uber s Ride-Sharing Dominance Comes Under Pressure; Apple s $1 billion investment in China s Didi highlights rapidly shifting landscape of ride-sharing

Several months ago, Uber Technologies Inc. seemed like the unstoppable king of ride-sharing. Apple Inc.'s $1 billion investment in a top rival caps a series of events showing how quickly that has changed.

Uber, locked in a battle with regulators across the globe and struggling to quell unrest in the ranks of its one million drivers, must now go head-to-head with startups whose backers include the largest computer maker in the world, China's biggest Internet companies, and a titan of auto making.

Along with its "http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2016/05/13/apple-invests-1-billion-in-didi-ubers-rival-in-china/", China's Didi Chuxing Technology Co. could have access to the company's vast technology and marketing resources that would help it reach millions of new users and develop the next generation of products in the fast-evolving world of transportation.

Didi, which has raised at least $5 billion in funding, has already proven it can compete in a fundraising battle with Uber's China operation. It also has powerful Chinese allies in e-commerce company Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Internet giant Tencent Holdings Ltd., which are aiming to invest more money in Didi's latest fundraising round that values the startup at about $25 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. Didi's service is integrated with both Alibaba's Alipay payment service and Tencent's messaging app, WeChat.

Uber's biggest U.S. competitor, Lyft Inc., received a jolt earlier this year from General Motors Co., "http://www.wsj.com/articles/gm-invests-500-million-in-lyft-plans-system-for-self-driving-cars-1451914204" in a pact aimed at bolstering the car maker's ambitions to compete in the future landscape of self-driving cars. GM and Lyft, valued at $5.5 billion in the funding round, said last week they plan to begin "http://www.wsj.com/articles/gm-lyft-to-test-self-driving-electric-taxis-1462460094" next year.

Travis Kalanick, Uber's co-founder and chief executive, marked the news of Apple's investment in his characteristic brash fashion with a jab at his competitors. In a tweet early Friday morning, Mr. Kalanick wrote that his girlfriend's stock in the iPhone-maker makes her an indirect investor in his competitor. He added the hashtags  #ridesharewars" and  #thanksalottim," referring to Apple CEO Tim Cook.

An Uber spokesman declined to comment on Apple's investment in Didi.

Uber, which has raised more than $10 billion in debt and equity and was recently valued at $62.5 billion, has worked to build its own base of global allies, from Chinese search giant Baidu Inc. to Bennett Coleman & Co., the publisher of the Times of India newspaper. Those partners have helped Uber expand in China and India, respectively two markets Mr. Kalanick has highlighted to his investors as the company's largest opportunities for expansion.

But in some ways, the ride-hailing leader has used its cash to carve out its competitive position rather than rely on the help of partners. Last year, as an array of deep-pocketed tech giants from Apple to Alphabet Inc. upped their investments in autonomous vehicle research, Uber poached 40 of the world's top robotics researchers and scientists from Carnegie Mellon University and began its own self-driving car project at a new technology center in Pittsburgh.

One of Uber's other corporate relationships has become more fraught. Google Ventures, the investment arm of Alphabet Inc., invested more than $250 million in Uber in 2013, its single largest investment at the time. Since then, Google began to test its own ride-hailing apps, and Uber began to develop its own mapping and self-driving car technology, in competition with Google. David Drummond, senior vice president of corporate development for Alphabet, remains on Uber's board.

Uber's do-it-yourself approach contrasts with the growing alliance between its competitors. Didi last year invested $100 million in Lyft, kicking off a partnership that has evolved into a multipronged international alliance. Didi and Lyft have tied their apps together so that Chinese visitors to the U.S. can hail a ride using Lyft's service, and vice versa. Southeast Asia's GrabTaxi Holdings Pte. Ltd. and India's Ola plan to introduce similar features in the coming months.

Apple's investment will go to strengthen an Uber rival in the one market where Uber is already the underdog. UberChina, a Chinese subsidiary of the ride-hailing company is locked in a fierce battle with Didi to attract riders and investors in China's ride-share market. Didi and UberChina have competed to raise billions from local investors, using the cash to subsidize incentives to win drivers and riders to their services.

The deal with Apple could bolster Didi's technology research. The company established a center called Didi Research to focus on machine learning, artificial intelligence, data mining and other areas.

Playboy Unveils  Safe For Work  Web Video Slate; Rizvi Traverse Management-backed magazine publisher is exploring a sale

Playboy Enterprises Inc. is exploring selling the famed magazine company, but in the meantime, it's trying to sell itself to advertisers.

The publisher, which cut out nudity in its print product beginning with the March 2016 issue, unveiled a slate of digital video programming covering topics like tech, food and gaming at its first-ever NewFront presentation to media buyers and marketers on Friday.

The new series include  Tech 360," a virtual reality show where blogger Jon Rettinger and model Amy Willerton explore tech destinations,  Journalista," a Vice-like documentary series in which Playboy correspondent Yoonj Kim looks into subcultures surrounding sex and drugs, and a show where a comedian and mixologist discuss the news of the week over cocktails.

Playboy, whose website has been  safe for work" since August 2014, also announced scripted series like  Fronting," which features Vine star Jon Paul Piques and follows a group trying to run a sports agency, and  Robots are Hard," a futuristic comedy about an artificial intelligence company.

At the annual NewFronts, digital media companies promote their nascent Web series to advertisers in a model that echoes the TV industry's  upfront" presentations of their fall seasons. To be sure, shows announced at the NewFronts have a tendency to never get off the ground if advertisers aren't interested.

Playboy Chief Executive Scott Flanders said that while the magazine was transforming, its  Playmates" are still the  single best brand ambassadors."

The event comes weeks after Playboy began shopping itself around with the help of investment bank Moelis & Co. People familiar with the matter say Playboy could fetch more than $500 million if it is sold wholly, though it is also exploring selling smaller pieces of the business, like its licensing arm or famed Playboy Mansion. The 5-acre Los Angeles property was put up for sale earlier this year.

Playboy founder Hugh Hefner owns about a third of the company, which he took private in 2011 with private-equity firm Rizvi Traverse Management. According to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, Playboy generated $38 million in revenue from its magazine and digital publishing unit last year, and $55 million from licensing its brand to other companies.

The publisher has struggled to regain the cultural clout it had in its heyday. Playboy's circulation has fallen to 800,000 from its peak of 5.6 million in 1975, according to Alliance for Audited Media.

At the event, Playboy announced the creation of an in-house branded content studio. Media companies like the New York Times, CNN, Cond Nast and The Wall Street Journal have similar groups working to fashion sponsored content for advertisers.

Hugh Garvey, Playboy's deputy editor and head of branded content, said the company wants to help brands in  uniquely sexy and impactful ways."

General Atlantic has emerged as a frontrunner in an auction to buy a controlling stake in Argus Media, in a deal that could value the energy reporting agency at around 950m, according to people familiar with the matter.

The London-based company, which helps assess global oil prices and provide industry news, could enter exclusive talks with General Atlantic, a US private equity group, in the next couple of days, they said.

The sale of a 50 per cent plus stake would see members of the founding Nasmyth family pocket hundreds of millions of pounds. It would also make dozens of Argus employees   including some of its senior journalists   paper multi-millionaires. These include chairman Adrian Binks and Ian Bourne, the editor in chief, report Joseph Cotterill, Neil Hume and Arash Massoudi.

General Atlantic and Argus Media could not be reached for comment.

In contrast to traditional news organisations, which have struggled amid falling circulation and a shift to digital advertising, groups that focus on providing specialist industry data are thriving.

There have been several transactions involving financial data and media companies over the past couple of years. These include the $13bn merger of data providers Markit and IHS, Verisk Analytics  agreement to buy Wood Mackenzie for 1.9bn in March, and McGraw Hill Financial s proposal to purchase SNL Financial for $2.2bn in July.

Argus is expected to generate earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of around 45m in 2016, the people said, placing a multiple of at least 18 times on the business.

The London-based company, which helps assess global oil prices and provide industry news, is expected to enter exclusive talks with General Atlantic, a US private equity group, in the next couple of days, people involved in the process said.

It would also make dozens of Argus employees   including some of its senior journalists   paper multimillionaires. These include chairman Adrian Binks and Ian Bourne, the editor in chief.

General Atlantic declined to comment, while Argus could not be reached for comment.

Argus is expected to generate earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of around 45m in 2016, the people said, placing a multiple of at least 20 times on the business.

In contrast to traditional news organisations, which have struggled amid falling circulation and shift to digital advertising, groups that focus on providing specialist industry data are thriving.

There have been several transactions involving financial data and media companies over the past couple of years. These include the planned $13bn merger of data providers Markit and IHS, Verisk Analytics  agreement to buy Wood Mackenzie for 1.9bn in March, and McGraw Hill Financial s proposal to purchase SNL Financial for $2.2bn in July.

Argus was founded in the 1970s by Jan Nasmyth, a former Treasury official and British Army Officer, as a weekly newsletter covering the Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Antwerp products market. Over the following decades it expanded into other markets. The company s closest rival is S&P Global Platts.

The company appointed Bank of America Merrill Lynch earlier this year to conduct a review of its business after receiving approaches from several prospective investors, including trade buyers and private equity funds.

Mr Binks, who announced in June that he was stepping down as Argus s chief executive, is understood to be committed to retaining his stake in the company. But other shareholders, including members of the founding Nasmyth family which own 52 per cent of the company s A shares, are selling out. Mr Nasmyth died in 2008 at the age of 90.

Mr Binks holds A and B shares which make up a 30 per cent stake in Argus. During the auction he has insisted on a number of conditions before agreeing to back a deal.

General Atlantic saw off competition from a numbers buyers for the stake including Hellman & Friedman which offered around 800m, the people involved said.

Many of the businesses that fall into the "research and consulting services" sector sell stuff that sounds nice to have - and likely to be ditched in hard times. Not Experian. The second-largest company in the sector, it derives half its sales from credit services. Knowing who your customer is, and whether they will be inclined to pay you back, is fundamental.

Entry barriers are steep - it has records on 1bn consumers - so margins are high (43 per cent on a gross basis). Sales growth should beat GDP long term, since countries rely more on automatic credit checking as they grow richer. Stripped of currency effects, organic growth was 5 per cent in the last quarter of 2016.

Unsurprisingly, Experian shares are pricey, at 20 times next year's earnings. Its newer services work by collecting all that can be known about consumers, like Facebook or Alphabet do. This is a play on big data.

Man Group PLC, one of the world's biggest hedge-fund firms, is changing the focus of an Oxford University research department it funds to "machine learning" as firms increasingly embrace technology to gain a competitive edge.

Man, which manages $78.6 billion in assets, has put millions of dollars into the Oxford Man Institute, or OMI, since setting it up in 2007, with the aim of tapping some of its research ideas.

The unit, which has been researching subjects such as statistics, economics and financial-asset prices, will now focus solely on machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence in which computers learn from data rather than simply acting on it, and data analytics.

DEUTSCHE BOERSE

CEO Gives Update

On LSE Merger

Deutsche Boerse AG Chief Executive Carsten Kengeter said Wednesday that a merger with the London Stock Exchange would create a global exchange player in Europe, and a tie-up would make sense even if the U.K. decides to quit the European Union in June.

Speaking at the Deutsche Boerse shareholders' meeting, Mr. Kengeter again said that the joint entity would have a registered office in London and be listed both there and in Frankfurt. But questions remain over whether German policy makers would allow Deutsche Boerse to be controlled by a holding company that was neither located nor supervised in the European Union.

Mr. Kengeter said he expected regulators in the U.K. and Germany to approve the tie-up, but didn't speculate on whether the U.K. would exit the EU. He also said talks about the merger with officials in Hesse -- the German state in which Deutsche Boerse is headquartered -- were going well, but declined to comment further.

"With the merger, we will create a European player that will compete on a global basis," Mr Kengeter said in a speech to shareholders.

The looming U.K. referendum on EU membership remains a big hurdle for the tie-up of the two exchange operators. People familiar with the matter have said German authorities likely wouldn't approve the deal if Deutsche Boerse were controlled by a holding company outside the EU.

Man Group PLC, one of the world's biggest hedge-fund firms, is changing the focus of an Oxford University research department it funds to "machine learning" as firms increasingly embrace technology to gain a competitive edge.

Man, which manages $78.6 billion in assets, has put millions of dollars into the Oxford Man Institute, or OMI, since setting it up in 2007, with the aim of tapping some of itsresearch ideas.

The unit, which has been researching a range of subjects such as statistics, economics and financial-asset prices, will now focus solely on machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence in which computers learn from data rather than simply acting on it, and data analytics.

Computer-driven hedge funds, which employ physicists and mathematicians to build trading algorithms, are focusing on areas such as artificial intelligence and big data as they attempt to gain any trading edge they can.

The idea behindusing machine learning is that a computer will recognize subtle, possibly moneymaking patterns among the data that would be undetectable to humans.

Sandy Rattray, chief executive of Man's computer-driven AHL unit, saidthe company'sallocation to machine learning hasbeen increasing.

The firm made about half of last year's profit in its $4.1 billion AHL Dimension fund from machine learning, said a person familiar with the fund's performance, higher than the previous year.

Machine learning algorithms made money for the fund late last summer when they started taking positions shortly before markets rebounded.

A spokeswoman for Man Group declined to comment on performance.

Man, which was founded in 1783, initially gave GBP13.75 million ($19.86 million) to fund the OMI and said in 2013 that it was extending the funding by five years. It declined to disclose further financial details.

Mr. Rattray said that while human traders may say that "markets feel a bit like" a certain period in the past, machine-learning algorithms could actually look at and analyze different characteristics of markets from different periods of history at the same time.

"In five years' time will we have machine-learning funds? I don't know but I certainly expect so if things continue at the current rate," he said.

Sir, Congratulations on your excellent week-long series on the robot economy (" Bring on the robots but reboot our societies too" , Editorial, May 7). As the march of the machines accelerates to a gallop, George Osborne, the chancellor, should reorder the tax system to protect human jobs and wellbeing, while allowing for technological progress.

I suggest two immediate priorities: to introduce a new set of employment taxes on robot, artificial intelligence and software applications that demonstrably displace people in the workplace; and, to phase in a universal citizen's income. As the Bank of England warned last year, intelligent machines may soon make half of the UK's workforce redundant. Where machines have mass replaced workers in the past - as in agriculture - there were significant but relatively slow social upheavals, where our unique cognitive abilities meant people could learn new skills in new jobs.

If the option of skilling up is removed for most by AI, and new and existing jobs taken by machines, widespread unemployment must result. To slow such labour market dislocations, give time for society to adapt and make it cheaper for private and public sectors to hire humans, these machine taxes should be hypothecated and national insurance contributions be commensurately reduced. Automata are here to stay, and jobs will go. The prospect of more leisure time "to enjoy" - the glib response of technophiles - will not reassure those for whom work is self-validation.

A citizen's income, being trialled in Finland, Ontario and Utrecht, can allow the jobless to play an active role in our market economy, while simplifying the mess that is the UK's welfare budget. Laying to rest the spectre of millions of unemployed is no Luddite brake on progress but an imperative for a moral political economy that Adam Smith would recognise.

Markit s Profit Falls on Higher Personnel Costs; U.K. financial-data provider says merger with U.S. information and analytics  provider IHS on track to close in second half

Financial-data provider Markit Ltd . posted revenue gains in its latest quarter, but profit fell as the U.K.-based company prepares to merge with U.S. information and analytics provider IHS Inc .

The companies announced the deal in April, valuing Markit at about $5.8 billion, or $31.13 a share. By moving to the U.K., IHS will be able to take advantage of the country's lower corporate-tax rate through what is known as a tax inversion, a way for U.S. companies to avoid paying taxes at home. The new company is to be called IHS Markit.

Tuesday, Markit said the deal was still on track to close in the second half of the year. In April, the U.S. Treasury Department issued new rules designed to stymie such tax-lowering deals, resulting in Pfizer Inc . and Ireland-based Allergan PLC canceling their planned $150 billion merger.

London-based Markit feeds data about derivatives, currencies, loans and other products, and provides services such as software, instant messaging, and trading links to big banks and other financial institutions. Markit went public in 2014, raising $1.3 billion with shares priced at $24.

Markit said acquisitions contributed $18.4 million, or 6.8%, to revenue growth in the quarter. Last year, Markit bought DealHub, a provider of trade processing to the foreign-exchange market, and Information Mosaic , a software provider for post trade processing. In March, Markit said it acquired the credit default swap pricing service of Fitch Solutions.

Markit's revenue grew 1.0% on an organic basis, which strips out the impact of acquisitions and currency swings.

Overall for the quarter ended March 31, Markit reported a profit of $24.7 million, or 13 cents a share, down from $54.5 million, or 29 cents a share a year prior. Excluding charges and other special items, earnings were 35 cents a share, down a penny from the previous year.

Revenue grew 6% to $287.8 million.

Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expected 36 cents a share in earnings on $294 million in revenue.

Share-based compensation jumped to $24.1 million from $9.9 million previously.

Markit's information-services unit, which accounts for 45% of the company's top line, logged a 4.9% increase in organic revenue on new business and increased customer assets under management in products benchmarked to Markit's indexes.

Its solutions division, the unit offering systems and software, posted a 4% organic revenue increase on new business in its managed services division, partially offset by lower relative growth rates in loan assets under management.

Its trade-processing division reported a 9.6% decline in organic revenue, hurt by price reductions in its derivatives business and lower volumes in credit and rates asset classes.

Shares, inactive premarket, have risen 27% over the past three months.

Lending Club founder Laplanche quits after inquiry into loans sale

Renaud Laplanche , founder and chief executive of Lending Club, resigned yesterday after an internal inquiry, sending the shares crashing and underscoring a sharp reversal in fortunes for the online lending industry.

The San Francisco-based group said Mr Laplanche had not only been involved in a sale of loans to a big investor that violated company practices but had also failed to disclose personal interests in a fund that Lending Club had been considering as an investment.

The announcement, which comes as the industry struggles under tougher credit conditions and tighter regulation, sent Lending Club shares down more than a quarter, in their worst day since the 2014 initial public offering.

"It's a big shock," said Matt Burton, chief executive of Orchard, a New York-based analytics firm. "Renaud is one of the faces of the industry; one of the first people to build this business."

Lending Club has been at the forefront of the online lending movement, which was fuelled by demand for high-yielding assets after the financial crisis.

Throughout last year, even as its share price drooped, Lending Club kept up its blistering growth. But as regulation tightens, and as losses rise among the riskiest customer segments, some hedge fund investors are turning up their noses at the returns on offer.

The company said it had supplied loans to one buyer that did not fit the buyer's specifications. The loans, totalling $22m, had been bought by Jefferies, the Wall Street bank, according to people familiar with the situation.

Jefferies declined to comment.

"While the financial impact . . . was minor, a violation of the company's business practices along with a lack of full disclosure during the review was unacceptable to the board," Lending Club said.

"Accordingly, the board took swift and decisive action."

Mr Laplanche could not be reached for immediate comment.

Pitch battle; FT BIG READ: PROFESSIONAL SERVICES

After criticism of its failure to raise the alarm before the financial crisis, the audit industry faces a shake-up. With companies forced to tender for contracts, the Big Four firms are pouring money into technology. By Harriet Agnew

In 1896, Puccini's opera La bohme premiered in Turin, Queen Victoria surpassed her grandfather King George III as the UK's longest-reigning monarch and professional services firm PwC - then Cooper Brothers - began auditing Barclays.

In 2014, PwC was still the auditor of Barclays, when the UK bank announced it was putting the contract out to tender for the first time in almost 120 years. The move was sparked bynew European regulations designed to shake up the audit market in the wake of the financial crisis.

PwC's relationship with Barclays is one of the starkest examples of a tendency for companies to hang on to their auditors for decades.

But this is now changing. Under EU regulations that come into force in June - drawn up to try and improve competition and choice in the audit market - companies have to put their audit out to tender every decade and change supplier every 20 years at least.

The UK is taking a lead. In the past few years, anticipation of the new regime sparked a frenzy of audit tendering from over half of the constituents in the FTSE 100 index. More than one in five companies think transition costs to change auditor will be 20-50 per cent of their current annual audit fee, according to a report last month from EY. Audit mandates from FTSE 100 companies including Reckitt Benckiser, Centrica and Rolls-Royce are currently being reviewed.

The result is a brave new world of competitive pitching in which the professional services firms are pouring money into technology as they try to pick up audit business from their rivals. So far the result has been a merry-go-round of audits swapping between the Big Four - PwC, Deloitte, EY and KPMG - which handle 98 per cent of FTSE 350 audits and 95 per cent of those for Fortune 500 companies.

Adrian Stone, head of UK audit at KPMG, says: "The tendering environment has made people press the accelerator on innovation." KPMG, for example, is in the middle of a $1bn investment programme in data analytics, and new technologies.

The rules are being introduced at the same time as a separate push by the UK accountancy regulator, the Financial Reporting Council, designed to improve audit quality and innovation in a profession where aspects of the work are vulnerable to being replaced by machines.

The firms are also seeking to address claims that audit standards globally are at risk from the prominence of their typically faster-growing and more lucrative consulting arms . Critics claim the shifting balance of activities could threaten auditor quality and independence.

"The accounting profession is at a tipping point," says Hywel Ball, head of UK audit at EY. "We need to innovate and remain relevant in the 21st century."

Personal services

Faced with these challenges, professional services firms are harnessing technological developments.

"Workflow automation, data analytics and artificial intelligence are fundamentally changing how audit is done," says Jon Raphael, chief innovation officer at Deloitte in New York.

The changes render obsolete many of the techniques, such as sampling, that auditors have relied on for decades. They threaten the industry's employment model, which has relied on hiring legions of graduates to carry out mundane administrative work. And they present a mounting challenge for the regulators who oversee the profession.

The overhaul of audit comes as the Big Four are still trying to shake off criticism for failing to raise the alarm in the run-up to the financial crisis over the overstretched business models of financial institutions. Banks including Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and HBOS collapsed or were bailed out by taxpayers months after being signed off with a clean bill of health by their auditors.

A string of corporate scandals since the crisis, including at Tesco, Quindell and Fifa , has compounded the pressure on auditors to sharpen their service.

The globalisation of companies, combined with advances in technology, has resulted in an explosion of data. Auditors are now trying to play a role in translating that information into meaningful business intelligence for clients. In essence, it is converting them from firms that sign off on other people's calculations into hands-on inquisitors.

"The possibilities are enormous," says James Chalmers, head of assurance at PwC. "Today the costs are pretty high but they won't be tomorrow."

At the heart of developments in data mining is the ability of auditors to collect, analyse and test entire data sets. In the past they relied on restricted samples of data. Now, for example, auditors can analyse an entire set of accounting journals - used by some companies to record adjusted entries and unique financial transactions - rather than just taking a sample of journals that provided a snapshot.

This wider view can highlight anomalies like entries posted by unexpected people or at odd times, such as weekends. They can also analyse entire sets of expenses and potentially expose claims for personal travel, for example.

The ubiquity of email and social network usage has resulted in the proliferation of so-called "unstructured" data, in the form of emails, posts on Facebook or LinkedIn, or tweets. Auditors are increasingly trawling this data to gauge sentiment and uncover potentially erroneous behaviour. Comments or complaints on social media can give an early indication of potential contingent liabilities, such as brand damage, environmental issues and future litigation.

One element of the analytics research involves using predictive technologies based on past data to run "what-if" scenarios for the future. In 2014 KPMG signed an alliance with McLaren Group to apply the same predictive analytics and technology it uses for its Formula One team to KPMG's audit and consulting clients. The technology can run live scenarios on how changes in a company's cash flow, interest rates or marketing spend will affect its revenue. Specific scenarios might include how China's anti-graft crackdown is likely to hit luxury goods sales, or how sunny weather could impact a brewer.

Rise of the robots

The changes are likely to be most keenly felt in areas where auditors use technology to replace those parts of the process previously done manually. EY, which hired 1,200 graduates in the UK and Ireland in 2015, estimates this number could fall by half in 2020. Technological advances include using applications that allow mobile devices to check physical inventory and transmit results while on site. EY and PwC are investigating the use of drones in stock counts of capital assets such as machinery.

Artificial intelligence tools are in their infancy but professional services industries are creating models to "read" thousands of complex documents, hunting for keywords and patterns.

Deloitte has developed a tool called Argus that uses machine learning technology to scan electronic papers and automatically identify and extract key accounting information from a wide range of document types ranging from sales, leasing and employment contracts to invoices.

These artificial tools then "learn" from every human interaction, which will over time increase their power as they gather more information.

"As you begin to apply artificial intelligence and machine learning you get a fabulous multiplier," says Richard Sexton, vice-chairman of global assurance at PwC. "The machine is beginning to learn something itself and the human intervenes to help it learn. That is in its very early stages."

As technology replaces much of the routine parts of the audit, this frees up time to spend on more important areas. It potentially also expands the scope of audit because it changes the nature of the discussion between a company and its auditor to areas such as financial risks, internal controls risks and strategic challenges.

"I don't think artificial intelligence will replace the profession but it will change what we do," says PwC's Mr Chalmers. "Technical knowledge will become increasingly commoditised and professionals will need to provide insight to stay relevant. This will require an understanding of a client's business, problems and risks together with the ability to work with new technologies and interrogate huge amounts of data to reach sound conclusions.

"We will be covering more ground and solving new problems," he predicts.

Deloitte's Mr Raphael agrees: "It's about saving time on low value work so you can move more quickly to the judgment part of the audit."

Sceptics caution that for all the hype about technological advancement, it is early days and the so-called improvements in audit come with their own risks. Analysing entire data sets also presents logistical problems. In the old method of data sampling, there might be only a handful of exceptional items; now there could be thousands of them.

"The challenge is what do you do with the exceptions," says KPMG's Mr Stone. "In the past you might have had 40 transactions in the sample, with two or three exceptions. Now you might have 4m transactions and 10,000 exceptions. You need to work out whether these are systemic or isolated - it could well be that 9,900 don't affect the accounts."

The speed of innovation is also a challenge for those policing the industry.

"Regulators are going to have to develop skills to make sure that when auditors extract the data they're doing it appropriately," says Brian Hunt, vice-chair of the International Forum of Independent Audit Regulators. "If that's not done, judgment goes out of the window because the data set is wrong."

One industry professional adds: "A big problem is that the large firms are moving quickly into technology-driven audit and the regulators don't have the resources and the specialists to keep up with what they're doing."

A stronger hand

Global accounting regulators are already grappling with trying to improve choice in a market dominated by the Big Four. There are fears that as these firms continue to invest in technology it could further reinforce their grip on the market.

"Technology has been developed by the Big Four at a considerable cost," says Michael Izza, chief executive officer of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. "It becomes a barrier to entry to the next tier of firms. You end up with greater concentration as the Big Four get economies of scale."

For the auditors themselves, they must rethink their recruitment strategies as vast swaths of the manual work that was historically performed by legions of graduates is automated. They are also reconsidering the profile of the people they are hiring.

While staff still need accounting and auditing skills and critical experience, technology, analytics and data specialists are increasingly in demand. Some people believe that large parts of their workforce could become redundant.

"Firms will no longer need armies of junior staff but instead will need the best algorithm design geeks in the world," says Jim Peterson, accounting specialist and author of Count Down: The Past, Present and Uncertain Future of the Big Four Accounting Firms . "They will audit large companies with a team that can fit into a conference room, rather than occupying an entire office tower."

New approach

Investors welcome extended reports

A key area of innovation in audits has been the introduction of long-form reports, which are designed to provide more information about the strategic risk in a business.

Audits used to offer a binary opinion on whether a company's financial statements present a "true and fair" view, in accordance with the accounting standards. But in 2013 the Financial Reporting Council, the UK accounting regulator, recommended the adoption of long-form reports to improve the dialogue between companies, auditors and the users of financial statements by introducing a qualitative dimension. Regulators in other countries are looking at similar moves.

"The extended audit report gives the audit community and investors more information about materiality, areas of principal judgment and risk areas," says Michael Izza, chief executive of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. Investors have broadly welcomed the move. "The use of advanced reports is one of the most notable developments in audit," says Iain Richards, head of responsible investment for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Columbia Threadneedle Investments. "It gives you much more confidence and understanding of where you need to have more conversations. We hope to see them rolled out more widely."

Another initiative, known as integrated reporting, aims to explain how a company is performing against its strategy. "Investors are looking for an understanding of a company's strategy and its business model," says Paul Druckman, chief executive at the International Integrated Reporting Council. "There are four lines of sight. We have terrific hindsight and oversight but we don't look at foresight and insight. Why shouldn't a trained auditor be able to give us foresight and insight?"

Pamplona Raises $1 Billion for TMT Fund, Backs Cloud-Based Web Manager; The firm made a $50 million growth-equity investment in venture-backed Dynamic Network Services

Pamplona Capital Management LLP said it raised $1 billion for a fund focused on investing in technology, media and telecommunications companies, adding that it struck its first deal from the vehicle.

The firm said it made a $50 million growth-equity investment in Dynamic Network Services Inc., a venture-backed provider of "http://dyn.com/".

John Halsted, a managing partner with the London firm, said a sector-dedicated fund was necessary as  the value metrics and the mind-set of people running a buyout fund, which is what we principally do at Pamplona, is quite different from that for TMT."

 These industries are evolving very quickly," he said.  To be on top of that and comfortable with the changes requires a very different mind-set from Pamplona's approach to investment in a generalist fund."

Pamplona TMT Fund I LP has a 10-year lifespan and is Pamplona's first industry-dedicated fund. The firm, which also has offices in New York and Ta'Xbiex, Malta, has been eager to enter the smaller end of the private-equity market, having previously carved out a portion of its  3 billion Pamplona Capital Partners IV LP fund for what the firm described as the "http://blogs.wsj.com/privateequity/2015/04/17/pe-goes-earlier-stage-in-health-care-investing-bain-co/"

Although the 2014 main fund invests up to $500 million in equity per deal, Mr. Halsted said the new fund would make 12 to 15 investments of about $50 million to $75 million each.

 The core Pamplona fund tends to be not as diversified," Mr. Halsted said.  But the risk and growth profiles of the new fund demand more diversification."

In the fund's first investment, Pamplona provided $50 million in Series B funding to Dynamic Network Services. The Manchester, N.H., company, which does business as Dyn, provides software as a service that helps companies such as Twitter Inc., Pfizer Inc. and Visa Inc. manage their cloud-based and Internet resources.

Pamplona Partner Justin Perreault said businesses are becoming more digital in their operations and have more business-critical information transmitted though the cloud, outside the control of their corporate data centers.

 It is critical for companies, whether they are social media, online retailers, banks, pharmaceutical companies or any company, to have a new generation of solutions to manage Internet-traffic performance, reliability and security," said Mr. Perreault.  That's what Dyn does and solves these problems in ways that existing solutions do not."

Dyn in 2012 "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00020121002e8a2qib9c?mod=undefined" from North Bridge, a Waltham, Mass.-based venture- and growth-capital investor that will remain an investor in the company.

Jeremy Hitchcock, Dyn's chief executive and co-founder, said the fresh capital will help expand the company's presence and new product offerings as well as potentially aid acquisitions.

 Customers are also using the Internet for things apart from advertising moving their private infrastructure to public infrastructure so we need to meet them in the market where they live, and that requires more field solutions, [more] engineering and more sophisticated sales," said Mr. Hitchcock.

Dyn which started with traffic-steering applications and later ventured into data and analytics said its revenue increased by 70% in the past two years and expects annual recurring revenue to be more than $100 million this year.

Pamplona has been making preparations for this new TMT fund for some time. Late last year, the firm hired Mr. Perreault, formerly a general partner at Commonwealth Capital Ventures, as a Boston-based partner for the fund. The vehicle is co-managed by two additional partners: Darren Battistoni and Hiren Mankodi.

Mr. Battistoni most recently was with Welsh Carson Anderson & Stowe's technology investment team. Mr. Mankodi led Audax Group's investments in information-technology, software and industrial-technology companies.

Mr. Perreault said the fund targets  large market segments where disruptive technologies are already reshaping the landscape," such as cloud computing, software-as-a-service applications, mobile platforms, and big data and analytics.

 These trends still have a long way to go, and the partners running the fund have backgrounds investing in these fields," said Mr. Perreault.  Over time, we will likely broaden out into other themes as new trends emerge."

He added that Pamplona doesn't have a strict definition for its technology targets, but is looking at companies with $30 million in annual revenue that are expanding at 20% or more each year.

 They don't necessarily need to be profitable, but have to have an established market presence that needs capital to expand, either by developing new product lines or through acquisitions," said Mr. Perreault.

Technology investments have calmed down from the deal frenzy over the past two years, with some venture-capital investors hitting the brakes on new transactions, causing "http://www.wsj.com/articles/startup-investors-hit-the-brakes-1460676478" in volume from the previous quarter to $13.9 billion.

Pamplona believes the timing could work to its advantage as  some of the market frothiness has come off," said Mr. Halsted.

Mr. Hitchcock said tamer market conditions might aid Dyn's expansion efforts.

 We've been profitable in the last couple of quarters while people are contracting, [and] we want to take advantage of the environment," he said.

Bitcoin business pioneer Jeff Garzik "https://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/jeff-garziks-stealthy-ploy-to-get-bitcoin-onto-private-blockchains/" over the weekend his latest venture Bloq will behave as a sort of consulting platform to bridge the world of private blockchains with bitcoin, because it is  very important to make Bitcoin a part of the blockchain discussion again .

But he also said this (our emphasis):

 It s the overall mission to make blockchain more acceptable, more stable and more widespread than ever before,  Garzik said.  And I think that s really going to be the success point within twenty years. Bloq is gonna be building a decentralized system. I like to call Bitcoin the first decentralized autonomous organism. There will be many more decentralized systems built on top of this technology and long-term Bloq is going to play a role in launching side chains and blockchains, and launching digital identity that s affordable and tying all that together. 

Admittedly, this is not the first time we ve come across cryptocurrency radicals touting blockchains and bitcoin as the path towards a naturally emergent and entirely autonomous artificial intelligence.

For example, one extremely vested party at a bitcoin conference over a year ago told us he envisaged the bitcoin blockchain would one day birth a creative minded digital entity. This entity would then, for example, craft creative musical content entirely independently, with us humble humans given the right to pay for it. We kid you not.

Ever since we ve been on watch for fintech mysticism pertaining to Global Organic Databases (a.k.a GODs) because, well & there is a not insignificant amount of millenarianism to it.

Bitcoin, we should note, is already steeped in "http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/", "http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/11330558/Millionaire-Bitcoin-Jesus-denied-entry-to-the-US.html", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keys_of_Heaven", "http://satoshiroundtable.org/", "http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/03/31/2158024/craig-wrights-upcoming-big-reveal/", "http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2016/05/02/2160632/oh-my-craig-wrights-keys-of-revelation/" and, of course, "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satoshi_Nakamoto".

The recent breakout in tech mysticism, however, "http://imgur.com/gallery/uc98W89", and that s without accounting for the great Craig Wright "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/769cc516-1370-11e6-839f-2922947098f0.html", and that s without accounting for the great Craig Wright

Our question as a consequence of all this: do the bitcoin radicals really believe what they re saying here? Or is this just part of the theatrics in play? If they do, could they please share the alleged benefits of a Skynet-style autonomous intelligence system for us humans? Because we re willing to bet most people would side with Sarah Connor on this.

One other thing to note.

In 1979, a team of magicians and tricksters led by the well known illusionist and committed sceptic James Randi, a.k.a The Amazing Randi, set out to expose public gullibility and people s tendency to believe the unbelievable.

It was a so-called long con.

Dubbed Project Alpha, it involved the magicians conspiring over four years to dupe academics, media professionals and scientists into believing psychic powers were possible and that telekinesis was scientifically provable.

In 1983, just as academic papers hailing psychic potential were being written, the group exposed the whole thing as a hoax.

In the press conference which followed the revelation, Randi   who had previously challenged the powers of well known Uri Geller   justified the experiment as saying:

  &.something had to be done because the parapsychologists had to be taught they could be fooled; they had said  we are too smart, we are too intelligent, we re too well informed, we re too good observers, no-one is going to be able to fool us . But they were fooled. 

So who is really fooling who, here, eh?

Lending Club chief executive steps down after internal review

The resignation of the founder and chief executive of Lending Club after an internal probe sent shares in the group crashing on Monday and underscored a sharp reversal in fortunes for the online lending industry.

As it presented earnings for the first quarter, the San Francisco-based company announced the departure of Renaud Laplanche, its founder, chairman and chief executive.

Not only had Mr Laplanche been involved in a sale of loans to a big investor that violated company business practices, the company said, he failed to disclose personal interests in a fund that "http://www.ft.com/topics/organisations/LendingClub_Corp" had been considering an investment.

Group president Scott Sanborn has become acting chief executive, supported by Hans Morris, a board director, who will assume the newly created role of executive chairman.

The announcement, which came as the industry struggled under tougher credit conditions and tighter regulation, caused Lending Club shares to drop more than a quarter, marking their worst day since the 2014 initial public offering.

 It s a big shock,  said Matt Burton, chief executive of Orchard, a New York-based analytics firm.  Renaud is one of the faces of the industry, one of the first people to build this business. 

San Francisco-based Lending Club has been at the forefront of the online lending movement, which was fuelled by demand for high-yielding assets in the wake of the financial crisis.

The company   which matches borrowers and investors using an online platform   arrived in the public markets with an all-star board of directors, including Lawrence Summers, former US Treasury secretary, John Mack, former chairman of Morgan Stanley and Mary Meeker, the technology analyst.

Throughout last year, even as the share price began to droop after investor lock-ups expired, Lending Club kept up its blistering pace of growth, regularly doubling the amount of loans it was originating compared with the same quarter a year earlier.

Now analysts have begun to talk about an inflection point. As regulation tightens, and as losses have started to rise among the riskiest customer segments, some hedge fund investors have begun to turn up their noses at the returns on offer. That means that the online lenders, which as non-banks cannot rely on deposits to fund loans, have had to scramble to find stable sources of long-term capital.

Rival Prosper Marketplace, which like Lending Club deals in unsecured consumer loans, said last week that it would lay off more than a quarter of its staff in response to a slowdown in its core unit. Publicly traded OnDeck Capital, a specialist in supplying loans to small businesses, revealed that growth had practically stalled in the first quarter.

Lending Club, too, has been caught in the funding squeeze. In an interview with the Financial Times in March, Mr Laplanche said that the group wanted to return to its roots as a peer-to-peer lender, matching individual investors with individual borrowers, rather than rely on big institutional investors to mop up supply.

At the same time regulators have urged banks to be more choosy about which platforms to back. In March the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation warned its regulated banks to ensure that they bought loans from only the most robust online lenders. Within the next couple of days, the US Treasury Department is expected to present the results of a fact-gathering exercise it began last summer, with the aim of developing the first regulatory framework for the fast-growing industry.

On Monday, Lending Club said that the company had supplied loans to one buyer that did not fit the buyer s specifications. The loans question, totalling $22m and sold in two transactions in late March and early April, were bought by Jefferies, the Wall Street bank, according to people familiar with the situation.

Jefferies declined to comment.

The loan sale sparked an internal review, which turned up the disclosure issue.  While the financial impact 	. 	. 	. 	was minor, a violation of the company s business practices along with a lack of full disclosure during the review was unacceptable to the board,  Lending Club s statement said:  Accordingly, the board took swift and decisive action. 

Lending Club s admission of weaknesses in its internal controls  highlights the risk of a rapidly growing business, and is likely to further accelerate the pace of regulatory scrutiny of the sector,  said Mike Taiano, a director at Fitch Ratings in New York.

The departure of Mr Laplanche overshadowed the company s results for the first quarter, which were slightly better than analysts had expected. Revenue jumped 87 per cent from the previous year to $152m, higher than estimates of $148m.

Net income for the March quarter came in at $4.28m, compared with a loss of $6.37m in the same period the year before.

Profile: Hans Morris

Lending Club s new executive chairman spent 27 years at Citigroup, rising to become the US bank s chief financial officer and head of finance, technology and operations for Citi Markets and Banking. He left and became president of Visa from 2007 to 2009 before moving to private equity group General Atlantic in 2010.

In 2014 he founded tech venture capital firm Nyca Partners with a plan to invest $20m-$25m over 18 months in financial technology companies. It focuses on alternative consumer credit, merchant payment solutions and financial infrastructure software.

He held a $4.3m stake, or almost 290,000 shares, in Lending Club at the time of its float and already sits on the lender s board.

Nyca has also invested in Indiegogo, a crowdfunding platform that competes with Kickstarter, and Affirm, a company founded by Max Levchin, PayPal co-founder and former chairman of Yelp, that seeks to create a new way for consumers to apply for short-term credit. Mr Morris is also an investor alongside former Citi chief executive Vikram Pandit in CommonBond, the student loan refinancing company.

Profile: Scott Sanborn

The acting chief executive joined Lending Club in 2013 as chief marketing officer and was promoted to the role of president only last month, giving him responsibility for all its product lines   personal loans, small business and patient and education financing   on top of marketing and product development.

He joined the online lender from eHealthInsurance, the listed US online health insurance provider, where he was head of marketing and revenue.

Before that he held senior marketing roles at RedEnvelope, the now defunct online gift company and Home Shopping Network, the television and online retailer.

A big shock in the world of peer-to-peer lending.

Renaud Laplanche has stepped down as chief executive and chairman of Lending Club after an internal review, the company announced on Monday.

The news sent shares in the company down more than 15 per cent in pre-market trading.

Lending Club said in a statement that Mr Laplanche s resignation followed the internal review of sales of $22m in near-prime loans to a single investor.

While the financial impact of this $22 million in loan sales was minor, a violation of the Company s business practices along with a lack of full disclosure during the review was unacceptable to the board. Accordingly, the board took swift and decisive action, and authorized additional remedial steps to rectify these issues.

The internal review also led to the discovery of another matter  involving a failure to inform the board s Risk Committee of personal interests held in a third party fund while the Company was contemplating an investment in the same fund. 

Although the company said the lack of disclosure had no impact on financial results for the first quarter, it has in light of the recent events decided to suspend forward guidance for the time being out of prudence. It has also has filed an extension request with the Securities and Exchange Commission to file its first quarter report.

Group president Scott Sanborn will become acting CEO with immediate effect. He will be supported by director Hans Morris who will assume the newly created role of executive chairman.

Mr Laplanche was a figurehead of the online lending industry   one of the  800-lb gorillas,  according to Matt Burton of Orchard, an analytics firm, along with Ron Suber of Prosper and Mike Cagney of SoFi.

The Frenchman s departure comes at a moment of reckoning for the industry, as operators across all asset classes try to secure stable sources of funding. Rising delinquencies among riskier borrowers, combined with broader wobbles in credit markets since the beginning of the year, have prompted investors such as hedge funds and banks to turn up their noses at the yields on offer.

Regulatory pressures are mounting too. Within the next couple of days the US Treasury Department is expected to present the results of a fact-gathering exercise it began last summer, with the aim of providing the first regulatory framework for the fast-growing industry.

 " Aberdeen Asset Management suffered a 12th consecutive quarter of net investor outflows and warned that it expected further withdrawals this year.

Europe's third-largest listed asset manager recorded 7.6bn of net outflows in the three months to the end of March but Martin Gilbert, the chief executive, said Aberdeen was starting to see inflows into some of its emerging markets funds.

However, Aberdeen's pre-tax profits almost halved, to 98.8m, in the six months to the end of March, compared with the same period a year earlier.

 " Negative-yielding government bonds are costing investors about $24bn annually , according to Fitch. The rating agency said last week that long-term investors, as well as insurers, banks, pension funds and money market funds, were under "increasing pressure" as a result of negative yields.

 " Mystery bond investors have raised eyebrows in Europe by lending millions of euros to governments for the next 100 years .

Centennial bonds are a rarity in debt markets but Ireland and Belgium have both raised  100m through the sale of 100-year bonds in recent weeks. Observers suspect the buyer is a single European insurer.

 " UBS suffered a big drop in its share price last week after reporting a steeper than expected fall in profits and warning that global financial market turmoil had paralysed client activity across its wealth management business.

The Swiss bank said client activity had been "exceptionally low" in the first three months of the year.

 " Sentient Technologies, an artificial intelligence company, plans to open its experimental hedge fund , which employs "evolutionary" algorithmic trading, to outside investors this year.

The San Francisco-based company, which was founded by some of the developers of Apple's Siri voice-recognition software, "breeds" investment algorithms into full-blown trading strategies. It has seen promising results from an equity portfolio it has run since 2014 and is aiming to become a fully fledged asset manager.

 " Electra, the London-listed private equity manager that owns Britain's biggest caravan park operator, Parkdean Resorts, defended its long-term record as it announced robust half-year results.

Electra, which also owns the UK franchise for the TGI Fridays restaurant chain, is under pressure to improve its performance from Edward Bramson , an activist shareholder.

Alex Fortescue, Electra's managing partner, described its latest results as "exceptional" ahead of the completion this autumn of a strategic review of its investments.

Buffett and Bogle unite against hedge funds; THE LAST WORD

Warren Buffett and Jack Bogle are the octogenarian opposites of investing: Buffett, the ultimate stockpicker, whose legacy includes educating a generation of value investors; Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, who has proselytised index investing for 40 years. Yet within a fortnight of each other, they gave essentially the same speech.

Mr Buffett described his 10-minute lesson on the stupidity of investing in hedge funds , delivered midway through Berkshire Hathaway's annual meeting in Omaha, as a "sermon". Mr Bogle's address to the Institute for Quantitative Finance in Washington earlier last month also had religious overtones. He pitched index investing as David fighting the intellectual Goliaths of algorithm-driven hedge funds, active mutual funds and the new breed of "smart- beta" managers.

It was a cute analogy because, as Malcolm Gladwell, the author, has pointed out, David was no underdog. A giant target weighed down by armour, Goliath was never going to be a match for a simple slinger of deadly stones.

The Goliaths of fund management believe that "the application of multiple complex equations - the language of science and technology, of engineering and mathematics, developed with computers processing big data , and trading stocks at the speed of light - make [them] far stronger and more powerful than are we indexing Davids", Mr Bogle said.

"The index fund relies on a simple arithmetic, a mathematical tautology that could be calculated by a second grader: gross return in the stock market, minus the frictional costs of investing, equals the net return that is shared by all investors as a group."

Mr Buffett made the same point at his meeting by asking the 18,000-strong crowd in the arena to imagine we were divided down the middle. On one side would be the "low energy" investors who buy half of everything that exists in the investment world and then do nothing, "a slovenly group that just sits for year after year". In the other half would be the "hyperactives", as he described them.

"This group, by definition, can't change from its half of the ultimate investment results. They are going to have the same results as the 'no energy' people but they're also going to have terrific expenses because they're all going to be moving around, hiring hedge funds, hiring consultants and paying lots of commissions. As a group, that half has to do worse than this half does."

In Mr Bogle's speech, he attempted to quantify the disadvantage. Hedge funds manage about $2.8tn of assets, generating about 300 basis points in management and performance fees, he estimated; about $84bn in fees alone. Vanguard, by contrast, supervises about $2tn in index funds, at a cost of about $1.6bn.

"The heavily armed and armoured hedge fund Goliaths versus the simple unencumbered index-fund David. Who will better serve the long-term investor?"

It is eight years since Mr Buffett wagered $1m for charity that a simple Vanguard S&P index fund would beat any portfolio of five hedge funds anyone cared to construct over the next decade. Ted Seides, the hedge fund manager who took up the challenge, is losing badly. It is hard to see his portfolio closing the gap in respective net returns after fees: the hedge funds have returned 22 per cent while the S&P is up 66 per cent. It is possible, of course, that all five funds will place bets on a stock market crash and it will come true in the final two years of the bet. We'll see.

More likely, this wager will become the high-profile embarrassment to the hedge fund industry that Mr Buffett hoped it would be. Meanwhile, the rise and rise and rise of Vanguard and its index-tracking copycats is more than just a symbolic humiliation to active fund management. As Morningstar, the data provider, reported last month, the shift of money out of actively managed mutual funds has accelerated in the past year. Passively managed mutual funds and exchange traded funds in the US attracted $384bn in the year to March, while active funds lost $277bn in assets.

And hedge funds - the most active managers of all - suffered their first quarterly outflows since the financial crisis in the first three months of 2016, as institutional investors staged a backlash against high fees and disappointing performance.

Mr Buffett joked at his meeting that he would put on the same anti-hedge fund bet again today except that having to wait 10 years to collect "gets a little more problematic as we go through life". But he and Mr Bogle are being vindicated in the here and now. They have been powerful preachers, and their sermons are winning converts.

Singapore banks become a hotbed for  fintech 

Banks have long used data analysis to predict market movements, investment returns, even risks of customer fraud. But Singapore s DBS Bank is one of those applying predictive analytics to internal functions   using pattern-detecting software to spot rogue traders, and other unusual staff behaviour.

Newly deployed, the programme is already starting to bear fruit, DBS says, allowing the bank to take action before losses escalate.

And while other banks are turning to outside technology firms for such sleuthing software, DBS has developed its version in-house   through an unusual government-backed research partnership.

It is one of many turning to  fintech  to cut costs and manage risks, as financial institutions around the world face up to depressed revenues and higher regulatory compliance costs.

Fintech investment has risen in the Asia-Pacific region from $103m in 2010 to $4.3bn in 2015. Investment there now accounts for 19.3 per cent of the total worldwide, according to consultancy Accenture.

Singapore, where the government and the financial regulator are taking concrete steps to support innovation, has become a test bed for the use of new technology in Asia.

Piyush Gupta, DBS chief executive, said:  I m convinced in the next five to 10 years our industry is going to be completely different. That s why this is imperative. 

The early successes of the public-private co-operation have been so marked that other regional centres, most notably Hong Kong, are taking notes and starting to follow Singapore s example.

In Singapore, the Institute for Infocomm Research, a government agency, connects financial companies with scientists seeking to commercialise their research. The links allow banks to tap experts that they otherwise might have trouble finding and affording.

The state is also a source of finance. Last summer, the Monetary Authority of Singapore announced plans to spend S$225m over five years to support the creation of innovation centres and technology projects within and across banks.

One such government-backed project is a partnership between Standard Chartered and DBS to use "http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=blockchain"   the technology behind the cryptocurrency bitcoin   for trade finance transactions.

The initiative uses blockchain, which allows records of asset ownership to be kept on a network of computers that is not controlled by any single user, to replace the current paper-based documentation of trade finance.

The two institutions, who completed a pilot in December, are in talks with other global and regional banks about launching the scheme later this year, in what the banks say will be the world s first application of the technology in trade finance.

Gautam Jain, head of client access for transaction banking at Standard Chartered, said:  Trade finance has been paper-intensive. Paper is inefficient   the transportation and storage   and it s time-consuming. 

Shifting to blockchain will also reduce the risk of errors by putting the terms and conditions of a deal into actual computer code, rather than relying on written agreements, which can be misinterpreted, Mr Jain said.

Singapore s banks are also using fintech to extend their reach into new sectors and geographies. In March, UOB, Singapore s third-biggest lender by assets, became the first bank in Asia to establish a partnership with an equity crowdfunding platform, teaming up with Israel s OurCrowd to provide funding to regional start-ups.

Over the past year, Singapore s Monetary Authority has openly encouraged the finance sector to embrace technological change, as global banks including Citi, UBS and Credit Suisse have all established innovation centres in Singapore.

The MAS recently announced a  regulatory sandbox  approach to technological innovation in finance. It allows banks to experiment without seeking regulatory approval in advance. Instead, bank managers are responsible for assessing risk.

In a speech to a Singapore business forum, MAS managing director Ravi Menon said:  With many innovations it is not always possible to anticipate every vulnerability 	. 	. 	. 	Sometimes, as Nike puts it, you have to just do it. 

The regulator is due to issue guidelines on exactly how the  sandbox  approach will work, with the emphasis on ensuring that experiments which fail do so cheaply and safely, without posing a risk to the rest of the financial system.

The progress made in Singapore is being keenly watched in Hong Kong, the rival financial centre in Asia, where fintech start-ups have complained of receiving scant attention from the regulator.

Until recently, start-ups seeking guidance from the Hong Kong Monetary Authority were simply turned away, as the regulator decided that fintech usually fell outside its remit.

However, tracking the changes pushed forward in Singapore, HKMA has made a rapid transition over the past three years in the way it interacts with financial technology, companies in the city report.

Last year the territory set up a steering committee for financial technology chaired by both the deputy chief executive of HKMA and the head of risk at Hong Kong s Securities and Futures Commission. Since then, communication has become easier.

 When I moved here three years ago, I approached the regulator but they didn t know how to deal with me,  said a managing director at a Hong Kong fintech.  They have come leaps and bounds since then. 

In March, the Hong Kong regulator established an office to promote fintech by organising industry events, creating a channel of communication between businesses and the regulator, and supporting research.

The HKMA said in a statement that it had always put great emphasis on striking the right balance between promoting technology and the public interest.

The regulator said:  In recent years, as technologies in areas from fintech and retail payment advanced, our proactive efforts in striking the balance, we believe, have become more apparent.

Sentient Technologies, an artificial intelligence company, plans to open its experimental hedge fund using "evolutionary" algorithmic trading to outside investors as early as this year.

The San Francisco-based group, which was founded by some of the developers of Apple's Siri voice-recognition software and is backed by investors including Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing , has been managing a small equity portfolio since 2014, and the results have been promising, according to chief executive Antoine Blondeau .

"We are happy enough with the performance that we will go market the fund within this year or next," he said. "We want to build a full-blown asset management business over time."

Some experts warn that the AI hype is overdone, and raise the possibility that it could fizzle out like previous waves of interest.

Others say markets are simply too chaotic for AI to work , because it functions best in narrow, clearly definable areas rather than on broad problems.

Nonetheless, the field is becoming a buzzphrase in investment management because faster and cheaper computers, internet connections and data storage, as well as data sets exploding in size, make sophisticated machine-learning algorithms increasingly viable as a way to parse financial markets for profitable patterns.

Sentient also focuses its attention on non-financial areas - it has worked with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on early identification of sepsis - but its hedge-fund arm uses an exotic form of AI known as " evolutionary computation ", which was inspired by how species develop over time.

Simply put, Sentient "breeds" investing algorithms and splices the more successful ones into new ones, repeating the process continually.

For regulatory reasons, Mr Blondeau declined to give the internal hedge fund's performance thus far and the size of the portfolio, but implied that it was more than $10m, as any size below that would not give accurate indicative returns.

He expects artificial intelligence techniques to become increasingly prevalent in asset management. "The transition will be slow. But at some point it will become a situation where the question will be whether one machine can outdo another machine, not whether the machine can outdo a human," he said.

Knockoffs of Biotech Drugs Bring Paltry Savings --- Price increases of brand-name medicines are diminishing expected discounts on biosimilars

Generic drugs have long delivered huge savings over their brand-name counterparts. That isn't likely to happen, though, with knockoff versions of some of the expensive drugs on the market today.

Rival versions of so-called biotech drugs, called biosimilars, are just starting to be released, and health insurers and drug-benefit managers say they expect them to cost nearly as much as the brand-name originals did for years.

One big reason: Pharmaceutical companies have been raising prices on biotech drugs about to lose patent protection to squeeze out more revenue before competition arrives, according to insurers, drug-benefit managers and pharmaceutical-industry consultants. And makers of the knockoffs are setting their prices just below those marked-up ones.

The main patent on Humira, a biotech that is one of the nation's top-selling drugs, is set to expire on Dec. 31. Over the past three years, with competition looming, the maker of the treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune diseases has increased the list price eight times, by a total of 73%, to $49,362 for a year's treatment.

By the time a biosimilar for Humira goes on sale, it will probably cost well above what Humira charged before its cost began rising rapidly, says Jim Carlson, vice president of clinical-pharmacy services at OmedaRx, the pharmacy division of Cambia Health Solutions in Portland, Ore.

"We're not expecting to see anything close to the price relief we saw with traditional medicines when the generics become available," he says.

A spokesman for AbbVie Inc., the maker of Humira, said the company "prices its medicines based on the value that those medicines bring to patients and the competitive environment."

The cost of biotech drugs matters because it is a big contributor to increases in overall drug spending. Many of the therapies cost tens of thousands of dollars or more for a single course of treatment. Spending on biotech drugs nearly doubled in the past five years, to $128.7 billion in 2015, and accounted for 54% of the increase in prescription-drug spending overall since 2010, according to IMS Health, a prescription-drug data and consulting firm.

Biotech drugs are more difficult and expensive to make than chemical-based pills. That is true of their knockoff versions, as well, making biosimilar makers unwilling to sharply undercut prices of the original versions.

"I really don't expect big relief from biosimilars," says Steven Marciniak, vice president of pharmacy programs at Priority Health, an insurer based in Grand Rapids, Mich.

The first biosimilar on the U.S. market, a knockoff of Amgen Inc.'s cancer-care drug Neupogen, was priced just 15% below the branded drug late last year. During the three years before, Amgen had raised the list price of a vial of Neupogen by 15.7%, according to data firm Truven Health Analytics.

With traditional medicines, which are much easier to manufacture than biotech drugs, pharmaceutical companies facing generic competition calculate whether they can charge more for branded versions without facing pushback from health insurers and drug-benefit managers, according to industry consultants. They often begin raising the price two or three years before the generic is expected to hit.

They sometimes also reduce the discounts they negotiate with health insurers and drug-benefit managers, says E.M. Kolassa, a former drug-company pricing official who now consults at Medical Marketing Economics LLC.

"You're facing this absolute loss of an asset, so you start in the last couple of years raising the price," he says.

List prices for the last 14 big-selling drugs to face generic competition rose an average 35% during the two years beforehand, while their cost after discounts increased an average 22% during that time, according to data from SSR Health LLC, which analyzes drug prices and occasionally advises companies on pricing. Those increases exceeded price and cost growth for all drugs by an average 13 percentage points.

The cost of blockbuster drug Lipitor began increasing more rapidly in late 2009, two years before the Pfizer Inc. cholesterol fighter lost patent protection, according SSR. During those two years, Lipitor's price after discounts jumped by one-third, to $2.60 a pill.

Pfizer says it took into account a variety of factors in pricing Lipitor, including affordability and the potential to reduce other health-care costs. It says that once generics became available, the price of drug treatment dropped by more than 90%.

The cost of another traditional drug, blood-pressure medication Diovan from Novartis AG, rose 24% to $1.89 a pill in the two years before going generic, according to SSR. Novartis declined to comment on the increase.

Health insurers and drug-benefit managers say it often makes more sense to pay the higher prices than switch patients to a less-expensive branded drug because they expect substantial savings when the generic becomes available.

"You want conversion to the generic at launch, because on average it's a pretty big decrease in price," says Steve Johnson, senior director of health outcomes at Prime Therapeutics LLC, a drug-benefit manager in St. Paul, Minn.

Biotech drugs, also called biologics, are fashioned through genetic engineering and manufactured in living cells. The first was approved in 1982, and today they treat diseases ranging from cancer to multiple sclerosis.

Insurance companies, drug-benefit managers and employers, eager to reduce costs, have been awaiting the arrival of their knockoff versions, biosimilars. They have taken longer to hit the market than analysts initially expected.

So far, only two biosimilars have been approved in the U.S. The first was the biosimilar version of cancer-care drug Neupogen, called Zarxio, which is made by Novartis. Last month, the FDA approved the second biosimilar, of Johnson & Johnson's rheumatoid-arthritis drug Remicade.

The Remicade knockoff -- Inflectra from Pfizer and Celltrion Inc. -- hasn't yet gone on sale partly because Johnson & Johnson has accused Celltrion in a lawsuit of infringing six Remicade patents. Celltrion has denied the allegations.

Humira, which is injected, belongs to a class of therapies that have transformed treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and other immune-system diseases, turning debilitating disorders into manageable conditions for millions of patients.

No other biotech drug faces more potential biosimilars than Humira, which is the target of a dozen knockoffs in development, according to Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. That is a product of the drug's commercial success: It is consistently among the top sellers in the U.S., generating more than $8 billion in annual sales.

The drug, first approved in 2002, is now authorized for nine uses in the U.S. and awaiting approval for a 10th, which has contributed to the sales growth.

Its manufacturer, AbbVie, was spun off from Abbott Laboratories on Jan. 1, 2013, with Humira as its primary product. Humira accounts for two-thirds of its sales. Two days after the spinoff, on Jan. 3, AbbVie made its first of its eight increases in Humira's list price, according Truven Health Analytics.

The AbbVie spokesman says the list price doesn't reflect discounts or rebates given to government, managed-care organizations and other commercial health plans, which often makes the cost paid by insurance companies far lower than the list price. As the company increased the list price, it also offered bigger discounts, he said.

Between 2013 and 2016, AbbVie increased prices more than it increased discounts, according to an analysis by SSR's Richard Evans, a former U.S. pricing official at Roche Holding AG.

Humira's cost "accelerated as the anticipated launch date for copycat versions drew nearer," Mr. Evans says. By the end of 2015, a year's treatment with Humira averaged $27,665 after discounts, up 49% from three years earlier, according to SSR's analysis.

The price increases are "making health insurance more and more expensive," says Eileen Wood, chief pharmacy officer at the Capital District Physicians' Health Plan Inc., which insures 430,000 people in New York state. To cover Humira's higher cost, the company had to raise premiums this year by an average of $16.52, and the drug now accounts for $66 of the average member's annual premium, says Ms. Wood.

Leticia Hughes, whose 12-year-old son Ashton takes Humira for juvenile arthritis and Crohn's disease, says she took a new job teaching nutrition at the University of Kentucky earlier this year because its health plan had lower out-of-pocket drug costs than her old employer's.

Under her old insurance, she says, she was paying as much as $2,200 a month out of pocket for Humira, half her family's monthly income, until she hit the annual maximum. Under her new insurance, she says, she has typically paid $600 a month.

Ms. Hughes says that was a big improvement, but still more than the monthly rent. "We don't feel we can afford to buy a house with our medical expenses," which include 12 other drugs for her son, she says.

She says she recently qualified for financial assistance from AbbVie, which could cut her out-of-pocket costs to as little as $15 a month.

AbbVie's spokesman says the company helps commercially insured patients afford their copayments, and provides the product at no cost to eligible patients through a patient-assistance program and not-for-profit foundation.

As AbbVie raised prices in anticipation of biosimilars, it also moved to fend off competition through the patent office. It assembled what it has said is one of the largest patent portfolios protecting a single drug -- more than 70 patents over the past decade.

"Any company seeking to market a biosimilar version of Humira will have to contend with this extensive patent estate, which AbbVie intends to enforce vigorously," Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez told analysts in October.

The patents, he said, should keep biosimilars off the market until at least 2022.

ON24

Goldman Invests in Dot-Com Survivor

A Goldman Sachs Group Inc. unit has invested $25 million in ON24 Inc., an 18-year-old software company that survived the dot-com bust and lately is seeing growth again after several strategic shifts.

In its latest iteration, ON24 is providing a software platform for companies to produce marketing Webinars, which they can promote through social channels and combine with data analytics to identify prospective buyers.

The company serves more than 1,500 customers and is adding about 175 customers each quarter, according to co-founder and Chief Executive Sharat Sharan.

 All of us do research when we buy a car &and we've started to see the same trend emerge in business-to-business sales" where people are downloading information, asking questions and answering online polls, Mr. Sharan said.

ON24 is competing against Cisco Systems Inc.'s WebEx platform, he said.

ON24 started in 1998 as an online financial-news service for retail investors and pivoted to become an online Webcaster and later a provider of Webcasts and virtual events.

The virtual events business was based on an acquisition that ON24 made in Spain in 2012, but that business didn't work out, Mr. Sharan said, so about 18 months ago ON24 sold the company, called Imaste-ips, back to the founders.

Roam International

Startup Seed Round Yields $3.4 Million

Technology created ways for people to work remotely from virtually any computer or device in any location.

A new startup now wants to provide a way for people to live remotely. Roam International Inc. aims to offer a network of housing locations where people can stay for $500 a week and move around freely.

Roam has raised $3.4 million in seed funding. CRV led the round, with participation from Collaborative Fund, NextView, Corigin and angel investors including SoundCloud founder Eric Wahlforss, Sean Park of Anthemis Group, and the CEO of Teleport, Sten Tamkivi.

The New York City-based company runs the business with rental and operating agreements to manage buildings. The model works best in complexes with less than 100 units a size that is typically difficult for hotels to generate a strong business, says Bruno Haid, co-founder of Roam.

The company is operating in Bali and is preparing to launch in Miami and then in Madrid this summer, with plans to have five to seven locations by year-end and  a couple dozen" next year.

The Roam concept is designed to appeal to different groups: travelers, remote-workers who are  location independent," small startup teams, recent college graduates or older  empty nest" couples who want new housing, says Haid.

Assent Compliance

Canadian Company Raises First Round

After more than 10 years in business, Assent Compliance Inc. raised its first funding round from venture capitalists.

The Ottawa firm picked up $20 million from Volition Capital, with participation from OpenText Enterprise Application Fund, Business Development Bank of Canada, National Research Council of Canada Industrial Research Assistance Program, Royal Bank of Canada and others.

The online service automates supply-chain data to help companies comply with product stewardship, anti-human-trafficking and ethical-sourcing regulations. Such regulations exist to ensure products are created in facilities by workers who make fair wages and that materials are sourced ethically. The platform helps companies manage and understand their supply chain so they can comply with regulations.  Different regulators have different ways of collecting that data," Assent CEO Andrew Waitman said.  It hasn't been well automated at all."

For example, with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010, companies must identify the source of the minerals in their products to limit the use of conflict minerals, which came from the Democratic Republic of Congo or an adjoining country and are financing armed groups. Last year, the U.S. created tighter laws about human trafficking, and the European Union has even stricter laws about conflict-mineral reporting and ethical sourcing.

Increased regulations have created more demand for compliance software to help automate these processes, Mr. Waitman said.

A unit of Goldman Sachs has invested $25 million in "http://www.on24.com"., an 18-year-old software company that survived the dot-com bust and is lately seeing growth again after several strategic shifts.

In its latest iteration, ON24 is providing a software platform for companies to produce marketing webinars, which they can promote through social channels and combine with data analytics to identify prospective buyers.

 Virtual events were supposed to be the next thing since sliced bread for marketers but it never became that," he said. Also, he said, there weren't enough people for ON24 to hire in Madrid, and the London employees got tired of flying back and forth.

Dot-com survivors are still raising the occasional round of venture capital. Around 20 such companies have raised new rounds in each of the past five quarters, according to data from Dow Jones VentureSource.

This latest round is the largest ON24 has ever raised. Mr. Sharan has bootstrapped the company for the last 10 or 12 years.

 It's an exciting time for the company [and] we will hold tight to what we do. Nobody knows how long [the current downturn] will last," he said.

The new round comes from Goldman Sachs Private Capital Investing group and is considered a Series B. Goldman Sachs also has a seat on ON24's board.
