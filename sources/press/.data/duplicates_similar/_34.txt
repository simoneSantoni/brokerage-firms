International Property: Brazil: Investors Searching for Bargains in Brazil --- A downturn in the local economy sends many to the property sideline, but some sniff for deals

Global real-estate investors such as Blackstone Group LP, Brookfield Property Partners LP and Global Logistic Properties are taking advantage of the political upheaval and economic decline in Brazil by bargain hunting in the country.

Most investors have moved to the sidelines as rents and occupancy levels have fallen. With Brazil's growth rate plunging and protests mounting, the volume of reported commercial-property sales hit only $584 million last year, compared with $698.6 million in 2013 and $1.92 billion in 2012, according to Real Capital Analytics Inc.

But Blackstone's real-estate group has made two acquisitions in recent months: stakes in a Brazilian home builder and a portfolio of four office buildings in Rio de Janeiro. Blackstone's real-estate group also is opening its own office in the country for the first time, to be led by Marcelo Fedak, formerly head of real estate for Brazilian financial-services firm BTG Pactual.

Meanwhile, Singapore-based Global Logistic, which last year bought a portfolio of 34 industrial properties in Brazil for $1.36 billion, this year is buying development sites from small owners "who are finding it hard to raise capital," according to Mauro Dias, president of the company's business in Brazil.

Brookfield has agreed to buy seven office buildings as part of a plan by BTG Pactual to acquire the stake it doesn't already own in Brazilian real-estate owner BR Properties SA.

"It is in our view a good time to buy," said Ric Clark, chief executive of Brookfield's real-estate business.

There are many investors who regret recent investments in Brazilian real estate. Shares of listed real-estate companies such as General Shopping Brasil, JHSF Partipacoes SA and Sonae Sierra Brasil SA have fallen sharply. Many new stores, apartments and office buildings now hitting the market are meeting with weak demand.

But investors who remain bullish point out that boom-and-bust cycles are to be expected in an emerging market such as Brazil. They also say they have confidence in the strength of the engines that until recently powered the country's strong growth -- including its abundant natural resources and growing middle class.

"The country has some core strength that hasn't changed despite the current challenges," said Rob Speyer, co-chief executive of Tishman Speyer Properties, which has been developing office and apartment buildings in Brazil for two decades.

Mr. Speyer said Tishman Speyer "doubled down" on Brazil in 2002 after the country hit a rough patch of political and economic uncertainty, and the bet helped the firm become a dominant player in the country. Tishman Speyer is now pursuing a similar strategy: It recently purchased its first development site in Belo Horizonte, a big mining area, for an office building.

Tishman Speyer also just bought a site in the Porto Maravilha section of Rio de Janeiro where it plans to develop 1,000 units of housing.

"We're voting with our capital," Mr. Speyer said.

Investors on the prowl for bargains include some new players but also a number of familiar faces. Sam Zell, who helped lead a wave of international investment in Brazilian real estate that started about 10 years ago, is looking for deals. So is his former partner, Gary Garrabrant, who co-founded his own firm, Jaguar Growth Partners.

Foreign players have been able to take advantage of the recent plunge in the Brazilian real, which is worth about 32 U.S. cents these days, compared with more than 60 cents in 2011. But big domestic investment companies, such as BTG Pactual, also are looking for opportunities in distressed properties. BTG just raised a $500 million fund that is focusing on heavily indebted residential projects, according to people familiar with the matter.

Blackstone's real-estate group has been eyeing Brazil for a number of years, especially after the firm established a beachhead in Brazil in 2010 by buying a 40% stake in Patria, a Brazilian investment firm.

The group decided to make its move and set up its own shop partly because of the recent decline in values, according to Kenneth Caplan, the group's chief investment officer.

The group made its recent acquisitions in 50-50 partnerships with Patria, and will likely continue co-investing with Patria in the future, Mr. Caplan said.

"It does feel like now is an interesting moment," he said.

Investors who are bullish on Brazil acknowledge there are risks to moving too early. The country's high inflation and interest rates could last longer than expected.

There are no guarantees political turmoil will calm or that financial reforms will work.

But waiting too long also can be problematic.

"Once the all clear sounds, it sometimes feels like it's a bit late," Mr. Caplan said.

Few people would admit to, much less boast about, keeping a copy of the 906-page US Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act on their Kindle. But after uncovering a provision on diabetes prevention on page 879 during a medical school internship, Sean Duffy swears by Obamacare, as the act is known informally, and generously credits it as the catalyst for the launch of Omada Health, his digital health platform.

"Omada was founded in direct response to the Affordable Care Act (ACA)," says Duffy, a former Harvard University medical student and Google analyst who had long maintained one foot in medicine and the other in Silicon Valley but had struggled to combine the two.

His light-bulb moment came during his internship with Ideo, a consultancy in Palo Alto, California, where he drew up a business model that would tap into ACA funds allocated to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the US national public health institute, for the prevention of type 2 diabetes - a chronic disease that costs the US $245bn annually in treatment and lost productivity, according to the American Diabetes Association. "We wouldn't have any customers without the ACA doing this," he notes.

Promptly dropping out of Harvard, forgetting even to tell his father, Duffy launched Omada in April 2011, embracing what he calls "digital therapeutics". This combines mobile and wearable health-tracking tools with an online peer group to foster better exercise and eating habits. The concept, combined with Duffy's technical and medical acumen, attracted a $23m capital infusion from Andreesen Horowitz - the Silicon Valley venture capital firm's first foray into digital health technology.

Through small online communities comprising a coach and peers who share their health dreams, fears, triumphs and failures through Omada's platform, individuals at risk from type 2 diabetes can monitor and encourage one another toward their goals. While weight-loss schemes are loathed by many, Omada's convenient, community-driven approach to dropping pounds has been a hit - 65 per cent of clients have stayed in the programme for 12 months following the initial trial period.

Duffy's story illustrates how a new crop of health technology entrepreneurs have jumped on the Obamacare health reforms to transform a sector that was an investment backwater and notorious technology laggard into a space overflowing with innovation and opportunity.

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.

<>Prior to Obamacare, the role of health information technology was analogous to a stockpiling of technical arms by hospitals and insurance companies seeking to maximise revenues at the others' expense, where neither side would blink first - leading to essentially "mutually assured destruction", according to Aneesh Chopra, the former White House chief technology officer who now heads a health analytics start-up. "If you wanted the highest technology, you would look at the revenue and billing systems - how do you better document care and squeeze every nickel out of the insurance company?"

The winds began to change after the recession from about 2008, which spawned a new urgency among employers - led by groups such as Apple, the technology company - to control healthcare costs, new funding for digital health records and data, and the passage in 2010 of Obamacare, which flipped the business model of health insurance on its head and revamped how the government pays healthcare providers for services rendered.

These reforms fundamentally changed the incentives behind how healthcare is delivered. Under the old "fee-for-service" model, healthcare providers were compensated strictly based on the volume of care they provided, and US healthcare spending, though tapering off recently, rose to $2.9tn in 2013 (17.4 per cent of gross domestic product - nearly double the OECD average).

In the new landscape, known in industry jargon as "population health", providers are paid based on how well they can deliver more effective care at a better price. This has created a new emphasis on promoting healthy habits, thereby minimising the need for costly hospital stays and treatments.

<>Eyeing a sea of opportunity, technology entrepreneurs quickly rushed in to find ways of fostering healthy lifestyles and improving treatment outcomes. Venture capitalists followed suit, quadrupling their investments in the area since 2011, according to Rock Health, a healthcare technology incubator. In 2014, $4.1bn was poured into digital health companies focused on new fields, such as consumer engagement, data and analytics, personalised medicine and wearable devices.

Bryan Roberts, a partner in Venrock, a health IT venture capitalist, says these new incentives for value creation and the availability of data are attracting the brightest young minds to the field. "We are seeing a dramatic increase in the level of entrepreneurial talent participating in the space," he says.

. . .

Health IT's unofficial coming-out party came during a December 2010 economic summit between President Barack Obama and top corporate executives in which post-ACA health technology was promoted by the president as a potential new opportunity. Venture capitalist John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins - who was bullish on the vision but lamented that nobody else in the investment community knew a thing about it - took matters into his own hands by convening the first panel on innovation in healthcare technology at the following month's JPMorgan healthcare investor conference.

The panel, comprising Doerr, Chopra, Google's Eric Schmidt and Todd Park of Athenahealth, the health technology company, stole the show as investors flooded the forum to learn more about the emerging field. An informal poll revealed the vast majority of participants had little or no background knowledge of the Obamacare reforms to health IT, but they peppered the panel with questions about this new investment landscape that had been created seemingly out of thin air.

The discussion centred on the law's carrot-and-stick approaches to promoting new technologies to help control costs and improve patient outcomes, in particular the incentives for providers to begin using electronic health records (EHRs) and to use them to increase efficiency.

<>Because Medicare - which insures the elderly and accounts for 20 per cent of all healthcare spending - is the largest payment source for nearly every clinic and hospital in the country and effectively a price-maker, when the ACA mandated that it should begin to shift to new "fee-for-value" payment models, the market took notice.

The largest EHR vendors, Epic and Cerner, have been significant beneficiaries, as have new companies that specialise in providing the infrastructure necessary for tapping into new government payment models, such as Evolent Health, a spin-off from the Advisory Board Company, a healthcare and education consultancy.

On the ground level, a cottage industry of start-ups that help providers maximise Medicare reimbursements through EHR usage is taking off. Seeing an immediate opportunity to harness his technical and software background, Lewis Mitchell, a developer with Mayo Clinic, a non-profit medical research group, jumped in.

"The use of information technology [in healthcare] is 25-30 years behind the rest of the commercial world," Mitchell says, emphasising the need for new value creation. "I made a conscious decision to get into healthcare because I thought the things I was doing 25 years ago, if applied to the medical community, could have a dramatic impact."

His new program, PhySoft, tackles kidney dialysis - a cumbersome and costly procedure that accounts for $50bn in annual spend and 6 per cent of all Medicare expenditures. Using captured EHR data to optimise the drug dosages administered to dialysis patients, PhySoft could trim $15,000 off the $37,000 drug and hospitalisation bill racked up by a typical Medicare patient each year.

. . .

In addition to Obamacare's cost-cutting pressures, its more politically controversial mandate of requiring people to obtain health insurance has forced millions of Americans to deal directly with the complexities of the healthcare system - creating opportunities for consumer education and choice.

Harnessing the frustration he incurred trying to select the proper health insurance plan for himself, Noah Lang started Stride Health to demystify the product for insurance shoppers. "Even though I have a degree in mechanical engineering, to get the data I needed to [decide on the right plan] was nearly impossible to do in terms of pricing and understanding the plans," he says, underscoring the need for the average consumer to have access to better information.

On the back of an Obamacare provision that did away with traditional paper-based insurance underwriting, Lang developed a personalised recommendation engine using algorithms that guide people to the best-fitting insurance plans on the basis of their health history and pricing needs. "I started this company to change the way Americans make healthcare coverage decisions," he says.

<>Josh Kushner is another smart guy to have been so befuddled by his health insurance that he vowed to invent a different way of doing things. With Mario Schlosser and Kevin Nazemi he created an insurance company, Oscar, whose cartoon ads adorned New York subway carriages this spring. "The consumer never mattered in healthcare," explains Kushner, "and for the first time ever the consumer does matter, because they are making choices on their own."

As New York state's first new commercial health insurer in 15 years, Oscar is off to a fast start in its drive to become the disrupting force of the health insurance market. It has attracted 40,000 customers in just two years through the state's health exchange and was valued at $1.5bn at its recent fundraising.

No industry can remain immune to technology. Kushner says. "We can have engineers look at [any industry] and say 'this doesn't make any sense', and do it better. There's government, education, financial services & but healthcare is the most screwed up - it is a total train wreck."

But this wave of healthcare innovation is not limited to the US. Looking to expand his platform to help fight obesity-related diseases on a global scale - and their $2tn impact on global GDP, according to McKinsey, the consultancy - Duffy and Omada Health are incorporating in the UK.

"Obesity is the biggest health emergency - it's this generation's smoking," warns Duffy, "but it is also the biggest market opportunity."

Big Property Investors Hunt for Bargains in Brazil; Blackstone, Brookfield are among global players buying as stalling economy sends others to the sidelines

U.S. News: Emergency-Room Visits Keep Climbing

By Stephanie Armour

Emergency-room visits continued to climb in the second year of the Affordable Care Act, contradicting the law's supporters who had predicted a decline in traffic as more people gained access to doctors and other health-care providers.

A survey of 2,098 emergency-room doctors conducted in March showed about three-quarters said visits had risen since January 2014. That was a significant uptick from a year earlier, when less than half of doctors surveyed reported an increase. The survey by the American College of Emergency Physicians is scheduled to be published Monday.

Medicaid recipients newly insured under the health law are struggling to get appointments or find doctors who will accept their coverage, and consequently wind up in the ER, ACEP said. Volume might also be increasing due to hospital and emergency-department closures -- a long-standing trend.

"There was a grand theory the law would reduce ER visits," said Dr. Howard Mell, a spokesman for ACEP. "Well, guess what, it hasn't happened. Visits are going up despite the ACA, and in a lot of cases because of it."

The health law's impact on emergency departments has been closely watched because it has significant implications for the public. ER crowding has been linked to longer wait times and higher mortality rates.

More than half of providers listed in Medicaid managed-care plans couldn't schedule appointments for enrollees, according to a December report by the Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General. Among providers who could offer appointments, the median wait time was two weeks, but more than a quarter of doctors had wait times of more than a month for an appointment.

Many doctors don't accept Medicaid patients because the state-federal coverage provides lower reimbursement rates than many private health-insurance plans. The waits for primary and specialty care by participating doctors appear to be leaving some Medicaid patients with the ER as the only option, according to ACEP.

"We're seeing a huge backlog in the ER because the volume has increased," said Ryan Stanton, an emergency-room doctor at Baptist Health Lexington in Kentucky. "This year we already have had to board people in the ER because of the sheer volumes," he said, referring to a practice of keeping patients in the ER until a hospital room becomes available.

Dr. Stanton said ER volume rose about 10% in 2014 from 2013, and was up almost 20% in the first few months of this year.

The ACEP survey also found that ERs are seeing sicker patients: About 90% of the doctors polled said the severity of illness has stayed the same or gotten worse. That might be explained in part by an aging population, newly insured people with multiple maladies, and people delaying care because they have high-deductible insurance plans.

Nicholas Vasquez, a medical director for an emergency department in Mesa, Ariz., said volume rose 5% in a year, representing about 10 more patients a day. The stress from bigger caseloads prompted some nurses to resign, he said. "Physicians are working more shifts -- that pushes them a lot," Dr. Vasquez said. "If they work too much, they get burnt out. For patients, it means longer waits."

Some states have been trying to curb ER use by Medicaid recipients by requiring higher copayments for visits deemed nonurgent. Critics have denounced that practice as punitive, and warn that it will dissuade low-income patients from seeking care that may be necessary.

A 2013 study by Truven Health Analytics that examined insurance claims for more than 6.5 million ER visits by commercially insured people under age 65 found just 29% of patients required immediate attention. Twenty-four percent didn't require immediate attention, 41% received care that could have been provided in a primary-care setting, and 6% got care that would have been preventable or avoidable with proper primary care.

More than 40% of emergency physicians said they expect emergency-room visits to increase if the Supreme Court rules that subsidies provided to people who obtain insurance on the federal exchange are invalid. The court is expected to rule by late June.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Henderson 'vigilant' about US after weak growth; FUND FOCUS; Fund manager will start to buy more defensive stocks if situation deteriorates

Global equity manager Andrew Jones has said the US is the region he is most "vigilant" about, following the market's recent slowdown.

Mr Jones, who runs the 741m Henderson Global Equity Income fund with Ben Lofthouse, said he was already underweight the US and was planning to make his remaining US portfolio more defensive.

After a solid 2014, when the S&P 500 rose 13 per cent in dollar terms, the index has risen less than 3 per cent this year, according to data from FE Analytics. This is a warning sign for Mr Jones in terms of how he plays his 32 per cent exposure to Wall Street.

"If there is one thing that we have to watch, it would be the US," he said. "The first quarter was relatively weak. The US has been the engine of growth for the world over the past couple of years. We are being vigilant."

Data released last week suggested the US economy expanded at an annualised rate of just 0.2 per cent in the first quarter of 2015, much lower than predicted. This led the Federal Reserve to admit the recovery had lost momentum.

If things deteriorate further, Mr Jones said he would start buying more defensive stocks such as consumer staples, industrials and telecoms .

The fund this month passes its three-year anniversary under its new mandate. In May 2012, what was then the Henderson Higher Income fund changed its name, investment objective and peer group sector.

Since the changes took effect, the fund has delivered top-quartile returns of 62.2 per cent, beating the 53.6 per cent average return from peers in the IA Global Equity Income sector, but lagging behind the 76.6 per cent rise in the benchmark MSCI World index, according to FE Analytics.

Mr Jones said the fund's strong returns so far this year are in part due to its underweight position to the US, which has a benchmark weighting of 57.6 per cent, compared with the fund's 32 per cent exposure.

The outperformance is also thanks to the fund's bias towards Europe, which makes up 23 per cent of the portfolio.

While investors have generally become more optimistic about Europe, it is not without its problems. Investors' concerns about a potential Greek exit from the eurozone have escalated in recent weeks.

Within his European holdings, Mr Jones has increased his allocation to telecoms, which now account for 8 per cent of the portfolio, compared with 6.5 per cent at the end of 2014.

This increase was funded by selling out of Bayer, the German pharmaceutical company.

Markets
Latest Victim of California s Drought: Water Bonds; Investors steer clear of debt issued by water utilities

 California's drought is starting to spread to the market for bonds issued by water utilities, long considered one of the safest types of debt sold by state and local governments.

Some investors are steering clear of the bonds from hard-hit areas of the U.S. west, amid concerns that restrictions on water use will drive down water-authority revenue. Some authorities may have a tough time raising rates to offset that lost income.

If shortages persist, credit ratings may weaken and prices for outstanding bonds fall, according to analysts and rating firms.

California water and sewer bonds lost value in April for the second month in three, falling 0.61% after Gov. Jerry Brown imposed mandatory water restrictions. All California municipal bonds posted a 0.55% decline for the month, counting price moves and interest payments, according to Barclays PLC.

California is in its fourth year of drought, one of the worst on record for the nation's most populous state. It is costing billions of dollars in losses in its agricultural sector and prompting the first-ever mandatory statewide cutbacks in water use.

 It is also a rare fissure in one of the most-secure and widely traded sectors of the $3.7 trillion municipal-bond market. During last year's rally in bonds, water and sewer debt nationwide outperformed the market, rising 9.7% compared with 9% for tax-exempt bonds overall, according to Barclays. California water and sewer agencies have issued about $28.8 billion in bonds since 2010, according to Thomson Reuters.

Water-utility bonds seldom default because they're typically backed by residents' payments on an essential service. And so far the drought hasn't kept water authorities from tapping the debt market.

But the persistent water shortages show how a market prized for safety and stability can contain hidden pockets of risk, some investors said.

 The way investors have looked at water in California in the past needs to go through some evolution," said Michael Johnson, co-chief investment officer at Gurtin Fixed Income Management LLC, in Solana Beach, Calif.

Mr. Johnson said heavy investor demand for California debt of all types has raised the prices of most water bonds. That means investors may be overpaying for debt from districts with growing but unacknowledged financial problems.

His firm, which manages about $9 billion, has avoided some authorities facing challenges such as limited water storage or small financial reserves.

An April report by Moody's Investors Service warned investors that the state's water restrictions could curb revenue at water agencies. While rate increases can offset declining water use, utilities have little time to make them, and such increases may further discourage consumption.

Fitch Ratings said downgrades could occur if policy makers hesitate to make rate increases.

California isn't the only place these bonds are under scrutiny. Robert Fernandez, director of environmental, social and governance research at Boston-based Breckinridge Capital Advisors, said his firm sold bonds from at least one water authority in Texas because of inconsistent revenue and water supplies.

Breckinridge, which manages about $21.4 billion, uses 11 indicators to analyze how water availability, demand and oversight can affect an agency's ability to repay debt, looking for factors including adequate backup supplies and contingency planning, Mr. Fernandez said.

 We're not looking to say, 'we want to avoid all water systems in this area,'" he said.  We want to look for the ones that are well managed and know how to manage through these issues."

Sharlene Leurig, who directs the sustainable water infrastructure program at Ceres, a nonprofit group that promotes sustainable investing, said that while bondholders are beginning to pay more attention, the threat posed by water shortages is still poorly understood.

 I think we have a long way to go before those risks are properly disclosed and priced," she said.

Maintaining investor demand will be important in California, where officials are accelerating parts of a voter-approved plan to sell more than $7 billion in general obligation bonds to pay for new water projects. That plan includes grants to local authorities, who may sell their own bonds.

Gary Breaux, chief financial officer for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, a consortium of 26 cities and water authorities that provide drinking water to about 19 million people in cities including Los Angeles and San Diego, said he's spoken with investors to reassure them that the triple-A-rated agency has plenty of sources for water and isn't foreseeing effect on its budget. Several water agencies' recent bond sales were well received, he added.

 I think investors feel reassured that we're watching all these different variables and we'll take them into account when we set our next budget, as well as the rates," he said.

Jamison Feheley, head of banking for public finance at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., said California issuers are well prepared by prior droughts and haven't had to adjust bond offerings, though investors are paying attention.

 There are a lot of discussions with investors and rating agencies about `what's the plan? How do you expect to manage the drought issue?'" he said.

Demand for water utility debt has grown nationwide since Detroit's bankruptcy, because those investors proved better-protected than those holding tax-supported bonds, said Matt Fabian, partner at Concord, Massachusetts-based research firm Municipal Market Analytics. And while water bills may go up as the drought goes on, they're still a small portion of most households' expenses.

 Frankly, they just need to charge more for it," he said.  Once they start laying in new capital, either to fund conservation, or reuse, or desalination or whatever, it's just going to cost a lot more money."

REVIEW & OUTLOOK (Editorial)
A Big Data  Financial Retreat

There are no permanent victories in Washington, but in the Obama era we'll take whatever we can get. So investors should be toasting a retreat by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority from its plan to vacuum up monthly account information from America's roughly 4,000 brokerage firms.

The Comprehensive Automated Risk Data System (Cards) was intended to allow "bird's-eye view surveillance" of the securities markets, said Finra chief Richard Ketchum last year. But now Mr. Ketchum says that Finra is ditching its current proposal and "will not move forward with an amended version until we conclude that the concerns raised in the comments have been addressed."

Concerns certainly were raised, including in these columns. Brokerages rebelled over the potential compliance costs, and investors weren't thrilled that much of their financial data would be warehoused in Washington. Finra is technically a nonprofit "self-regulatory organization" that lives off fees charged to market participants. But it's arguably an arm of the government as it polices the brokerage industry under the direction of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Finra claimed it wouldn't collect personally identifiable information such as names and Social Security numbers. But with enough transaction details, people become identifiable. SEC Commissioner Michael Piwowar questioned the need for this data collection and described recent research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology examining how anonymous detailed financial data can be.

"In a data set recording three months of credit-card transactions by 1.1 million users, the MIT researchers found that just four pieces of information -- the dates and locations of four purchases -- are enough to identify 90% of the people. This was true, even in cases where no one in the data set is identified by name, address, credit card number, or anything else that we typically think of as personally identifiable information," said Mr. Piwowar.

He added, "The fact that the Office of Financial Research within the Department of the Treasury already has access to credit card transactions from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and could similarly grab brokerage account transactions from any Cards-type program, heightens my concerns."

This isn't Big Data designed to detect and foil terrorist plots. The program was aimed at legal businesses serving willing clients. By gathering all of America's investment account data in one place, regulators would be creating a hacker's delight of a target. One lapse in Finra security could result in data theft on an unprecedented scale.

The truth is that Finra already collects a lot of data, and regulators will be collecting oceans more under new SEC requirements for a "consolidated audit trail." But as Finra and the SEC know well from cases like Allen Stanford's multibillion-dollar fraud, what regulators really lack is not information, but the judgment and willingness to act on what they discover. That's where Mr. Ketchum should focus his regulatory attention.

Moody's Beats Estimates

Moody's Corp.'s ratings business is benefiting from an active bond market, especially in the U.S., though a weakened euro is diminishing some of the results.

The New York company reported first-quarter earnings that topped analysts' expectations and were powered by a 14% rise in revenue at its Moody's Investors Service unit, the world's second-largest ratings firm. But "foreign currency translation" had a negative 5% drag on ratings revenues, the company said.

Moody's also lowered its full-year guidance for non-U.S. ratings revenue. "We're seeing growth but that growth is really being impacted by the decline of the euro," said Raymond McDaniel, Moody's chief executive, on a call with analysts Friday.

Moody's debt-rating unit, which is the company's biggest revenue driver, reported $602 million in revenue during the quarter, an increase of 14%. Its analytics division posted revenue of $263 million, an increase of 11%. A growing part of Moody's revenue comes from its analytics division, which provides financial data and other types of market intelligence to investors, banks and other players.

In all, the company reported a profit of $230 million, or $1.11 a share, up from $218 million, or $1 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 13% to $866 million, or 18% excluding negative currency effects.

Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters projected earnings of $1.03 a share and revenue of $828 million.

Aside from the currency issue, Moody's saw stronger-than-projected demand for its bond grades, especially among U.S. corporate borrowers, and it projects to remain busy in the coming months as an active mergers-and-acquisitions market fuels demand for debt deals, said Linda S. Huber, Moody's chief financial officer.

"We're expecting a very busy May," Ms. Huber said on the call. "The current pipeline [for corporate debt] is described as robust, and we don't use that word too often."

Investors rely on the bond grades issued by Moody's, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings. Collectively, they issue about 95% of ratings globally -- a total nearly unchanged from before the financial crisis.

The company reaffirmed its guidance for the year.

Moody's shares edged lower to $107.22. The shares have increased 12% so far this year.

Moody's repurchased 3.8 million shares in the first quarter at a cost of $365.8 million. Moody's has $1.2 billion of share-repurchase authority remaining.

World News: Asia: Thailand Cuts Benchmark Rate as Economy Falters

BANGKOK -- Thailand's faltering economy pushed the central bank to unexpectedly cut its policy rate on Wednesday, as poor exports and slower-than-predicted economic recovery continued to exact a toll on business.

The Bank of Thailand's monetary-policy committee members voted 5-2 to cut the benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage point to 1.5%, citing slow economic recovery despite higher government spending and a sunnier outlook for the tourism sector.

The latest rate cut also aimed to weaken the Thai baht to lift exports, which account for roughly two-thirds of Thailand's gross domestic product, while helping boost domestic spending.

Weiwen Ng from ANZ Research said that the interest-rate policy, with an element of surprise announcement, "is perhaps the strongest instrument the BOT can rely on in tempering the strong baht, which is out of step with the sluggish economy."

The baht has strengthened around 1% against the U.S. dollar since the beginning of the year. Exports contracted more than 4% in the first quarter amid slow global growth, higher risks from an economic slowdown in China, and a drop in imports by major trading partners.

"I think this [rate cut] will only have a short-term impact on the baht as its movement should be driven by external factors, such as the Fed, more than the interest-rate policy," said Thammarat Kittisiripat, an economist at TMB Analytics in Bangkok.

Other countries in the region have lowered rates this year. But the market didn't expect another cut from Thailand this time after a surprise 0.25 percentage-point cut in March, betting the central bank wouldn't want to spark even greater household borrowing.

Thailand's household debt stood at 89.5% of GDP at the end of 2014 -- one of the highest in the world, compared with the country's income level.

Krystal Tan from Capital Economics said in a research note that, in addition to weak growth, "negative inflation" and government pressure contributed to the central bank's decision in favor of back-to-back easing of Thailand's monetary policy.

"The [monetary-policy committee's] statement was notably more dovish both in its concerns over the external outlook -- explicitly referring to the negative impact of recent baht strength on exports for the first time -- as well as on inflation, where reference was made to the drag from weak domestic demand, not just oil prices," Barclays said.

Thailand has recorded three consecutive months of disinflation -- a decrease in the rate of inflation -- since January, with the headline consumer-price index falling 0.6% on-year in March when core inflation also softened to 1.3% year-over-year.

Even after the bank's rate cut in March, the military-appointed government, which took office a few months after a military coup in May 2014, urged the central bank to lower its policy rate by at least an additional quarter point in order to lift exports and strengthen the economy.

Thailand's shipments of major industrial goods, particularly computers and parts, have been performing poorly, while prices of such key agricultural items as rubber remain low.

Private investment and consumption were also very downbeat during the first two months of the year, despite measures taken by the government to speed up spending and its announcement of billion-dollar infrastructure development projects.

Venezuela cashes out $1bn of its gold; Commodities

Interest-bearing deal to combat soaring inflation is a coup for Citigroup

Venezuela has turned to Wall Street to help it secure US dollar funding through its large gold reserves as it battles with an economic crisis that has left it struggling to pay for food, medicine and even toilet paper.

According to people familiar with the deal, the central bank has swapped gold for $1bn in cash through a complex agreement with Citigroup.

The deal will provide foreign currency for the socialist government of President Nicols Maduro as it grapples with soaring inflation, chronic shortages of everyday items and an economy that is shrinking because of falling oil prices.

Barack Obama, US president, called the Latin American country a national security threat in March , restricting travel and freezing the assets of some Venezuelans, after Venezuela ordered Washington to slash diplomatic staff.

The structure of the deal is unclear but, according to media reports, Caracas has pledged 1.4m troy ounces of gold - equivalent to 3,500 gold bars, or 14 per cent of the UK's gold reserves - for about $1bn in cash, on which Venezuela will pay interest.

At current prices, the bullion is worth almost $1.7bn, providing Citi with a cushion should prices fall. Gold has fallen 36 per cent since a peak in 2011 but is up 1.8 per cent so far this year to about $1,200 a troy ounce. Citi declined to comment on the deal.

Venezuela has the world's largest oil reserves but its economy is forecast to shrink 7 per cent this year. It has printed money to fund a fiscal deficit estimated at 20 per cent of gross domestic product, fuelling inflation that is expected to top 150 per cent.

Its international currency reserves hit an 11-year low of $19bn in April. About $14bn of that is held in gold, most of it stored at the central bank in Caracas.

Venezuela has almost $8bn to repay in principal and interest payments this year, according to Alejandro Arreaza, Barclays economist.

Although it has so far made good on debt payments, Caracas is rated by Moody'sAnalytics the most likely country to default after Ukraine.

Its gold reserves, at almost 377 tonnes, are the world's 16th biggest, according to the World Gold Council.

Hugo Chvez, the late president who was a longtime US critic, said he would free Venezuela from the "dictatorship of the dollar". He directed the central bank to ditch greenbacks and amass gold instead. Four years ago, as a safeguard against market instability, he repatriated most of the gold stored overseas.

The Venezuela deal is a coup for Citi, which has been expanding its commodities business as rivals including Barclays, Credit Suisse and Deutsche Bank have retreated from the sector because of increased regulation.

Citi has been using its global lending franchise and trade finance business to pitch and win deals. It has been involved in Mexico's oil-hedging programme - the largest of its kind - and entered into derivative contracts with the Moroccan government to hedge the cost of imported fuel.

AIG s Profit Jumps 53%, Helped by Investment Sales; Insurer s operating income tops Wall Street estimates

American International Group Inc. said its first-quarter profit jumped 53%, buoyed by the sale of investment holdings, while the one-time government ward continued a strong share-buyback program.

Net income rose to $2.47 billion, or $1.78 a share, including $874 million in net realized capital gains from investment sales that included a stake in a Chinese insurer. In the prior-year period, the New York insurance conglomerate logged $1.61 billion, or $1.09 a share, in net income.

AIG's operating income, which excludes realized capital gains and losses and is closely watched by investors, slipped 2.9% to $1.69 billion, from $1.74 billion, but on a per-share basis rose to $1.22 from $1.18 a share.

The operating results exceeded Wall Street expectations of $1.19 a share as compiled by Thomson Reuters. AIG shares edged up fractionally in after-hours trading.

The results reflect the second full quarter of management of the company by Peter Hancock, who took over last September as chief executive. Mr. Hancock succeeded Robert Benmosche, who restored the company to profitability and helped it fully repay a financial-crisis bailout package that had topped $180 billion at its peak.

Mr. Benmosche, who died in February, slimmed down the once-sprawling financial-services behemoth. He sold many businesses to raise money to pay back the government and narrowed the company's focus primarily to a world-wide property-casualty insurance business and a U.S. life-insurance and retirement-services business.

AIG said it bought back about $1.4 billion in shares during the first quarter and repurchased about an additional $800 million through the end of April. It said the board had authorized buying back more shares worth up to $3.5 billion.

As previously announced, AIG in March sold shares of PICC Property & Casualty Co., receiving gross proceeds of about $500 million. It continues to be a large investor in the Chinese company.

AIG is one of three insurance companies that have been designated nonbank  systemically important financial institutions" subject to oversight by the Federal Reserve. However, the capital and other nonbank SIFI rules are yet to be determined, so the designated companies at this point don't have to go through a formal approval process for raising dividends or buying back shares.

Mr. Hancock's tenure is under way as insurers face multiple headwinds. For many quarters, low interest rates have depressed earnings on the bonds typically bought with policyholders' premiums and held until claims are due. AIG cited lower net investment income on both the property-casualty and life-insurance side.

Commercial insurers also face deterioration in prices for many types of policies, and the continued strong dollar means global companies are subject to adverse foreign-exchange rates. AIG said its commercial-insurance net premiums written, the benchmark commonly used by analysts for gauging top-line growth, increased 1% to $5.05 billion compared with the prior-year quarter, and said they increased 6% excluding the effects of foreign exchange.

The commercial-insurance unit's closely watched combined ratio, which is the percentage of each premium dollar spent on claims and expenses, decreased to 97.1% from 98.9% in the year-earlier quarter. The company said the improvement stemmed from lower catastrophe claims among other positive developments, while the year-earlier results were stung by unfavorable adjustments to older loss reserves.

The unit's general expenses decreased slightly, as increased efficiencies were  offset by investments in technology, engineering and analytics," which have been a priority of Mr. Hancock.

ClickSoftware Technologies Ltd. said Thursday that it has agreed to be purchased by Francisco Partners Management L.P. for $438 million in cash, after which the company will be taken private.

ClickSoftware is an Israeli company that develops software for workplace management. Francisco Partners is a private-equity firm focusing on technology.

The offer of $12.65 a share is a 29% premium on ClickSoftware's closing price on Wednesday.

 We are excited to partner with Francisco Partners, a firm with an established track record of working with companies transitioning to Cloud and with companies in relevant verticals to ClickSoftware," ClickSoftware Chief Executive Moshe BenBassat said.

Separately, ClickSoftware said that its first-quarter sales are expected to be in the range of $26 million to $27 million, below the analyst consensus of $33 million, according to Thomson Reuters. It will report full results on May 6.

Earlier in April, Francisco agreed to pay $240 million to buy Fremont, Calif.-based analytics company Procera Networks Inc., which it will also take private.

BGC plans to sell Trayport unit after receiving approaches

BGC Partners, the US interdealer broker, is looking to sell Trayport, one of its electronic trading venues, after being approached by several parties in recent months, its chief executive has said.

The New York group said on Wednesday it was willing to sell the unit it inherited with February's takeover of rival GFI Group, and hoped to have a deal completed by the end of the year. The asset was coveted by CME Group, the US's largest futures exchange by market capitalisation, but shareholders backed a rival offer by BGC to buy GFI earlier this year.

"It's a great product and has a great position in the marketplace. From the beginning [of bidding for GFI], we never felt that Trayport got the attention and valuation it deserved," Howard Lutnick, chief executive of BGC told FT Trading Room.

"We've been approached by multiple parties. Sometimes one makes a sad decision. I haven't as of yet been able to get the market to look inside and understand the company to increase shareholder value. I hope this will create attention and create interest."

BGC paid $6.10-per-share to take a controlling stake in GFI, valuing GFI equity at around $780m. The financial advisers for GFI last year had put a prospective valuation range of between $650m and $728m for the unit.

The asset is widely used by traders, brokers, utilities and resource companies to conduct voice and electronic trading and clearing of gas, coal, power and emissions in over-the-counter markets in Europe.

Mr Lutnick also confirmed that BGC would retain Fenics, the risk analytics business that the CME also attempted to buy last summer. "We will still keep it. Fenics has growth whose time has yet to come."

BGC also confirmed it expected to cut annual costs of $50m from the GFI deal by stripping out duplication of telecom lines, data centre costs, software suppliers and interest expenses.

Banks approached over IPO or sale that would value business at $5.5bn

The private equity owners of Interactive Data Corporation, the US financial information company, are preparing to sell their investment in a deal that would value the business at as much as $5.5bn including debt, people familiar with the matter said.

Silver Lake Partners and Warburg Pincus have launched the early phases of a dual-track process that could lead either to a sale or a US flotation of IDC, these people said. The two firms are preparing to interview banks.

An auction of IDC could appeal to strategic bidders including financial data companies such as McGraw Hill Financial, owner of Standard & Poor's, the rating agency, or Thomson Reuters.

But the deal's possible size may put off some bidders as IDC's value would make it quite big for competitors to absorb. As a result, a listing may be a more viable scenario for its owners. Warburg Pincus and Silver Lake declined to comment.

The two US private equity firms acquired IDC in 2010 in a buyout that gave the company an enterprise value of $3.4bn. IDC was at the time controlled by Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, which received $2bn for its 61 per cent stake in the business.

IDC evaluates prices for 2.7m financial securities every day, including 46,000 corporate debt issues, 1.1m US municipal bonds and 45,000 high-yield bonds, among other services it provides.

The company reported $362m in adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation in 2014, up 3 per cent from a year earlier. Revenues rose 3.7 per cent to $939m. IDC had total debt outstanding of $2.2bn and cash of $320m at the end of last year.

Global spending on financial data, analysis or news increased 4 per cent to $26.5bn last year, according to Burton-Taylor, a consultancy. The market is dominated by Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters, which have shares by sales of 32 per cent and 26 per cent respectively.

FactSet is the third-largest player in the industry, with $945m in revenue.

Dealmaking in the financial data industry has stepped up of late with the acquisition of Wood Mackenzie, the energy specialist, by Nasdaq-listed Verisk Analytics for $2.8bn this year.

Interest in the financial data sector has also led to recent listings. Markit, the UK-based financial data provider, raised $1.3bn from a New York IPO in June last year. Its shares have risen 7.8 per cent since, giving it a market capitalisation of $4.8bn.

Industrial Warehouses In U.K. Are Acquired

Blackstone Group LP has bought 16 industrial warehouses in the U.K., the latest sign that the U.S. private-equity firm is using its deep pockets to push into all corners of the European real-estate market.

The firm, through its European logistics arm Logicor, paid nearly 400 million ($607.3 million) for the properties, a person familiar with the deal said.

Industrial warehouses are becoming vital as retailers across Europe shift to online delivery-focused business models, with next-day delivery a must. Real-estate investors have piled into the sector. Last year,  24.9 billion ($26.8 billion) flowed into European industrial properties, up from  19.3 billion in 2013, but still below the prefinancial-crisis peak, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics.

Blackstone formed Logicor in 2012 to buy industrial assets in the region. Last year, it scooped up more than  2 billion of logistics properties, more than doubling the size of its portfolio while expanding into six new markets, including Germany, Spain and Italy.

Blackstone, the world's largest real-estate investor, embarked on a similar push in the U.S. in 2010 with its IndCor Properties business. It sold IndCor to GIC Pte. Ltd., Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund, for $8.1 billion in December.

Consortium Buys Stake in Ship Tracker

An investor consortium including one of Asia's richest businessmen and a former chief executive of Thomson Reuters Corp. has taken a stake in Windward, valuing the ship-tracking startup at about $100 million.

Among new investors in the Tel Aviv firm are Li Ka-shing's Horizons Ventures and Angelic Ventures, the family office of former Thomson Reuters CEO Thomas Glocer. The $10.8 million investment for a roughly 10% stake follows previous funding rounds in 2011 and 2013.

Windward takes information about movements of ships around the world and uses a database of historical voyages to predict patterns of global trade and highlight unusual movements.

The company, founded by two former officers of the Israeli navy, said it would use the proceeds to launch a product that caters to Wall Street. Big banks, hedge funds and commodity-trading firms use information about seaborne commodity shipments to make bets on prices in raw-materials markets, such as oil and iron ore. Shifts in supply-and-demand trends often ripple through financial markets. The company already has been offering its technology to clients in security, intelligence and law-enforcement sectors.

Windward's competitors include Bloomberg LP and Reuters.

Mr. Ka-shing made his fortune in a diverse array of industries ranging from ports and shipping to plastics and retail. Horizons is known for prior investments in companies including Skype, Spotify AB and Facebook Inc. Angelic Ventures has invested in financial-technology and data-analysis companies such as Bitcoin payment provider Coinbase Inc.

Horizons Ventures will take a seat on Windward's board. Mr. Glocer will join the advisory board.

Real-estate investors have piled into the sector. Last year, 24.9 billion euros ($27.1 billion) flowed into European industrial properties, up from 19.3 billion euros in 2013, but still below the pre-financial-crisis peak, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics.

The run looks set to continue, with logistics properties expected to be the best-performing real-estate sector in Europe over the next five years, a recent report from Deutsche Asset Wealth Management said.

Blackstone formed Logicor in 2012 to buy industrial assets in the region. Last year it scooped up more than 2 billion euros of logistics properties, more than doubling the size of its portfolio while expanding into six new markets, including Germany, Spain and Italy.

Blackstone, the world's largest real-estate investor, embarked on a similar push in the U.S. in 2010 with its IndCor Properties business. It sold IndCor to GIC Pte. Ltd., Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund, for $8.1 billion in December.

The U.K. warehouse deal "by Blackstone comes after notable recent growth for our platform in Germany and Portugal, as well as acquisitions in France and Spain as part of the GE portfolio Blackstone agreed to acquire earlier this month," Mr. Barzegar said.

Blackstone said earlier this month that, along with partner Wells Fargo & Co., it was buying General Electric's $23 billion portfolio of real-estate assets. In March, Blackstone said that in less than four months it raised a record $14.5 billion to buy real estate around the world.

The U.K. warehouse purchase is Logicor's first U.K. deal since November. It bought the six million square feet properties from U.K. private-equity firm Oaktree Capital Management LP and real-estate investor Anglesea Capital.

The properties in the portfolio are in markets close to urban centers such as Birmingham, Leeds and Oxford. Logicor now owns 21 million square feet of logistics assets in the U.K.

Other notable deals in the sector recently include the $5.9 billion agreement by Prologis Inc., a big owner of warehouses and distribution centers, which agreed to buy industrial-property owner KTR Capital Partners.

FT REPORT - RISK MANAGEMENT: PROPERTY
Industry must adjust to climate change loss

Sharing data is vital for countering extreme weather events, reports Sarah Murray

Videos produced by the Insurance Institute for Business & Home Safety - in which simulated tornadoes and hurricanes tear off rooftops and force structures to collapse - make it easy to understand why climate change might prompt insurance companies to rethink their exposure to property risk.

Yet, in response to the increased frequency and severity of storms and floods, insurers can do more than simply raise their premiums.

The storms that appear in the US-based IBHS videos were generated using giant fans and massive tanks of water. But recent years have produced plenty of hard evidence of the damage that can be wreaked on property by actual storms, from severe flooding in Bangkok in 2011 to Hurricane Sandy in New York and New Jersey in 2012.

And these events are costly. The Thai floods led to $47bn in economic losses, according to Swiss Re, the global reinsurer, while Hurricane Sandy caused $68bn of damage across the eastern seaboard of the US, destroying more than 300,000 homes.

Emerging markets are particularly at risk, since they are urbanising rapidly - often in the absence of the building codes needed to ensure that developments can withstand storms and floods.

Moreover, in many cases, the insurance sector is less well developed in these countries than in mature markets.

Whether in emerging or mature markets, metropolitan areas are often located near coasts, which means that threats are a central concern for insurers. And as the value of city real estate increases, so do the potential losses.

For insurers, the challenge is not only to price into their risk models the greater frequency and severity of storms, but also to take account of the changing value of assets located in exposed areas.

The relative vulnerability of real estate fabric is another consideration for insurers. This includes the age of infrastructure. For example, climateresilient measures - such as water-resistant construction materials - are more often present in new developments than in older structures.

However, while new buildings may be able to withstand windstorms and tornadoes more effectively, newer structures can be less resilient when it comes to flooding, since far more infrastructure - from heating and electricity systems to computer servers - is now placed underground.

Tim Bunt is global head of risk management at CBRE, the property services company, and points to Hurricane Sandy as an example. "The wind damage was one thing," he says. "But with the flooding, a number of high-value assets were impacted not just for weeks but months."

In addition to climate change, a range of other factors must inform pricing models, says Andreas Schraft, head of catastrophe perils at Swiss Re.

"It's not just climate change. Several developments are leading to increased exposure and claims," he says. "We need to know those risks, so we can charge the right price."

Sophisticated weather modelling technologies can help. "What the insurers now have is big data," says Mr Bunt. "And their models are giving them better insight, not only as to how to price their risk but also where to take risk."

This can lead some insurers to alter the geographic emphasis of their risk portfolio.

Cynthia McHale, director of the insurance programme at Ceres, a US-based coalition of investors and environmental organisations, says: "Some companies are making decisions about not being involved in a market or limiting their coverage in a certain market."

However, she adds that in highly regulated markets such as some US states, cherry-picking their coverage is not an option for insurers. "In the past, insurance companies can and have pulled out of markets wholesale," she says. "But where the regulator might step in is if an insurance company wants to operate in only parts of a state."

To remain in certain markets, it is in the insurers' interests to play a role in reducing the risks to property from extreme weather.

"There are a few things we can do and already do," says Mr Schraft. "We can share our view of the risks."

Swiss Re does this through reports such as last year's "Mind the Risk", in which it highlighted the perils facing more than 600 of the world's largest metropolitan areas.

In addition, Swiss Re publishes both a global map of flood-prone areas and a regular assessment of global insured losses from natural catastrophes.

Insurers can also integrate risk engineering and consulting services into their coverage, to help cities and businesses increase the resilience of their buildings to minimise future losses. These services range from helping companies understand the risks their property assets face and producing natural hazard loss models and simulations, to developing mitigation strategies.

Industry associations are also playing a role. In the UK, the Association of British Insurers hosts events and produces reports and guidance documents to help developers, planners and buyers identify and address a range of climate change threats to property.

Through industry associations, insurers can help to shape zoning laws and building codes. In 2014, for example, the IBHS joined New York-based groups in advocating the adoption of updated construction and renovation codes to increase the resilience and energy efficiency of the city's buildings.

Meanwhile, the IBHS "Rating the States" report ranks 18 hurricane-prone coastal states along the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic coast on how they have strengthened their residential building code systems since its previous study was published in 2012.

Even so, Ms McHale sees a marked difference between the willingness of the US insurance industry to address climate change and that of European companies, partly because the issue is still so contentious in the US.

"The industry [in the US] has been too reluctant to jump into the whole area of climate change and not only sound the alarm, but roll up its sleeves and work with cities, planners and property owners to look at where the risks are going to increase," she says.

A study of 330 US insurance companies, that Ceres published last year, highlighted this. The report found that 82 per cent of the 330 companies surveyed gained only a "beginning" or "minimal" rating in their response to climate risks.

Meanwhile, Mr Schraft argues that the industry could do more to share claims information globally. "The insurance industry has a wealth of data about what can help and that is also relevant for architects and city planners."

The issue of privacy is one barrier to this, however. Additionally, much valuable information remains siloed in insurance companies, stored in everything from their claims departments to their underwriting offices.

Finding ways to tap this rich vein of data could help the industry work more effectively with planners, engineers and architects on developing more resilient infrastructure. And, of course, doing so could allow the industry to remain profitable while meeting the insurance needs of the real estate sector in an increasingly risky world.

MasterCard Inc. agreed to acquire Applied Predictive Technologies, an analytics software that helps companies gauge things like pricing, marketing and merchandising, for $600 million, a deal it says helps differentiate its services to merchants.

APT helps companies tailor investments and attempt to boost their earnings by using analytics to design, measure and calibrate marketing and merchandising.

MasterCard said the deal would complement its recent acquisition of London-based retail consulting and analytics firm 5One, which was announced in November.

APT's customers include companies across a number of industries and it has offices around the world.

The deal is expected to close in the second quarter.

MasterCard, which has posted positive results recently as U.S. consumers continue to recover, is looking to expand into markets dominated by rival Visa Inc.

APT was founded in 1999. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s merchant banking division invested $100 million in the company in 2013. It previously received financing from Accel-KKR.

'Flash Crash' Arrest Sparks Questions

By day, Navinder Singh Sarao was a determined futures trader -- headphones on, hood pulled low, feet on his desk -- who boasted market powers that made him a legend among other small-time investors at an electronic-trading office on the outskirts of London.

At night, Mr. Sarao, 36 years old, returned to the modest, semidetached home he shared with his parents, near a flight path to Heathrow Airport. Two brothers lived nearby.

Mr. Sarao appeared in court in London on Wednesday, a day after he was arrested at his home on charges he manipulated financial markets and contributed to the swift drop in hundreds of stocks that came to be known as the flash crash. Between 2010 and 2014, the Justice Department alleges, Mr. Sarao manipulated futures markets through an illegal computerized trading technique known as spoofing and layering, earning $40 million in profit.

That one trader like Mr. Sarao could have engaged in activities that authorities now say contributed to the global market meltdown on May 6, 2010, has shocked investors and others. It has also highlighted difficulties regulators and prosecutors face trying to examine activities in complex financial markets -- and raised questions about why regulators didn't address the suspicious trading sooner.

"Somebody was asleep at the switch," said David Weisberger, managing director at the market-analytics firm RegOne Solutions. "It's not clear if it's the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission] or someone else, but somebody should have made a bigger deal out of this earlier."

Joel Smith, Mr. Sarao's lawyer, said in a London court Wednesday that "the arrest came as a bolt from the blue." Mr. Sarao was being held in lieu of <pound>5 million ($7.5 million) bail, and he said he would fight an extradition request by U.S. authorities. Mr. Smith declined to comment on the charges.

Exchanges in both the U.S. and Europe noticed Mr. Sarao's suspicious trades -- large orders placed and then quickly canceled -- in 2009 and 2010, and they questioned him about them, according to the Justice Department complaint.

The CME contacted Mr. Sarao in March 2009, according to criminal charges unsealed in Chicago on Tuesday, and again notified him in correspondence dated the day of the flash crash that his orders "are expected to be entered in good faith for the purpose of executing bona fide transactions."

In an email later that month, Mr. Sarao told the broker that cleared his trades that he called the CME and "told em to kiss my ass."

In a July 2010 email, Mr. Sarao told representatives of German derivatives exchange Eurex that all of his trades were placed "manually by me and only me," not by a computer program.

Mr. Sarao continued to trade through 2015 in the futures at issue, the S&P 500 E-mini futures contract, which trades on the CME. Futures are contracts tied to the future value of an asset or index.

Mr. Sarao's downfall appears to have begun in late 2012, when a whistleblower gave U.S. commodities regulators data suggesting suspicious orders on May 6, 2010. The tip triggered a 2<frac12> -year probe by regulators, who were later joined by criminal authorities, ultimately landing Mr. Sarao under arrest and changing the government's narrative about why the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 1,000 points in a single day. Previously, a report by regulators said the crash was set off by a big sale of contracts from a large trader at an especially vulnerable moment, but no manipulation was cited.

CFTC officials say the agency doesn't have the technology to monitor canceled trades in real time, an issue they have said hinders their ability to police the market. CFTC investigators instead need to ask an exchange after the fact for order information about specific products on specific days.

CME Group Inc., the world's largest futures exchange, said in a statement that it stood by its 2010 analysis that "the Flash Crash was not caused by the futures market." The CME said it was "prohibited by law from releasing information about any individual's trading behavior, including Mr. Sarao's."

In the early 2000s, Mr. Sarao found his passion in trading futures, honing his skills at a so-called trading arcade run by a company called Futex on the outskirts of London, according to people who traded at the firm. Such arcades are a one-stop shop where traders can rent desk space and computer systems and take training courses in return for a fee and a share of any profit they make. Futex declined to comment.

Mr. Sarao proved adept at trafficking in stock futures, routinely posting gains of up to half a million pounds on a single day, according to those who knew him, and earning a reputation as a legendary trader.

Neil Crammond, a former risk manager at Futex, said Mr. Sarao was known for quirky behaviors, especially notable for such a successful trader. "He would turn up at 10 to get an off-peak train fare and would buy a sandwich at 4 to get it at half-price," he said.

Around 2008, Mr. Sarao moved on from Futex after the firm refused his request to raise the amount he was allowed to trade on any given day, according to Mr. Crammond. He eventually focused on trading by himself using commercially available software.

While authorities were aware of Mr. Sarao's potential connection to the questionable May 6 trades, they didn't move to arrest him until Tuesday. By 2014, Mr. Sarao appeared to stop trading for a while, leaving investigators without an urgent need to shut down his trading activity and allowing them to continue building their case, according to people familiar with the matter.

"Sometimes it takes a long time to put cases together," CFTC Chairman Timothy Massad said Wednesday, speaking in Chicago. "These are huge markets. There's a lot going on."

Andrei Kirilenko, a former CFTC chief economist who helped write a report on the crash while at the agency, said that, according to the complaint, Mr. Sarao's trading ceased in the minutes before the crash, making him skeptical Mr. Sarao played an integral role. In addition, Mr. Kirilenko noted that Mr. Sarao allegedly placed orders that weren't close to the best prevailing prices, and it isn't clear the market reacted to them.

"It's unclear how his particular activity is related to the flash crash itself," said Mr. Kirilenko, who now teaches at the MIT Sloan School of Management in Massachusetts.

Puerto Rico Needs to Finish Tax Overhaul, Officials Say; Investors including hedge funds want to see government take steps to improve finances

Puerto Rico's government may run out of money and have to shut down in the next three months, with a  devastating impact" for the U.S. commonwealth's economy, officials at the island's Government Development Bank warned this week.

In an April 21 letter to Puerto Rico's lawmakers and the governor, bank officials said the government needs to complete a tax overhaul and balance the budget to bolster"http://www.wsj.com/articles/puerto-rico-bankruptcy-bill-could-offer-roadmap-for-creditors-1424977816"of selling new bonds. Legislative fighting over the tax plan has stalled an effort to borrow up to $2.95 billion, as investors including hedge funds want to see Puerto Rico take steps to improve its finances before buying the debt.

Puerto Rico has more than $70 billion in debt and is struggling with a weak economy and high unemployment. Its bonds are widely held around the U.S. because they are typically exempt from federal, state and local taxes.

 A government shutdown would have a devastating impact on the economy," the letter said, citing cuts to public services. The letter was signed by officials including Melba Acosta, president of the GDB, which taps debt markets on behalf of Puerto Rico.

When the"http://www.wsj.com/articles/moodys-cuts-puerto-rico-rating-further-into-junk-1424381800" borrowed $3.5 billion in 2014, hoping to get some financial breathing room, hedge funds bought more than half the deal. Prices of some of those bonds touched new lows this week of about 78.5 cents on the dollar.

Puerto Rico's"http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/04/14/puerto-ricos-creditors-push-for-new-bulletproof-debt/?KEYWORDS=puerto have asked that the new bond deal include clauses that would raise the interest rate if the government fails to meet budget targets and would require timely standardized financial reports, according to people familiar with the matter.

GDB Chairman David Chafey Jr. said in an interview on Thursday that investors have made several proposals, but the tax overhaul and budget changes are the most important issues. He said he is still optimistic a bond deal can get done. The letter was intended to create a sense of urgency among Puerto Rican lawmakers because time is a factor, he added.

 There is a window here, and we need to make sure we take advantage of that window," Mr. Chafey said.

Lawmakers have sparred over the governor's planned move to a value-added tax, which is facing resistance from many quarters of Puerto Rico's economy, according to a report by Janney Capital Markets. Ms. Acosta has said a value-added tax would reduce tax evasion and contains exemptions protecting low-wage workers.

 The prospective investors continue to await full disclosure and the passage of tax reform," said Robert Donahue, managing director at Concord, Mass.-based research firm Municipal Market Analytics.  This can't take forever."

Pentagon to Open Silicon Valley Office, Provide Venture Capital; Defense Secretary Ash Carter set to discuss cyberwarfare strategy at Stanford University

The Pentagon plans to open its first office in Silicon Valley and provide venture capital in an effort to tap commercial technology that can be used to develop more advanced weapons and intelligence systems.

Pentagon officials said the twin moves are part of a broader "(http://www.wsj.com/articles/pentagon-to-defense-contractors-innovate-1416527136" to field technology more quickly and cheaply amid concerns that potential adversaries such as China are closing the gap or surpassing U.S. capabilities.

However, the Pentagon's push faces resistance from technology companies and the venture-capital community, which has long been wary of becoming ensnared in the department's bureaucracy and uncertain budget outlook.

Defense Secretary Ash Carter is scheduled to unveil the plans in a speech at Stanford University on Thursday that will also discuss a new Pentagon strategy for cyberwarfare. The three-day visit to Silicon Valley will include meetings with technology executives such as Facebook Inc. Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, as well as a venture-capital round table hosted by Andreessen Horowitz, according to a senior Pentagon official.

Hundreds of firms ranging from "http://www.wsj.com/articles/ford-mercedes-set-up-shop-in-silicon-valley-1427475558" to banks and consumer product firms have set up offices in the Bay Area in an effort to boost their access to the best technology.

 The only folks that don't have that presence are the government," said Peter Newell, a former Army procurement officer who's now managing partner at BMNT Partners, a Palo Alto, Calif.-based venture-capital firm that is one of the few in the Bay Area focused on defense work.  I'm surprised it's taken them so long to have this epiphany."

The Pentagon's planned office in Moffett Field is expected to be up and running in a month, with around 15 staffers drawn from active-duty military and reservists. The Department of Homeland Security also plans an office in the area, it said this week, and Mr. Newell said two other government agencies had talked with him about similar moves.

The Defense Department had a significant role in Silicon Valley's emergence as a global technology center during the 1970s, funding advances in microprocessing that were used to build precision weapons, and then applied to develop mass-market computing.

Now, the department is turning to commercial firms for advancements in 3-D printing, robotics, and using big data to mine intelligence.

Frank Kendall, the Pentagon's acquisition chief, told reporters last week that he's focused on attracting bids from companies that currently don't vie for government work. He said the department needs to do a better at accessing and using commercial technologies.  Our potential adversaries are already doing so," he said.

With many venture-capital firms avoiding investments in firms tied to government business, Mr. Carter will announce plans for the Defense Department to create its own funding vehicle.

The department plans to use In-Q-Tel, a venture-capital firm set up by the U.S. intelligence agencies in 1999, as the conduit. It will provide a small amount of seed capital during a one-year pilot program with the firm, whose past investments have included Keyhole Inc., which later provided the core technology for Google Earth.

The Pentagon has toyed in the past with small-scale venture capital initiatives. The Army set up OnPoint Technologies in 2002, but its investments were limited to energy-related technologies. The Defense Venture Catalyst Initiative was created in 2005 as a loose-knit advisory group of financiers looked to tap technology for the military, but budget pressures have since curtailed its activity.

People pushing the Pentagon to become more innovative said it needs to offer commercial firms a route to use technology for both commercial and military purposes, expanding the potential marketplace.

It may also require major change at the Pentagon.  There's a  fear of failure' culture," said Ben Kohlmann, a former Navy aviator who set up the Defense Entrepreneurs Forum. The network of junior officers generated and pushed innovative ideas, including the use of swarms of small drones to airlift supplies into hostile areas.

The pursuit of solutions to big problems that might generate big financial returns for financial backers is ingrained in the nation's tech community.  It has to be done in the manner that the Valley does business," Mr. Newell said of the Pentagon's initiative.  They're going to have to learn to expect some failures."

While Mr. Kendall and other Pentagon leaders have pledged to reduce bureaucracy and trim other impediments such as ownership of intellectual property, there are concerns this could take too long to lure Silicon Valley.

 I don't think they have a plan. It's a structural problem [at the Pentagon]," said one executive with close ties to the department.

Small-Time Trader Eyed In Meltdown --- Sarao's lawyer to fight extradition to U.S., says client's arrest came 'as a bolt from the blue'

In the 19th century, American prospectors headed west to make their fortunes mining gold. Today, from California and Colorado to New York and Massachusetts, US states are seeing a "green rush" as entrepreneurs and investors stake their claims in the legal marijuana market .

Legal sales of cannabis for medical purposes and "recreational" consumption in the US grew about 75 per cent in 2014 to $2.7bn, according to ArcView, an investor network . Medical marijuana is legal in 23 states and the District of Columbia. Colorado, Washington, Oregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia permit some recreational use by adults.

While marijuana remains illegal under federal law, ArcView predicts sales will reach $10.8bn by 2019 as more states end prohibition. "It's a massive opportunity," says Brendan Kennedy, chief executive and co-founder of Privateer Holdings, a Seattle-based private equity fund focused on cannabis. "It's the first time anyone in our lifetime is seeing a $40bn-$50bn industry transition from illicit to legal."

Like the gold rush, the pot boom is luring people hoping to get rich quick. Many ventures fizzle out, but some entrepreneurs say they are working to build businesses with global ambitions and winning the backing of venture capitalists and Silicon Valley billionaires. Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, which in-vested in Facebook and Spotify, was part of Privateer's latest $75m funding round . It marked the pot industry's largest private capital raising to date.

"This is the time to try to build businesses," says Leslie Bocskor, an investment banker in Las Vegas who is spearheading efforts to develop what advocates say is the next big consumer sector. His firm, Electrum Partners, is raising $25m for its own cannabis investment fund: "We should have an exemplary industry that's run by professionals as we transition from the black market to the white market."

Terra Tech: Wall Street to weed

In 2010, amid fallout from the financial crisis, Derek Peterson left Morgan Stan-ley to start GrowOp Technology, a company selling hydroponic equipment to marijuana growers in California. The company became Terra Tech and he took it public in 2012. Shares trade over the counter rather than on an exchange, and the company has expanded into medical marijuana cultivation and dispensaries. It posted $7.1m in revenue and a $21.9m net loss in 2014.

Late last year, Terra Tech became the first company to win approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission to use the money it raises on the stock market to cultivate and sell marijuana. It is setting up dispensaries in Nevada and applying for licences to operate in New York's new medical market, following the state's legalisation of some medical cannabis last year. Mr Peterson is eyeing Florida, where the legislature is considering a medical legalisation bill.

"It's a land grab right now to get permits to operate medical marijuana facilities around the country," he says. "If we have penetration in the biggest markets, when federal prohibition goes away, we'll be well positioned for geographic dispersion around the country."

Like Privateer, which partnered with Bob Marley's estate on a line of products bearing the reggae singer's name, Terra Tech wants to build brands to win customer loyalty. It recently launched IVXX, a line of cannabis products including joints, oils and plants.

But even as more states permit the sale of its products and public support for marijuana legalisation swells, Terra Tech and its peers face big hurdles. Banks remain wary of handling money from companies involved with a drug that federal law still classifies as a controlled substance alongside heroin and LSD. "We lost our [bank] account," Mr Peterson says. "We pay our sales tax in cash. That's a concern. It invites money laundering, theft, a criminal element."

High There: making connections

Cannabis already has a rich subculture. Todd Mitchem thinks cannabis needs a social network. Two months ago, the entrepreneur from Denver launch-ed High There, a smartphone app to connect marijuana users. It has been dubbed "Tinder for pot smokers", after the dating app, but Mr Mitchem says his aim is to make it easier for cannabis users to find like-minded friends as well as potential romantic connections. "It's also for people like my mom, who is a two-time cancer survivor, who used marijuana medicinally, and who didn't have anyone to talk to about it," he says.

The app was initially only available to consumers in US states where marijua-na consumption is legal. But High There recently won approval from Apple and Google's Android app stores to go global, and can now be downloaded anywhere.

Mr Mitchem has funded the company with about $300,000 of his own money and a small investment from a friend, but is in the middle of raising a first funding round from outside investors. He is no stranger to "cannabusiness", having worked at OpenVape, which makes marijuana vaporisers.

In Colorado, he was involved with the industry's efforts to work out regulations when pot became legal last year. That experience proved useful when lobbying the tech companies to get his app broadly approved.

"The acceptance of cannabis is evolving quickly," he says. "The idea that people can now seek out other cannabis users is becoming more mainstream. But the industry is going to have to get really sharp about consumer safety, product quality, interaction with law enforcement. They have to start behaving like grown-up companies."

PotBotics: research and robotics

Father and son Boris and David Goldstein saw the beneficial effects of medical marijuana with their own eyes. In 2011, David Goldstein's grandmother began treatment for cancer, but the pain medication diminished her quality of life. Then she tried pain relief using cannabidiol, one of the main components in cannabis. He says: "She could get up in the morning rather than being bed-ridden."

Mr Goldstein, a college graduate working in marketing, and his father, an ex-pert in artificial intelligence and robotics, wanted to know why the cannabis treatment worked. "We want to quant-ify some of the claims being made in the medical market, " he says.

In 2013 they founded PotBotics, based in Palo Alto in California and New York. They have raised about $2m from friends and family. The company, which has not yet generated revenue, will launch its first product this year: PotBot, a virtual "budtender" - the industry's term for workers at dispensaries who sell cannabis and educate customers. Medical patients can use the PotBot app on their smartphones, computers or in-store kiosks to answer questions about ailments and symptoms. PotBot will recommend the right kind of cannabinoid, what strains of marijuana have the appropriate levels and how best to consume it, whether by vaporising, eating or using a skin cream or oil.

"Our goal is to add transparency to the industry," Mr Goldstein says. "We hope to be pioneers. As states see the hard scientific research, their arguments against it being a medicine will be drawn into question."

PotBotics is also working on BrainBot, a wireless electroencephalography helmet that doctors would use to see how patients' brains are affected by using marijuana. A third area of interest is agriculture. PotBotics plans to develop technology to read plant DNA that growers can use to improve their yields.

"Our investors have a long-term vision. We are trying to create a company that is positioned as a technological innovator for the medical cannabis community," says Mr Goldstein.

U.K.  Flash Crash  Trader Navinder Sarao Fighting Extradition to U.S. Granted Bail; U.S. authorities allege trader played a role in  flash crash  in May 2010

By day, Navinder Singh Sarao was a determined futures trader headphones on, hood pulled low, feet on his desk who boasted market powers that made him a legend among other small-time investors at an electronic-trading facility on the outskirts of London.

At night, Mr. Sarao, 36 years old, returned to the modest, semidetached home he shared with his parents, near a flight path to Heathrow Airport. Two brothers lived nearby.

Mr. Sarao appeared in court in London Wednesday, a day after he was arrested at his home on "http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-man-arrested-on-charges-tied-to-may-2010-flash-crash-1429636758"and contributed to the swift drop in hundreds of stocks that came to be known as the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704370704575227754131412596". Between 2010 and 2014, the Justice Department alleges, Mr. Sarao manipulated futures markets through an illegal computerized trading "http://blogs.wsj.com/briefly/2015/02/22/5-things-to-know-about-spoofing-in-financial-markets/"and layering, earning $40 million in profits.

That one trader like Mr. Sarao could have engaged in activities that authorities now say contributed to the global market meltdown on May 6, 2010, has shocked investors and others. It has also highlighted difficulties regulators and prosecutors face trying to examine activities in complex financial markets and raised questions about why regulators didn't address the suspicious trading sooner.

 Somebody was asleep at the switch," said David Weisberger, managing director at the market-analytics firm RegOne Solutions.  It's not clear if it's the [Chicago Mercantile Exchange or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission] or someone else, but somebody should have made a bigger deal out of this earlier."

Joel Smith, Mr. Sarao's lawyer, said in a London court Wednesday,  the arrest came as a bolt from the blue." Mr. Sarao was being held in lieu of 5 million ($7.5 million) bail, and he said he would fight an extradition request by U.S. authorities. Mr. Smith declined to comment on the charges.

Exchanges in both the U.S. and Europe noticed Mr. Sarao's suspicious trades large orders placed and then quickly canceled in 2009 and 2010, and they questioned him about them, according to the Justice Department complaint.

The CME contacted Mr. Sarao in March 2009, "http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/SaraoDOJ04-21-2015.pdf" unsealed in Chicago on Tuesday, and again notified him in correspondence dated the day of the flash crash that his orders  are expected to be entered in good faith for the purpose of executing bona fide transactions."

In an email later that month, Mr. Sarao told the broker that cleared his trades that he called the CME and  told em to kiss my ass."

In a July 2010 email, Mr. Sarao told representatives of German derivatives exchange Eurex that all of his trades were placed  manually by me and only me," not by a computer program.

Mr. Sarao continued to trade through 2015 in the futures at issue, the S&P 500 E-mini futures contract, which trades on the CME. Futures are contracts tied to the future value of an asset or index.

Mr. Sarao's downfall appears to have begun in late 2012, when a whistleblower gave U.S. commodities regulators data suggesting suspicious orders on May 6, 2010. The tip triggered a 2 -year probe by regulators, who were later joined by criminal authorities, ultimately landing Mr. Sarao under arrest and changing the government's narrative about why the Dow Jones Industrial Average plummeted 1,000 points in single day. Previously, a report by regulators said the crash was set off by a big sale of contracts from a large trader at an especially vulnerable moment, but no manipulation was cited.

CFTC officials say the agency doesn't have the technology to monitor canceled trades in real time, an issue they have said hinders their ability to police the market. CFTC investigators instead need to ask an exchange after the fact for order information about specific products on specific days.

CME Group Inc., the world's largest futures exchange, said in a statement that it stood by its 2010 analysis that  the Flash Crash was not caused by the futures market." The CME said it was  "http://www.wsj.com/articles/cme-says-prohibited-from-releasing-info-about-any-individuals-trading-1429734205" from releasing information about any individual's trading behavior, including Mr. Sarao's."

In the early 2000s, Mr. Sarao found his passion in trading futures, honing his skills at a so-called trading arcade run by a company called Futex on the outskirts of London, according to people who traded at the firm. Such arcades are a one-stop shop where traders can rent desk space and computer systems and take training courses in return for a fee and a share of any profits they make. Futex declined to comment.

Mr. Sarao quickly proved adept at trafficking in stock futures, routinely posting gains of up to half a million pounds on a single day, according to those who knew him, and earning a reputation as a legendary trader.

Neil Crammond, a former risk manager at Futex, said Mr. Sarao was known for quirky behaviors, especially notable for such a successful trader.  He would turn up at 10 to get an off-peak train fare and would buy a sandwich at 4 to get it at half-price," he said.

Around 2008, Mr. Sarao moved on from Futex after the firm refused his request to raise the amount he was allowed to trade on any given day, according to Mr. Crammond. He eventually focused on trading by himself using commercially available software.

While authorities were aware of Mr. Sarao's potential connection to the questionable May 6 trades, they didn't move to arrest him until Tuesday. By 2014, Mr. Sarao appeared to stop trading for a while, leaving investigators without an urgent need to shut down his trading activity and allowing them to continue building their case, according to people familiar with the matter.

 Sometimes it takes a long time to put cases together," CFTC Chairman Timothy Massad said Wednesday, speaking in Chicago.  These are huge markets. There's a lot going on."

Andrei Kirilenko, a former CFTC chief economist who helped write a report on the crash while at the agency, said that, according to the complaint, Mr. Sarao's trading ceased in the minutes before the crash, making him skeptical Mr. Sarao played an integral role. In addition, Mr. Kirilenko noted that Mr. Sarao allegedly placed orders that weren't close to the best prevailing prices, and it isn't clear the market reacted to them.

 It's unclear how his particular activity is related to the flash crash itself," said Mr. Kirilenko, who now teaches at the MIT Sloan School of Management in Massachusetts.

Network services company Procera Networks Inc. has agreed to be purchased by Francisco Partners Management LP for $240 million in cash.

Fremont, Calif-based Procera provides analytics for service providers. Francisco Partners is a private-equity firm focusing on technology.

The offer price of $11.50 a share is a 21% premium on Procera's closing price on April 21. The buyout price is similar to shares last traded at in March 2014. Procera had previously traded at $70 a share in 2003 after the company's IPO.

Shares of Procera jumped 20% in premarket trading. The stock had been down about 40% after the company posted weak third-quarter results in November, but had steadily pushed higher the past few months to get to pre-warning levels.

After the deal closes, Procera will become a private company.

Procera's board has unanimously approved the transaction after  careful consideration and an extensive process to review strategic alternatives," the company said.

Separately, Procera said it expects first-quarter revenue in the range of $19.5 to $20.5 million and to incur an operating loss. Analysts had expected sales of $17 million.

The deal is expected to close in June.

Welcome to the double-digit club, Morgan Stanley. The bank - the last of the big Wall Street names to report first-quarter earnings - announced strong results yesterday. Earnings per share of $1.14 came in well ahead of the 78c that analysts had predicted.

Those profits were good enough to push the much-scrutinised return on equity figure up to a formidable, at least in this era, 10 per cent. This was the best ROE number since 2007.

How did Morgan Stanley get to the mystical threshold? The bank would emphasise its wealth management business. Its army of nearly 16,000 advisers and brokers generated $4bn in revenue, good enough for a profit margin of 22 per cent. In 2007, the wealth unit had a margin of just 15 per cent on revenue less than half of today's level. The strategy in wealth management has been to favour management fees over commissions, use analytics to create a better experience for clients, and then to increase deposits and lending.

Corporate deal advice was also strong at the group, jumping 40 per cent to nearly $500m, although Morgan Stanley's chief rival Goldman Sachs last week reported first-quarter M&A revenue of twice that.

Still, the impact of trading revenue cannot be dismissed and it raises questions about the sustainability of that 10 per cent ROE. Revenue from equity trading jumped 31 per cent this quarter. The good news, at least from a risk management perspective, is that the growth in the more volatile fixed income, commodity and currency trading was only half of that, reaching just below $2bn of revenue. In 2007, that business generated $3.6bn, and FICC was nearly twice the size of equity trading in terms of revenue. Today they are roughly balanced.

Even after Morgan Stanley shares inched up 1 per cent yesterday, they are down 4 per cent for the year. One quarter of double-digit ROE is a good start but no more than that. The market is right to wait for more of the same.

Omnicom Group Inc. reported underlying revenue growth across its geographic markets that exceeded analysts' expectations, though foreign-currency fluctuations continued to weigh on overall results.

The owner of agencies such as BBDO, DDB and TBWA said organic revenue which strips out foreign-exchange fluctuations, acquisitions and dispositions rose 5.1% for the quarter that ended in March. That topped the 4.3% growth estimated by analysts on average, according to John Janedis, an analyst at Jefferies LLC.

North America, which represents 60% of Omnicom's business, posted organic revenue growth of 4.8% for the first quarter, driven by brand advertising and media operations. Omnicom said its European markets also showed signs of stability in the latest period.

 With the increasing complexity of the marketing landscape, our clients demand for our services is only increasing," Chief Executive John Wren said on an earnings call with analysts Tuesday.

Omnicom, the second-largest ad holding company in the world, has been building up its digital capabilities to keep up with new technologies and changing media-consumption habits that are rapidly transforming the industry. Like the other major advertising companies, Omnicom faces increasing competition from a new crop of technology, digital and data-analytics specialists who claim they can automate some of the tasks that agency employees have long handled. Since walking away from its proposed $35 billion merger with French rival Publicis last year, Omnicom has continued to post solid organic growth rates.

Overall, Omnicom's first-quarter net income rose 1.8% to $209.1 million, or 83 cents a share, while revenue slipped 0.9% to $3.47 billion. Analysts were looking for profit of 82 cents a share and revenue of $3.5 billion.

Domestic revenue increased 4.6% while international revenue fell 7.3%. Foreign-exchange rates reduced revenue by 6.4% in the latest period.

 They're off to a good start and even though FX and currency is a headwind for them. If you look at the underlying growth of the business, it was very healthy," said Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich.

Given the foreign-currency fluctuations, Mr. Wren said the company continues to project revenue growth of 3.5% for the year. The company said it isn't ready to forecast margins for the year, but aims to keep its second-quarter margins consistent with the year-before period.

Investors flood cyber security conference as groups seek to avoid being the next Target

When cyber security start-ups set out their stalls at the sector's largest conference today, they will be looking to show off their hacker-fighting prowess not just to buyers of security products, but also to Wall Street investors.

A new generation of cyber security companies is preparing to go public, as analysts predict a rise in spending by boards desperate not to be the next Sony Pictures, Home Depot or Target.

Dan Ives, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, says investors will be flocking to the RSA Conference in San Francisco these week because cyber security is a $15bn-$20bn market opportunity in the next three years.

"It is going to be like a Bon Jovi rock concert," he said, recalling former days when you could "hear a pin drop".

Venture capital funds have been flooding into cyber security, surpassing $1bn for the first time in the first quarter of 2015, according to the private company researcher PrivCo. VC funding for security software start-ups hit $2.3bn in 2014. Four years ago less than $1bn was raised in a whole year.

Rapid7 , a security data and analytics start-up; Bit9, which protects PCs; and Docusign, which enables signed contracts to be exchanged online, are tipped to be among those seeking to list.

Kathleen Smith, a manager of IPOfocused exchange traded funds at Renaissance Capital, said her watch list included LogRhythm, Zscaler and Apigee, which secures interactions with third-party applications and is set to go public next week.

Others linked with potential IPOs are Tanium , a large investment by VC firm Andreessen Horowitz, Skyhigh Networks , a Sequoia and Greylock investment, and Veracode, whose investors include fund managers Wellington Management and In-Q-Tel, which is backed by the CIA.

Venky Ganesan of Menlo Ventures, which invested in one of the few public next-generation security companies, Palo Alto Networks, said there could be between 20 and 30 IPOs in the sector in the next two or three years.

"They have had a major drought of cyber security companies . . . relative to the scale of the problem," he said. "Now I think we see the companies getting the increase in budgets, staying private and turning down acquisition offers."

Older antivirus companies have fallen out of favour, and most of the startups with newer solutions have yet to go public.

Total returns from the few companies to list have been high. Palo Alto has returned almost 250 per cent, Qualys about 330 per cent and Proofpoint almost 360 per cent since they listed in 2012, according to Renaissance Capital.

Enrique Salem, an investor at Bain Capital Ventures, which has stakes in Rapid7 and Docusign, said the interest stemmed from the most active threat environment he had seen in 28 years.

The rapid transformation from desktop to cloud, mobile and the internet of things was creating more holes for hackers to exploit. "We definitely see security IPOs performing well because of an increased demand for security - JPMorgan Chase doubled its security budget from $250m to $500m," he said.

David Cowan of Bessemer Ventures said: "In security, by definition, the incumbents are obsolete." Additional reporting by Nicole Bullock in New York

VCs Pour Money Into Cybersecurity Startups; New companies have taken different approaches to protecting digital data

In 2014 a year in which cyberthieves stole customer information from at least four Fortune 500 companies venture capitalists invested a record amount in privately held companies in the cybersecurity industry.

Venture-backed companies in the U.S. that provide cybersecurity technology or services raised $1.77 billion from investors last year, topping the previous high of $1.62 billion set in 2000 during the dot-com boom, according to industry tracker Dow Jones VentureSource. Globally, venture-backed cybersecurity companies raised $1.9 billion last year, also a record.

Cybersecurity has become an unending arms race, with companies and governments trying to protect themselves against attackers that include organized crime and increasingly nation-states.

Startups in the sector have approached the problem in different ways. Some provide software and services to businesses, some offer protection to consumers, and some focus on hardware and software at the infrastructure level that can potentially protect both.

Startups are taking different approaches to detecting and understanding threats. Some, for instance, are using crowdsourcing, gathering information from a wide range of sources about recent cyberattacks to keep up with hackers' latest methods. Others are using machine learning computers reacting to and anticipating new situations without reprogramming.

Still others focus on technologies to protect network endpoints anything from PCs to mobile devices to sensors in a manufacturing plant.

A growing concern among investors is the  Internet of Things," a term for the connection of everyday items, such as toothbrushes, baby pajamas and cars, to the Internet.  It's a huge threat," says Alex Doll, founder of TenEleven Ventures, a venture-capital firm that specializes in information security.  It's great that everything is connected, but all that data is one click away" for hackers, and it isn't protected as well as it would be in a more contained network, he says.

Protection of data, regardless of where it resides, has become paramount more so than building perimeter defenses. New cybersecurity technology is designed with the idea that attacks can't always be prevented and may have already occurred.

 Something will get through the network, and you're trying to make it irrelevant," says Ted Schlein, a general partner at venture-capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.

Companies Join Forces to Fight Hackers; As the threat grows, companies step up efforts to share information about attacks

Companies looking to bolster their defense against cyberthreats are finding strength in numbers.

With hackers and cyberterrorists becoming more advanced and breaches proliferating in both frequency and scale and claiming victims out of some of the world's biggest and most sophisticated companies collaboration among firms has emerged as one of the key ways to fight back.

 It's an arms race between attackers and defenders," says Mark Clancy, chief information-security officer at securities-clearing firm Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. (DTCC) and the head of Soltra, a joint venture overseeing a platform that makes information-sharing easier. By banding together, companies can tip each other off about specific threats and vulnerabilities discovered within their networks, he says,  decreasing the cost of their defense while raising the cost of their attackers."

The move toward greater collaboration represents a shift for many companies. Although the benefits of working together are cited often, many firms have been reluctant to share sensitive information about cyberattacks, fearing it might damage their reputations or tip off rivals to their strategies and plans.

But amid increased attention from Washington President Barack Obama in February signed an executive order urging more collaboration between organizations in the public and private sectors and a growing recognition of the consequences at stake, companies and industry groups have begun rapidly expanding the scope and potency of their information-sharing capabilities.

Pooling intelligence

A focal point of the new cooperation is Soltra, a partnership between DTCC and the Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center, or FS-ISAC, an industry group with more than 5,500 members, including the world's biggest banks. As head of Soltra, Mr. Clancy is overseeing the development and adoption of an information-exchange platform called Soltra Edge, which collects threat indicators such as suspicious IP addresses or particular forms of malware from member organizations and uses a special programming language to automate the transfer of that information to other members.

Because Soltra Edge users don't have to gather and scrutinize threat indicators manually via list serves, emails and spreadsheets, they can spot threats like malware in a matter of seconds, down from an average of seven hours, and take preventive measures such as blocking the source of the attempted breach before they are targeted.

 It's a machine-readable way of describing who the bad guy is and what type of attack it is," says Mr. Clancy.

Soltra, which launched the platform in December, reports more than 1,400 installations of the software through March 3, with roughly 40% coming from financial firms and 60% from other sectors. (Soltra offers a free version, as well as a premium version requiring payment.)

Nearly 400 FS-ISAC members are active Soltra Edge users, submitting over 10,000 information requests to the repository every day.

 We're already seeing some of the efforts start to pay off," says Bill Nelson, chief executive of FS-ISAC. In addition to giving companies the ability to make faster decisions, instances of identify theft are on the decline, he says.

FS-ISAC's cyberthreat repository a central database that stores reams of member-submitted threat data multiplied to more than 12 million indicators as of Oct. 1, a fivefold increase from a year ago.

With IT security vendors now working on ways to import threat data from organizations in the defense industry, as well as other sources, into the Soltra Edge platform, the size of the database and universe of potential collaborators is poised to grow. And that, experts say, will provide an even larger base from which threats can be detected.

Scoring the threats

Soltra isn't the only organization developing tools to make information sharing easier and more valuable.

Hewlett-Packard Co. offers a cloud-based analytics platform called Threat Central that supplies subscribers with streams of cyberthreat intelligence customized specifically for them. Included in this customized stream is an  evilness" score from one to 100 with  100 being Satan" based on the impact a particular threat is likely to have on that specific subscriber, says Ted Ross, director of threat intelligence at H-P.

For example, an active attack that involves extracting and reselling data may score higher for a retail business than for a company that doesn't collect sensitive customer information.

 Information-sharing is table stakes," says Mr. Ross.  Making it relevant and timely is where the value comes into play."

A beta version of Threat Central launched in December, and a full version is now generally available.

Perhaps the biggest splash this year, however, has been made by tech giant Facebook Inc., which jumped into the cybersecurity space in February with the launch of its own information-sharing platform called Facebook Threat Exchange.

Mark Hammell, manager of Facebook's threat-infrastructure team, says Threat Exchange differs from Soltra Edge in that it allows participants to share information with a more flexible network.

 The publisher gets to define the privacy on individual pieces of data," says Mr. Hammell. Firms can quickly create a customized list of receivers, which may include same-sector firms, particular companies in other sectors or the platform's whole universe of members. The focus is on making it easier for companies to communicate, he says, not on what information is being shared or with whom they are sharing it.

Twenty companies have been using an early version of the exchange, with requests coming in from  thousands" of others in industries ranging from health care to media, says Mr. Hammell. Microsoft Corp. and Netflix Inc. are among the companies that have recently joined the free exchange.

Safeguarding repositories

As partnerships multiply and intelligence accumulates, some information-security experts warn that consolidation on such a scale may expose information-sharing platforms to greater vulnerabilities.

One common concern: How do you prevent the bad guys from getting into these exchanges?

 If a platform isn't properly vetted, it's child's play for the bad guys to infiltrate," says Hugh Njemanze, chief executive of ThreatStream, another company developing a cybersecurity-sharing tool.

Malicious actors who gain access to these large databases are able to filter through the known threats that companies are sharing and focus their efforts on threats that have yet to be discovered. They can also enter false positives into the repository and mislead other firms, Mr. Njemanze says.

To combat this, ThreatStream applies a rigorous and ongoing inspection process to ensure users are verified.  It's similar to your bank account," Mr. Njemanze says. In the same way that banks continue to monitor a customer's behavior and purchases after an account has been created,  we focus on the entire life cycle of security defense," he says.

Peter Thiel changes course with funding of two Berlin start-ups

PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel has made a rare foray into continental Europe, leading funding rounds in two Berlin start-ups, as Silicon Valley investors continue to be attracted by the region's technology scene.

Mr Thiel's Valar Ventures is leading an $18m funding round in EyeEm, a network for photographers, and a  10m investment in Number26, a banking app.

The move is an unexpected endorsement of Berlin's budding tech scene, as Mr Thiel has previously been scathing about the business environment in the city and continental Europe.

He told the Financial Times in September that he preferred to invest in London because people "just work harder . . . They just work less hard in Berlin." Europe, he said, was a "slacker with low expectations".

Mr Thiel, the first venture capitalist to back Facebook, has rarely invested outside the US. But in recent months he funded two London-based start-ups: TransferWise, a money transfer business, and Deepmind, an artificial intelligence group bought by Google for 400m last year.

EyeEm helps users of mobile phones sort through the photographs they take on the devices. "There is a new generation of photographers solely equipped with mobile phones, who are able to capture incredible images. But one of the biggest problems in photography is how do you find images that really interest you," said co-founder Florian Meissner.

The company will use the funding to extend its photography licensing platform from the US, where the business was launched, to Europe, Asia and South America, and to hire more staff. EyeEm has 13m users and launched a platform to license its community's work for commercial use last month.

Number26 is a mobile banking app which launched in Germany and Austria this year and has about 8,500 customers. It provides users with a MasterCard credit card and an account offered by German partner bank Wirecard. Spending through the app can be mapped according to categories such as "restaurants".

The start-up plans to spend the funding on recruitment and developing new features, such as a fraud detection system that maps where a card is used against geo-location data from the cardholder's phone.

Number26, which is free to users, makes money from a portion of the transaction fee charged to merchants, and earns interest on funds deposited with the partner bank.

Another VC fund co-founded by Mr Thiel, Founders Fund, invested in a Berlin-based social network for scientists, ResearchGate, in 2012.

Europe's technology start-ups have begin to attract US funds, which are large enough to step in to provide "growth" funding rounds of $10m or more - the types of multimillion-dollar cheques commonplace in the US but rare in Europe.

Figures from Go4Venture Advisers, an analyst group, and DFJ Esprit, the venture capital group, show that in 2010, European start-ups received $808m during growth funding rounds, either solely from US investors or through joint investments between US and European venture groups. By 2013, this figure had risen $1.9bn and is projected to rise to $3.5bn by the end of this year.

Chinese shadow banking slows as People's Bank eases

Beijing wants banks to lend more, and so they are. Aggregate financing, the broadest measure of Chinese new credit available, fell short of expectations in March as shadow banking loan growth slid. Total financing was Rmb1.18tn ($190bn) , versus forecasts for the month of Rmb1.5tn, central bank data show.

The advance indicates that lenders are responding to moves by the People's Bank of China. At the start of March it cut interest rates for the second time in three months, and in February it reduced the amount of cash lenders must hold, freeing cash for loans.

The data show new renminbi loan growth from banks last month was Rmb1.18tn, versus estimates of Rmb1.04tn. That accounts for 100 per cent of the aggregate figure, suggesting that shadow banking activity as a percentage of overall activity has contributed little to overall growth.

An analysis of quarterly data shows that shadow banking credit growth accounted for about 15 per cent of new financing in March, down from a month earlier.

"Credit growth has been picking up somewhat in recent months, helped by the PBoC's transition to an easing bias," said Moody'sAnalytics before the release.

"Although credit demand is weak, because of the housing slowdown and overcapacity among property developers, commodity producers and other heavy borrowers, easier borrowing conditions should raise credit growth at the margin. Increased lending should lead to an upturn in the investment and construction cycle in the latter half of the year."

Policy makers must walk a fine line as the economy slows. They seek to boost activity, but are reluctant to take big action that could fuel speculative lending and encourage debt piles to rise.

Last month Fitch warned that shadow bankers were still "a serious concern", noting that total leverage (as a percentage of GDP) had doubled since 2009. "http://www.fastFT.com"

Markets
Fannie, Freddie to Lower Fees for Some Borrowers; Modest changes likely to disappoint affordable-housing advocates

The regulator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will direct the housing-finance firms to slightly cut mortgage fees for riskier borrowers, a decision that falls short of what housing advocates wanted and yet is likely to anger conservative politicians who wanted higher charges.

For most people taking out a loan, the change will be negligible. Some riskier borrowers, who make lower down payments and have lower credit scores, will see slight savings that could translate to hundredths of a percentage point on a mortgage rate an amount that would have little effect on the housing market according to people familiar with the Federal Housing Finance Agency's plan.

To cover the cost of the reductions, Fannie and Freddie will raise fees on some other borrowers, such as those borrowing for an investment property and some of those who have safer borrowing characteristics, with the intent of the changes to be revenue-neutral for Fannie and Freddie, the people said.

The fee changes will put an end to more than a year of speculation as to what the FHFA would do under Melvin Watt, a former Democratic congressman from North Carolina who was sworn in as director in January 2014 and some advocates had hoped would prove more amenable to lessening borrowing costs than his predecessor.

As one of this first moves after taking office, Mr. Watt halted a planned fee increase by the former acting director, Edward DeMarco, a move that Mr. DeMarco had said was necessary to encourage private investors, who require a higher rate of return, to compete for business. That increase would have been the latest in a string of fee increases over the past several years.

After Mr. Watt halted the increase, some had speculated that he could move significantly in the other direction, sharply reducing fees for riskier borrowers in an effort to broaden credit access. However, the FHFA's ultimate direction, in which costs will remain little changed, signals that Mr. Watt has chosen a middle route.

 What we've seen so far from Director Watt is he is an incrementalist," said Julia Gordon, senior director of housing and consumer finance at the left-leaning Center for American Progress, who has pushed for Fannie and Freddie to step back from charging higher prices to riskier borrowers.  It's important that this not be the last word" on fees, she said.

Nevertheless, the changes that are being made which include the termination of a borrowing surcharge imposed by Fannie and Freddie during the crisis are likely to draw the ire of some conservatives on Capitol Hill, who believe that the government is generally encouraging riskier lending practices.

But ultimately for most borrowers and the economy, the changes will have little impact except on the margins, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sAnalytics.  It sounds like they're maintaining the status quo, roughly speaking, and that feels right to me. It's exactly what they should be doing," said Mr. Zandi.

Fannie and Freddie don't make mortgages. They buy them from lenders, wrap them into securities and provide guarantees to make investors whole if the loans default. In exchange for those guarantees, Fannie and Freddie charge lenders fees that are typically passed through to borrowers as a component of mortgage rates.

The government put Fannie and Freddie in a so-called conservatorship in 2008 after the companies suffered significant crisis-era losses. The companies ended up receiving $187.5 billion in aid from the U.S. Treasury, but then became highly profitable, sending the U.S. Treasury more than $228 billion in dividends.

 This decision is a step in the wrong direction, and it increases the liability of American taxpayers who are already on the hook for countless billions of dollars in guaranteed loans," said Rep. Scott Garrett (R., N.J.).  It's just another example of the worst kind of cronyism that punishes qualified borrowers while promoting many of the same policies that played a major role in our most recent financial crisis."

In the past year, some conservatives have criticized Mr. Watt's decision to allow Fannie and Freddie to back loans made to borrowers with down payments of as little as 3%, down from the previous 5% minimum.

Separately, the Federal Housing Administration which insures loans to borrowers who make down payments of as little as 3.5% in January said it would cut fees by 0.5 percentage point for most borrowers.

The FHFA's latest decision to lower fees for some borrowers is  just starting to look like part of a larger trend, that's my real concern. What's next?" said Mark Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the libertarian Cato Institute.  There was not some single moment or event that got us into the last mess, but the accumulation of lots of errors."

In making the decision not to significantly change fees, the FHFA likely weighed the potential risks of Fannie and Freddie needing a taxpayer bailout if their revenues were reduced significantly, said Isaac Boltansky, an analyst with Compass Point Research & Trading LLC in Washington.

 The potential for a draw, even though it would largely be symbolic, had to weigh on the FHFA when they were making their pricing decision," Mr. Boltansky said.

IBM strikes Apple digital health deal; Technology hardware

Doctors, researchers and insurers can gain access to group's Watch health data

IBM has struck partnerships with Apple and the world's biggest makers of medical devices, to put health data from Apple Watches into the hands of doctors and insurers, and to create personalised treatments for hip replacement patients and diabetics.

IBM's push into digital healthcare will allow users monitoring their heart rate, calories expended and cholesterol levels using Apple's HealthKit platform to upload the information from an IBM app to a storage cloud, where it will be accessible to their doctors and insurance companies. Those who opt in to Apple's ResearchKit programmes will also be able to share their data with medical researchers.

The agreement is the latest instance of deeper ties between the healthcare and technology sectors, in anticipation of an explosion in the amount of medical data that people collect using their smartphones or "wearables" such as the Fitbit or Apple Watch.

John Kelly , senior vice-president at IBM, described Apple's HealthKit and ResearchKit platforms as "really unique" but said there was currently "no systematic way of pulling the data together and sending it" to physicians or clinical researchers. "We are . . . providing a huge cloud and a secure database as a backstop," he said.

IBM's partnership with Apple is not exclusive, but the group said few companies could offer the iPhone maker the same storage and security capabilities. "[Apple's] sense is that this is very sensitive data. They feel really good about our reputation for operating secure data centres," said Mr Kelly.

IBM said it would also market a set of analytical tools to physicians, researchers and insurers, enabling them to collate the data from Apple's devices with patients' electronic medical records so they could spot patterns to support clinical trials or help bring down rising healthcare costs.

The tools will be built using Watson , IBM's "cognitive computing system", which can query large sets of statistics and identify patterns.

"The average patient will collect a terabyte of medical data in their lifetime. Our analytics will be able to find the dots, the clues that are eluding us, and find new breakthroughs," said Michael Rhodin, senior vice-president of IBM Watson.

Mr Rhodin said he expected consumers, especially younger "millennials", to opt in to having their data used in clinical research trials because they had a vested interest in contributing to the next big medical advance.

"The generation who buy Apple Watches are interested in data philanthropy," he said. "Many of them have been touched by relatives or parents struck down by disease. Why wouldn't they help researchers figure out what's going on?"

IBM's partnership with Apple was announced alongside a handful of other healthcare tie-ups, including with Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic, the world's largest makers of medical devices such as insulin pumps and replacement knees and hips.

Under-pressure Italy has become a big overweight position for fund manager Stuart Mitchell, in the belief that the market is underestimating an earnings recovery.

Mr Mitchell said 13.4 per cent of his Dublin-based SWMC European fund was now invested in Italy, compared with a weighting of just 3.5 per cent in his benchmark MSCI Europe excluding UK index.

Italy entered recession last year and plateaued in the final quarter of 2014, when economic growth was zero. The MSCI Italy index has underperformed many of its peers, with its gain of 9.4 per cent in the past year lower than that of equivalent Spanish, Irish and broader European indices, according to data from FE Analytics.

Mr Mitchell said investors in Italy were "materially underestimating the earnings recovery under way in the country".

The manager said Italy had embarked on a series of beneficial reforms, while macroeconomic tailwinds behind Europe, such as l ower oil prices and a weaker euro that should encourage exports, would spur the country further.

Among the key stocks the fund holds are Intesa Sanpaolo, the country's largest bank, Telecom Italia and Mediaset, the broadcaster.

Mr Mitchell said a recent meeting with Carlo Messina, Intesa's chief executive, showed it was "clear the economy is beginning to recover rapidly".

"We saw Intesa a few months ago and the company expected no loan growth, but we are now talking about 3 per cent to 6 per cent loan growth," he said.

"Lending margins have increased significantly and are now correctly priced for the risk. Hence even with the collateral requirements, large retail banks such as Intesa Sanpaolo should be able to make very strong returns - similar to those made prior to the crisis."

With respect to Telecom Italia, Mr Mitchell said there had been "rising optimism" among European telecommunications companies generally.

"Regulation is becoming more benign and allowing consolidation from four operators to three in individual markets," he said.

"The new fibre-to-the-kerb technology is also a very important development.

"Current share prices imply groups such as Telecom Italia will disappear in seven years, and the disrupters will continue to gain market share. But we think the market shares and revenues of the large telecoms [operators] will begin to stabilise now the companies can offer a competitive broadband product."

Mediaset shares have rallied strongly this year.

Former security service experts launch cyber start-ups

These days, cyber security entrepreneurs are more likely to be just out of the intelligence services than straight out of college.

Accelerators - organisations that help start-ups with advice and early stage funding - have sprung up specialising in cyber security, focusing not on hoodie-clad twentysomethings with smart ideas, but on experienced professionals with in-depth security knowledge.

Start-ups in this sector attracted $2.3bn of venture capital globally in 2014, up more than a third on the year before, according to data from PrivCo, a research company, as businesses hunt for an alternative to existing technologies to help defend against hackers.

But starting a cyber security company is not easy: instead of the downloads and users desired by consumer technology start-ups, they must win the trust of large corporate and government customers scared of a fast-changing threat.

Kevin Rowney, co-founder of Mod N Labs, a San Francisco Bay Area-based accelerator, is using his expertise as a serial security entrepreneur and former senior manager at Symantec to help others progress from an "idea on a napkin" to contracts, fundraising and building a team. Mod N Labs may take a stake in a company or just advise.

He says: "It is a turbulent time in information technology - a lot is changing fast and many big providers are doing a bad job at adapting. The result is big holes in the threat landscape . . . and a giant opportunity for start-ups in security."

He adds, though, that entrepreneurs need more help to sell new categories of security software to large multinational banks than they do to create apps for takeaway deliveries, for example.

Rick Gordon, managing partner at MACH37, a Virginia-based cyber security accelerator launched 18 months ago, runs a 90-day programme that helps technically focused founders learn the business skills needed to run a company.

"Our first-time entrepreneurs are often a bit older, with deep technical expertise," he says. To have that eureka moment, he says you have to have dealt with security issues and have been in the trenches grappling with vexing problems.

But, he adds, such people may not be as adept at communicating their value to seed investors or institutional venture capitalists, "so that is certainly one skill set we teach".

He points out that entrepreneurs need more than just a "compelling PowerPoint" presentation - they must have evidence of a real need among paying customers.

MACH37 provides a $50,000 investment for an 8 per cent stake in a nascent business, matching it again or going up to $100,000 at the seed round. Mr Gordon says he expects almost all the "exits" to be via mergers or acquisitions by strategic buyers, ranging from long established companies such as Symantec to newer businesses such as FireEye or Palo Alto Networks.

Roy Stephan, chief executive and founder of Pierce Global Threat Intelligence, a security start-up, was in the accelerator's first class. The company has received $1m from angel investors and is raising more.

Despite having been chief technology officer at start-ups in the 1990s, Mr Stephan felt he needed MACH37 to teach him the financial and legal aspects of running a business. He says the accelerator was a "springboard" that helped him develop what was a "very, very early, somewhat nebulous concept". He adds: "It probably would have taken me three years on my own"

In London, Alex van Someren, a venture capitalist, and Jonathan Luff and Grace Cassy, both former diplomats and advisers to prime ministers Cameron and Blair respectively, are about to launch CyLon, which they hope will help entrepreneurs who want to commercialise intellectual property that came out of the intelligence services.

Commissioned by the Cabinet Office to write a report on how to generate revenue from such intellectual property, they concluded that accelerators and incubators would help with both the standard challenges encountered by start-ups and the unique hurdles faced by companies founded by former intelligence officers. So they started an accelerator themselves.

CyLon is forming partnerships with defence companies, government agencies and academia to mentor and sponsor start-ups, many of which have been founded by people with a background in government cyber security.

The first cohort includes a start-up using machine learning to study network activity, one building a highly secure home router, and another specialising in biometrics.

Mr van Someren says that in the past couple of years, those with cyber security skills and experience have found themselves in demand in the commercial world for the first time and need to learn how to sell to businesses as well as governments.

"The experience of the government agencies, both defence and intelligence, has a lot to offer," he says.

"This is somewhat of a novelty. There is plenty of innovation in academia and the commercial domain, but there are relatively few opportunities for significant publicly funded work to cross over into the commercial domain."

After Foreclosures in U.S., Buyers Get Back in the Game

The housing industry is slowly seeing the return of buyers like Rick LeBlanc, who lost his Michigan home to foreclosure during the financial crisis but now qualifies for a mortgage again.

Mr. LeBlanc, a 46-year-old residential-construction manager, fell behind on his $1,400 monthly mortgage payments in 2007 after suffering a 20% pay cut. He had tried to sell the property before moving to Florida for a new job. With no takers, he took on renters. But with $225,000 owed on the Highland, Mich., property, he and his wife eventually lost it to foreclosure in 2008.

In the years since, Mr. LeBlanc says he was turned down for car loans and credit cards. His credit ruined, he learned to live without debt and to pay for his family's expenses with cash.

Then last year, with the foreclosure behind him, he found himself with a near-clean credit slate. The LeBlancs were able to purchase a four-bedroom ranch in St. Augustine Beach, Fla., after borrowing just under $300,000 with a 30-year mortgage carrying a fixed interest rate of about 4.4% from Directors Financial Group, a mortgage lender and broker.

More than five million American families lost their homes to foreclosure from 2007 -- the year when the crisis kicked up -- through the end of last year. Foreclosures and most negative credit events stay on credit reports for up to seven years. For those who lost their homes in the early years of the crisis, credit scores are improving as the black marks drop away, improving their ability to borrow again. This could have widespread implications for the U.S. economy, including a boost in demand for mortgages in the coming years.

Fair Isaac Corp., which developed the widely used FICO credit scores, estimates that there were 910,000 consumers whose credit reports showed they had foreclosure proceedings begin on their homes between October 2007 and October 2008. Of those, some 264,400 had no evidence of the event on their credit reports by October 2014. That number will rise by up to 645,600 by the end of this year, according to FICO.

"The dark shadow of the foreclosure crisis is finally beginning to fade," says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sAnalytics, a unit of Moody's Corp. "That should be a positive for single-family housing and, by extension, for the broader economy."

The end of the seven-year period can be a game changer for borrowers, who can qualify for new home loans and lower interest rates. But not all lenders are welcoming them.

After being hit with mortgage-related penalties, many large banks, such as Bank of America Corp. and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., decided to pull back sharply on mortgage lending and put in place tough credit requirements that excluded all but the safest borrowers. The requirements, such as high credit scores and unblemished credit histories, had the effect of excluding some foreclosed-on borrowers.

Some of those banks, such as Wells Fargo & Co. and SunTrust Banks Inc., have lately said that they would start easing credit access. But meanwhile, smaller lenders, which for the most part hadn't faced the penalties, have taken advantage of big banks' reticence, opening the spigot to qualified but less creditworthy borrowers in an effort to gain market share.

Many foreclosed-on borrowers opt for loans backed by the Federal Housing Administration, which allows such buyers to come back in as little as a year under some circumstances. But some big banks, including J.P. Morgan Chase, have curtailed their FHA lending in the wake of government penalties and lawsuits related to mistakes, such as inflated borrowers' incomes, on FHA loans.

The increase in potential mortgage applicants could give a jolt to the home-mortgage industry. Originations for home purchases declined 13% last year to $638 billion, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association, as higher interest rates and home prices damped affordability.

The declines dragged down bank earnings, which fell for the first time in five years, in part due to reduced revenue from mortgage activity, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

"We have a large number of people who were affected by foreclosure and have been sitting in the penalty box," says Mike Orr, director of the Center for Real Estate Theory and Practice at the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. "This 'boomerang buyer' group is a pretty substantial potential demand."

Mortgage companies have already started to see a shift. Anthony Hsieh, chief executive of loanDepot LLC, one of the biggest FHA lenders, said that one out of four of the company's current FHA borrowers has had either a foreclosure or bankruptcy in the past seven years. Mr. Hsieh said that stringent mortgage requirements -- such as relatively high credit score standards -- had kept foreclosed-upon borrowers on the sidelines. But that is starting to change.

"The difference is they can actually get approved," said Mr. Hsieh, who said that a recent lowering of mortgage fees, among other factors, are gaining traction.

FICO credit scores range from 300 to 850 and most mortgage lenders generally require at least a 620 to 660 score to approve applicants.

Some 12% of the people -- or about 109,000 -- who had foreclosure proceedings tacked onto their credit reports between October 2007 and October 2008 had a FICO credit score of at least 680 by October 2014. That was up from 6.2% in October 2012 and 4.4% in October 2010.

Their recovery occurred as the seven-year period passed and the negative information was removed from their credit reports. The score improvements suggest they kept current with other loans since foreclosing.

The three major credit reporting firms -- Equifax, Experian and TransUnion -- start the clock on the seven-year period from early on in the foreclosure process, from the date the lender reports the borrower as having missed the payment that eventually leads to foreclosure.

Many folks who become eligible for a mortgage still won't qualify due to other problems on their credit report, such as late credit-card payments or delinquent auto loans, which can also drag down scores. And many foreclosed-upon borrowers remain too shellshocked to consider homeownership again. Lenders originated just 2,162 FHA mortgages in the year through September 2014 for buyers with a previous foreclosure, according to the FHA. That was up slightly from 1,808 in the period in 2013.

And some people with improved credit can still have trouble getting a favorable response from lenders. Gerry Duva, a 61-year-old engineer in Oshkosh, Wis., managed to unload his home, on which he owed more than $180,000, in a 2013 short sale for $105,000. He had lost his job and the bank had already started foreclosure proceedings.

Mr. Duva says that he has tried six lenders, but can't find one willing to work with him. One lender, he says, canceled his initial appointment after Mr. Duva's real-estate agent disclosed that he had been through a short sale.

"I'll ask, 'You don't even want to try to explain the special circumstances?' and they say no, they won't do anything with it," says Mr. Duva, who says that his credit score is now up to about 750.

Some analysts are warning that boomerang borrowers could prompt another wave of bad loans down the road because people who have previously gone through a foreclosure are more likely to do so again, says Stu Feldstein, president at SMR Research Corp., a mortgage-research firm in Hackettstown, N.J.

Some previously foreclosed homeowners have been able to obtain new mortgages without waiting seven years. The FHA allows borrowers who went through a full foreclosure and have repaired their credit to become eligible for an FHA-insured home loan just three years after a foreclosure is completed and even in as little as one year in rare circumstances. According to Moody'sAnalytics, roughly 1.2 million previously foreclosed-upon borrowers have passed that three-year mark.

Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- which typically guarantee loans that have higher credit quality and lower costs for borrowers than those backed by the FHA -- will back loans as little as two years after a short sale under certain circumstances such as job loss.

Mr. LeBlanc, who had been stretched thin while supporting two residences -- the home in Michigan and a rental property he moved to in Florida -- says that returning to homeownership is different this time.

He says he used to look at his house as an investment that he could buy and flip without having much skin in the game. On the Michigan property, he at one point owed nearly the entire amount that it was worth. This time around, he says he looks at his home as simply that -- a place where he can stay for a long time.

"I did this for my family," says Mr. LeBlanc. "[I'm] building a legacy and someday my kids will end up with what I own," he says. His mortgage payment is about $2,000 a month.

Catherine and Kerry Foley were among the small number who didn't have to wait seven years to re-enter the housing market. The couple had defaulted on their $238,000 home loan in 2010 after Mr. Foley lost his job as a conference-services director. After the foreclosure, the Foleys hopped from one small apartment to another, ending up in a high-crime neighborhood where Ms. Foley says she was afraid to go out at night. While the experience was harrowing, the scrimping strategy helped them save money and avoid taking on new debt, which boosted their credit score to nearly 700 in just two years.

In February, the couple purchased a house in the Atlanta area for $175,000 with a 30-year, 4.1% fixed-rate FHA-backed mortgage from Fairway Independent Mortgage Corp., a lender based in Madison, Wis. The Foley's new house in Atlanta is smaller than their previous home and less lavish. Although Ms. Foley says she misses the chandeliers and wood floors of their old place, The couple doesn't plan to do any major renovations this time around. Rather, becoming homeowners again has been both a psychological balm and an important step toward stabilizing their lives.

"I don't know that anybody is going to be financially secure in this present economy, but I feel as secure as I can be. I've learned to have a backup plan," she says.

Bass's Tack: Dispute Patent, Short the Stock

A well-known hedge-fund manager is taking a novel approach to making money: filing and publicizing patent challenges against pharmaceutical companies while also betting against their shares.

Kyle Bass, head of Hayman Capital Management LP -- which made a fortune wagering on the housing bust -- is targeting patents that he says have little value other than to drive up prescription drug prices. His new fund bets against companies whose patents it believes are spurious, and invests in those that would profit if the patents are invalidated, said people familiar with the matter.

His latest challenge seeks to employ a relatively new and inexpensive petition process to invalidate a Jazz Pharmaceuticals PLC patent for Xyrem, a narcolepsy drug with sales of $779 million last year, two-thirds of Jazz's 2014 revenues.

Mr. Bass created the Coalition for Affordable Drugs, an organization that is the lead petitioner in several patent challenges filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. He says he plans to pursue the cases regardless of share price moves. "We will not settle," he said in an interview.

Jazz Pharmaceuticals, of Dublin, Ireland, didn't respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.

Mr. Bass previously challenged patents held by Acorda Therapeutics Inc., of Ardsley, N.Y., and Shire PLC, of Dublin. Acorda and Shire said they would defend the patents, and said the patents targeted represent a portion of the intellectual property protecting their drugs.

Mr. Bass, 45 years old, insists his challenges will help reduce drug prices, which he says are kept artificially high because of patents. In the U.S., drugs generally enjoy a 20-year period of market exclusivity from the date of patent filing before generics can be sold at steep discounts.

The pharmaceutical industry contends Mr. Bass is exploiting a process designed to aid patent holders in defending themselves, twisting it to provoke fear among his target's investors, and then gain from the fallout that may result.

"There's nothing in this man's history to suggest he has any interest in lowering health-care costs," said James C. Greenwood, chief executive of the trade group Biotechnology Industry Organization.

Mr. Bass's strategy taps an administrative process known as Inter Partes Review, or IPR, that allows petitions to strike down patents to be heard by a patent office panel. The process was created by Congress in 2011 to help companies fight so-called patent trolls, nonoperating companies that extract cash settlements from companies they accuse of patent infringement. The panel is a cheaper and faster option than trials in federal courts.

IPR challenges are evaluated by a panel of three administrative patent judges who use a broader set of criteria than the courts when deciding whether patents should be invalidated, making it much easier to strike down patents, experts said. Some 77% of patents evaluated through the IPR process have been invalidated or disclaimed by their owners, according to an analysis published last year in the University of Chicago Law Review.

Acorda Chief Executive Ron Cohen said the petition process was never intended to be used as Mr. Bass is employing it. Congress has inadvertently created a "mirror image problem of 'reverse patent trolls'" that use the system to invalidate operating companies' patents, he said.

Mr. Bass has teamed up with intellectual-property consultant Erich Spangenberg, who opponents call a patent troll because of his frequent patent suits.

Mr. Spangenberg, 54 years old, made his name and fortune by acquiring technology patents and using them to sue such firms as Apple Inc. and Exxon Mobil Corp. for infringement.

He also has worked as an adviser to other patent holders, assembling dossiers on alleged infringement in exchange for collecting a percentage of the holders' future winnings, a person familiar with the matter said.

One of Mr. Spangenberg's firms, nXn Partners LLC, is a paid consultant to Mr. Bass's more than $2 billion Hayman Capital, according to filings with the patent office. Both men are named as "real parties of interest" in the petitions.

Messrs. Bass and Spangenberg, both based in Dallas, met last year through mutual friends, according to people familiar with the matter. Mr. Spangenberg was looking for a way to capitalize on what he perceived as the vulnerability of certain pharmaceutical patents through the IPR petition process, one of these people said. Two weeks later, the men agreed to work together.

Under their arrangement, Mr. Spangenberg sizes up potential patent targets, using a predictive analytics software program he acquired several years ago, that helps determine the strength of certain patents.

"A small minority of drug companies are abusing the patent system to sustain invalid patents," Mr. Spangenberg said in a prepared statement.

Months after their meeting, Mr. Bass was pitching wealthy individuals and institutions to invest in a dedicated fund that would bet against, or short, the shares of companies whose patents Mr. Bass believed to be specious, and wager on rivals that could benefit. In particular, Mr. Bass was interested in older patents which he believed to be more vulnerable.

The fund requires a minimum $1 million investment, and Mr. Bass's firm will keep 20% of all profits earned, according to a person familiar with the matter. The trades also will be part of Hayman Capital's main fund.

Mr. Bass is no stranger to controversial gambles. He was one of the handful of hedge-fund managers to spot trouble in the subprime mortgage markets before the finance crisis, earning hundreds of millions of dollars in trading profit, investor documents show. Mr. Bass is willing to press this latest effort in patents for three years -- longer even than his bet against subprime, a person familiar with his plans said.

More recently, his firm has struggled. He predicted long-term insolvency for Japan amid demographic pressures -- an outcome that hasn't come to pass. And he forecast a dramatic recovery for the largest U.S. auto maker General Motors Co., but its share price has lagged behind his targets. Last year, Hayman Capital's main fund posted a small loss, a person familiar with the matter said.

The patent office hasn't yet decided whether it will review the Coalition for Affordable Drugs' petitions, and it is unclear whether the challenges will succeed. But says Jacob S. Sherkow, an associate professor at New York Law School who studies pharmaceutical patents, "It's hard to be more upbeat than a lot of CEOs are about the strength of their intellectual property."

If Mr. Bass is right about their reliance on weak patents, CEOs ought to "be very worried," Mr. Sherkow adds.

Chinese Insurers Buy First Piece of U.S.

China's two largest insurance companies are making their first investment in U.S. commercial real estate, buying a majority stake in a $500 million project in Boston, according to a person briefed on the transaction.

The investment by China Life Insurance Group Co. and Ping An Insurance Co., along with New York developer Tishman Speyer Properties, marks the latest sign that Chinese insurance companies are becoming a force in global real-estate investment.

The Boston development includes a 13-story office building and a nine-story condominium tower with 100 units. The project in the city's Seaport District will take up most of Pier 4, which was known for Anthony's Pier 4, a popular restaurant that closed two years ago amid plans for redeveloping the site.

Rob Speyer, co-chief executive of Tishman Speyer, confirmed China Life and Ping An's participation in the deal, but declined to disclose the size of their stakes. A person briefed on the deal said each insurer was taking a one-third stake, while the other third would be owned by a Tishman Speyer fund that will be the managing partner of the venture. China Life and Ping An didn't respond to requests for comment.

Until 2012, the Chinese government prohibited China's insurance companies from buying foreign property. Now they are joining other Chinese investors in becoming increasingly active in U.S. and European markets. Both China Life and Ping An have acquired property in London, but they haven't bought in the U.S. before.

So far in 2015, Chinese insurance companies have purchased $2.5 billion in foreign property, more than they have purchased in all previous years combined, according to Real Capital Analytics. Overall, Chinese investors in 2014 bought $13.6 billion in foreign real estate, down slightly from $15.3 billion in 2013 but still well above the $5.4 billion they bought in 2012, Real Capital said.

Beijing has been encouraging Chinese companies to venture abroad and has loosened foreign-exchange controls and administrative procedures in recent years. The government in 2012 capped insurers' real-estate assets at 15% of their total assets. In 2014, the insurance companies' regulator, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, increased that threshold to 30%. The moves allowed insurers to invest in mature commercial and office building properties in prime locations abroad.

The companies have enormous buying power. China Life Insurance Co. is the country's largest insurer by premiums, while Ping An Insurance Group ranks second. Overall, Chinese insurers' total assets reached 10.55 trillion yuan ($1.7 trillion) as of the end of February, up 70% from the same month three years ago.

For Tishman Speyer, the Boston transaction shows that its China strategy is paying off. The firm entered the China market as a developer there, but lately also has been using the contacts it has made to team up with Chinese investors in U.S. deals. Tishman Speyer in 2012 sold a building it developed in Chengdu to Ping An for an undisclosed amount. "We've made relationships in China both with investors and with tenants that have paid dividends in other parts of the world," Mr. Speyer said.

Tishman Speyer owns about three million square feet of office space in Boston's financial district. Run by Mr. Speyer and his father, Jerry Speyer, Tishman's signature assets include Rockefeller Center and the Chrysler Building in New York, Sao Paulo's Torre Norte and OpernTurm in Frankfurt.

The Pier 4 project in Boston is its first development in the Seaport area. The firm acquired the site last year and is planning to complete the office portion of the project in the second half of 2017 and the condo tower in the first quarter of 2018.

European private equity firm joins forces with Canadian pension fund

The European private equity group Permira has joined forces with Canada's largest pension fund to acquire Informatica, the US data software and services company, in a $5.3bn deal that marks the largest leveraged buyout this year.

The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Permira will pay $48.75 a share in cash to take Informatica private, valuing it at $5.3bn, the company said yesterday.

Permira and CPPIB's offer would be a 6.5 per cent premium to the stock's closing price on Monday.

The shares have risen a fifth year-to-date.

The takeover would fit in with the strategy of Elliott Management, which has built a nearly 10 per cent stake in Informatica, a maker of "middleware" used by businesses to integrate their data, in recent months.

Elliott has often pushed software companies to sell themselves to private equity after taking a stake in them, causing irritation on corporate boards across Silicon Valley.

Past targets for the hedge fund's technology company activism over the past two years include Riverbed Technology and BMC, both of which eventually found private equity owners.

Buyout firms, meanwhile, have spied an opportunity in taking over mature middleware providers whose products provide them with a steady cash flow, but are unloved by public stock markets.

Informatica, which reported $1bn in sales last year, has sought to expand by selling integration for newer markets including big data, cloud-computing and data security.

"We are very excited about the company's ongoing transition to cloud and subscription-based services, as well as its continued pursuit of four separate billion-dollar market opportunities," said Brian Ruder, a partner at Permira.

The company reported $211m in earnings before tax, interest payments, depreciation and amortisation in 2014.

The deal's size will also raise hopes that classic leveraged buyouts could make a comeback after a lacklustre start to the year.

Less than $30bn in private equity takeovers were announced in the first quarter, the lowest level since early 2009. Many firms have been focused on exiting previous investments at a time when stock market valuations have been high.

New forms of relatively debt-free private equity investment, such as 3G Capital's merger of Heinz with Kraft last month, have also emerged while leveraged mega-buyouts typical before the financial crisis have receded.

The year's previous largest buyout was Life Time Fitness, a gym chain acquired last month by Leonard Green and TPG for just over $4bn.

Informatica would be Permira's largest investment to date within its fifth buyout fund, which it finished raising in June last year. More than a third of the firm's investments since 1997 have been in technology companies.

WSJ.D Technology: Data Firm Informatica Backs $5.3 Billion Buyout

Data-software company Informatica Corp. agreed to be bought by Permira Advisers LLC and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board for $5.3 billion, in the largest leveraged buyout so far this year.

The two private-equity investors will pay $48.75 a share for the Redwood City, Calif., company, according to a statement Tuesday confirming an earlier report in The Wall Street Journal. The per-share price is about 6% above the company's closing price Monday of $45.83.

Shares of Informatica had risen in anticipation of a possible deal as private-equity groups vied in an auction of the company. The Journal reported in January that the company was working with investment bankers and had made contact with potential buyers.

Informatica helps companies organize and analyze broad swaths of information, tapping the growing demand for help with managing what is known as big data. The company had revenue of around $1 billion in 2014, up about 11%.

The Informatica deal, set to be completed in the second or third quarter, is the largest private-equity buyout struck globally so far this year, eclipsing one for gym operator Life Time Fitness Inc. That deal, valued at more than $2.8 billion, was signed in March.

Private-equity firms have been investing at a relatively sluggish pace so far in 2015, with the lowest number of buyouts agreed to in a comparable period since 2010 as deal activity has been crimped by factors including a regulatory clampdown on leverage levels. There have been 477 deals worth $46.4 billion, according to Dealogic.

The Informatica deal is a big win for Elliott Management Corp., which in January revealed that it owned about 8% of the company, having accumulated stock at an average price of $36.99 a share.

The hedge fund said then that it saw the company as "significantly undervalued" and that it had initiated talks with Informatica's management and board regarding "steps to maximize shareholder value." Elliott said in February that it had lifted its stake to 9.4%, after exercising options.

It isn't clear if Elliott will roll its equity into the buyout, something the firm has done previously, including as part of BMC Software Inc.'s $6.9 billion sale to a private-equity group in 2013.

Software companies have been targeted in a string of private-equity buyouts in recent months, in part because of their high cash flow. In December, Thoma Bravo LLC completed its acquisition of Compuware Corp. for about $2.5 billion and separately teamed up with an arm of the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan in an agreement to buy Riverbed Technology Inc. for about $3.6 billion. Compuware and Riverbed were both put in play following separate takeover bids for each company by Elliott.

Chinese Defaults

Head Into Cloud

China's experiment with credit risk just went live.

Until now, defaults in China's domestic bond market have been virtually unheard of. But on Tuesday, struggling restaurateur-turned-technology startup Cloud Live Technology Group became the first company to miss a principal payment.

Last year, Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy missed interest payments, making it technically the first domestic default. But its bondholders were eventually paid the missing interest in a convoluted, government-arranged bailout.

Now Cloud Live says it doesn't have the funds to repay 400 million yuan ($65.2 million) in debt it raised three years ago. It is possible that bondholders could be made whole down the line in another Chaori-style deal. But if not, Cloud Live will be China's first outright bond default.

That would be welcome. Shielding bondholders from default risk distorts capital allocation by freeing investors from having to gauge creditworthiness. If China is to achieve its stated goal of giving the market the primary role in allocating resources, credit markets must become acquainted with the notion of risk.

If there was ever a time to stand by and allow a default, Cloud Live would be it. Formerly known as Beijing Xiangeqing Group, the company was a spicy Hunan-style restaurant chain popular with government officials. But its business turned south due to new rules discouraging lavish meals by public servants.

The company then changed its name to Cloud Live, announced plans to expand into big data and cloud computing, and sold its restaurants. Its former chairman, Meng Kai, meanwhile, has been under investigation since December. In a statement with the Shenzhen Stock Exchange on Tuesday, Cloud Live said Mr. Meng left China for a holiday in October and hasn't returned.

Given the novelty of default events in China, markets may respond in hard-to-predict ways. Cloud Live's Shenzhen-listed shares, for instance, soared nearly 10% on Tuesday before being halted ahead of the default announcement.

Cloud Live's case could be unique enough that the broader bond market escapes mostly unscathed. But tougher tests lie ahead. Beijing is currently conducting an audit of all debt linked to local governments, in which some debt raised by off-balance-sheet platforms known as local government financing vehicles is to be clearly classified as not backed by state guarantees.

If and when these government-affiliated borrowers start defaulting, China's credit markets will get a real jolt.

High Speed for Tesla Motors

Doesn't Tell the Whole Story

Tesla Motors delivered more cars than expected in the first quarter. Investors shouldn't be so quick to simply raise their expectations.

Tesla announced Friday that it delivered more than 10,000 vehicles in the first quarter, up 55% year over year and higher than the guidance it gave in February. The stock jumped 6.3% Monday.

Growth is good news, but just one piece of the puzzle. For starters, as the company points out in a news release, it is difficult to assess the quarter's results without more information on margins, product mix and currency movements. This won't be available until quarterly results are announced next month.

Analysts expect Tesla to report $943 million in automotive revenue, which would be up 52% from a year before but down slightly from the fourth quarter.

Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has forecast 55,000 deliveries this year, so the next three quarters will have to see a significant improvement to meet this target. The coming launch of the new Model X SUV might help, but rollouts of previous models have been slow. For example, Tesla began delivering its Model S sedan in June of 2012 but had delivered only 2,650 cars by the end of that year.

Meanwhile, there is a troubling expansion in inventory. Automotive revenue increased last year by about 60%, to $3.2 billion, but total inventory nearly tripled to $953.7 million. More concerning, the percentage of inventory labeled "finished goods" doubled to 42% over the period. This suggests demand might be softer than anticipated.

In its annual filing, Tesla blamed the inventory buildup, in part, on cars whose delivery slipped from the fourth quarter to the current year, and it has acknowledged that it overestimated customer demand in China.

There are concerns beyond the immediate delivery targets. Mr. Musk has forecast 500,000 deliveries by 2020 as well as Tesla finally turning a profit under generally accepted accounting principles. Realizing such ambitions will cost money. Tesla projects capital expenditure of $1.5 billion this year. It started 2015 with just $1.9 billion in cash on its balance sheet. Analysts expect a free cash outflow of another $761 million this year.

So Tesla will likely need to tap the capital markets to finance its operating needs. Given the buoyant state of the bond market and a high stock price, this doesn't present an immediate worry.

For the same reasons, though, investors supplying that capital should be looking for more convincing signs of operational success at the company.

India Rate Setters Need a Little Patience

Raghuram Rajan's Reserve Bank of India is going back to the more patient aspects of monetary policy. Given the excruciating time it takes for India's central-bank moves to filter, investors will have to learn to be patient, too.

India's central-bank chief kept interest rates steady Tuesday. After rate cuts in January and March, Mr. Rajan is partly turning cautious because he wants to observe prices carefully.

And for good reason: Inflation has begun rising again. Though February's 5.4% retail inflation is still below the 6% target the RBI wants to hit by next January, Mr. Rajan himself predicts this number will increase to 5.8% by the year's end.

It may not take much to put the RBI in breach of its target.

Food, as always, is the wild card, making up nearly half of the consumer-price basket. Heavy rains lately hurt 17% of the area where winter crops are cultivated, which could result in shortages and price spikes. Another factor is rural wages. Subdued for some time, they have suddenly risen faster in December and January, Nomura notes, a possible sign of rising demand pressures as the economy recovers.

Then there's the issue that Mr. Rajan's rate cuts are something like a hard-hit golf shot, where a long walk is required until you see exactly where the ball lies. The RBI chief says he will hold rates until he sees his changes to short-term interest rates transmitting into the real economy.

Yet this takes time. While there are one-off factors at play, the basic problem is that economies with immature bond markets such as India lack a functioning yield curve.

The International Monetary Fund looked at data from 2002 to 2014 and found that it typically takes 23 months for the RBI's rate moves to filter to bank deposit rates and 32 months to lending rates. Banks won't easily grant Mr. Rajan his wish.

For instance, in recent months, some lenders have taken advantage of the RBI's easy-money signal to cut deposit rates, but not lending rates. This means the likes of Axis Bank and ICICI Bank are enjoying fatter margins instead of stimulating business activity.

All this complicates the simple low-inflation premise under which investors profited by moving into Indian bonds.

The spread between India's 10-year sovereign bond and comparable U.S. Treasurys narrowed by 0.9 percentage point between August and early March, before widening somewhat recently.

Mr. Rajan may still have room to ease money further this year. But with investors having to wait to see the effects of India's rains, and that of previous rate cuts, the Indian bond trade doesn't look so easy anymore.

Investing In Funds & ETFs: A Quarterly Analysis --- Portfolio Strategy: The Dark Magic of Month-End Trades --- A study explains the phenomenon, and suggests a recipe to profit

Investors have long known that mutual funds, pension funds and hedge funds roil the markets when they buy and sell en masse due to their size. But a new academic paper shines light on one surprising way these institutions distort the stock market.

In the study "Dash for Cash: Month-End Liquidity Needs and the Predictability of Stock Returns," three Finnish researchers show that through their penchant to sell stocks near the end of the month and buy them at the beginning of the month, funds inadvertently create a trough in prices that loses a significant sum for their account holders -- and that savvy investors can exploit.

Published on the Social Science Research Network in November and revised in March, the working paper finds "strong return reversals in the U.S. value-weighted stock market index around the last monthly settlement day," three days before the end of the month, as well as similar effects overseas.

The trends are stronger in countries with a higher amount of mutual-fund ownership, and, in the U.S., have strengthened as investors have poured money into mutual funds. The researchers -- Kalle Rinne, a postdoctoral fellow at the Luxembourg School of Finance; Matti Suominen, a professor of finance at Aalto University in Aalto, Finland; and Lauri Vaittinen, chief securities officer at Etera Mutual Pension Insurance Co. in Helsinki -- point to institutional investors as the culprits, noting that the effects are more pronounced for stocks that funds hold widely.

"It was striking for us to notice that these turn-of-the-month patterns, which have been known, have intensified over time," said Mr. Suominen.

The mechanics are calendar-driven, the paper shows.

Institutions must make cash distributions regularly to pension beneficiaries, with the end of the month being a popular date for payments. During the last eight days of the month, and most heavily during the last three, institutions sell shares to generate cash, driving down prices.

Once beneficiaries receive their cash, they often reinvest it in mutual funds.

At the same time, many retirement-plan participants get paychecks at the end of the month and see their plan contributions deducted. That cash goes into retirement funds. These institutions begin buying, pushing prices back up. "The best time to sell is on the third or fourth of the month," Mr. Vaittinen says.

Because the pattern is so ingrained, investors can profit with this recipe: Buy shares three days before the end of the month and sell them three days into the new month, he says.

It's a different story, however, for fund shareholders. The fact that funds are selling holdings into the dip and buying them during the rise can act as a drag on fund performance.

"We're now working on identifying how much the pensioners are losing historically on this type of trading," says Mr. Suominen. Their conservative estimate is $2 billion a year, "but we think it's more," he says.

Jim O'Donnell, chief investment officer of Forward Management, an asset-management firm in San Francisco that runs the $6 billion Forward Funds, is skeptical that funds are to blame for the phenomenon the researchers found.

"For them to be correct in this, mutual-fund turnover would have to be multiples of what it is, he says.

He believes there are other explanations and points to 401(k) plans as one likely culprit: "Many mutual funds have faucets of money that fill their buckets up based on 401(k) contributions that come in along with the paycheck cycle." That cash is "mechanically invested" once it arrives, he says.

The paper also gives short shrift to hedge-fund trading, he says. Although hedge funds represent only $2.5 billion of the $18 trillion U.S. stock market, their higher asset turnover lets them wield a $10 trillion influence on markets, he says.

And the researchers don't finger individuals following the momentum of the bigger players' movements and exacerbating them, Mr. O'Donnell says. "There's a lot of band-wagoning among DIY [do-it-yourself] investors who don't want to pay a management fee," he says.

The patterns described in the paper aren't a secret among fund managers, and some try to time fund purchases and sales to take advantage of it, including Source Morgan Stanley Europe MEMO Plus UCITS ETF.

Other funds incorporate it into a larger strategy. "In our asset-allocation funds, we consciously play defense against this by not conducting tactical rebalances around month-end," says Sharon Hill, senior vice president and head of equity quantitative research and analytics at Delaware Investments in Philadelphia, which manages $185 billion.

Some investors say a trading strategy designed around this idea could lose out on gains.

"In the case of month-end return patterns, had you invested in the S&P 500 only on those six days since the market's bottom in March 2009, you would have missed out on two-thirds of the subsequent rally," says David Hall, a co-portfolio manager at TFS Capital in West Chester, Pa., which manages $924 million. "And over the last two years, you would have missed 100% of it."

Real Estate
Boston Project Draws Chinese Insurance Firms  First U.S. Investments; Tishman Speyer will join in $500 million Pier 4 redevelopment

China's two largest insurance companies are making their first investment in U.S. commercial real estate, buying a majority stake in a $500 million project in Boston, according to a person briefed on the transaction.

The investment by China Life Insurance Group Co. and Ping An Insurance Co., along with New York developer Tishman Speyer Properties, marks the latest sign that Chinese insurance companies are becoming a force in global real-estate investment.

The Boston development includes a 13-story office building and a nine-story condominium tower with 100 units. The project in the city's popular Seaport District will take up most of Pier 4, which was known for Anthony's Pier 4, a popular restaurant that was closed two years ago as plans for redeveloping the site progressed.

Rob Speyer, co-chief executive of Tishman Speyer, confirmed China Life and Ping An's participation in the deal, but declined to disclose the size of their stakes. A person briefed on the deal said each insurer was taking a one-third stake, while the other third would be owned by a Tishman Speyer fund that will be the managing partner of the venture. China Life and Ping An didn't respond to requests for comment.

Until 2012, the Chinese government prohibited China's insurance companies from buying foreign property. Now they are joining other Chinese investors in becoming increasingly active in U.S. and European markets. Both China Life and Ping An have acquired property in London, but they haven't bought in the U.S. before.

So far in 2015, Chinese insurance companies have purchased $2.5 billion in foreign property, more than they have purchased in all previous years combined, according to Real Capital Analytics. Overall, Chinese investors in 2014 bought $13.6 billion in foreign real estate, down slightly from $15.3 billion in 2013 but still well above the $5.4 billion they bought in 2012, Real Capital said.

Beijing has been encouraging Chinese companies to venture abroad and has loosened foreign-exchange controls and administrative procedures in recent years. The government in 2012 capped insurers' real-estate assets at 15% of their total assets. In 2014, the insurance companies' regulator, the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, increased that threshold to 30%. The moves allowed insurers to invest in mature commercial and office building properties in prime locations abroad.

The companies have enormous buying power. China Life Insurance Co. is the country's largest insurer by premiums, while Ping An Insurance Group ranks second. Overall, Chinese insurers' total assets reached 10.55 trillion yuan ($1.7 trillion) as of the end of February, up 70% from the same month three years ago.

For Tishman Speyer, the Boston transaction shows that its China strategy is paying off. The firm entered the China market as a developer there, but lately also has been using the contacts it has made to partner with Chinese investors in U.S. deals. Tishman Speyer in 2012 sold a building it developed in Chengdu to Ping An for an undisclosed amount.

 We've made relationships in China both with investors and with tenants that have paid dividends in other parts of the world," Mr. Speyer said.

Tishman Speyer, one of the top developers in the U.S., owns about 3 million square feet of office space in Boston's financial district. Run by Mr. Speyer and his father, Jerry Speyer, Tishman's signature assets include Rockefeller Center and the Chrysler Building in New York, So Paulo's Torre Norte and OpernTurm in Frankfurt.

The Pier 4 project in Boston is its first development in the Seaport area. The firm acquired the site last year and is planning to complete the office portion of the project in the second half of 2017 and the condo tower in the first quarter of 2018.

Boston's Seaport district was long a dream of city planners who recognized the development potential of the waterfront area that was mostly populated by parking lots and aging industrial property. Led by the Fan Pier development, a 21-acre mixed use development that launched about 10 years ago, the district has succeeded in attracting a critical mass of business, residential and retail uses.

The new project is moving forward without any preleasing of the office space, increasing the risk to Tishman Speyer and its Chinese partners. But Mr. Speyer said he is confident there will be strong demand for the office space as well as the condos.

 We've seen a significant uptick in demand from a wide range of companies over the last two years," he said.  There's also substantial demand that wants new product and there's very little new product under development in Boston."

Tishman Speyer has developed about 4 million square feet of space in China; it has about 20 million square feet in the development pipeline there. The firm is the only U.S. company to raise yuan-denominated funds in China for projects in that country. It has raised two, for a total of $700 million.

Tishman Speyer also has raised a $50 million fund from wealthy Chinese individuals for investment in New York, Washington and Boston. The firm is developing a 655-unit condominium project in San Francisco, with China Vanke Co., one of China's largest property developers by market capitalization.

Mr. Speyer, who has been playing a leading role at the firm in executing its China strategy, said he hopes to be doing more projects with Chinese partners.

 We have an aligned view of where to invest and what to invest in," he said.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Fund management faces a battle between man and machine; VIEWPOINT

What do Formula 1 and fund management have in common? Both are judged on performance, they are highly competitive and require real-time information to make optimum decisions. But for fund managers seeking to be on the front foot, the parallel becomes much more interesting.

Roll back the clock to the 1960s when F1 was growing in popularity. To gain a competitive advantage, team engineers would experiment and optimise a car's performance based on their visual observations during each race.

Today, significant advancements in technology mean cars are equipped with hundreds of sensors, allowing teams to analyse each second of a race in real time. Consider McLaren. Over the course of a typical Grand Prix weekend the team will capture more than a billion data points from more than 200 sensors in each car.

By combining technology and data analytics, engineers and strategists crunch this information. This enables them to create models to predict a car's performance accurately under different conditions. If conditions change, they are able to draw on data from previous races to make real-time adjustments and improve their chances of winning. Nothing is left to chance.

Data analytics, the use of technology and F1 have become intrinsically linked over the years, taking the sport to a new level of sophistication.

There is certainly a question as to what fund management could learn from F1 to improve investment decisions and fund performance. Worryingly, our observations suggest that, compared with other financial services sectors, fund managers are behind the curve when it comes to making decisions using data analytics.

Speed, as well as the ability to process market data (unstructured big data ) and to manage geopolitical risk, define winners and losers in the fund management industry. As we have seen from recent events, such as the Ukrainian and Syrian conflicts, oil-price and foreign-exchange swings, risks are growing in variety, volume and velocity.

Furthermore, with increasing interest in quant and smart beta, a battle could emerge between man and machine . Traditional active management could become obsolete as managers who embrace technology, and the power of F1-style data analytics, overtake.

The application of data analytics and technology is not limited to investment decision making, but is also relevant in understanding the client better. Demographics are changing. People are living longer and taking greater responsibility for their own retirement. Younger generations will save more as they see their parents run out of money in retirement. We also expect a boost of new money from the growing middle classes in China, Mexico, India, Nigeria and other developing economies over the next 15 years.

The clients of the future will be fundamentally different in terms of their needs and expectations. They will demand more personalised information, education and advice that will require asset managers to address their technology capabilities radically.

Asset managers still have a long way to go. Although technology is attracting a significant amount of investment, it is not being channelled into the right areas. The focus has been on unpicking and fixing legacy systems while trying to meet stringent compliance requirements. There is too little focus on building architecture to meet the business needs of tomorrow.

Successful managers will be those who hire data scientists and invest in advanced data analytics. Those who ignore this technology will be left on the starting grid.

The battle for the soul of Alliance Trust hots up; COMMENT

Nothing strengthens authority so much as silence," wrote Charles de Gaulle in his 1932 book Le Fil de l'pe (The Edge of the Sword).

After distinguishing himself in the first world war, Mr de Gaulle wrote extensively on how France should prepare for and conduct warfare should Germany eventually rearm, but his warnings went unheeded.

When France fell to the Axis powers in 1940, silence took on new meaning for the French Resistance who later came to draw inspiration from le Gnral's leadership.

The fund industry took a leaf out of Mr de Gaulle's book as the world succumbed to financial crisis seven years ago, maintaining an authoritative silence as the banking sector was hauled over the coals.

But a recession-weary public has turned on the well-paid managers of active funds, where a fund manager aims to outperform the wider stock market. In the face of the rise of ultra-cheap passive fund investing, the industry is facing an existential threat.

Once the fund industry's silence engendered authority, but now it smacks of siege mentality amid rising calls for change from vocal critics, politicians and regulators.

The focus is on funds that consistently underperform, making underwhelming bets against the market while taking active management fees and paying out healthy fund manager bonuses.

Alliance Trust, the 127-year old 2.8bn London-listed investment trust has, according to its own March 31 fact sheet, lagged behind rival funds in net asset value terms over one, three and five years.

The trust's shares have consistently traded at a wide discount to the value of its investment portfolio for at least a decade, reflecting poor demand for the shares. Shares of close rival Scottish Mortgage have returned more than double Alliance's 68 per cent return in the past five years, according to FE Analytics, the data provider.

Last week the trust's corporate broker, JPMorgan Cazenove, admitted performance was "lacklustre" and suggested it could conduct an internal review, in a blow for Katherine Garrett-Cox (above), the trust's chief executive and lead investment manager.

Trading volumes in the trust's shares are typically low, but since March 2011 the UK arm of a US hedge fund, Elliott Advisors, has been building a position in a move that has eased the discount issue slightly. It now holds a 12 per cent stake.

After closed talks proved fruitless, that investor has now gone activist, requisitioning the trust's board to bring resolutions at its forthcoming annual meeting to appoint three new independent non-executive directors.

Alliance Trust, however, has refused to acknowledge its performance issues and pulled out all the stops, launching a smear campaign against Elliott. It features a prominent link on its website that warns against the resolutions in bold letters.

The trust's contention is that Spencer Stuart, the recruitment firm that found the three nominees, was instructed by Elliott and so therefore the nominees are not independent.

But under UK regulation they would be required to be independent of influence from individual shareholders. There is no evidence that they would breach these rules.

To my mind it does not matter who nominated these three. What matters is who they are and whether Alliance Trust could benefit.

The nominees are Peter Chambers, a former chief executive officer of Legal & General Investment Management; Anthony Brooke, who spent nearly 30 years working across the City; and Rory Macnamara, an accountant who is already chairman of another trust.

Alliance claims the nominees are the "thin end of the wedge", saying Elliot wants to disrupt the trust to its own ends.

But how can it do that by appointing three fresh pairs of eyes, who would be required to be independent, to a board that would have 10 people on it? They would not even have a majority vote to enact change.

So why does Alliance Trust appear to be scaremongering?

Perhaps it worries it might one day have to acquiesce to calls to outsource management to better investment managers elsewhere. This would not bode well for Ms Garrett-Cox - she has earned more than 6m in the past five years.

It did not help the trust's case that last weekend a former non-executive director at Alliance - one of many who have come and gone in recent years - published an open letter criticising it and backing the resolutions.

Underperforming managers refusing to facilitate dissent, or accept their own shortcomings, are contrary to public sentiment.

That is why my magazine, Investment Adviser, is encouraging investors to vote "yes" to resolutions 14, 15 and 16 at the Alliance Trust annual meeting on April 29.

A New Inside Track to Hot Startups

Silicon Valley insiders are taking advantage of soaring values for technology startups by creating a potentially lucrative side business.

Venture-capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz and FirstMark Capital, along with a cast of prominent entrepreneurs and executives, have each raised tens of millions of dollars for impromptu funds that take a direct stake in a single startup.

These funds, which often come together in a matter of days, give institutional investors, friends and business associates exclusive access to highflying companies. The funds also let the venture capitalists invest far more money in a company than they otherwise could. In many cases, the funds are blessed by the startups, which see them as a way to raise big sums quickly.

While the investments are usually billed as exclusive, can't-miss opportunities, the funds aren't without risk. Their investors -- which include fund of funds, family offices and pension funds -- are usually offered limited financial information about the companies. They are also charged a performance fee that is typically about 20% of any investment profits on top of already rich prices.

When image-bookmarking site Pinterest Inc. set out to raise more than $500 million in February, one of its earliest investors, FirstMark Capital, wanted to take part in the round.

But the venture firm couldn't invest a big enough sum from its $225 million fund to keep pace with Pinterest's steep proposed valuation of $11 billion, more than double the price from May. Venture firms typically spread out their bets and avoid allocating too much capital in one company.

So Rick Heitzmann, FirstMark's managing director and a Pinterest board observer, struck a deal with the San Francisco company to create a special fund that would pool capital from other investors and take a direct stake.

In just three days, Mr. Heitzmann rounded up $200 million from seven of FirstMark's investors and included a small of amount of capital from its main fund, according to a person familiar with the deal.

He sweetened the deal by waiving fees typically charged to manage a fund, usually about 2%. FirstMark will get the same "carry," or a cut of the investment profits, as its main fund should Pinterest hold an initial public offering or get acquired at a price higher than $11 billion.

In the eyes of some investors, the wager is easy money: Pinterest has the potential to follow a similar trajectory as Facebook Inc., which became a social destination for hundreds of millions of people and a top place for advertisers. But Pinterest is no surefire bet as it only officially began selling advertising on its site in January.

A Pinterest spokesman declined to comment.

The deal illustrates how startup investors are increasingly using an emerging funding structure that helps them defend their most promising bets. They are employing a type of fund called a special purpose vehicle, or SPV. Unlike venture funds that invest in dozens of startups over several years, an SPV represents a bet on a single company at a specific point in time.

These funds let investors write bigger checks to compete with the billions of dollars pouring into later-stage startups from mutual funds, hedge funds and banks. Venture firms are finding they don't always have enough funds reserved to retain percentage stakes in startups as valuations rise quickly.

In the past 12 months, at least 70 private companies world-wide raised capital at a valuation of $1 billion or more, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. Many companies, including Pinterest, have been valued at more than double their previous valuation in that time span.

Further down the chain, a small but prominent group of entrepreneurs and executives are capitalizing on their access to fast-growing startups by raising SPVs for companies such as grocery delivery service Instacart Inc. and bitcoin processor Coinbase Inc., people familiar with the matter said.

Elad Gil, a former executive at Twitter and Google, raised tens of millions of dollars from current or former employees of Google, Facebook and Twitter for Instacart's $220 million January round that valued the company at $2 billion, said a person familiar with the matter. Mr. Gil couldn't be reached for comment.

A spokesman for Coinbase confirmed the presence of an SPV in its January round, saying it represented less than 3% of the total $75 million investment. Instacart didn't respond to a request for comment.

With the connections already in place, these deals happen quickly and further narrow the exclusive club that gets access to prime startups. But these funds pose financial risks. A venture capitalist gets a detailed look into a startup's revenue, costs and financial projections before they make a decision to invest. Buyers of SPVs are usually only offered a high-level view into the potential performance, not detailed financial metrics, according to both investors who have arranged these funds and firms and individuals who have considered investing in them.

"There are going to be some bad outcomes," said Brad Garlinghouse, a former executive at Yahoo Inc. and AOL Inc., who has invested in some SPVs and passed on others. "When you're the last money in coming at the top, you're going to be disappointed with the financial returns."

As more startups go this funding route, some investors question whether the companies are losing out on a chance to bring aboard more strategically valuable investors.

"Entrepreneurs should focus on investors that deliver value to them," said Jeff Clavier, managing partner of venture firm SoftTech VC. "When you crowd out experience just to get an SPV going, then that's a problem."

SPVs gained popularity around Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. as those companies headed toward mega-IPOs. Chris Sacca, a former Google Inc. executive, helped popularize this trend when he bought up hundreds of millions of dollars in private shares of Twitter from executives and early investors over several years preceding the company's 2013 public offering. Those shares, bought on behalf of J.P. Morgan and investment firm Rizvi Traverse Management, would be valued at about $4.2 billion at today's Twitter stock price.

Investment banks have also given their wealthiest clients special access to hot deals, such as Goldman Sachs' creation of an SPV in 2011 to market shares of Facebook to its clients at a $50 billion valuation, a year before the social network went public at about $100 billion.

But many of the earlier SPVs bought shares from employees or early investors. Startups such as Uber Technologies Inc. have attempted to prevent the trading of so-called secondary shares and regulators have tried to crack down on a market of middlemen trying to buy such stock and reap big fees.

The newer breed of SPVs involves primary shares issued by the companies, which are giving express permission to invest.

Since its site launched in 2010, Pinterest has raised more than $1 billion, much of that through SPVs. Besides FirstMark, another earlier Pinterest backer, Andreessen Horowitz, recently arranged its own special fund, people familiar with the matter said.

The firm shopped the fund to its limited partners and "friends and family," said one of these people, and waved its management fee and charged a 15% carry, smaller than what it normally takes from its main funds. A regulatory filing from Andreessen Horowitz for a fund called PinAH LP disclosed it raised $37 million in mid-March.

A spokeswoman for Andreessen Horowitz declined to comment on the funding round.

Last year, SV Angel, the seed-stage fund headed by San Francisco financier Ron Conway, led a $200 million round in Pinterest at a $5 billion valuation.

Other companies have turned to SPVs for large sums of capital in recent months.

Data analytics provider Palantir Technologies Inc., which was valued at $15 billion last September, turned to an SPV arranged by Founders Fund, a San Francisco firm headed by billionaire investors Peter Thiel, according to people familiar with the deal. In March, ride-sharing service Lyft Inc. included an SPV of more than $10 million from GSV Capital for its $530 million round that valued it at $2.5 billion, a person familiar with the matter said.

Twitter Inc. confirmed it has acquired TenXer, a startup run by one of the card-counting phenoms who inspired the 2008 blackjack movie  21."

The company on Thursday pointed to a tweet from Jeff Ma, TenXer's CEO and co-founder who "https://twitter.com/jeffma/status/583636100767322112". TenXer's technology could help Twitter's engineers work together more productively, a trouble spot for the company in the past.

VentureBeat earlier reported news of the acquisition. The price of the deal wasn't disclosed.

Founded in 2011, TenXer provides data-driven management tools for engineers and their managers to improve their work output. It has raised $4.7 million in funding from investors that include True Ventures, Radar Partners and Khosla Ventures.

Twitter in earlier years has had trouble shipping products amid coordination issues between engineers and product managers. The company plans to use TenXer's technology to improve productivity and help managers make more effective decisions through increased transparency, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Roughly half of Twitter's 3,600 employees world-wide are engineers. The company currently doesn't have plans to make TenXer's technology available to outside app developers through its Fabric platform.

Mr. Ma, a serial entrepreneur who specializes in predictive analytics, will join Twitter's product team while two TenXer engineers will join the engineering ranks.

Corrections & Amplifications: Roughly half of Twitter's 3,600 employees world-wide are engineers. An earlier version of this article incorrectly said Twitter had 3,700 employees world-wide.

Computers Trawl Sea of Data for Stock Picks --- Funds managing billions hunt for investment clues in newswires, weather, Twitter

By Bradley Hope

NEW YORK -- In SoHo offices where robots occasionally ply the hallways, dozens of Ph.D. scientists with degrees in fields like astrophysics, immunology and linguistics huddle every day around computer screens that show billions of dollars zapping around the world.

Their goal: to give their secretive hedge-fund firm a leg up in investing the $24 billion it has under management. Scientists at the firm, Two Sigma Investments LLC, program its machines to cull torrents of information from sources like newswires, earnings reports, weather bulletins and Twitter.

They then write trading algorithms that make stock picks based on what they call "signals" in those data.

Two Sigma is part of a new frontier in computerized investing, in which scientists and engineers with little formal financial training are trying to funnel massive computing power into predicting securities prices by drawing from clues in news and data.

"The secret of the markets is they can be predicted," says Alexander Migdal, a former Soviet physicist in Princeton, N.J., who writes algorithms to predict securities prices based on a broad set of data, such as news feeds. "Not 100%, of course, but just enough to make a difference, to make a profit."

The approach is a form of so-called quantitative investing, because its trades rely mainly on mathematical models. But its practitioners differ from traditional "quants," who program their computers to bet on statistical relationships among securities prices and don't bother much with real-world information.

Instead, these practitioners' aim is to get an advantage over human stock pickers by writing algorithms that are smarter and faster than any person could be in scouring the world's information, finding patterns and making trading decisions in stocks, bonds, options, futures or currencies.

At Two Sigma, the strategy works like this:

In determining how to trade the stock of, say, a major big-box retailer, Two Sigma's scientists and mathematicians devise dozens of computer-trading models related to the stock.

One model would automatically pore through analysts' research for patterns in how they view the retailer -- much as a human broker might. Another would look for clues in Twitter: It might identify one pattern -- a growing number of customers tweeting complaints, say -- and correlate that with another pattern, such as data showing fewer people visiting stores.

Additional algorithms would do other tasks human investors traditionally perform: watching for the stock price to break through a 200-day average, say, or monitoring whether executives are buying or selling company shares.

Each model would produce a trade suggestion, which would go through an algorithm written to weigh each idea based on its model's historical performance and other factors. Then, a risk-management algorithm would check the suggested trade to make sure it didn't overexpose the firm to the stock or sector. Finally, an execution system would automatically place a trade.

A model might take weeks for scientists to perfect. Once programmed into computers, a model might act in seconds or less.

"Most investment managers operate more or less the way they operated decades ago: Their investments are made using their brains," says Two Sigma co-founder David Siegel. The firm's systems constitute artificial intelligence, he says, and "represent the future of investment management."

The firm typically holds investments for days, weeks or months.

Companies like Mr. Siegel's are beginning a new investing arms race on and off Wall Street. Some are tiny startups. Major quant firms are also exploring the strategy. Hedge-fund firms Renaissance Technologies LLC, with $25 billion under management, and D.E. Shaw & Co., with $36 billion, have explored similar operations, say people familiar with the companies. Both firms decline to comment for this article.

Such firms are part of a broader quest among businesses of all types to profit from so-called big data, the world's growing flood of information on just about everything, by doing what's often called "data mining."

"The computational power available today, combined with the ability to store huge amounts of data, has allowed us to do things that were simply not possible before," says Petter Kolm, director of the mathematics-in-finance program at New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, which has sent graduates to Two Sigma and other firms that do data mining.

"We can solve problems now in real-time," he says, "that would have taken days and weeks a decade ago."

Firms practicing the approach tend to be secretive, and there are no data on how many companies or how much money is involved. People at such firms, and academics who study them, say strategies they write into their algorithms vary, as do the levels of human involvement during trading.

Some of the strategies worry some who say they may expose investors to undue risk. Among skeptics is Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates LP, the world's biggest hedge-fund firm. While not speaking specifically of Two Sigma, Mr. Dalio believes some such methods risk placing big bets on "spurious" relationships, a Bridgewater spokesman says.

Professors from University of California, Davis, and several other institutions warned in an April 2014 research paper of a trend of "overfitting" in math-based trading by hedge funds and other money managers, in which random correlations are interpreted wrongly as strong relationships.

They concluded that "pseudo-mathematics" and "financial charlatanism" were running rampant on Wall Street. Such bad math, they wrote, "is a large part of the reason why so many algorithmic and systematic hedge funds do not live up to the elevated expectations generated by their managers."

Some practitioners of the data-mining approach have failed to make it a business. Flyberry Capital LLC, a $2 million Cambridge, Mass., hedge-fund firm tested trading strategies based on reacting immediately to news events such as earthquakes near the coast of Japan. Its founder said he was especially interested in predicting how different investors would react to events like surprise changes in nonfarm-payroll statistics or the national energy supply. The firm closed earlier this year because it couldn't attract enough investors, a spokesman says.

Two Sigma casts itself as a safe bet in a jittery, interconnected world where human judgment alone is no longer effective. "Do you want your doctor operating off of gut instinct?" Mr. Siegel asks. "I don't. I want my doctor to be analytical in their diagnosis and use scientific procedures in their treatment. The same can be said for investment management."

Mr. Siegel, 53 years old, founded Two Sigma in 2001 with mathematician John Overdeck, 45. It was ranked 22nd largest of 305 U.S. firms as of September 2014 by HedgeFund Intelligence, a data-and-research firm.

Last year, it raised a $3.3 billion "macro" fund -- one of the largest hedge funds launched since the financial crisis. Another, its $6 billion Compass fund focusing on futures and currencies, returned more than 25% in 2014. The company's website says its investors "include some of the world's largest corporate and public pension plans, sovereign wealth funds, research institutions, educational endowments, hospitals and healthcare systems, and foundations."

Two Sigma's funds all take a big-data approach. Among its data sources are news bulletins, National Weather Service reports, market data, tweets and information from smartphone users who have agreed to be tracked by a retail-trend-analysis company.

Employees writing the algorithms typically have backgrounds in fields like physics, chemistry or machine learning -- scientists adept at parsing large amounts of data. More than 100 employees have doctorates.

Thirty years ago, it was easier to make investment picks because the world wasn't as interconnected, Mr. Siegel says. "Here's the problem: What affects the price of a share of Apple stock? The answer: Pretty much everything. Absolutely every little thing has some effect. Every sale, every earthquake."

Mr. Migdal, the former Soviet physicist, after leaving academia started a high-frequency-trading firm using computers to zip in and out of markets, earning tiny profits on hundreds of thousands of transactions. But he believes the profit opportunity there is diminishing. His new company, Migdal Research LLC, is devoted to longer-term predictions based on a broader data set.

Mr. Migdal, 69, compares data to water drops before they form a river. "Many little movements of the drop may become a flow," he says. "Not all the events in the financial world take the form of dramatic and obvious announcements. Quite often, they begin as small drops moving in the same direction in a way that isn't immediately visible to the human observer."

Still, says NYU's Mr. Kolm, computers aren't close to being omniscient: "For the majority of financial-prediction models, the degree of certainty is much, much weaker" than even weather forecasts.

One risk, critics say, is a repeat of the 2007 "quant meltdown," when models with similar assumptions broke down simultaneously at many firms. Long-Term Capital Management L.P.'s collapse in the late 1990s is also a stark memory: Backed by two Nobel Prize winners, it used mathematical methods to identify arbitrage opportunities but imploded in 1998, causing ripples across the financial sector.

Bridgewater, whose founder has expressed concern about data-mining, says it has invested in capability to analyze data. But its strategies are based on a "deep understanding of the logical cause-effect economic relationships that drive markets," the spokesman says. In other words, humans come up with hypotheses and test them with powerful computers, rather than letting computers drive the entire process.

Two Sigma recently suffered a large loss when one fund dropped more than 12% in January after the

Swiss National Bank abolished a currency cap and the Franc surged, says a person familiar with the fund. The fund was up 8% in February, the person says.

But the firm touts long-term consistency. One of its first funds, Spectrum, has an annualized return of 9.49% after fees and hasn't had a down year since its 2004 creation, say people familiar with its performance.

A walk through its offices shows how far it is from traditional Wall Street. In a room called the "Hacker's Lab" where staff work on side projects, a researcher prints out an ergonomic keyboard on a 3-D printer while another teaches a robot to play air hockey. A robot from the lab occasionally plays shuffleboard in hallways.

Mr. Siegel earned a computer-science Ph.D. at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied at its Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He is a lover of robotics and believes the Hackers Lab encourages staff to think differently about investing. He calls human investors "non-computer traders."

To comb through data 24 hours a day, the firm has more than 100 teraflops of power -- more than 100 trillion calculations a second -- and more than 11 petabytes of storage, the equivalent of five times the data stored in all U.S. academic libraries.

It tightly guards its strategies, but a recent hiring campaign aimed at engineers from firms like Facebook Inc. and Twitter Inc. gives a glimpse. Prospective recruits don virtual-reality headsets that bring them through a frenetic Times Square and fly them over buildings in Dubai. "A lot to take in, isn't there?" a male voice says. "Shopping, trends, traffic."

What if, the voice continues, there were a burst of headlines about a volcanic eruption in Kamchatka, Russia? If the ash caused air-traffic delays, what would that mean for oil prices? "And that's what we do at Two Sigma," the voice says, "look for connections that make sense of it all."

The company, which has grown to about 750 employees and is looking to hire 100 more engineers, needs brain power for a constant challenge: Where physicists in academia seek immutable laws, scientists writing these trading algorithms unearth patterns whose value disappears quickly as others discover them.

Profits hinge more on whether these firms' cultures of experimentation can repeatedly give an edge than on discovering a "fortune's formula," says James Weatherall, author of "The Physics of Wall Street: A Brief History of Predicting the Unpredictable," who has studied firms like Two Sigma.

The risk, he says: "If everyone is using the same models, you end up with weird market behavior."

The U.S. commodities regulator sued giant food companies Kraft Foods Group Inc. and Mondelez Global LLC over alleged manipulation of wheat prices, marking a fresh crackdown on how companies outside the financial industry use derivatives markets.

In a lawsuit filed on Wednesday, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Kraft and former parent Mondelez earned profit of $5.4 million through a 2011 effort to artificially lower the price of physical wheat by buying large amounts of futures contracts. Kraft and Mondelez were separated via a spinoff in 2012.

The case is an early test of the CFTC's new authority under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul that gives the agency more flexibility in going after derivatives manipulation. The only other case the regulator has brought under the provision is against J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. over its "London whale" trades.

The CFTC's allegations were jarring partly because grain-futures markets are set up to serve food companies and processors, who are afforded special trading privileges to help them offset the price risk they face buying crops, according to David Durra, president of AgSpread Analytics LLC, a Chicago-based commodities-trading firm.

"If what the CFTC alleges is true, it kind of challenges the integrity of the entire market," Mr. Durra said. "It's normally the speculative players who get the bad reputation."

Kraft and Mondelez didn't comment, citing pending litigation.

Wheat prices spiked in the summer of 2011 after drought damaged crops in Russia, Europe and China. That boosted the cost of grain for food companies such as Kraft, which the CFTC said uses 30 million bushels of wheat a year to make products including Oreo cookies and Wheat Thins crackers.

In response, according to the CFTC's complaint, Kraft's wheat traders developed a plan in which the company would heavily buy December-dated wheat-futures contracts, sending a signal to other traders that food companies and other grain processors intended to acquire large quantities of wheat near the end of that year.

In response, the CFTC said, the price for Kraft to buy physical wheat before December would fall, because grain companies that supply crops directly to food makers may have believed that Kraft's mill didn't require as much grain immediately.

"Kraft executed its plan, and the market reacted as Kraft expected, yielding Kraft more than $5.4 million in futures-trading profits and savings from its strategy," CFTC officials wrote in the complaint.

In the event, Kraft bought $90 million of December 2011 wheat futures in December 2011, the equivalent of a six-month supply of wheat. While wheat futures contracts traded at the Chicago Board of Trade provide for physical delivery of the grain, the CFTC alleged that the companies never intended to take the order but instead expected the market to react to their large long position by lowering cash wheat prices, which the market did, according to the complaint.

"This case goes to the core of the CFTC's mission: protecting market participants and the public from manipulation and abusive practices that undermine the integrity of the derivatives markets," the CFTC enforcement director, Aitan Goelman, said in announcing the lawsuit.

Mondelez said in a regulatory filing in February that it expected to "predominantly bear any monetary penalties or other payments that the CFTC may impose" in the case.

Alibaba Films a Mystery Movie

A mystery worthy of Hollywood is brewing at Alibaba Group Holding's Hong Kong-listed film studio. The intrigue is further muddying Alibaba's unclear entertainment strategy.

China's e-commerce giant has made several steps that show grand entertainment ambitions. But just how its various pieces fit into a comprehensive strategy remains unclear. There is a set-top-box business, a stake in an online video outlet and deals with film-and-television studio Lions Gate and music studio BMG. Its flagship entertainment unit is Alibaba Pictures, created when the group acquired a controlling interest in a Hong Kong-listed movie studio, ChinaVision Media Group.

On Tuesday night, Alibaba Pictures reported full-year earnings, and the picture wasn't pretty. Various impairments related to embarrassing accounting irregularities Alibaba discovered after the acquisition contributed to a net loss of 417.3 million yuan ($67.3 million). Revenue also fell by almost two-thirds, partly due to the suspension or delay of a number of films and TV dramas.

The losses were expected. But Alibaba Pictures shares seem to dance to their own tune, having more than doubled in value since late January. On Feb. 27, the company said it wasn't aware of any reasons for the share gains. Then on March 24, share trading was halted, pending release of inside information. The shares remain halted, without explanation.

Intriguingly, shares of another Hong Kong listed unit, Alibaba Health Information Technology, also have been halted since March 23. One possibility is that Alibaba Group intends to delist the two units. Or some other deal may be in the works.

Alibaba Pictures has some promising projects in the pipeline. For instance, renowned Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai is on board for a slate of five films, the first of which will feature actor Tony Leung. This could provide valuable content for Alibaba's ultimate entertainment strategy.

Yet what the strategy is remains hard for investors to understand. In its statement accompanying Tuesday's results, Alibaba Pictures said it and its parent "have explored a user-demand-oriented e-commerce customization model through the Internet and big data, in addition to developing a cross-industry in-depth cooperation model for e-commerce and cultural and creative industry by taking advantage of the deployment of O2O [online-to-offline] film related business in ways such as conducting promotion and marketing activities on Alibaba Group's e-commerce platforms."

This salad of tech buzzwords does little to clarify what Alibaba is up to. For now, investors are sitting in the dark, waiting for the show to start.

Problems Under

Asos's Top Line

Asos is back in fashion, but the company may struggle to maintain its style.

Following an excruciating year in which the company reeled from a string of profit warnings and suffered an inferno that destroyed its largest warehouse, the U.K. online fashion retailer is back on track.

Shares in Asos rose 3% on better-than-expected results Wednesday. In particular, group revenue grew by 14%, with the U.K. and the U.S. contributing gains of 27% and 17%, respectively. The number of active customers and the number of orders both increased by more than one-tenth, and the average order value rose 7% to GBP 67 ($99).

That is a welcome return to form for the once-feted company. Asos also has been addressing its growing pains. It has had to take costly steps to lower prices and invest in new technology and its distribution network, which until recently was centered in the U.K. Following last year's fire, the company now delivers about 25% of global orders from its U.S. warehouse and about the same amount from its German hub.

After a hit last year from pricing its wares in sterling, and translating that price into various currencies around the globe, Asos also has rolled out zonal pricing to stay more competitive locally. International sales accelerated 19% in the six weeks ended March 31 compared with 5% in the previous six-week period, J.P. Morgan estimated.

But while lowering prices overseas is reversing Asos's slowing sales trend, it is hurting profitability. Operating margins have taken a hit, expected to be about 4% this fiscal year from 7% two years earlier.

The company has been able to temper some of the impact by cutting certain operating costs such as marketing, but will need to do more to boost margins.

Competing on price to fuel growth also may leave Asos limited scope to react as more competition enters the fray. Germany's Zalando is encroaching on Asos's domestic market by expanding in the U.K. Amazon also is investing more in fashion retail.

Yet the company's valuation smacks of haute couture. Asos is trading at 75 times forward earnings, or twice its 10-year historical average. Asos has done well in righting last year's mishaps. But with margins under pressure and competitors circling, investors who have enjoyed the cut of its recovery may now be tempted to click elsewhere.

Ford's Unusually Unswerving Path

Ford Motor's U.S. sales fell last month, but still topped expectations. That doesn't mean investors should relax.

On the surface, sales numbers out Wednesday shouldn't sound alarm bells. Edmunds.com, which tracks automotive data, had estimated a 5.4% drop in Ford sales, year over year, but they fell by only 3.4%.

Despite the drop, Ford still projects the industry overall will sell 17 million to 17.5 million light vehicles in the U.S. this year. This is similar to competitors' estimates and would top the total for any year since 2006.

Meanwhile, no sign of weakening demand can be found in the industry's average transaction prices: These rose by 3.5%, year over year, according to Kelley Blue Book.

The trouble for investors is that auto sales are sensitive to economic conditions and are therefore difficult to forecast over the long term.

Ford, for example, has reported a loss per share in just six years dating back to 1987, according to FactSet. But the most recent six years of generally improving sales and positive earnings have flattered this trend. The earnings streak is approaching the length of the eight-year run concluding in 2000, which was the longest in at least 28 years.

Yet Wall Street doesn't see any rough patches in the near future. Some 20 sell-side analysts forecast, on average, earnings of $1.60 a share this year and $1.89 in 2016, according to FactSet. None predicts a loss. Fewer estimates are available for the following three years, but no analyst with numbers collated by FactSet predicts a loss for those years either.

Ford's multiple of forward earnings is 9.5 times. While higher than the five-year average of 8.5, it looks appealing when set against the S&P 500's multiple of 16.5 times.

Yet this earnings multiple should be treated with caution. For stocks of companies in cyclical industries, the P/E multiple can fall as earnings rise, only to expand suddenly as profits turn down, leaving the shares looking overvalued. In 2005, Ford's forward multiple averaged 8.6 times -- just a year before it lost $6.72 a share and was forced to scrap its dividend.

The outlook for cyclical companies can change quickly, especially when the journey up has been going on for a while. When judging the road ahead for Ford, or any car maker's stock, it doesn't pay to keep looking in the rearview mirror.

Goal Posts

Shift on

Lloyds

Bonds

Trying to walk a line between equity and debt is a precarious game -- especially when it comes to investing in banks.

U.K. investors in junior bonds issued by Lloyds Banking Group designed to convert into stock if the bank faces life-threatening losses are rediscovering this painfully.

In the financial crisis, so-called hybrid capital bonds didn't do the job they were meant to: Regulators balked at forcing losses for fear of contaminating insurers and other investors with the sickness sweeping through banks.

Such instruments became popular due to a paradox, largely ignored by everyone. Ratings firms and regulators treated them as equity, everyone else believed they were debt.

They have since become more complicated and dependent on regulatory fiat for their worth.

At Lloyds, a group of retail investors want to stop the bank redeeming notes that pay coupons of between 6.5% and 16.1%. Today, anyone would fight to keep that income.

The investors got these notes in late 2009 when Lloyds needed shoring up. With regulatory approval, the notes were exchanged for a bunch of old preference shares and other securities. But regulators have moved the goal posts since.

The U.K.'s prudential regulator has signaled that these notes don't now meet its capital rules. That became apparent in the run-up to the first annual "stress test" last year and is what prompted Lloyds to try to redeem the notes.

At the same time, the U.K.'s consumer regulator has decided that retail investors shouldn't own this type of complex investment at all, leaving the investors without a champion when they believe they are being shortchanged.

Beyond the GBP 720 million ($1.07 billion) of notes in this fight, Lloyds has GBP 2.5 billion outstanding, so the court decision will be important.

The bigger issue is how to ensure that losses can be imposed upon investors in the next crisis. With plain equity everyone knows where they are. With so-called hybrid capital, there will always be scope for politicians, regulators, banks and investors to blur the lines. As Lloyds shows, that makes it easy to get tripped up.

Overheard

Balloons sometimes bounce when they fall to the ground.

The Hong Kong shares of KuangChi Science rose by 23 times in 2014 on the promise of sending helium balloons high in the sky for commercial data transmission and surveillance purposes. KuangChi shares finally began a chunky drop last week, plunging 37% for the year through March 31.

But this balloon isn't popping just yet. On April 1, KuangChi shares rose 19%. Blame the ride down on a key shareholder, financial-services firm Reorient, being in talks to be taken over. KuangChi was a favored topic of conversation among Hong Kong short sellers, so the reinflation may have come when investors' short positions, deep in the money, were closed. The company last month reported revenue shrank and losses widened in the latest reportable period.

Predicting this balloon's path isn't getting any easier.

Nigerian Vote, Iranian Nuclear

Talks Have Muted Effect on Oil

Dinner party chatter among oil watchers can be a wide-ranging and somewhat gloomy affair, taking in Iran's nuclear ambitions, Nigeria's fractured politics and the Middle East's cat's cradle of conflicts.

Geopolitics aren't quite what they used to be, though.

West Texas Intermediate crude jumped back above $50 a barrel last week on news Yemen's president had fled advancing rebel forces. Yemen's oil output is insignificant, but it does overlook an oil-tanker chokepoint and is a battleground in the wider regional rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Even so, WTI quickly slipped back below $50.

Oil was under pressure again as nuclear negotiations with Iran continued. An agreement could pave the way for an extra 500,000 barrels a day or more of Iranian crude exports. Except that it would take time for those barrels to appear and the deadline isn't a hard one the final one is in three months.

More pertinent may be Nigeria's presidential election, in which the incumbent's defeat may lead supporters in its oil-rich Delta region to respond by disrupting supply. Regional militants helped take Nigeria's output down to about 2 million barrels a day by 2009 roughly where it sits now from north of 2.5 million in 2005.

Yet at roughly 3.3 million barrels a day, the amount of global supply offline due to political upheaval is roughly where it has stood since mid-2013. That supported mostly triple-digit oil prices for a while, but couldn't prevent last summer's crash.

Rising U.S. oil output up by about 3 million barrels a day in threeyears and bloated inventories have blunted the traditional geopolitical premium.

Lower oil prices, adding further pressure in unstable countries such as Nigeria and Venezuela, could spark bigger supply shocks. But the bar for causing a price spike clearly is higher than it once was.

Meanwhile, hints of instability without tangible disruption of supply Yemen being the prime example may work against a sustainable rally.

Retail investors have piled back into oil: Net flows into energy exchange-traded funds this year through mid-March were $5.5 billion versus $2 billion for 2014, Citigroup notes. Their bids for oil futures help U.S. exploration-and-production firms hedge their output, enabling them to delay the supply cuts ultimately required to balance the market.

The front line in the battle over oil prices lies much closer to home.

Alibaba's Film-Unit Mystery

A mystery worthy of Hollywood is brewing at Alibaba Group Holding's Hong Kong-listed film studio. The intrigue is further muddying Alibaba's unclear entertainment strategy.

New Metric Aids Weak Credit Risks --- Banks would be able to grant cards, loans to people previously unable to qualify

By AnnaMaria Andriotis

Millions of Americans unable to obtain credit cards, mortgages and auto loans from banks will receive a boost with the launch of a new credit score aimed at consumers regarded as too risky by lenders.

The new metric, set to be announced as soon as this week, is being developed by Fair Isaac Corp ., creator of the most widely used consumer-credit scores, and is being tested in a pilot phase with credit-card issuers. Fair Isaac said it hopes to make as many as 53 million people who don't have credit scores more acceptable to lenders.

People without scores in most cases don't use debt either by choice or because a negative credit event, such as a bankruptcy, foreclosure or a collection account, has shut them out of mainstream borrowing.

The new score is largely a response to banks' desire to boost lending volumes by increasing loan originations to borrowers who otherwise wouldn't qualify, many of whom tend to be charged more for loans. But the new yardstick will also throw a spotlight on consumers who often are deemed riskier than the rest of the population and could saddle banks with losses if they fail to make good on their loans.

The new score, which isn't yet named, will be calculated based on consumers' payment history with their cable, cellphone, electric and gas bills, as well as how often they change addresses and other factors, according to Fair Isaac, also known as FICO. Traditional FICO scores that lenders use in the approval or rejection process are calculated based on the information in the reports from the three major credit-reporting firms, Equifax Inc ., Experian PLC and TransUnion.

The new score will instead pull data from a separate database of telecommunications and utilities providers maintained by Equifax. It also will incorporate data from a LexisNexis database, including how often people change addresses, with frequent changes suggesting less stability.

FICO and 10 credit-card issuers, which the firm declined to name, have been quietly testing the new score since November. The firm plans to roll it out nationwide by around year-end. Some 15 million of the 53 million unscorable Americans already can be scored using the alternative data, said Jim Wehmann, executive vice president of scores at FICO.

Lenders often consider consumers who don't have a credit score to be as risky or even riskier than so-called subprime borrowers, who have low FICO scores, and often deny their loan applications or offer them interest rates that are very high. Without a score and little or no credit history, lenders have a difficult time figuring out whether the borrower is likely to pay back a loan.

The new score could help applicants who don't use credit often but are responsible with their monthly payments to get approved for financing. Proponents of scores based on alternative data have said that people who are on time with their other bills should be rewarded similarly to people who are on time with their debt payments when it comes to new-loan approvals.

But many borrowers who don't have a traditional FICO score are very risky. Some 40% of the roughly 28 million people who have thin credit files and no score -- an additional 25 million have no credit file -- have had a major negative event like a bankruptcy or collection and haven't had any updates on their credit files in at least six months, according to FICO.

Besides increasing their pool of borrowers and loan originations, banks stand to earn more in interest revenue from riskier borrowers. Lenders charge higher interest rates and in some cases extra fees to borrowers who present a higher risk of falling behind on debt payments.

The new score is the latest attempt by FICO to bring more consumers into the credit system and for the firm to stay in lenders' good graces at a time when banks' profits have been squeezed by low interest rates and lackluster demand for loans.

The announcement comes as the housing industry seeks ways to make people more creditworthy to increase loan originations, an important source of profit for banks and real-estate agents. The National Association of Realtors, along with other real-estate groups, will sponsor a symposium on credit access on Wednesday, which is billed as the first of its type to discuss ways to increase access to mortgages using alternative credit-scoring systems.

Lenders use FICO scores in 90% of consumer-lending decisions, according to CEB TowerGroup, a financial-services research firm.

About 200 million adults in the U.S. have FICO scores, which range from 300 to 850, based on factors such as whether they pay their debts on time and maintain low credit-card balances, and how long they have been managing debt. The new score won't apply to them. To have such a score, consumers must have at least one account, generally a loan or credit card, that is older than six months, and at least one account on their credit report must be updated, which can occur when there is activity on it, in the past six months, among other factors, said John Ulzheimer, president of consumer education at CreditSesame.com, a credit-management site, and a former manager at FICO. One account can satisfy both conditions, he said.

Among the potential new crop of borrowers created by the new credit score, those who successfully apply for a credit card and handle their payments well -- avoiding falling behind on payments and maintaining low balances -- for at least six months will then receive a regular FICO score, which will make it easier for them to get approved by other lenders, including car-loan and mortgage lenders.

The new score comes after years of intensifying pressure from lenders on FICO to help make more people creditworthy. Lenders have been asking FICO for a score that will allow them to lend to more borrowers, including those who haven't been using credit but are responsible with monthly payments, said Dave Shellenberger, senior director of scoring and predictive analytics at FICO.

Mortgage firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , which require lenders from whom they buy mortgages to use FICO scores when underwriting applicants, began reviewing alternative credit-scoring models, specifically scores from VantageScore Solutions LLC , last year.

VantageScore is starting to make inroads. More than 2,000 lenders, including six of the 10 largest U.S. banks, used VantageScore scores in their lending decisions in 2014, a 24% increase from 2013, the company said.

Microfinance -- Financing the Future Transforming Banking For the World's Poor

1,052 words

Microfinance was once heralded as a key weapon in the fight against global poverty. Yet some 2.5 billion impoverished people across the world still don't have access to basic financial services, according to the latest World Bank data.

Economist and author Jonathan Morduch has been thinking deeply about the conundrum for nearly three decades. A professor of public policy and economics at New York University and managing director of the Financial Access Initiative, he has cowritten two books on the topic: "Portfolios of the Poor: How the Poor Live on $2 a Day," and "The Economics of Microfinance."

He recently spoke to The Wall Street Journal about the limitations of microfinance, the promise of new technologies, and the need for quality, not just cost effectiveness, when it comes to financial services for low-income groups. Edited excerpts:

WSJ: There were big hopes for microfinance a decade ago. What's your take on it?

Morduch: In many ways, microfinance has been a stunning success. In 1997, the first global count of microfinance customers netted about 13 million borrowers. Twenty years later, the tally found 200 million customers. If we assume that each borrower is part of a family of five, the tally implies that one billion people are touched by microfinance. The push to scale has been spectacular.

WSJ: Why didn't this push solve the problems of financial exclusion and widespread poverty?

Morduch: The biggest constraint to further growth is that microfinance remains locked into a vision in which lending is restricted to finance for small-scale entrepreneurs. That box traps most microlenders.

The fact is that half the world's adults -- some 2.5 billion people -- lack access to basic banking services. And most of these 2.5 billion are not small-scale entrepreneurs. They are construction workers, shop clerks, drivers, nannies, factory laborers and other kinds of wage earners. Many live in cities. They have the income to be reliable customers, and they desire loans to manage expenses, but the microfinance sector has little to offer them. Another share of the 2.5 billion comprises farmers, who microlenders have largely avoided for fear of the risks in agriculture.

When it comes to poverty reduction, the evidence shows that access to finance alone is insufficient. There's much to learn from microfinance, but the next steps require going beyond the strategies that have driven its success.

WSJ: People talk a lot today about the potential impact of new technologies on helping more people get access to banking services. Which technologies do you see as most likely to help and why?

Morduch: There are several ways that technologies are changing the picture. The first is radical improvements in digital-payment technologies. This is the backbone on which banking services can be built. In the U.S. and Europe, we hardly give a thought to what life would be like without credit cards and the like. But in the developing world, the new payment systems are disrupting traditional practices in positive ways. They allow government transfers to go directly to recipients, cutting corruption and leakage dramatically. In Kenya, they're helping extended families cope with shocks by making it much easier to send money to relatives. Simply making it easier to move money is the fundamental step.

Second, technologies are making it easier to keep track of people and establish identities. India's national ID card, for example, is now making it easier to provide banking services to millions of poor families.

The third technology is mobile banking. The biggest story so far has been the rise of M-Pesa in Kenya with over 12 million customers, a huge penetration rate given the size of Kenya's population. Even bigger stories, though, will be told about the next innovators. GSMA, the industry group, counts 255 mobile money services in 89 countries. In about half of the countries, regulation allows both banks and nonbanks to provide mobile money services. The latest count found just under 300 million registered mobile money accounts in 2014, which is still a small share of the potential market.

WSJ: What's the biggest technology game changer?

Morduch: It's the possibility of using "big data" from the millions of records of mobile banking transactions to construct more accurate profiles of customers and sharpen assessments of credit risks. I'm more wary than most people here, though. Experience shows that big data models can end up including new customers -- while too quickly excluding others.

WSJ: Are there any other policies that you favor that aren't being tried? Or are there any initiatives out there not getting publicity that you think are on the right track?

Morduch: The microfinance movement got its start by turning away from traditional brick-and-mortar bank branches. The strategy slashed costs dramatically, and was a triumph. We're at a point, though, when it's time to go back to the idea of bank branches with a new mindset. KGFS in Tamil Nadu, south India, shows what the future holds. They created branches that deploy new technologies to serve low-income customers, not with stripped-down products but with a suite of suitable financial offerings. KGFS demonstrated that it is a mistake to think that the very cheapest option will always be most popular. The world's unbanked seek quality too.

In that same way, consumer protection for microfinance customers remains a priority. The "Smart Campaign" has shown how to establish fair dispute resolution and improve the transparency of pricing and policies. So far, the strategy involves self-regulation, but it can't stop there. We've seen in the U.S. that government-backed regulation is needed to create a mature market. There are risks in that, but there are greater risks in not providing consumers with basic protections.

Transforming Banking for the Poor: Q&A With Jonathan Morduch

Microfinance was once heralded as a key weapon in the fight against global poverty. Yet some 2.5 billion impoverished people across the world still don't have access to basic financial services, according to the latest World Bank data.

Economist and author Jonathan Morduch has been thinking deeply about the conundrum for nearly three decades. A professor of public policy and economics at New York University and managing director of the Financial Access Initiative, he has co-authored two books on the topic:  Portfolios of the Poor: How the Poor Live on $2 a Day," and  The Economics of Microfinance."

He recently spoke to The Wall Street Journal about the limitations of microfinance, the promise of new technologies, and the need for quality, not just cost effectiveness, when it comes to financial services for low-income groups. Edited excerpts:

There were big hopes for microfinance a decade ago. What's your take on it?

In many ways, microfinance has been a stunning success. In 1997, the first global count of microfinance customers netted about 13 million borrowers. Twenty years later, the tally found 200 million customers. If we assume that each borrower is part of a family of five, the tally implies that 1 billion people are touched by microfinance. The push to scale has been spectacular.

Why didn't this push solve the problems of financial exclusion and widespread poverty?

The biggest constraint to further growth is that microfinance remains locked into a vision in which lending is restricted to finance for small-scale entrepreneurs. That box traps most microlenders.

The fact is that half the world's adults some 2.5 billion people lack access to basic banking services. And most of these 2.5 billion are not small-scale entrepreneurs. They are construction workers, shop clerks, drivers, nannies, factory laborers and other kinds of wage earners. Many live in cities. They have the income to be reliable customers, and they desire loans to manage expenses, but the microfinance sector has little to offer them. Another share of the 2.5 billion comprises farmers, who microlenders have largely avoided for fear of the risks in agriculture.

When it comes to poverty reduction, the evidence shows that access to finance alone is insufficient. There's much to learn from microfinance, but the next steps require going beyond the strategies that have driven its success.

People talk a lot today about the potential impact of new technologies on helping more people get access to banking services. Which technologies do you see as most likely to help and why?

There are several ways that technologies are changing the picture. The first is radical improvements in digital-payment technologies. This is the backbone on which banking services can be built. In the U.S. and Europe, we hardly give a thought to what life would be like without credit cards and the like. But in the developing world, the new payment systems are disrupting traditional practices in positive ways. They allow government transfers to go directly to recipients, cutting corruption and leakage dramatically. In Kenya, they're helping extended families cope with shocks by making it much easier to send money to relatives. Simply making it easier to move money is the fundamental step.

Second, technologies are making it easier to keep track of people and establish identities. India's national ID card, for example, is now making it easier to provide banking services to millions of poor families.

The third technology is mobile banking. The biggest story so far has been the rise of M-Pesa in Kenya with over 12 million customers, a huge penetration rate given the size of Kenya's population. Even bigger stories, though, will be told about the next innovators. GSMA, the industry group, counts 255 mobile money services in 89 countries. In about half of the countries, regulation allows both banks and nonbanks to provide mobile money services. The latest count found just under 300 million registered mobile money accounts in 2014, which is still a small share of the potential market.

What's the biggest technology game changer?

It's the possibility of using  big data" from the millions of records of mobile banking transactions to construct more accurate profiles of customers and sharpen assessments of credit risks. I'm more wary than most people here, though. Experience shows that big data models can end up including new customers while too quickly excluding others.

Are there any other policies that you favor that aren't being tried? Or are there any initiatives out there not getting publicity that you think are on the right track?

The microfinance movement got its start by turning away from traditional brick-and-mortar bank branches. The strategy slashed costs dramatically, and was a triumph. We're at a point, though, when it's time to go back to the idea of bank branches with a new mindset. KGFS in Tamil Nadu, south India, shows what the future holds. They created branches that deploy new technologies to serve low-income customers, not with stripped-down products but with a suite of suitable financial offerings. KGFS demonstrated that it is a mistake to think that the very cheapest option will always be most popular. The world's unbanked seek quality too.

In that same way, consumer protection for microfinance customers remains a priority. The  Smart Campaign" has shown how to establish fair dispute resolution and improve the transparency of pricing and policies. So far, the strategy involves self-regulation, but it can't stop there. We've seen in the U.S. that government-backed regulation is needed to create a mature market. There are risks in that, but there are greater risks in not providing consumers with basic protections.

World
Lufthansa Expects Insurance Claim of $300 Million After Germanwings Plane Crash; Total includes expected claims from passenger liability policy, physical damage to aircraft

FRANKFURT Deutsche Lufthansa AG expects an insurance claim of around $300 million in connection with "http://www.wsj.com/articles/germanwings-investigation-to-focus-on-how-industry-vets-psychological-backgrounds-of-pilots-1427797466" in the French Alps, a spokesman for Germanwings ' parent Lufthansa said Tuesday.

The $300 million includes expected claims from a passenger liability policy and from insuring physical damage to the aircraft, the spokesman said.

The bulk of the overall loss for which insurers will have to pay relates to the passenger liability policy that covers the 150 victims, and costs will depend on the nationality of the victim, among other things, insurance rating agency A.M. Best estimates. Those costs will be shared by a consortium of 10 insurers led by Allianz SE , which is backed by reinsurers.

There is more certainty around the ultimate cost of physical damage to the destroyed aircraft, which was valued at $6.5 million, A.M. Best says.

If it is determined that the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/germanwings-co-pilot-andreas-lubitz-appears-to-have-deliberately-crashed-plane-1427373360", the insurers that underwrote the airline's  hull war" insurance policy will likely become liable for the aircraft loss, rather than the consortium that underwrote the aviation all-risks policy, says Catherine Thomas, director of analytics at A.M. Best.

In that case, the Lloyd's market, rather than the consortium led by Allianz, will absorb the bulk of the aircraft loss, according to A.M. Best.

Allianz and Lloyd's declined to comment.

Lufthansa earlier said it would pay out an initial sum of  50,000 ($54,000) a person to the relatives of passengers on the Germanwings plane that crashed in the French Alps last week.

Aviation lawyers say that Lufthansa and its insurers will likely face large legal liability claims in the crash despite findings that the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/germanwings-investigation-to-focus-on-how-industry-vets-psychological-backgrounds-of-pilots-1427797466", who is suspected of deliberately crashing the plane, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/germanwings-co-pilot-andreas-lubitz-concealed-depression-from-airline-1427484790".

The great American disconnect

If you believe history is yet to come, the United States is still the place to be. Only in America can you find people trying to make cars fly, abolish human mortality and nurture robots with feelings. Yet America's politics is remarkable for its resistance to new ideas. The gap between Washington's dearth of creativity and the ferment beyond is widening. Every week, some audacious start-up aims to exploit the commercial potential of science. Many are too zany to succeed. A few will deserve to. Every week, it seems, a presidential campaign is launched. Some of the 2016 candidates are actively hostile to science. None, so far, have hinted at original ideas for fixing America's problems. One will undeservedly succeed.

The root of America's intellectual disconnect is cultural. In Silicon Valley, "fail harder" is a motto. A history of bankruptcy is proof of business credentials. In Washington, a single miscue can ruin your career. Ruth Porat 's move last week from Morgan Stanley, where she was chief financial officer, to Google for a cool $70m was taken as another sign of Silicon Valley's increasing edge over Wall Street . A growing share of top US graduates are bypassing a career in investment banking for Big Data. Less noticed was the fact that Ms Porat turned down a job in Barack Obama's administration last year as deputy Treasury secretary. She feared the Senate confirmation process would rip her to shreds. She was probably right.

The result is a system in which the bland are leading the bland. Washington is host to the largest collection of think- tanks in the world. Yet they are notable nowadays for their lack of original thinking. The ideas shortage has nothing to do with low IQ. The post codes around Washington have America's highest concentration of PhDs other than Silicon Valley. But if you want a job in a future US administration, you risk running a gauntlet from which you may never recover. The route to success is paved with caution. One stray remark, or risqu policy idea, can kill your prospects. Science is the basis of America's innovative edge. Yet embracing it can be a political career-stopper. Several Republican presidential candidates reject the notion of man-made global warming while some believe child vaccines cause disease .

Aversion to science is not a conservative monopoly. Among the 19,000 papers produced by Washington's top 10 think-tanks in the past few years, science and technology ranked bottom among the subjects addressed, according to a survey by Foreign Policy magazine. During the cold war, senior US officials were expected to be fluent in the language of nuclear technology - understanding it was the basis of America's rivalry with the Soviet Union. Today few have much clue about the evolving threat of cyber warfare. Unlike nuclear weapons, which were too risky to use given the certainty of overwhelming retaliation, cyber attacks are low risk. Deterrence does not work on anonymous foes. Yet cyber attacks are arguably the greatest future danger to US national security.

Some hope Silicon Valley's growing visibility in Washington might spark new ideas. If US politics runs on money, Big Data's dollars are preferable to Wall Street's. Tech companies used to disdain the US capital in the myopic view that their success had little to do with government. Today, the most rapid lobbying growth comes from the likes of Google and Facebook. Yet their priority is to repair the damage from the Edward Snowden leaks - strengthening privacy, rather than lifting research and development budgets, or opening up the US immigration system. They aim to curb the National Security Agency's incursions rather than spread bold thinking to Washington.

Might 2016 produce an original debate over America's future? It is tempting to believe so. Yet the contest is shaping into a traditional slugfest between those who want to shrink federal government and those who would conserve it. In the coming days, Hillary Clinton will launch her official candidacy. Having strung it out so long, she is expected to justify the wait with original thinking. In 2008 she won ovations by saying she was born in the middle of the last century, into the middle class in the middle of America. That will no longer bring blue collar voters to their feet. It is possible Mrs Clinton has spent the time coming up with new ideas to address America's middle class squeeze - but unlikely. As it stands, her chief originality will be a promise to break the White House gender barrier. Nor should we expect Jeb Bush, or his rivals, to restock Washington's intellectual cupboard. Gridlock suits the conservative base.

If the US is recovering in spite of Washington, might conservatives have a point? Alas not. Much of America's innovative edge comes from public research. Washington tends to come up with new ideas during emergencies - necessity being the mother of invention. Silicon Valley's prowess dates from the breakthroughs produced by cold war Pentagon spending. Even the technology behind hydraulic fracking, which has helped power the US job market recovery, comes from public investment in the aftermath of the 1970s oil shortages. The secret sauce of US capitalism is a history of collaboration with federal government. The two are now increasingly disconnected. Do not look to White House hopefuls to restore it.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Baillie Gifford chooses Hong Kong over Shanghai; FUND FOCUS; Fund manager adopts a wait-and-see approach to mainland Chinese equities

A lack of clarity on tax, foreign exchange and central bank policy are deterring Baillie Gifford's Richard Sneller from buying mainland Chinese equities, even though he views the market as a strong opportunity.

The fund manager has roughly 17 per cent of his portfolio in Chinese stocks, but this is entirely via Hong Kong-listed "H" shares, rather than the Shanghai-listed "A" share variety.

He has co-managed the Emerging Markets Growth fund for more than a decade, in which time the fund has returned 235 per cent versus benchmark returns of 183 per cent, according to FE Analytics, the data provider.

In the past five years, however, it has only narrowly outperformed the index.

Mr Sneller said in spite of the Hong Kong-Shanghai Stock Connect scheme , which has made foreign investment in China easier, there were still issues preventing him from buying mainland stocks.

"We do spend time looking at the A-share market but we are not there yet," he said.

These issues include a lack of clarity surrounding how capital gains tax is levied on investments.

He added there were concerns surrounding foreign exchange as well as the flow of money in and out of the country when stocks are bought and sold.

"There is an element of discretion by the central bank in terms of taking large amounts of money out," he said.

Mr Sneller's biggest bet is on information technology, especially companies targeting emerging market consumers.

"We have 50 per cent of the portfolio in IT companies, which is a very large position, but we are excited about them as we feel the valuations are failing to understand the long-term shifts in consumer behaviour," he said.

However Mr Sneller acknowledged this was the "biggest risk" to the portfolio, given that investors can sometimes get "too excited about technology companies".

Mr Sneller said while he and his team followed the Baillie Gifford style of bottom-up, long-term investing, the cycles in emerging markets were often "shorter and sharper", so the economic backdrop is not ignored.

As China was likely to be cutting back on infrastructure and property investment , he said was "fairly negative on a top-down macro view" on countries such as Brazil and South Africa, which are strongly linked to the commodity cycle.

The fund also has 20 per cent position in India focused on export-orientated IT outsourcing companies.

Yahoo Boosts Buyback Authorization by $2 Billion; The additional buybacks bolster CEO s defense against activist investor

Yahoo Inc. on Thursday announced a plan to buy back $2 billion of its own shares with proceeds from the recent public offering of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

The buybacks are part of Chief Executive Marissa Mayer's broader effort to unlock value from Yahoo's Asian assets and return cash to shareholders. The company has repurchased $9.7 billion in stock since 2012 and earlier this year unveiled a plan to spin off its remaining stake in Alibaba.

The new plan expires March 31, 2018. Yahoo said about $726 million remains available under a repurchase program announced in November 2013.

The additional buybacks bolster Ms. Mayer's defense against activist investor Starboard Value LP, who took a position in Yahoo last year and argued the CEO has diminished investor value by overspending on acquisitions. The investor reiterated some of its concerns in a letter to Ms. Mayer earlier this month, urging the company to cut costs, spin off its stake in Yahoo Japan and buy back up to $4 billion in shares.

Friday is the deadline for shareholders to submit nominees for the board of Yahoo, effectively the last day that a proxy fight can be launched.

A spokesman for Starboard wasn't immediately able to comment Thursday. The firm's latest letter didn't indicate whether the activist may seek a leadership change, a threat it had made before the Alibaba spinoff announcement.

Starboard has voiced the loudest objection to Ms. Mayer in the more than two years since she took the reins at Yahoo. During that period, the Internet portal has failed to boost its core advertising business and struggled to reinvent itself in an age of social networks and mobile computing.

Yahoo reaped more than $5 billion from Alibaba's record-setting IPO last fall, in addition to its sale of $7.6 billion in shares of the Chinese e-commerce company in 2012.

Yahoo had about $8 billion in cash and short-term securities as of Dec. 31.

Buybacks diminish the amount Ms. Mayer could spend on large acquisitions. Last year, she spent more than $800 million to acquire two companies: mobile ad analytics company Flurry and video-ad service BrightRoll.

In after-hours trading Thursday, Yahoo's shares rose 2.2% to $45.45.

Sector's rate of growth presents challenge for banks' business models

Investment in the red hot market for financial technology companies trebled last year, providing a hint of the scale of digital disruption the banking sector will face in the future, according to new research from Accenture.

The total amount invested in the global fintech sector rose from just over $4bn in 2013 to more than $12bn last year, as record amounts were poured into companies developing technologies that promise to turn the financial sector on its head. The rate of growth far outstripped the 63 per cent growth in total venture capital investments last year. Accenture said the biggest deals included the $3.5bn investment by KKR and others into First Data, the payment processor, and the $865m raised on the New York Stock Exchange by Lending Club, the peer-to-peer lender.

But even without those two unusually big deals, total investment almost doubled in the sector. Accenture defines fintech as companies that are offering technology for banking and corporate finance, capital markets, financial data analytics, payments and personal financial management.

However, much of the growth has come from investments in relatively mature companies - the amount of money flowing into first-round investments in fintech companies grew only 48 per cent to $1.38bn, Accenture said.

"The obvious conclusion is that banks' value chain is going to be disrupted," said Julian Skan , managing director at Accenture. "The question this year in fintech is really much more about a challenge to the business model of banks."

The consultancy said its survey of senior banking executives involved in technology innovation found that seven out of 10 felt their banks had "a fragmented or opportunistic approach to dealing with digital innovation".

Gonzalo Gortazar , chief executive of Caixabank, Spain's biggest bank by market share, said: "I think they [fintech companies] are a threat for some business models, particularly those based on a low-cost product offering, which will find it very hard to compete with these new entrants."

However, Mr Gortazar said that lenders with a dominant market share and active approach to investing in technology would be able to prosper, despite the threat from new players. "I don't think we'll be challenged, unless we are complacent."

Many banks, such as Barclays and Santander, have in-house venture capital funds to invest in fintech companies, hoping to learn from, and in some cases acquire, the top innovations in the sector. The US had the biggest share of investment in fintech, but the rate of growth was highest in Europe, where the UK accounted for more than $4 of every $10 invested in fintech last year.

The figures include financing from venture capital, private equity, corporations, hedge funds, accelerators and government-backed funds.

Accenture said that "open innovation" was critical for banks to embrace the digital innovation disrupting their industry.

A new breed of commercial intelligence company

At dawn on a cold, grey March morning in London's Mayfair, 135 police officers burst into the homes and offices associated with Vincent and Robert Tchenguiz, the property moguls, in the glare of paparazzi flash bulbs. It is 2011 and the raid has been orchestrated by the Serious Fraud Office to gather evidence against the brothers for their alleged involvement in the collapse of Kaupthing, the Icelandic bank, three years previously. In moments like these there is only one question: who you gonna call?

In this case, Vincent Tchenguiz called a very new, little-known business intelligence company founded and staffed by two young ex-Israeli military intelligence officers, Dan Zorella and Avi Yanus. Black Cube set about mapping the complex network of relationships that underpinned the 2008 crash of the Icelandic banking system that collectively had debts nine times the gross domestic product of the entire country. As a result of this investigation, the case against the Tchenguiz brothers collapsed, the courts ordered the SFO to pay 3m plus costs and David Green, director of the SFO, issued a public apology. Vincent Tchenguiz is now suing accountants Grant Thornton, among others, for 2.2bn using the same dossier supplied by Black Cube.

Black Cube is a different breed of investigative company. It does not just gather information for its clients, the company builds a body of evidence focused on a particular lawsuit, corporate attack or threat, and is known for its tenacity.

Elite units within the Israel Defense Forces' Intelligence Corps, such as the renowned Unit 8200, have arguably spawned more technology companies than any business school. Stylit, Nice, Comverse and Check Point are all examples. Professor Asher Tishler, until last year dean of Tel Aviv University's school of business and now president of the College of Management Academic Studies, taught both Zorella and Yanus, and sits on Black Cube's advisory board. "IDF intelligence graduates are very smart people," he says. "They have been trained very, very well to think outside the box, not 9-5."

It is not only action by the police or the courts that may have you reaching for the phone. When a Ukrainian bank noticed that some of its ATMs appeared to be faulty, paying money out in an apparently random way, it put in a call to Kaspersky Lab.

"I don't know if we would categorise ourselves as an intelligence company," says David Emm, principal security researcher for Kaspersky Lab, "but we have been drawn in that direction inexorably." Founded in 1997, Kaspersky has since been dubbed "the best anti-virus and cyber-threat company in the world" by a senior industry source.

There was nothing wrong with the bank's ATMs, but someone had hacked the machine's programme to dispense cash at prescribed times. It was the tip of a very big cyber iceberg. "As with many targeted attacks, you are looking at a unified code base that attacks a range of organisations," says Emm. "It is not like a Brink's-Mat [gold bullion] robbery and a single hit." In this case Kaspersky, then working with Interpol, uncovered thefts amounting to approximately $1bn from 100 banks across the globe.

The company analyses 325,000 samples of code every day to detect malware and unusual patterns of activity that may indicate a future security breach. Predictive analytics allows the company to "keep track in real time" of anomalies in software or browser behaviour.

The Carbanak gang was able to hack important employees' computers using "spear phishing" (highly targeted emails) and drive-by downloads (unintentional software downloads), and then mirror bank operations so precisely that they remained undetected until Kaspersky became involved. "Companies and individuals should not rely on the thin red line," says Emm. "We are not as smart as we should be on raising awareness of human vulnerability."

. . .

Facing two rooms full of electronic data in their efforts to recover money for investors hung out to dry by Bernard Madoff, the convicted Ponzi schemer, Baker Hostetler, the US law firm, called in K2 Intelligence. The company specialises in crunching through large volumes of data "with our new whizz-bang tech", says Paul Lyons, co-head of the business intelligence practice at the company. Working with Palantir, the software specialist, K2 has been analysing tens of thousands of email and phone records to prove that certain individuals claiming they did not know Madoff, actually did.

K2 was founded by father and son Jules and Jeremy Kroll in 2009. Kroll pre is a veteran of corporate investigation, more or less inventing the industry. The former district attorney built his eponymous company from its inception in 1972 to an enterprise worth $1.9bn when it was sold to Marsh & McLennan, the US insurance broker, in 2004. It is now owned by Altegrity, the security group. Until perhaps a decade ago, companies such as Kroll and Control Risks dominated the risk mitigation and business intelligence sector.

"These firms are huge factories," says a senior industry source. "A project goes in one end and goes through a predetermined set of 10 processes and the product emerges at the other end." By contrast, companies focused on the sharp end of intelligence work have "no reliance on reaching down from the shelf", in the words of Chris Morgan Jones, an ex-Kroll intelligence staffer and now adviser to K2, when he is not writing thrillers. "Much due-diligence work, for example, has become highly commoditised," he says.

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.

<>"What we do is very personal," explains Frans Post, chief executive of GPW, the business intelligence group. "We do not have 100 analysts in a room monitoring Google Stream [an online newsfeed], then writing it up into a report. We provide unique intelligence."

Globalisation, cyber threats and the 2008 financial crisis have all been good news for business intelligence companies. Not only is the market expanding (total global spend is forecast to grow 8.2 per cent in 2015, to $76.9bn, according to research by Gartner, the technology research company), but the speed and nature of these challenges also favour entrants.

GPW, founded in 2004, specialises in providing corporate intelligence in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Middle East and Africa. "As companies with a big geographical footprint look to expand into unknown territory with more challenging jurisdictions, they need expert support in helping them gather intelligence on the ground," says Post. K2's Morgan Jones says older companies have been slow to grasp opportunities to build valuable business relationships with clients from emerging markets. Such work builds a two-way intelligence route, as these clients open doors and offer "far deeper access to these markets" than would otherwise be possible, he says.

. . .

Companies founded by former intelligence officers, have to tread a narrow line between legal and illegal methods of intelligence gathering. "When you leave the service, it is like being suddenly blinded," says a senior industry source. "You are used to hacking computers, wiretapping, listening to phone calls. Suddenly you have to create unique methodologies that are legal to gain that information."

Prof Tishler adds: "You work on the borders and sometimes by mistake you cross the border. Sometimes you drive your car and go over the speed limit. It happens in life and it happens in intelligence work."

<>Heavyweight legal counsel helps. Black Cube's advisers include Michael Drury, former director of legal affairs at GCHQ, the UK state communications monitoring agency, as well as the law firm K&L Gates in the US.

Intelligence is still a covert, secretive business. That is partly why the deep web (part of the internet not indexed by standard search engines) - and the even more clandestine dark net - is one of its critical tools. "It is an interesting place," says a senior industry source, "because it is where criminals, hackers, intelligence officers and investigative journalists operate." However, navigating the dark net "requires very specialist skills", adds Morgan Jones.

For all the importance of data, Black Cube, GPW and K2 invest in "people on the ground" in Post's words. "Sometimes one telephone call can save you three months of work; it is not all done through technology," says Prof Tishler. "You just need to know who to call."

At Bank of China, Net Rises but at Slower Pace

BEIJING -- Bank of China Ltd. reported its slowest annual profit growth as a publicly traded company on Wednesday, the second major Chinese state lender this week to do so, as the industry grapples with a slowing economy and growing bad loans.

The bank, China's fourth-largest lender by assets, said it stepped up provisions against possible losses from rapidly growing bad loans.

"Chinese economic growth has entered a 'new normal,' " Bank of China Chairman Tian Guoli said in the bank's earnings report, invoking a phrase used by Chinese officials to describe slowing economic growth. "The operating environment for banks is undergoing immense and profound changes."

On Tuesday, China's No. 3 lender, Agricultural Bank of China Ltd., reported its slowest annual profit growth since it went public in 2010. Bank of China listed its shares in 2006.

Bank of China said its 2014 net profit rose 8% from a year earlier to 169.6 billion yuan ($27.3 billion), thanks to higher interest and fee income. The result beat the median 167.88 billion yuan net-profit forecast of 27 analysts polled by Thomson One Analytics.

The bank said its nonperforming loans stood at 842.6 billion yuan at the end of 2014, up 250.5 billion yuan from the end of 2013.

Its ratio of bad loans to total lending rose to 1.18% from 0.96% a year earlier. It also said it had disposed of 19.9 billion worth of nonperforming loans in 2014, capping the increase in bad debt.

Bank of China said it had increased its allowance for loan-impairment losses in 2014 by 20.48 billion yuan, bringing the total at the end of last year to 188.53 billion yuan.

But the rapid growth of bad loans over the past year meant that its provisions for possibly unprofitable credits no longer covered as much as they once did. The state lender said its allowance for possible losses on loans was 187.6% of total nonperforming loans at the end of 2014, down from 229.35% a year earlier.

The bank said its net interest income last year was up 13% from a year earlier to 321.1 billion yuan, while fee-and-commission income rose 9% to 135.23 billion yuan.

Net interest margin -- the difference between interest paid and received -- widened slightly to 2.25% at the end of 2014 from 2.24% a year earlier, it said. The margin is a key measure for Chinese banks' profitability.

Profit growth at Chinese banks has been under pressure as Beijing accelerates its efforts to liberalize interest rates that have long protected fat margins on loans. The central bank suggested it could scrap all controls over the nation's deposit rates this year.

U.S. Regulators Fault HSBC, RBS on 'Wills'

WASHINGTON -- U.S. regulators added three foreign-owned banks to the list of big financial firms that haven't shown they can collapse without causing broader economic damage.

The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. found shortcomings in the "living wills," or bankruptcy plans, of the U.S. units of BNP Paribas SA, HSBC Holdings PLC and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC. The banks could face sanctions if they don't fix the issues by the end of this year, when new drafts of the plans are due, the regulators said.

BNP and HSBC declined to comment, and RBS had no immediate ccomment.

The regulators' move echoes a similar rebuke issued to 11 of the largest U.S. banks in August. Among the biggest firms, Wells Fargo & Co. was the only bank that persuaded regulators it could go through bankruptcy without serious damage to the financial system. These 11 banks could face sanctions if they don't make significant progress on the plans by July.

The living wills are a requirement of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law and spell out how a firm would wind down its operations under the U.S. bankruptcy code if it got into trouble. The plans must show the bank is able to be unwound without broad negative repercussions. If the plans aren't credible and remain so after repeated warnings, regulators can impose sanctions, including forcing a firm to sell subsidiaries or break apart.

The FDIC found the three foreign-owned firms' plans were "not credible," but the Fed stopped short of that finding, regulators said in a statement. Both agencies must agree a bank's plan is "not credible" before they can begin the process of considering sanctions, which could take two years or more.

The Fed and FDIC split along similar lines when rejecting the living wills of the 11 other large banks in August. But they also promised to be harsher in the future if banks don't make improvements.

Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of policy analysis firm Federal Financial Analytics Inc., said Monday's decision "is going to be a significant strategic event" for the foreign-owned firms, which will need to "look very hard at their U.S. operations to identify what the problems . . . are and whether they can be resolved to U.S. satisfaction without damage to the franchise."

All three of the foreign-owned firms filed versions of the living wills with regulators in 2013 and 2014. The regulators said the 2014 plans made improvements from the 2013 versions but still needed improvement, including "ensuring the continuity of shared services that support critical operations and core business lines" and demonstrating "the ability to produce reliable information in a timely manner" across all operations. They said the firms must amend certain financial contracts to ensure counterparties can't terminate them upon a bankruptcy filing, a scenario that could cause problems for a struggling firm.

Separately, the judge presiding over MetLife Inc.'s lawsuit challenging its designation as a "systemically important financial institution" has asked the Fed and FDIC to consider giving the insurer an extension of about six months to file its first living will document, according to a March 6 court filing. U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer said the existing July 1 deadline "might make it difficult for the court to rule" on various motions before MetLife "begins to expend time and money to prepare" its document.

According to the court filing, the Fed and FDIC are considering the request and plan to vote on a possible extension by March 30.

Andreessen joins rush to back UK tech groups; Software

Andreessen Horowitz, the Silicon Valley group that was an early backer of Facebook, is investing $20m in Improbable, a London-based company that creates "virtual worlds", as US venture capital continues to flood into UK digital start-ups.

Chris Dixon , who masterminded Andreessen Horowitz's investment in Oculus, the virtual reality company bought by Facebook for $2bn, will join Improbable's board.

One person familiar with the matter said the investment valued the three-year-old company at around $100m.

The investment is the latest sign of how UK tech companies, particularly those based in the capital, are attracting attention from US venture groups.

Last month, figures from CB Insights, a research group, revealed that London-based technology companies obtained $1.4bn in funding in 2014, with $795.2m from US-based investors.

Improbable creates systems for virtual worlds, enabling thousands of people to play complex computer games at the same time or allowing healthcare workers to simulate how a virus spreads across a city's transport network. Its technology adopts techniques from high-frequency trading.

"This is a brand new technology. There is nothing like it at all," Mr Dixon said.

Herman Narula , its 26-year-old chief executive, founded the company along with fellow computer science graduates from the University of Cambridge. The son of Harpinder Singh Narula, the Indian construction billionaire, said: "We have grand ambitions to create an operating system for an entirely new class of applications."

The company employs 50 people, including former staff of tech groups such as Google and Facebook and former software engineers from financial institutions such as Goldman Sachs.

The company had previously raised $1.5m from a group of angel investors including Hermann Hauser , the Austrian entrepreneur who co-founded Acorn Computer in the 1970s, and Alex Asseily , co-founder of Jawbone, the gadget maker.

Mr Narula said the funds would allow the company to keep hiring.

In showing interest in the UK tech sector, Andreessen Horowitz is joining the ranks of elite Silicon Valley investors that have begun to look favourably at deals across the Atlantic.

In January, the US venture capital group made its first investment in a European company, putting $58m into TransferWise in a round that valued the London-based money transfer group at $1bn. Other Silicon Valley venture groups to invest in UK tech include Sequoia Capital, which has backed Songkick, the London-based concert listings start-up, and Skyscanner, the Edinburgh-based travel search engine.

Cambridge had enjoyed a "very impressive run lately", Mr Dixon said, pointing to DeepMind, an artificial intelligence start-up acquired by Google last year.

Improbable "is a company that had to exist outside Silicon Valley", Mr Dixon said, because in the US it would have been advised to focus on selling its software to large corporate clients. "They started doing gaming, then stumbled on the fact that the technology has all these opportunities outside gaming."

Watchdog to shine spotlight on 'dark pools'; Financial Conduct Authority

Business plan also puts fund fees, pensions and big data under scrutiny

The Financial Conduct Authority is to investigate " dark pools" - private trading venues that compete with exchanges - asset management fees, pensions and how insurers gather data on their customers, the watchdog said as it set out its business plan for the next financial year.

Dark pools have come under increasing scrutiny by US authorities as part of their investigations into high-frequency trading. UBS, for example, was fined earlier this year by the Securities and Exchange Commission over allegations that it failed to disclose information about order types for its dark pool.

As part of its to-do list for the next 12 months, the FCA said it would "continue to increase our knowledge of the conflicts of interest that may be inherent in the operation of dark pools and explore how firms are managing them".

Insurers' use of big data - where information on consumers, including from sources such as social media, is used by companies to predict behaviour - would also be the subject of a market study, the FCA said. "We will identify potential risks and benefits for consumers, including whether the use of big data creates barriers to access products or services. We will also examine the regulatory regime to ensure that it does not unduly constrain beneficial innovation in this area."

Such studies are used by regulators to ascertain whether markets are working well. In certain cases business lines can be shut down and products banned.

The asset-management sector will also come under more scrutiny. The watchdog said it would press ahead with a study into "charges paid by investors, and the factors that drive those charges".

The business plan serves as a useful barometer of regulatory concern. For the first time the FCA included its risk monitor, normally a separate document, and added financial crime to last year's list of concerns, stressing it would be tough on companies with lax controls against money-laundering and bribery.

"When combined with the increasing shift towards the criminalisation of corporate and senior management misconduct , it appears extremely likely that criminal prosecutions will only be on the increase within the financial services industry," said Michael Ruck, a former regulator now at law firm Pinsent Masons.

The 73,000 businesses regulated by the FCA will pay more for the privilege, seeing an 8 per cent fee rise over the next year as the watchdog said its annual funding requirement would rise to 481.6m. Staff costs and training, recruitment and travel will see particular rises.

Last year's business plan sparked controversy after a botched pre-briefing by the FCA to the Daily Telegraph on work it was planning around annuities caused shares in big life assurers to plummet.

The focus on whether consumers were getting a good deal on their pensions, whose reform has been a key policy for Chancellor George Osborne, would continue this year, the FCA said. Reforms give those aged over 55 freedom to take their pension savings as they wish and avoid having to buy an annuity .

"The business plan is set against the backdrop of the most fundamental changes to pension policy we have seen in over a generation," said Martin Wheatley, the FCA's chief executive.

Price fixing

Competition body eyes rise in criminal cases

The UK's competition watchdog pledged to crack down on cases of price fixing and vowed to bring as "many criminal cases as possible" over the next 12 months as part of its annual to-do list .

The Competition and Markets Authority said yesterday that enforcement - including bringing criminal cases and imposing civil penalties that can amount to 30 per cent of a worldwide turnover in a relevant market - was a priority, with 10 cases in the pipeline.

The CMA said it would report on its investigations into retail banking and the energy sector.

'Cadillac' Tax Imperils UAW's Health Benefits

By Christina Rogers

25 March 2015

Copyright  2015, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 

Detroit's negotiations this summer to reach a new four-year labor deal won't just be an argument about wages. Generous health-care benefits for about 135,000 unionized factory workers are at risk of being cut to prepare for the Affordable Care Act's "Cadillac" tax.

Health care has long been a fiercely protected benefit for United Auto Worker members, remaining generous even as the union has made other concessions. But the so-called Cadillac tax on companies with high-cost health plans is scheduled to take effect in 2018.

The law imposes a 40% excise tax on the annual cost of health care above $10,200 for individual coverage and $27,500 for family coverage. It is unclear how many UAW assembly workers have plans with costs exceeding those amounts, but industry officials say penalties could be significant.

The tax was created to help fund the health-care law, as well as discourage overly generous medical coverage that provided an unequal tax benefit and that could encourage overuse of health care. A Mercer LLC study conducted in 2014 estimated about one-third of employers in the U.S. say they will be hit with the tax in 2018 if no changes are made.

Unions and employers have been tussling over who will pick up the tab for new mandates, and it promises to be a point of tension as thousands of labor contracts are renegotiated over the next couple of years.

Negotiators for the Big Three auto makers are willing to be creative in lowering expenses, including potentially forming a shared private exchange that would let the companies better leverage their size to win lower costs, according to people familiar with the plan.

Health benefits were among the topics discussed at the union's quadrennial bargaining convention in Detroit Tuesday. UAW President Dennis Williams said it is premature to comment on benefits and other issues on the negotiating agenda.

Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles will spend in excess of $2 billion in medical cost coverage for hourly workers in 2015, or at least $14,800 per active worker, according to figures furnished by the auto makers.

To contain annual costs they may need to roll back benefits and increase cost sharing.

UAW members pay between 6% and 8% of their medical costs -- far less than what is typical for manufacturing employees. Chrysler estimates it is conceivable hourly worker medical costs will eventually exceed the equivalent of $16 an hour, or more than the entry-level wage, if they go unchecked.

The car makers in 2007 moved tens of billions of dollars in retiree obligations off their balance sheets into VEBA accounts, which work as independent trust funds managing money needed to pay future medical bills. The threat of getting slapped by the Cadillac tax is a big factor in bringing them back to the table on the issue.

The auto makers say medical costs must be addressed -- which means a fight is almost certain.

Mr. Williams is also dealing with discontent among members related to the roughly $9 gap between veteran factory workers and new hires. Altering a tiered wage structure is a top priority.

"This is a line in the sand for the UAW," Kristin Dziczek, a labor expert with the Center for Automotive Research, said. "The companies have done well over the past four years, so to go in and say 'we [workers] have to take on health care cuts' is going to be a hard sell."

The UAW's single-digit percentage share for medical costs is far below the 30% cost-share standard among Detroit's salaried workers. Truven Health Analytics estimates average cost shares for U.S. manufacturing workers is closer to 28%.

GM and Ford still carry a labor-cost disadvantage compared with nonunionized auto makers building cars in the U.S. Fiat Chrysler, while aligned with most nonunionized rivals on costs, has said it has no interest in returning to the days when it was uncompetitive in that area.

"The financial penalties associated with the Cadillac tax are significant and represent an incremental cost to the already high cost of employee health care," Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) said.

FCA estimates it will spend $611 million on health care in 2015 for UAW workers covered by the collective-bargaining contract. Ford in 2014 spent $700 million on the benefit, roughly equal to GM's costs.

Ford says the cost has grown 15% since the last contract was signed in 2011, and expenses will increase 25% by 2019. Fiat Chrysler says it pegs its annual inflation at 8% and says medical costs are unsustainable.

European groups map private route to growth; Trend for big fundraising rounds spreads from US, allowing ventures to fund expansion without having to float

Public investors are gearing up for an increase in private fundraising rounds by fast-growing European companies, following a trend in the US where big asset managers have participated in unlisted technology company fundraisings at blockbuster valuations.

Goldman Sachs has instructed Dan Martin , its head of European equity syndicate, to spend more time sourcing private fundraising deals. Asset managers, including BlackRock, also intend to make more investments in the continent's fast-growing private companies.

Late-stage financing is an increasingly well-trodden path in the the US tech sector, with companies such as Dropbox, the cloud storage venture, ride-hailing app Uber and messaging app Snapchat opting to raise hundreds of millions of dollars privately at high valuations without having to endure the scrutiny that comes with an initial public offering. Mutual funds and hedge funds are trying to get in on a game dominated by venture capitalists, as they come under pressure to get in early or miss out on a lot of the potential value appreciation.

According to Mr Martin: "We are looking for opportunities to help European issuers raise private financing from public market investors. This might be six to 18 months before an IPO or for private companies that plan to stay private."

This year, European start-ups including luxury online fashion retailer Farfetch, money transfer group TransferWise and music discovery app Shazam have all been given $1bn valuations from private fundraising rounds.

Spotify, the music streaming service, has hired Goldman Sachs to raise around $500m , which would value the Swedish music streaming company at as much as $8bn.

"We're seeing more unlisted European companies looking to do pre-IPO late-stage fundraising," says Greg Bennett , head of European, Middle East and Africa financing at Fidelity, which was early investor in Ocado, the online supermarket. "The number of deals we're seeing is increasing and has increased compared to 18 months ago."

In the US, Fidelity invested in Dropbox, BlackRock bought a stake in Uber, and Wellington Management, T. Rowe Price and Janus have taken part in private financing rounds .

Private valuation levels in some US technology companies have been so high that the recent IPOs of cloud storage company Box, New Relic - a data analytics business - and open-source software company Hortonworks, have all taken place at lower valuations than their last private rounds.

Despite greater interest in this area, the European market is still small compared with the US and remains constrained by a lack of supply of sizeable private companies in which to invest. In 2014, there was $2.2bn in late-stage fundraising in Europe, compared with $24bn in the US, according to PrivCo, a private company financial data provider. This year late-stage fundraising in Europe has raised $641m, compared with $3bn in the US. In both the US and Europe the average round size this year is $37m.

For companies, private fundraising can be attractive because it allows them to fund growth without having to go public. It is also a chance to start cultivating a loyal base of investors who may act as anchors in an IPO at a later stage.

Michael Lavelle , head of capital markets origination for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Citi, is seeing more appetite for private rounds of fundraising in Europe from public investors. "There's an increasingly blurred line between public and private investors. You don't need to just go to private equity investors to raise private financing," he says. "Long-only institutions and sovereign wealth funds have increasingly got private side cars."

This comes amid a buoyant environment for IPOs and rising European equity markets that have been boosted by quantitative easing. The Euro Stoxx 50 Index is up 17.7 per cent this year, while the FTSE 100 touched a new high for the first time since 1999.

"Pre-IPO private fundraising deals are usually a sign that the market is peaking," says one hedge fund manager.

A rival adds: "These deals always happen when markets are frothy."

Private deals are typically priced at a discount because investors want to be compensated for the lack of liquidity, less transparency and the execution risk of an IPO. Investors get an early look at companies and the chance to buy in at a price that may be substantially lower than a future float. However, that comes with the greater risk of backing companies that have not developed the full financial controls of public rivals.

In Europe, hedge funds such as Lansdowne Partners, Och-Ziff Capital Management, Marshall Wace, Polygon and Toscafund are investors in these private rounds of financing, according to bankers. In January 2014, Lansdowne and Toscafund injected 40m into challenger bank Aldermore, whose shares soared more than 10 per cent at its stock market debut earlier this month.

Some European investors are looking to get in even earlier in a company's life, particularly in sectors such as biosciences. Neil Woodford , founder of Woodford Investment Management, has backed unlisted companies including Atom Bank, the challenger lender, and online estate agent Purplebricks.com. He is a cornerstone investor in the coming IPO of Malin , a shell group that is raising about  300m to invest in young privately held life science assets.

Buying stakes in private companies pre-IPO was popular among European hedge funds before the financial crisis. However, some such as RAB Capital ran into trouble during 2008 when liquidity in the markets dried up and they were left holding unlisted positions that they were unable to sell. Many hedge funds have become more cautious about investing in private companies, choosing to conduct small trades or avoid them altogether.

WASHINGTON U.S. regulators added three foreign-owned banks to the list of big financial firms that haven't shown they can collapse without causing broader economic damage.

The Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. found shortcomings in the  living wills," or bankruptcy plans, of the U.S. units of BNP Paribas SA, HSBC Holdings PLC and Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC.

Alleged 'Spoofing' Trader Faces Suit

A prominent Chicago trader under investigation by regulators for allegedly manipulative trading is now accused of trying to silence a former partner, according to a federal lawsuit filed last week.

Igor Oystacher, a co-founder of proprietary trading firm 3Red Group, tried to keep former partner Edwin Johnson from speaking to regulators about Mr. Oystacher's alleged tactics, Mr. Johnson alleges in the lawsuit.

Mr. Johnson claims he was forced into signing a settlement agreement that was illegal because it precluded him from speaking with regulators about possible violations of law.

Mr. Oystacher's alleged "spoofing," a bluffing tactic used to manipulate the price of everything from stocks to bonds to futures, was the subject of an article in The Wall Street Journal last month.

Mr. Johnson, who describes himself as a former 10% owner of 3Red and former chief risk officer, said he was forced out of the firm in August 2013 after confronting Mr. Oystacher about "illegal 'spoofing' commodities trading," the lawsuit said.

A law firm representing 3Red said in a motion to dismiss an earlier civil lawsuit filed by Mr. Johnson against the law firm that the company terminated Mr. Johnson for "theft, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, embezzlement." In his federal suit, Mr. Johnson said those accusations were false.

When Mr. Johnson left 3Red, he and the firm signed a separation agreement under which Mr. Johnson would be paid a total of $450,000, disbursed monthly over two years. Payments would stop if 3Red or Mr. Oystacher were fined or banned from trading, according to a copy of the agreement filed in the separate case.

Mr. Johnson said in his federal suit that he signed the agreement "under duress" because he needed the money, and that the agreement was intended to "muzzle" him by requiring he not speak to regulators about the trading.

"Oystacher's conduct was plainly in retaliation for Johnson confronting Oystacher concerning his illegal trading and was designed to prevent Johnson from blowing the whistle on Oystacher to regulators," Mr. Johnson's lawsuit said.

The firm recently stopped paying Mr. Johnson and filed its own suit against him, alleging that he had violated the terms of the agreement.

Mr. Johnson is seeking damages from Mr. Oystacher and 3Red after being cut out of "millions of dollars," according to the suit filed last week.

"Mr. Johnson's lawsuit is frivolous, contains multiple false allegations, and will be dismissed by the court," Mr. Oystacher's attorney, Martin Carroll, said in a statement. Mr. Carroll said it is "readily apparent" that Mr. Johnson filed the suit in retaliation for 3Red's suit against Mr. Johnson.

Spoofing is an illegal bluffing tactic by which a trader sends orders to a market that they don't intend to trade in the hopes of tricking other traders into buying or selling a security or futures contract.

The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is investigating whether Mr. Oystacher broke securities laws or committed fraud, according to court documents and interviews with current and former associates of Mr. Oystacher. Several exchanges also investigated Mr. Oystacher's trading, according to court documents, exchange correspondence and interviews with his associates.

Mr. Oystacher's lawyer declined to discuss the spoofing allegations. In earlier correspondence from his clearing firm to one exchange, Mr. Oystacher was quoted as saying his trading is based on "analytics, statistical modeling and relative value theories."

The Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. attorney's office in Chicago also have made inquiries into the trading of 3Red, according to a person familiar with the inquiries.

The CFTC, FBI and U.S. attorney in Chicago declined to comment.

Mr. Oystacher was banned from trading by CME Group Inc. for the month of December after allegedly engaging in spoofing behavior. He didn't admit or deny any rule violations in the case. The CME declined to comment.

Mr. Johnson said in his lawsuit that he first became "concerned" about spoofing in mid and late 2012 after "several exchanges and other government agencies" began investigating Mr. Oystacher's trading behavior.

Mr. Oystacher "represented" to Mr. Johnson that the trading was "not 'spoofing' because Oystacher did not intend to cancel his bids/offers when he made them," the lawsuit said.

After discussions with the regulatory groups at exchanges about Mr. Oystacher's trading, Mr. Johnson believed that those representations were false and told Mr. Oystacher that his "trading practices were putting 3Red's business at risk," the lawsuit said. Soon after, Mr. Johnson was forced out of the firm, it said.

The settlement agreement between 3Red and Mr. Johnson is redacted in Mr. Johnson's suit.

However, the agreement was published in full in a separate lawsuit filed by Mr. Johnson against Gardiner, Koch, Weisberg and Wrona, a law firm that represented Mr. Johnson, Mr. Oystacher and 3Red.

The agreement, dated August 2013, said that Mr. Johnson would receive an initial $200,000 and another $250,000 paid in monthly installments until August 2015. The agreement said that if regulators fined Mr. Oystacher or 3Red $1 million or more, or if Mr. Oystacher was banned from trading for five months or longer, the payments would stop.

Exchanges and clearers miss out on market changes

Some fascinating points came out of the annual Oliver Wyman/Morgan Stanley survey of the wholesale and investment banking industry this week.

Its headline findings - that there's a liquidity risk in markets and most pronounced in fixed income - should come as no surprise. But its findings also gave the market infrastructure industry several points to chew on.

The most striking was a profound shift in market share from revenues in securities trading between 2006 and 2014. In that period, revenues at sellside investment banks had fallen 20 per cent to $55bn and turnover among asset managers had soared 45 per cent to $135bn. However, revenues at market infrastructure providers over that period had been flat.

Those numbers masked a near 10 per cent decline by 2010 but the rebound has been led by post-trade data and analytics, and technology.

The industry "is still searching for how to exploit the opportunity", said authors Christian Edelmann and Huw van Steenis - a fair conclusion given that the market doesn't quite know how to react to the depth and pace of regulatory-driven change.

US-mandated Swap Execution Facilities (Sefs) are yet to take off while the lack of standardisation in credit markets trading was likely to inhibit the development of electronic trading.

Second, what was most revealing about that was that paucity of options on offer for growth. Mr Edelmann and Mr van Steenis see the most potential for market infrastructure providers in collateral optimisation, with global custodians increasing their triparty repo business as a result of banks' more challenging liquidity.

Under a tri-party repo agreement, a third party, such as a clearing house or bank, sits between two counterparties as an agent, although it does not take on risk of the transaction. The partnership between Deutsche Brse's Clearstream and Intercontinental Exchange's ICE Clear Europe on a triparty margin collateral management service this week was the latest development in this area.

The study pointed out that there were opportunities in data and risk management and further outsourcing of business traditionally done by the bank. That would include know your customer services, trade affirmations, collateral management, reference data and analytics, which could be an incremental revenue stream of $3bn. It's a sizeable amount but hardly earth-shattering for a $100bn industry.

Clearing was also highlighted to be a relatively small (and static) part of the business and is a sobering counterpoint to a topic that has dominated industry talk for years. As the authors note, even if the amount of revenues from clearing doubles, it'll still be a small part of the total earnings for the industry.

The final point was the cumulative impact of steady and persistent low and flat global interest rates. Moving rates are usually viewed as an opportunity to speculate or hedge, so the low volatility and the reduced velocity, or frequency, of trading has hit the industry hard.

But it's also had one often forgotten effect - the role of net interest income in clearing houses' treasury operations. This is the difference between interest earned and interest. Clearing houses, especially in derivatives, make most of their money not from charging clearing fees but on the interest earned by placing funds posted to them by market participants in short-term money markets. Those gains are offset by payments of interest to clearing members for the deposits they have made.

With US interest rates likely to rise in coming months, don't be surprised if this revenue stream shows some signs of life in next year's survey.

INSIDE BUSINESS
Investments in the $1bn valuation club could pose dangers

Some unusual names have been appearing on the investor lists of up and coming private technology companies. Take a spate of investments made over the past week or so in companies that are in (or very close to joining) the $1bn valuation club - a group whose exclusivity has faded somewhat as its ranks have swollen.

Among the investors lining up in recent days have been: Wellington Management, a mutual funds group that took a lead in financing rounds for business intelligence company Birst and Zuora , the billings software firm; the family investment office of Swiss businessman Ernesto Bertarelli that led an investment in data-centre technology company SimpliVity; and business rivals Salesforce.com and Microsoft, which buried their differences to join a funding round for analytics company InsideSales.

Investors who normally limit themselves to the public stock markets have been among the most prominent newcomers to this game. Wellington, along with four other US funds groups - T Rowe Price, Fidelity, BlackRock and Janus Capital - participated in venture capital rounds that raised $4.7bn last year, according to CB Insights. That was nearly twice as much as the previous three years of tech-funding rounds combined.

These conventional funds groups have had little choice. In the US, the Jobs Act made it easier for companies to stay private for longer. And if Silicon Valley will not come to Wall Street, then Wall Street has to come to Silicon Valley.

An optimistic interpretation of this trend is that it is good for all concerned. Public investors get in on the ground floor of the next Googles or Facebooks, while the private companies get access to large amounts of capital and a gentle introduction to the rigours that will eventually come from a full initial public offering.

For example, Scott Dietzen , chief executive of Pure Storage, which has raised nearly $500m privately, says that his mutual fund investors are educating him about what life will be like when he has to run a public company. Brad Peters , founder of Birst, says that his company now holds public company-style quarterly earnings calls with investors. And Zuora boss Tien Tzuo , who calls his latest fundraising "a private IPO", says that having public market investors around forces a discipline that will stand him in good stead when he finally takes the plunge.

What is not clear yet, however, is how well the private markets will handle the quasi-public responsibilities they are taking on as they channel much larger amounts of money to businesses that could just as easily do an IPO.

Valuation is one very murky area. According to Mr Tzuo, public investors have been pushing for lower valuations to leave room for some upside - much as they would in a traditional IPO. But that push is not apparent from the soaring valuations being achieved in the late-stage private market.

Some tech IPOs have even been made at substantial discounts to private valuations, and companies such as Box and Hortonworks still trade below their earlier valuations in private fundraisings.

Investors in the private markets can often insulate themselves from losses in situations such as these by insisting on downside protection - which means they are handed more shares as compensation. But that makes a mockery of the stated valuations. Is a company really worth $1bn if the investors at that valuation have put a floor under their holdings? It also creates confusion for would-be employees who are offered stock awards to join the company - or, indeed, anyone else trying to work out what an up and coming company is really worth.

A second question is what happens when investment is channelled into private venues where the disciplines of the public markets are absent. Venture capitalist Bill Gurley has warned - loudly - of the heightened risks from backing companies that have not developed the full financial controls of public corporations.

There may also be deeper distortions to the capital markets. Access to private deals is highly restricted: only a handful of big investors have the influence to get in on the most sought-after financing. Most investors will be left in the cold, forcing them into lower-quality deals.

This runs counter to the principles on which public capital markets operate. But, in the absence of a more active IPO market, it is the reality many tech investors must face.

Mid-market watches: Functional, in vogue and unlikely to break the bank

So-called "affordable" luxury watch brands such as Coach and Michael Kors must manage a delicate balancing act. They target younger adults and are constantly expanding their ranges, but they must also offer prestige and quality.

These brands' watches often share features, for example, rose gold-toned or oversized silver-coloured cases and tortoise-shell faces are regular details. In many ways, the look is similar to that of luxury Swiss watch brands, but these watches are cheaper, usually costing about $300.

As well as offering lower prices than their luxury rivals, mid-market brands target young consumers through social media. Michael Kors, for example, has a strong presence on Tumblr, the short-form social network. Michael Kors, chief executive, even writes his own tweets, distinguishing them from the brand's main feed by signing off "xxMK".

Michael Kors declined to comment on its strategy, but its marketing activity suggests it is targeting young affluent adults.

Last month, the brand, which launched its first watch collection in 2006, published an online style guide to watches for young women, in which consumers learn how to select the right watch for social occasions, ranging from going out for ice-cream to meeting a boyfriend's parents.

Michael Kors was also the first brand to run an advert on Instagram. According to Totems, the Instagram marketing analytics platform, the brand gained nearly 34,000 followers in the 18 hours following publication of its sponsored image.

Coach, the US luxury leather goods and fashion brand, has also broadened its range to include watches in recent decades. The New York-based company began as a leather goods maker in 1941 and has expanded to include an extensive fashion and accessories range.

Greg Unis, global head of men's merchandising and licensing at Coach, says: "We introduced our first watch collection in 1996 as a licensee of Movado Group. Since then, the business has grown substantially. Watches now represent between 1 and 2 per cent of sales in our Coach stores. We also have a substantial wholesale watch business in more than 2,000 points of distribution."

Mr Unis says Coach sets out to give its watches a high-end feel at a reasonable price.

"The styles in the collection range from sport styles that capture current market trends, to modern luxury styles in round and tank styles. In the end, our watches blur the line between a functional timepiece and fashion jewellery."

-------------------------------------------

Brandmates: The allure of affordable glamour

Affordable luxury brands such as Michael Kors and Kate Spade can monetise brand equity by branching out into product categories such as watches, suggests Luca Solca, head of luxury goods at Exane BNP Paribas.

"These products are not sold on the back of the brand being a specialist or technically credible in that [category] - but on the back of the brand being very popular and cool," he says.

Non-specialist brands such as these, he says, tend to take two distinct approaches to their watches. The likes of Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Herms, for example, developed watches that were technically ambitious and distinctive, "typically associated with a rather ambitious price position." Others have focused on design and "a more compellingly lower price point".

Ultimately, he notes, today's affordable brands are no different from those of the past. "Today, it is Michael Kors and Kate Spade; yesterday, it was Armani and Cavalli."

Does the success of the affordable luxury brands in this category pose a threat to the Swiss watch brands?

Mr Solca thinks not. "I don't expect these forays to be a threat to Swiss specialists-even at the lower end."

He also notes that Swiss specialists have the advantage of leading on innovation, and have a stronger technical story to tell.

"Even Swatch, as the most compellingly low-priced brand in the Swatch Group, has come forward with System 51: a breakthrough innovative product, that no designer or leather brands would ever be in a position to offer," he says.

Real Estate Unit of Italy s Generali Planning Move into Asia; Push is part of group-wide expansion away from insurer s European roots

The real estate arm of Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali SpA is planning a big push into Asia as part of a group-wide expansion away from its European roots.

Generali Real Estate SpA currently holds nearly all of its  28 billion ($29.6 billion) property portfolio in Europe. But Chief Executive Officer Christian Delaire said it expects to eventually have 10% to 15% of the portfolio in Asian markets such as China and Indonesia.

 We're basically starting from scratch," Mr. Delaire said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. He declined to say how long it would take to reach the target in Asia.  It will not be too quickly, but our ambitions are high," he said.

Global property investors have increasingly moved into foreign markets, or new asset classes such as student housing, on the hunt for higher returns in a low interest rate environment. But while Asian investors have been quick to embrace Europe, movement the other way is far less common.

In the past 12 months, $2.4 billion flowed into Asian real-estate markets from Europe, data from Real Capital Analytics show. In the same period, data show $17.4 billion flowed into Europe from Asia.

The biggest European investors buying property in Asia are large insurers such as Prudential PLC in the U.K. and AXA Group in France, which already have insurance operations in the region. Generali's insurance business, the third largest in Europe, is looking to expand its business in Asia, Mr. Delaire said.

European insurers  are running global businesses anyway," said David Green-Morgan, global capital markets research director at broker JLL in Singapore.  It is much easier for them to deploy money to the Asia-Pacific region."

For the majority of European property investors Asia is less attractive than Europe, where real-estate prices are perceived to have room to grow amid a flood of capital from the European Central Bank's bond buying program, Mr. Green-Morgan said.

Generali Real Estate currently has 40% of its assets in Italy, and 57% in the rest of Europe. U.S. assets account for 1.5% of its portfolio, and Asia is less than 1%.

Generali Real Estate's previous acquisitions in Asia were purely aimed at supporting the wider group's insurance operations. For instance, three years ago Generali Real Estate purchased part of the Prosper Center in Beijing as offices for Generali China.

The firm has yet to close any deals in Asia under its new strategy, but  we're close to one or two," said Mr. Delaire, who joined as chief executive officer last April.

In addition to supporting the group's expanding insurance operations in Asia, the planned move will aim to diversify Generali Real Estate's exposure and help insulate it from any financial shocks, Mr. Delaire said.

Shocks to the increasingly global financial system are certain, and  diversifying will help smooth these problems along the way," he said.

Generali Real Estate hired Andy Tan, a former vice president at Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund, in December to oversee its Asian expansion from Singapore.

Generali also plans to increase its real estate exposure to the U.K., Spain and Poland. And it isn't ruling out future expansion into other markets such as the U.S., Mr. Delaire said.

Darktrace takes $18m investment on $80m valuation

Darktrace, the British cybersecurity company backed by the Mike Lynch, founder of UK software group Autonomy, has raised $18m on a valuation of $80m in a move designed to fuel ambitious plans to go global.

On Wednesday, the company said it had taken investment from Invoke Capital, Mr Lynch's venture fund that was one of Darktrace's first backers, Talis Capital, the UK private equity vehicle, Hoxton Ventures, a London-based venture fund, and other unnamed individuals.

The funding is a boost to the emerging UK cybersecurity industry, with Darktrace being the most prominent of a group of specialist start-ups to have emerged around Cambridge, with its history of mathematical excellence, and Cheltenham, home of GCHQ, the UK government's communications surveillance service.

Darktrace employs 70, which includes machine learning specialists from the University of Cambridge as well as cyber intelligence experts from GCHQ and MI5. The company said that it had developed systems that "protects companies from advanced cyber threats within their networks".

Nicole Eagan, Darktrace's chief executive, said the money would allow the company, which already has offices in Cambridge and Washington DC, to open bases in Singapore and Australia. This will allow it target corporate customers in the Asia-Pacific region and rapidly expand its employee base.

"Cybersecurity is clearly a global issue," she said. "If you look at the nature of cyber attacks, often times the initial threat may emerge halfway around the world and then jump over networks into a different system. Many of the customers we have, even in the UK and US, also have a presence in Asia."

Cybersecurity has become a key concern for many boardrooms in recent months, following a number of high-profile attacks. Ms Eagan said Darktrace had received interest from companies in Malaysia, Singapore, Japan and Hong Kong.

She added that Darktrace had no immediate plans to target customers in China, whose cybersecurity forces have been accused of conducted corporate espionage and cyber attacks on Western groups. But she said that selling to Chinese groups would be "something to consider in the future".

The company has 75 customers, including BT, the telecoms conglomerate, Virgin Trains, the rail company, and Drax, the British electric power group.

In 2013, Mr Lynch raised $1bn to create Invoke Capital, making it one of the largest specialist investors on the European tech scene.

Through his investing, Mr Lynch has attempted to rebuild his reputation, after his $11.1bn sale of Autonomy's to Hewlett-Packardended in acrimony.

In 2012, HP took a $8.8bn writedown on the acquisition, $5.5bn of which was down to accounting misrepresentations". HP has subsequently accused Mr Lynch of being "behind a massive fraud" at Autonomy, a claim that he has strenuously denied.

Private equity groups slide towards the exit; Investment companies: Buyout moves

Blackstone considers options for Center Parcs amid wave of potential sales by firms

If private equity is selling, beware of buying, goes one investing adage.

This year the market has been confronting an unusually large wave of buyout firms looking to exit investments.

Yesterday, Blackstone joined the fray. Center Parcs, the British leisure park operator that it has owned since 2006, announced it was considering options for the business.

Those options "may include private or public equity or debt capital markets", the company added. They summarise the three paths to an exit that have recently become available in abundance to private equity sellers.

Buyout firms can exit investments by listing companies they took private years earlier on the stock market, or selling them to buyers, including strategic bidders or other private equity firms.

Low interest rates mean that firms can also take some cash out of a company now, and prepare for a full exit later, through refinancing its debt on cheaper terms.

For Center Parcs the second option has already presented itself, showing the intensity of competition for the right asset.

The 2.5bn business has attracted interest from the European buyout firm CVC Capital Partners working with GIC, the Singaporean sovereign wealth fund.

If Blackstone successfully leaves the forested estates of Center Parcs in the coming months, it will be the latest in a string of private equity exits.

In the UK in recent months, KKR has snapped up thetrainline.com from Exponent just before the company was due to be listed on public markets, while Hellman & Friedman chose to offload Wood Mackenzie, the energy research consultancy, to Verisk Analytics for 1.85bn, having also considered a "dual track" initial public offering.

So far this year exits have already generated $63.5bn - a third more than in the same period last year, according to Dealogic.

This follows a strong 2014, when private equity firms reaped $428bn from selling assets, much more than the $308bn they sowed in fresh investments and the highest level since 2006, according to Preqin, a data provider.

The strong start this year partly reflects one large US deal announced this month - the sale by Permira, Blackstone, TGP Capital and Carlyle of Freescale to fellow semiconductor company NXP for $16.7bn.

But the re-emergence of Freescale shows why private equity firms are suddenly using the opportunity of cheap rates and high public market valuations to exit investments. The company, taken private in one of the large consortium deals that marked investing by private equity before the crisis, spent years valued at earnings multiples below the purchase price - until the rising value of its listed peers enabled a rethink.

In the past five years buyout groups have invested more cash - but at lower valuations - than the previous cycle.

Bernstein analysts estimate that the buyout industry invested $3.2tn between 2005 and 2008 in companies typically valued at more than eight times their earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.

Between 2009 and 2014 however, firms invested $3.7tn at 6.5 times - an indication that they took advantage of the post-crisis trough in valuations. Blackstone in particular deployed double the amount of its investors' capital between 2009 and 2014 versus the pre-crisis period - or $76bn to $35bn respectively, compared with $28bn and $35bn at its rival KKR.

But there may be a flipside to surging valuations. It is making it harder for private equity firms to buy assets and make reasonable future returns on the amount paid. According to Dealogic, the year so far has been the worst since 2002 for private equity firms acquiring assets. Ten is the new seven in earnings multiples, as buyout executives like to moan, but many are feeling pressure to put money to work anyway.

 Italy s Back?  Some Real-Estate Investors Skeptical; A major repricing of properties hasn t yet occurred

A sign saying  Italy's Back" greeted attendees at a lunch last week sponsored by the Italian real-estate industry at the international property conference, known by its French acronym Mipim, in Cannes, France.

As people sipped Italian wines and nibbled cured ham, Grissini breadsticks and chocolate Tiramisu, speakers listed steps the government has taken to improve the country's investment climate.  The time has come to go back to investing in Italy," said Paolo Buzzetti, president of the Italian National Association of Construction Companies.

Many of the investors attending the conference, however, said they remain wary of investing in Italy. A big concern: There hasn't been a major repricing of real-estate values in Italy such as occurred in Ireland and Spain because Italian banks still hold large amounts of bad real-estate loans on their books.

 There's been no market-clearing event," said Jeff Jacobson, global chief executive officer of Chicago-based LaSalle Investment Management, which has steered clear of buying property in Italy.  It's been more of a slow grind."

Conditions in Italy have improved a bit. In 2014, investors purchased  5.5 billion ($5.81 billion) worth of property, up from  5 billion in 2013, said data firm Real Capital Analytics. Active buyers recently have included Blackstone Group LP and AXA Real Estate Investment Managers.

 In Italy, we've done a lot. You can pick up some very good yields,  said Pierre Vaquier, chief executive at AXA Real Estate.  The market has been far less crowded [than Spain]."

Also, investors acknowledge that the Italian government has taken steps to make being a landlord more attractive in a legal system that is tenant-friendly. For example, when the total annual rent in commercial leases exceeds  250,000, tenants no longer have their traditional right to leave at any time, according to Alessandro Mazzanti, CBRE Group Inc.'s chief executive of Italy.

Sales volume is still a fraction of the  8.2 billion in Italian deals in 2007, and last year's increase was way below the overall sales increase for Europe, which has become a hot destination among global investors. European sales volume went up to a postcrash record volume of  222.4 billion in 2014 from  189.1 billion the previous year, according to Real Capital.

Investor appetite has been weaker in Italy partly because the country's economy continues to underperform the rest of Europe. Italy's economy didn't grow at all between the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2014, compared with a 0.3% growth rate for the rest of the eurozone in that period, according to the Bank of Italy.

At the same time, investors say many more changes need to be made in Italy's legal system. Developers say excessive red tape is discouraging them from attempting projects in Italy.

Investors especially criticize the country's court system, which makes it very difficult to foreclose on properties.  If I'm a borrower and I want to fight foreclosure, I can drag it out for years," said Mr. Jacobson of LaSalle.

Such obstacles are one reason banks have been slow to sell distressed loans, investors say. Buyers insist on a huge discount because it is so difficult to get their hands on properties even if borrowers aren't paying what they owe.

Carlo Calenda, Italy's deputy minister of economic development, who attended the Mipim conference, said in an interview that executives with U.S. private-equity funds have told him they expect a 15% discount for every year it takes to foreclose on a property. He said efforts are under way to streamline the foreclosure process and that the government plans  business decrees" later this year to reduce delays.

 This is the most important thing we should do," he said.  What is happening is you don't have turnover. The recycling of the economy is stuck."

Mr. Calenda said the current development-approval process is flawed. Government planners insist on being involved in the details of the planning process, he said. Instead they should tell developers the objective of their plans and let the developers figure out the details, he added.

For example, Mr. Calenda cited efforts by the government in Italy's Tuscany region to redevelop a historic building that would be perfect for a hotel. Planners insist that a buyer preserve the building's foyer but also want 20% of the space to be devoted to low-income housing, he said.

 It's a crazy way of presenting" a plan, said Mr. Calenda.  It's clear you will never attract capital in this way."

Instead, they should give a developer flexibility to convert the building into a hotel and develop housing somewhere else, he said.  Otherwise you will make a fantastic plan without any possibilities to implement that plan."

Frankfurt's Dax index holds 12,000 as Europe equities rise

Monday 14:25 GMT. US and Europeans stock markets are rising, with the European Central Bank's quantitative easing process offsetting wider worries about Greek debt talks and more hawkish monetary policy in the US.

The Xetra Dax 30 in Frankfurt is up 1.8 per cent at 12,111.29, breaking the 12,000-point mark for the first time. London's FTSE 100 is up 0.6 per cent and the international FTSE Eurofirst 300 is 0.7 per cent stronger.

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 is up 0.9 per cent and the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 1 per cent.

The mood is also being helped by a further pause in the dollar's long march higher. The euro is finding support around the $1.055 level, trading up 0.6 per cent at $1.0557. The dollar is generally easing, with the dollar index down 0.5 per cent at 99.881.

"Although US markets are buckling under the threat of a hawkish Fed, European equities appear to be able to shrug off all and any negative cues due to the ECB's dovish monetary policy," said Jonathan Sudaria at London Capital.

"As long as [ECB president] Mario Draghi is manning the printing presses, the bulls can take all this in their stride."

There are further falls for Brent crude, down another 1.2 per cent at $54.02 a barrel. Gold is up 0.3 per cent at $1,162.21 a troy ounce. Meanwhile, West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, took its fall into a fifth consecutive trading day, down 1.2 per cent to $44.30 a barrel, its weakest level since March 2009.

The rally on Europe's main indices follows gains on China's stock market, which touched a five-year high in an otherwise subdued trading environment.

The Shanghai Composite gained 2.2 per cent to 3,448.49, its highest close since August 2009. The benchmark has risen 5.9 per cent since January following a 37 per cent climb in the final three months of 2014, driven by a surge of trading volumes and retail account openings.

Though recent data from China have been disappointing, February figures last week showed that recent loosening of monetary policy had been effective in spurring banks to lend more. Many economists expect the People's Bank of China to continue easing, to counter slowing growth.

"Our economists think the time is ripe for further reserve requirement ratio cuts in China," said economists at ANZ, referring to the amount of money lenders must hold in reserve.

Over the weekend, stock market bulls were encouraged by Premier Li Keqiang's closing words at China's annual National People's Congress, where he suggested further steps could be taken to ensure China hits its growth target of "around 7 per cent".

Other Asian markets began the new week on a subdued note. Japan's Nikkei 225 average was flat, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng added 0.5 per cent.

In Australia the S&P/ASX 200 dropped 0.3 per cent, led by a 2.1 per cent decline for the energy sector. Oil-related stocks weighed on the market as the price of Brent fell.

Emerging market currencies weakened ahead of Tuesday's policy statement from the Federal Reserve. Economists anticipate the US central bank will tweak its language to indicate it will raise interest rates as soon as June.

Among the worst performers was the South Korean won, which fell 0.6 per cent against the dollar to Won1,137, its weakest since July 2013. The currency, which last week weakened 2.6 per cent after the country's central bank caught most forecasters off guard and cut interest rates, has fallen 12 per cent against the dollar since September.

Indonesia's rupiah shed 0.3 per cent against the dollar to Rp13,243, a new low going back to 1998. The nation's central bank meets on Tuesday and the majority of economists foresee it leaving policy on hold.

"Bank Indonesia is unlikely to be too concerned about the rupiah's recent depreciation, as the weaker currency will boost the struggling export sector," said economists at Moody'sAnalytics.

Corporate News: Want to Quit? Algorithms Alert Boss

Employers want to know who has one foot out the door.

As turnover becomes a bigger worry -- and expense -- in a tightening labor market, companies including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Credit Suisse Group AG and Box Inc. are analyzing a vast array of data points to determine who is likely to leave.

The idea, say people who run analytics teams, is to give managers early warning so they can take action before employees jump ship.

Corporate data crunchers play with dozens of factors, which may include job tenure, geography, performance reviews, employee surveys, communication patterns and even personality tests to identify flight risks, a term human-resources departments sometimes use for people likely to leave.

The data often reveal a complex picture of what motivates workers to stay -- and what causes them to look elsewhere.

At Box, a worker's pay or relationship with his boss matters far less than how connected the worker feels to his team, according to an analysis from human-resources analytics firm Culture Amp. At Credit Suisse, managers' performance and team size turn out to be surprisingly powerful influences, with a spike in attrition among employees working on large teams with low-rated managers.

Human-resources software company Ultimate Software Group Inc. has a product that assigns clients' employees, and even its own workers, individual "retention predictor" numbers, similar to a credit score, to indicate the likelihood that a worker will leave.

As the employment picture improves, companies are focusing more on retaining workers, largely because replacing them is costly. The median cost of turnover for most jobs is about 21% of an employee's annual salary, according to the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning think tank.

William Wolf, Credit Suisse's global head of talent acquisition and development, says a one-point reduction in unwanted attrition rates saves the bank $75 million to $100 million a year.

No single piece of data predicts whether an employee will stay or go, though many employers wish it were so. Data scientists create models to predict which workers might leave a company in the near future, combining a range of variables and testing the predictions over time.

"One of the things that people want to find is that one nugget, that key thing that correlates with someone leaving, but it is never that simple," says Thomas Daglis, a data scientist at Ultimate Software.

Employers may not mind that some employees are at risk of leaving, though companies stress that they are using the data to find ways to improve retention, and not nudge people out.

VoloMetrix Inc., which examines HR data as well as anonymized employee email and calendar data, found that it could predict flight risk up to a year in advance for employees who were spending less time interacting with certain colleagues or attending events beyond required meetings. And Ultimate Software found a correlation between a client's employees who waived their benefits coverage and those who left the company.

The big challenge for employers is what, exactly, to do with the information. Some aren't sure how to approach employees at risk of leaving.

"Our goal is to never say the only reason we are coming to talk to you is because an algorithm told us to do so," says John Callery, director of people analytics at AOL Inc., which recently started working with workforce analytics firm Visier Inc. on a program to help predict attrition down to the individual employee.

For the past three years, Credit Suisse has studied what happens to employees over time, including raises, promotions and life transitions, to predict whether they will choose to stay or leave the bank in the subsequent year. Changing jobs makes people "sticky," or likely to stay on, says Mr. Wolf, who oversees the bank's people analytics team. As recently as five years ago, fewer than half of open jobs at the bank were posted, and most went to outsiders.

About a year and a half ago, the bank launched a global effort allowing its workers to raise their hands for internal moves. Credit Suisse recruiters now post 80% of open jobs, and cold-call employees when jobs open up.

After observing that some who volunteered to be considered for internal moves ended up leaving for jobs elsewhere, bank recruiters began using attrition probability estimates in deciding which employees to target when positions opened up.

Some 300 people have been promoted through the internal program; many of those people, Mr. Wolf says, might have left otherwise. "We believe we've saved a number of them from taking jobs at other banks."

To kindle closeness among team members, and help forestall attrition, Box has encouraged managers to throw more social events, recognize team-based work and hold more mentoring meetings between senior leaders and newer employees.

Semiconductor maker Micron Technology Inc. is using data in its efforts to reduce turnover among first-year employees, who have about a 20% world-wide attrition rate, largely driven by manufacturing personnel.

Among its early findings, Micron discovered that workers were more likely to leave if they felt their job hadn't been accurately described when they were hired, so the company is trying to create clearer job descriptions. Micron also found that people who relocated for a job were more likely to leave, but it isn't sure why.

Sir, What is one supposed to make of the distinctly different takes on "value at risk" (VAR) in the March 11 edition of the FT?

In his article on the Comment page, " From the cricket pitch to politics, the big data bandwagon rolls on ", Iain Martin states that instead of encouraging a sensible attitude to risk the introduction of VAR provided bank executives with false assurance that helped create the conditions that led to the financial crisis. Yet in Patrick Jenkins' Inside Business article on the appointment of Tidjane Thiam (" Thiam is refreshing for Credit Suisse and also for banking in general ") we are told that "he is proud of the work he did as a McKinsey consultant installing JPMorgan's innovative value-at-risk financial control system".

As someone who worked in a financial institution and experienced the uncritical introduction of VAR and other big data metrics such as expected loss, I know where my sympathies lie.

The median cost of turnover for most jobs is about 21% of an employee's annual salary, according to the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning think tank.And it can cost, on average, some $3,341 to hire a new employee, according to the Society for Human Resource Management.

William Wolf, Credit Suisse's global head of talent acquisition and development, says a one-point reduction in unwanted attrition rates saves the bank $75 million to $100 million a year.

No single piece of data predicts whether an employee will stay or go, though many employers wish it were so. Data scientists create models to predict which workers might leave a company in the near future, combining a range of variables and testing the predictions over time. They might refine the calculations depending on which variables are most predictive for a given company or group of employees.

 One of the things that people want to find is that one nugget, that key thing that correlates with someone leaving, but it is never that simple," says Thomas Daglis, a data scientist at Ultimate Software.

Employers may not mind that some employees are at risk of leaving, though companies stress that they are using the data to find ways to improve retention, and not nudge people out.

Those caveats aside, data scientists who study retention say they have found some meaningful correlations.

VoloMetrix Inc., which examines HR data as well as anonymized employee email and calendar data, found that it could predict flight risk up to a year in advance for employees who were spending less time interacting with certain colleagues or attending events beyond required meetings. And Ultimate Software found a correlation between a client's employees who waived their benefits coverage and those who left the company.

 Our goal is to never say the only reason we are coming to talk to you is because an algorithm told us to do so," says John Callery, director of people analytics at AOL Inc., which recently started working with workforce analytics firm Visier Inc. on a program to help predict attrition down to the individual employee. Mr. Callery says it is too early to tell whether AOL's retention figures will improve, or by how much, since it takes at least a year to test a predictive model.

For the past three years, Credit Suisse has studied what happens to employees over time, including raises, promotions and life transitions, to predict whether they will choose to stay or leave the bank in the subsequent year. Changing jobs makes people  sticky," or likely to stay on, says Mr. Wolf, who oversees the bank's people analytics team.

Some 300 people have been promoted through the internal program; many of those people, Mr. Wolf says, might have left otherwise.  We believe we've saved a number of them from taking jobs at other banks."

Credit Suisse also used analytics to investigate why women with certain job titles left the company at higher rates than men, and determined that transitions whether a promotion or a personal milestone, such as a maternity leave increased the probability of a woman deciding to leave.

To kindle closeness among team members, and help forestall attrition, Box has encouraged managers to throw more social events, recognize team-based work and hold more mentoring meetings between senior leaders and newer employees. Since workers were more likely to leave if they didn't see clear career opportunities at the company, it has sought to improve at pointing out career possibilities for individual workers and encouraging  stretch" assignments.

Semiconductor maker Micron Technology Inc. is using data in its efforts to reduce turnover among first-year employees, who have about a 20% world-wide attrition rate, largely driven by manufacturing personnel.

Among its early findings, Micron discovered that workers were more likely to leave if they felt their job hadn't been accurately described when they were hired, so the company is trying to create clearer job descriptions. Micron also found that people who relocated for a job were more likely to leave, but it isn't sure why.

 It's very delicate how you approach things," says Timothy Long, the company's director of workforce analytics and systems.  The idea is to determine, what can we do to get [people] to stay?"

Companies also are trying to predict when workers might leave their positions, but not necessarily the company. Wal-Mart is trying to determine in advance which employees are likely to get promoted so that it can line up replacements more quickly. The company says it promotes some 160,000 to 170,000 people a year.

 If we can tell three months in advance [that a position is going to be open], we can start hiring and training people. You don't want the jobs vacant for that long a time," says Elpida Ormanidou, Wal-Mart's vice president of global people analytics.

U.S. Officials Pressed to Let Pregnant Women Enroll in Health-Law Plans at Any Time; Health-Care advocacy groups want pregnancy to be declared a  qualifying life event 

The Obama administration is under increasing pressure to allow uninsured women who become pregnant to obtain health coverage at any time of the year through the Affordable Care Act's federal exchange.

More than 50 House Democrats delivered a letter Thursday to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell calling for immediate guidance that would classify pregnancy as a  qualifying life event."

That designation would let uninsured women who become pregnant to sign up for coverage through HealthCare.gov within 60 days and outside the open-enrollment period.

More than 30 national health advocacy groups, including Families USA and Planned Parenthood, sent their own letter Thursday to HHS supporting the change. And over 50,000 people signed a petition endorsing the move that was delivered to the agency, according to the advocacy group Young Invincibles.

The letters and the petition mark the latest efforts to push HHS to change its rule. In a March 3 letter, 37 Senate Democrats urged Ms. Burwell to let pregnant women use HealthCare.gov to sign up for health care. The exchange's open-enrollment period is generally about three months long, and the latest ended Feb. 15.

 These women are forced to either forgo critical prenatal care or face significant out-of-pocket costs," the House Democrats' letter said.  Special enrollment periods currently exist for qualifying life events like the birth of a child or the adoption of a child. We believe pregnancy should trigger a similar special enrollment period."

In addition to a birth or adoption, other life events that trigger an enrollment period include moving to a new state, some changes in income and changes in family size, including marriage and divorce.

 The number of health advocates, members of Congress, and average Americans calling for this change highlights the importance of this issue and should inspire special urgency for the Department of Health and Human Services," Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D., N.J.), who spearheaded the House letter, said in a statement.

HHS said in regulations issued in February that it had no plans to allow a special enrollment period for women becoming pregnant. Federal officials said states could add such a period if they chose. The agency declined to comment further on Thursday.

Opponents of a special enrollment period for pregnant women, such as insurers, said that many women would forgo insurance until they become pregnant, potentially driving up premium costs.

 Health plans want to ensure women have access to the care that they need at all stages of their lives," said Clare Krusing, a spokeswoman for America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group.  But if individuals are incentivized only to sign up for coverage when they need care, then that has a significant impact on affordability for everyone."

In the U.S., about 4 million women give birth each year. Among women and newborns with employer-provided commercial health insurance, the average doctor and hospital bills for a vaginal birth totaled $32,093, according to a January 2013 study by Truven Health Analytics, a provider of health-care data and consulting services. The cost rose to $51,125 for a caesarean birth.

Changing the rules would largely help young women. Eighty-three percent of new mothers are between the ages of 18 and 34, according to a report by Young Invincibles.

The health law requires insurance plans sold on individual and small group markets to include maternity care as one of 10 essential benefits. But some women lack maternity coverage because their plan is exempt from providing the essential benefits.

Pregnant women who meet income eligibility requirements can obtain maternity care through Medicaid, the federal-state program for the poor.

The maverick name of Wood Mackenzie looks set to disappear from the Edinburghian business scene following the 1.85bn takeover of the energy consultancy. It could as easily have ended up with a stock market quote under the dual track sale gambit popular with private equity owners.

WoodMac, as everyone calls it, grew from a private client business into a midsized stockbroker expert in the ways of whisky and oil producers. Its acquisition by Hill Samuel in 1984 was the first in a bewildering series of ownership changes. Along the way WoodMac wisely got out of broking, finding a new market for its research among oil businesses themselves.

Investors evidently gave the raspberry to an initial public offering mooted by private equity owner Hellman & Friedman. There are easier propositions to market in the wake of a slump in oil prices. Just as well US data group Verisk Analytics was willing to pay a steep 17 times trailing earnings. The scarcity of private equity winners in such auctions is intriguing. Could it be that they now see the prices of their own wares as toppy?

Verisk buys WoodMac for push into energy data; General financial

Verisk Analytics is to buy Wood Mackenzie, the Scottish stockbroker that the North Sea oil boom four decades ago transformed into a global energy consultancy, from private equity ownership for 1.85bn.

The sale comes three years after Hellman & Friedman, the San Francisco-based private equity firm, bought its stake in WoodMac for 1.1bn.

Nasdaq-listed Verisk said the acquisition would help place it at the centre of analysing data in the energy industry, much as its products are already widely used in the ins urance sector.

Consultants such as WoodMac have also seen growing demand for their services as the oil and gas industry reconsiders big projects and operating costs after last year's price decline.

The purchase price values WoodMac at more than 17 times its 107m earnings before tax, interest, depreciation and amortisation last year. Verisk's own shares trade at 26 times its forecast earnings next year.

But it is less than the 2bn stock market listing that WoodMac had been contemplating in parallel to seeking bids from strategic buyers. McGraw Hill Financial, owner of the rating agency Standard & Poor's and the energy-price reporter Platt's, submitted a 1.5bn bid in competition with Verisk, the Financial Times reported last month.

Private equity firms have increasingly oscillated this year between listing the companies they are looking to exit or seeking bids from strategic buyers with reserves of cash to spend. Their tactics have been aided by the emollient valuations that public market investors are placing on companies.

Most recently Refresco Gerber, a Dutch soft-drinks bottler, chose to list in Amsterdam after a buyout bid battle.

On Monday Apax announced a 2bn-2.5bn IPO of Auto Trader, the UK's biggest car classifieds site, which itself had been a potential takeover target for Hellman & Friedman.

Private equity firms generated nearly $450bn from exiting investments in 2014, making it the best year in some time for buyout firms to reap gains on assets and return cash to investors. The trend may continue this year.

However, as those investors look to reinvest the cash back into new private equity funds, concerns are rising that this influx of money could weaken future returns by pushing up prices - especially as corporate buyers and public markets compete for the same assets.

BANGALORE, India Google Inc. is in early stages of negotiations to buy Indian mobile ad firm InMobi, a person familiar with the matter said, as the U.S. company looks to strengthen its presence in the mobile advertising space.

 Google has expressed interest and has reached out" but there is no certainty on whether the Indian company would sell itself, this person said.

Google declined to comment.

The Economic Times first reported the news.

InMobi, one of the biggest ad networks in India, offers advertising services on mobile websites based on the profiles and behaviors of users of those sites. The company has offices across 17 countries with more than 900 employees.

Founded in 2007 by a former McKinsey & Co. consultant, InMobi is backed by investors Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Sherpalo Ventures, SoftBank Corp. and is valued at $2.5 billion, according to a Dow Jones VentureSource analysis. InMobi makes money by charging 40% of the fee advertisers pay to mobile Internet sites. The company turned profitable for the first time in the December quarter last year.

A potential acquisition  would give Google an even stronger presence in the mobile ad space, since InMobi is not only a fast-growing competitor but has made significant traction in emerging markets," said Neha Dharia, a senior analyst with telecommunications consulting firm Ovum.

Ms. Dharia said Inmobi has a wide reach and a strong customer base and has been  innovating new ways to serve ads on mobile, and that technology would be of interest to Google."

InMobi's main challenge is to develop analytics technology that can better understand the behavior and profiles of mobile users that browse the Web and show them relevant ads.

Real-Estate Investors Owe ECB Gratitude

CANNES, France -- The crowds of real-estate executives gathered here on the Riviera this week for an annual conference had reason to celebrate even before they arrived.

On Monday, a day before the four-day MIPIM conference began, the European Central Bank started its aggressive bond-buying program known as quantitative easing. That was good news for the 21,000 investors, developers, brokers, architects, planners and others from 93 countries meeting along La Croisette, Cannes' beachfront promenade.

While there are still plenty of concerns in Cannes -- such as the violence in Ukraine and threat of economic upheaval in Greece -- the ECB's bond buying means the low interest rates that have fueled the sharp rise in deals and values across much of Europe will likely continue. Property is attractive to investors when rates are low because the cash flow from buildings is better than bond yields.

"Quantitative easing will only increase the amount of money coming in," said Scott Brown, chief executive of Hartford, Conn.-based Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers LLC, which expanded into Europe in 2010.

The year already is off to a good start after the market logged a postcrash record volume of property sales in 2014. In the first two months of 2015, investors purchased 26.5 billion euros ($28.3 billion) in European real estate, up from 25 billion euros in January and February last year, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics.

American investors in particular are on a buying spree thanks to the strong dollar. For example, in the biggest deal so far this year, Dallas-based private-equity firm Lone Star Funds purchased a portfolio of U.K. property from the Moorfield Group Ltd., a real-estate fund manager, for 1.27 billion euros, according to Real Capital.

New groups of Asian investors also are showing up in major European cities. In London, Chinese insurer Ping An purchased Tower Place and the headquarters of HSBC Holdings PLC was sold to a Qatari buyer.

Investors are bullish on European property partly because they think the economies of many European countries are poised for tentative recoveries and see opportunities to increase building occupancies, rents and cash flows. For example, CBRE Group Inc.'s asset-management arm is planning to buy about 4 billion euros of European property this year, up from 3 billion euros in 2014.

Another big topic of conversation in Cannes: Debt financing is becoming more plentiful. Stephen Renna, chief executive of the Commercial Real Estate Finance Council, has been moderating MIPIM panels since the early years of the bust and says borrowers are no longer bemoaning the "dearth of capital."

Of course, not everyone at MIPIM has voiced optimism. Reds SA, the development arm of Ellaktor SA, a large Greek construction company, was in Cannes partly to find investors for a proposed retail development on a former winery near Athens. But because of the political and economic uncertainty hanging over Greece, "people are postponing the conversation," said Romanos Savopoulos, a spokesman for Reds.

China Bailout Falls on Banks

A plan is taking shape to clean up the legacy debts of China's profligate local governments. For investors, it means some short-term pain in return for better long-term security.

China's leadership is considering bailing out some local government financing vehicles, which are essentially off-balance-sheet entities that provinces and towns use to get around restrictions on direct borrowing. Under the plan, some financing-vehicle debt, mostly loans from banks or shadow lenders, will be swapped for longer duration, lower-interest local government bonds.

The Ministry of Finance said it has submitted a proposal to the State Council to restructure an initial one trillion yuan tranche of debt ($159.7 billion). That is a small slice of total local government debt, which Societe Generale estimates has reached 25 trillion to 30 trillion yuan, but it shows the way forward.

Not all financing-vehicle debt would qualify. Beijing is currently conducting a debt audit, in which it will separate liabilities associated with public projects, such as schools and hospitals, which should get state guarantees, from projects with commercial returns, such as apartment complexes and subways. The latter wouldn't be eligible for the restructuring.

Much of the debt raised by the financing vehicles is of short duration and at high interest, so the swap could save local governments 400 billion to 500 billion yuan a year in debt servicing costs, according to the Ministry of Finance. In theory, it would also reduce moral hazard by clarifying which kinds of projects are eligible for government backstops and which aren't.

As with any bailout, however, someone pays. Banks that were ordered to support local governments during the stimulus years of 2009 and 2010 will receive lower-yielding government bonds in their place.

All told, a broader restructuring that goes beyond the initial tranche could reduce earnings at eight of the biggest Hong Kong-listed banks by 8% over two years, according to Bernstein analyst Wei Ho. That includes banks taking higher provisions on loans to projects that don't end up getting government guarantees.

Midsize lenders such as China Citic Bank and China Merchants Bank are especially exposed. On the positive side, the restructuring should improve bank capital ratios, as loans are reclassified as government bonds, which carry lower risk weightings.

For the broader economy, the plan, which deals with legacy debts, doesn't answer how local governments will fund new spending now that new borrowing by financing vehicles is banned. This could create an immediate fiscal squeeze equal to 4% to 5% of GDP, economists estimate. A slightly lower debt-financing bill by local governments will help, but not by much.

China's leaders figure it is worth the pain to get local governments on more sustainable footing. But with growth still slowing and the employment picture weakening, Beijing could hit a pain threshold fairly soon. Leniency with local governments, more stimulus from the center, or both will be needed to keep things comfortable.

The Apple Smartwatch: Paying for a Good Time

Apple's customers soon will know whether the company's new smartwatch was worth the wait. Investors will need to be more patient.

On Monday, the company hosted an event to whet appetites for the Apple Watch, which ships on April 24. The company also unveiled prices for the device, which will range, in the main, from $350 to more than $1,000. For die-hard fans there also will be a limited edition version made of gold priced from $10,000.

Those prices clear up a big question that has hung over Apple since it unveiled the smartwatch last September. Five years ago, Apple surprised everyone by launching its first iPad for $500 -- about half the price many had expected for the first mainstream tablet. The iPad went on to become Apple's second-best selling product line, but it also carried margins well below average. Apple's aim was to build up share in a rapidly growing market and it succeeded.

The company is playing a different game this time, positioning the Apple Watch more as a luxury item. Leaving aside the gold version, the two main models range from $349 to $1,099, with a median price tag above $700, depending on size and type of wristband. That is more than double the price that rival smartwatches usually fetch. J.P. Morgan Chase estimates profit margins on the Apple Watch will be around 39% to 44%, which would be among the highest in the company's product line.

Apple has never been a low-price leader, so this isn't a surprise. But it does complicate the outlook for the watch.

Unlike past products, the Apple Watch can only sell to a portion of the company's existing customer base, namely those owning an iPhone 5 or newer model. And unlike the iPhone, the watch won't have subsidies from wireless carriers to ease the sticker shock.

Previous attempts at smartwatches have failed to catch on, so the market is probably Apple's to lose. Strategy Analytics forecasts Apple will control more than half the global smartwatch market by year-end. But While Apple's dedicated fan base likely will ensure a good launch, it isn't clear how well a high-price timepiece will perform outside that group. Wall Street currently expects Apple's revenue to rise 20%, year over year, in the second half of the current fiscal year. That is typically when iPhone sales cool, so the Apple Watch will be important in helping to hit that target.

Beyond that, the watch's sales trajectory is tough to predict. A high price suggests buyers won't upgrade frequently. This was true for the iPad, which saw sales grow quickly in its first three years before leveling off. Wall Street expects Apple Watch revenue to be about $12 billion in fiscal 2016, the end of which is only about 18 months from now.

Apple's business will continue to depend on the iPhone for the foreseeable future. But the company's prestige rests also on its ability to create major new product categories. Appealing to a well-heeled niche of existing customers doesn't quite meet that aim.

Pru's Wells fields a perilous pass

Tidjane Thiam, chief executive of Prudential, has every reason for jubilation. A gruelling struggle had been rewarded with a notable triumph. His beloved Arsenal knocked Manchester United out of the FA Cup on Monday night. Oh, and by the way, he is getting a new job, too. The ambitious French-Ivorian will be the next chief executive of Credit Suisse.

It is a mistake to lead the same team for too long, he said, in a veiled dig at Arsenal boss Arsne Wenger. Mr Thiam was meanwhile alive to the innuendo that he has executed a "hospital pass" - in sporting parlance, passing the ball to a teammate set to collide with the opposition.

It is reasonable to harbour that suspicion when a chief executive chooses his own time to depart. More so when results are as sparkling as Prudential's 2014 numbers. Net cash remittances were 11 per cent higher at 1.48bn. In under just six years, Mr Thiam has delivered a shareholder return of 230 per cent by focusing on cash and Asia's growing middle class.

"There will be no low-hanging fruit left for a successor," said one insurance executive. Mike Wells, the boss credited with turning round Pru's US business, is expected to replace Mr Thiam. As an internal candidate his job will be to continue delivering on a plan formed by Mr Thiam and chairman Paul Manduca.

This will be both easier and harder than parachuting into the insurer as a troubleshooter. Easier, because no risky shake-up appears necessary. Harder, because that can breed complacency. The analogy is with Phil Clarke replacing Sir Terry Leahy at Tesco, or David Moyes succeeding Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford.

Mr Wells is unlikely to face a challenge to Pru's business model of the kind that tripped up Mr Clarke. Mr Thiam has tilted the group away from the long-term insurance that can incubate big liabilities. However, the stickiness or "persistency" of Asian customers may require scrutiny. New solvency standards could impose a greater drag than the City anticipates. And while growth in the Asian business slowed last year, in time its scale could revive pressure to split up the group.

Water pressure

The ruling from a local Chilean court that Antofagasta must destroy part of a waste dam wall at its Los Pelambres mine adds no more than a trickle to newsflow about the FTSE 100 miner, writes Alison Smith. The decision is just the latest episode in a saga over access to a stream by the town of Caimanes. Antofagasta is appealing and there are two higher levels that could overrule the junior court.

Yet Los Pelambres points to the pressure building up on miners in Chile from a drought that began in 2007. Some districts have recorded their driest January ever. This raises tension well beyond issues that usually arise because mines are water-intensive operations often operating in dry and remote areas where communities use the same water sources.

Alongside the court action are local protests that have cost Antofagasta 5,000 tonnes in lost production: not much in the context of more than 700,000 tonnes produced each year. Even allowing for more court costs, Tuesday's 5 per cent drop in the share price to 712.5p looks a shade overdone.

Los Pelambres could signal a change in the climate, as communities become readier to oppose operations they would previously have welcomed as a source of jobs. If so, then the risk and the cost profile of mining copper in Chile both increase. That would hit Antofagasta - but it would affect smaller rivals more. Beyond that, the dispute underscores scope for water rights to trigger conflict in a world increasingly short of the stuff.

Scotched

The maverick name of Wood Mackenzie looks set to disappear from the Edinburghian business scene following the 1.85bn takeover of the energy consultancy. It could as easily have ended up with a stock market quote under the dual track sale gambit popular with private equity owners.

WoodMac, as everyone calls it, grew from a private client business into a midsized stockbroker expert in the ways of whisky and oil producers. Its acquisition by Hill Samuel in 1984 was the first in a bewildering series of ownership changes. Along the way WoodMac wisely got out of broking, finding a new market for its research among oil businesses themselves.

Investors evidently gave the raspberry to an initial public offering mooted by private equity owner Hellman & Friedman. There are easier propositions to market in the wake of a slump in oil prices. Just as well US data group Verisk Analytics was willing to pay a steep 17 times trailing earnings. The scarcity of private equity winners in such auctions is intriguing. Could it be that they now see the prices of their own wares as toppy?

Economy
India s Industrial Activity Likely Slowed in January; Leading indicators point to a moderation in factory output

NEW DELHI India's industrial output growth likely slowed in January, a survey of economists showed.

Industrial production, which includes the output of factories, mines and utilities, likely rose 0.90% from a year earlier, according to the median estimate in a poll of 11 economists by The Wall Street Journal. That would be down from an expansion of 1.7% in December and 3.9% in November. The government is set to release the data Thursday.

 All leading indicators have been pointing towards an easing of factory activity," said Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at L&T Finance Holdings Ltd.

Numbers earlier this month showed output of India's eight key infrastructure industries, which together make up about 38% of industrial production, grew 1.8% in January, much weaker than a recent peak of 6.7% in November. A second month of decline in exports in January as well as a "http://www.wsj.com/articles/india-manufacturing-activity-at-5-month-low-in-february-1425282574" also point to weak industrial activity.

Some economists said they are particularly curious about the industrial production data out Thursday, after "http://www.wsj.com/articles/india-forecasts-gdp-growth-of-up-to-8-5-1425024900" showed the Indian economy in a much better position than previously thought.

 Revised GDP figures show a much higher pace of economic growth," Moody'sAnalytics said in a research note.  Industrial production data will be more closely scrutinized as a result."

As part of the revisions, the government brought forward the base year it uses to calculate GDP and adopted a new methodology of measuring output. The revisions resulted in a sharp increase in India's growth rate, placing it at odds with other indicators.

The government also made a similar change in the base year used in the consumer-price inflation measurement. It hasn't said when it would make those changes to the industrial output numbers.

LONDON Verisk Analytics Inc. on Tuesday said it would buy energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie for 1.85 billion ($2.8 billion) to boost its international operations.

The deal provides an exit for private-equity firm Hellman & Friedman, which acquired a majority stake in Wood Mackenzie in 2012 in a deal that valued the company at 1.1 billion.

For New Jersey-based Verisk, the acquisition of Wood Mackenzie will allow the data analysis firm to expand its product offering and build on its ambitions to grow internationally.

The company intends to finance the purchase through a combination of $2 billion in debt and up to $800 million in equity. The transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2015.

Stephen Halliday, Wood Mackenzie's chief executive, will continue to lead the business, reporting to Verisk's president and CEO, Scott Stephenson.

Wood Mackenzie's customer base includes more than 800 international and national energy and metals companies, financial institutions, and governments. The Edinburgh-based consultancy has about 1,000 staff in offices across the world.

Keywords: People Are Startups' 'Infrastructure'

By Christopher Mims

(Copyright (c) 2015, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

Silicon Valley of 2015 resembles nothing so much as the beloved Busytown children's books by Richard Scarry. I don't mean all the construction -- though there's plenty of that -- but in terms of what businesses companies are pursuing. In an industry built, like Google, on the strength of an algorithm, the ranks of the billion-dollar startup club are swelling with something altogether different -- companies predicated on the scale and power of their infrastructure. Here's the crazy part -- that infrastructure is made of people.

Uber, Lyft, AirBnB and companies like them are "the FedEx of the modern tech industry, if you think about FedEx as a massively complicated logistics organization that happens to get paid to deliver packages," says Scott Kupor, managing partner at venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.

It might seem specious to compare Uber with FedEx. One employs about 2,000 people, the other 162,000; one doesn't own a single vehicle while the other recorded $3.5 billion in capital expenditures last year. But that's the trick of what I call the New Infrastructure, and it's the reason Uber is valued, premarket, 80% as much as FedEx.

"We just reveal infrastructure that already exists," says Marc Gorlin, chief executive and founder of Roadie, a startup that aims to disrupt -- what else? -- FedEx. Roadie connects people who happen to be driving between two cities with people who have bulky or heavy items they need transported, the sort of thing FedEx and United Parcel Service can't handle and that courier services charge exorbitant rates to move.

It's this act of "revealing infrastructure" -- not the mislabeled "sharing economy" -- that is at the heart of startups such as Uber, AirBnB, Roadie and Instacart, which pays people to pick up and deliver your groceries. America is awash in able-bodied and underemployed young people, motor vehicles and, in the case of AirBnB, homes that are less than fully occupied. It's a combustible mix: Just add a coordinating mechanism, in this instance the always-connected pocket supercomputers known as smartphones, and what you get is a seemingly endless potential to put goods and labor to productive use.

"I think an area of tech that doesn't get talked about as much but is really important is just how many people these companies need," says Brian O'Malley, a partner at venture-capital firm Accel Partners. The New Infrastructure isn't fiber optics or cell towers or data centers -- though none of it could be built without that underlying kit.

And that's perhaps the most remarkable thing about this movement: For the first time in decades, billion-dollar startups are being built not on gains in productivity made possible by eliminating humans, but by their wholesale recruitment.

"This is a very popular meme today in the Valley: If you talk to aspiring entrepreneurs in accelerators or earlier, it's 'We want to be the Uber for something or the AirBnB for blank,' " says Chuck Ganapathi, the founder of Tactile, which makes software that helps salespeople do their jobs better.

The industries these aspiring entrepreneurs want to tackle tend to be things that haven't been touched by technology in a long time -- like the taxi industry -- and, unlike startups in the Valley days of yore, labor-intensive, whether it's cleaning houses or buying groceries.

Taking on these industries isn't for the faint of heart, however. At the core of all of these businesses is what's known as a two-sided market, in which companies must create markets for both labor (think Uber drivers) and customers.

Just getting one of these markets going can be daunting. "It's the 'cold start' problem," says John Horton, professor at NYU Stern and formerly the staff economist at oDesk, a site that pairs freelancers with employers. "In general, no one wants to come to your market if you don't have the other side of the market," he adds.

In its early days, AirBnB created a market by tapping into an existing one, letting would-be landlords cross-post their listings to Craigslist. Mr. Gorlin, founder of Roadie, says that a year before he launched his app, he started a field-marketing effort at college-football bowl games, just so people would be familiar with his brand.

Once the two-sided market at the heart of these New Infrastructure companies is in motion, with enough supply to feed demand and vice versa, balancing these markets is no less challenging. It's both a problem for predictive analytics and behavioral economics, requiring a mix of data science and incentives.

"The way we think about this internally at Instacart is this is really a machine learning problem," says Apoorva Mehta, CEO of Instacart. "We have models running at all times of day to predict how many shoppers are needed at any time of day, anywhere."

All two-sided markets also need the ability to shape both demand and supply. Uber talks often about its use of surge pricing to get more drivers on the road, but Mr. Mehta says that raising prices is also a way to damp demand, persuading customers to buy at times when more shoppers are available.

The jobs created by the New Infrastructure are often derided as being insecure and potentially ill-paying -- what's known as the 1099 economy, after the U.S. tax form freelancers file. We live in a time when shrinking unemployment hasn't led to increasing wages, so it's worth asking just what kind of jobs these companies are creating.

Investing in Funds & ETFS: A Monthly Analysis --- Investing for Retirement: Fears About 'Target' Funds --- They are gobbling up retirement-plan assets, but some experts worry that investors don't understand them as well as they should

Retirement-plan investors often aren't sure how to allocate the money they're socking away in their 401(k) accounts. So the rise of target-date funds -- which automatically shift investors' money from stocks to fixed income gradually over the years -- has been widely heralded as a victory for the country's retirement readiness.

Indeed, many employer-sponsored retirement plans now use target-date funds as their default option when employees are automatically enrolled. Target-date funds are expected to hold about 35% of total 401(k) assets by 2019, up from 13.5% in 2013, according to Cerulli Associates, a research firm based in Boston.

But is this really a good thing?

Not necessarily, say some observers, who worry that some investors who don't fully understand these funds might take on more risk than they want.

The target-date approach was tested in the 2008 financial crisis, and many investors were surprised by the declines in their funds. For example, funds with a 2010 target date lost 30% on average in 2008, with losses ranging as high as 41%, Securities and Exchange Commission member Luis A. Aguilar said in a speech to a retirement-planning summit in Washington last month.

"What we saw in 2008 is that they're not infallible," says analyst Kathryn Spica at fund tracker Morningstar Inc., speaking of the funds.

That experience should have served as a wake-up call for investors, Mr. Aguilar said.

"The relentless growth in target-date funds is troubling because studies have shown that investors and industry professionals alike do not fully appreciate the risk these funds present," Mr. Aguilar said. He cited as one example a 2012 study, sponsored by the SEC, on investors' understanding of target-date funds. It found only 36% of respondents were aware that these funds don't provide guaranteed income after retirement.

Joe Nagengast, a partner at consulting firm Target Date Analytics LLC, points to another concern. He says investors should be aware that target-date funds can have confusing names.

For instance, a fund labeled 2040 might not complete the shift in its portfolio toward more-conservative investments until 2045 or 2050, Mr. Nagengast says. That extended "glide path" could leave some investors more exposed to risk than they would like at the time of their retirement, he says.

Proponents say target-date funds keep investors on track, preventing overreactions to market volatility. And, some argue, while target-date funds aren't immune to declines, their ability to recover rapidly from downturns means they remain a good deal for investors.

A report published in September by Charles Schwab Corp., which manages several target-date funds, said funds with end dates of 2010 and 2040 both performed well after the 2008 financial crisis. "Most of them recovered their full principal by 2010, before the S&P 500 itself recovered," says Jake Gilliam, the report's author, a senior portfolio manager at Charles Schwab Investment Management in Cleveland.

The Schwab report says that on average, $100,000 in a fund at the end of 2007 with a retirement target between 2036 and 2040 -- aimed at younger investors, who have many years until retirement -- would have become $123,327 by the end of 2013. For a fund with a 2000 to 2010 retirement date, $100,000 at the end of 2007 would have become $125,833 on average by the end of 2013, Schwab says.

Still, it's important for investors to make an informed decision about whether to invest their 401(k) money in a target-date fund or in other options.

The first step in evaluating a target-date fund, Morningstar's Ms. Spica says, is to check the prospectus to determine the glide path -- the changes in allocations over time -- to make sure the fund is taking an amount of risk over the years that the investor is comfortable with.

Investors should be aware that target-date funds take one of two basic approaches: The "to retirement" funds finish their allocation changes by the investor's projected retirement date, while "through retirement" funds continue to switch from stocks into fixed income until a later date, often at age 72, says Erik Daley, managing principal at Multnomah Group, a consulting firm for retirement plans. Knowing which of those approaches a fund takes is crucial in deciding whether it matches an investor's risk tolerance.

As with any fund, investors should also be aware of fees. The largest providers of target-date funds -- T. Rowe Price Group, Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group -- all offer low-fee funds, either actively managed or passive and index-based, Ms. Spica says. Investors should seek out funds with expense ratios below the average, which was 0.84% for target-date funds at the end of 2013, she says.

Typically, 401(k) plans offer a series of target-date funds from the same fund company, so investors who can't find one with low fees and their preferred risk profile might prefer to do things the old-fashioned way -- invest in the stock and bond funds their plan offers and commit to doing the rebalancing in the years ahead themselves.

Real Estate
Greystar to Buy U.K. Student-Housing Portfolio; Deal highlights growing interest in small corner of property market

International investors are piling into U.K. student housing, with a flurry of deals showing renewed interest in this small corner of the property market.

Greystar Real Estate Partners of the U.S. has agreed to buy a student-housing portfolio for about 600 million ($915 million) from U.K. private-equity group Round Hill Capital LLC, a person familiar with the deal said.

Last week, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board spent 1.1 billion to acquire the U.K.'s Liberty Living, while a company headed by Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman paid 532 million for another London student-housing portfolio.

Yields on office buildings and other traditional property types have fallen as investors flush with cash and able to borrow at low rates have pushed prices higher. That has some investors looking elsewhere for higher returns.

Traditionally, real-estate investing  has been focused around the main commercial property types of retail, office, and industrial," a February report from the Investment Property Forum, a U.K. industry body, said.

But investors' hunt for higher long-term returns is producing  significant changes in the market," said Jon Neale, head of U.K. research at broker JLL. The fastest-growing sectors are now those deemed  alternatives" like student-housing, hotels, health care and privately rented residential real estate 11.6 billion of which traded in 2014, a 33% increase from 2013, JLL figures show.

It remains a small part of the 65 billion of U.K. real estate traded last year, but alternatives  accounted for only a few percentage points of volumes just a few years ago," Mr. Neale said.

For U.K. student accommodation, the average investment yield has been 5.8% this year, compared with 5.1% on offices, according to Real Capital Analytics data.

The yield on student housing is down from 6.4% last year, a reflection of rising prices.

There were about $2.4 billion of student housing transactions in the U.K. in 2014, down 18% from 2013, according to Real Capital Analytics. U.S. firms Greystar, LaSalle Investment and Goldman Sachs have been among the biggest buyers in the last two years, the data show.

Last Friday, the Canadian Pension Plan bought 16,700 student rooms in over 40 residences across 17 cities as well as the company that manages the business from the Brandeaux Student Accommodation Fund.

This was the Canadian investor's largest-ever real-estate deal in Europe, and its first there in the alternative space, said Andrea Orlandi, head of European real-estate investments.

For CPP, student accommodation provides  a noticeable pickup in the yield" offered by office investments, Mr. Orlandi said.

The opportunity to buy the management company and its team means,  we can look to buy more assets" in a sector  that can, and will, consolidate in the future," he said.

The U.K. has long been a destination for foreign students looking to study at one of the renowned universities, or simply improve their English. London in particular is a magnet for foreign students.

Last Tuesday, Carlyle Group sold Pure Student Living with 2,170 student rooms across five central London sites to a Luxembourg-based investment vehicle called LetterOne Treasury Services, led by Mr. Fridman.

The deal saw Carlyle exit from U.K. student accommodation after a five-year run. But the U.S. investor  remains committed to student housing as a long-term institutional asset class," the firm said in a statement, noting it still has over 1,700 rooms in the Netherlands managed under The Student Hotel brand.

In the Greystar deal Monday, Round Hill is selling three London residences with 2,375 beds, a portfolio it bought for $415 million from Blackstone Group in 2012. Round Hill will retain the student-housing brand Nido, its management business and one student residence in London it bought earlier this year.

For a fund with a 2000 to 2010 retirement date, $100,000 at the end of 2007 would have become $125,833 on average by the end of 2013, Schwab says.

Making a Choice

Still, it's important for investors to make an informed decision about whether to invest their 401(k) money in a target-date fund or in other options.

The first step in evaluating a target-date fund, Morningstar's Ms. Spica says, is to check the prospectus to determine the glide path the changes in allocations over time to make sure the fund is taking an amount of risk over the years that the investor is comfortable with.

Investors should be aware that target-date funds take one of two basic approaches: The  to retirement" funds finish their allocation changes by the investor's projected retirement date, while  through retirement" funds continue to switch from stocks into fixed income until a later date, often at age 72, says Erik Daley, managing principal at Multnomah Group, a consulting firm for retirement plans. Knowing which of those approaches a fund takes is crucial in deciding whether it matches an investor's risk tolerance.

As with any fund, investors should also be aware of fees. The largest providers of target-date funds T. Rowe Price Group, Fidelity Investments and Vanguard Group all offer low-fee funds, either actively managed or passive and index-based, Ms. Spica says. Investors should seek out funds with expense ratios below the average, which was 0.84% for target-date funds at the end of 2013, she says.

Typically, 401(k) plans offer a series of target-date funds from the same fund company, so investors who can't find one with low fees and their preferred risk profile might prefer to do things the old-fashioned way invest in the stock and bond funds their plan offers and commit to doing the rebalancing in the years ahead themselves.

Basketball's labour market; Let s make a deal

BUYING a basketball team used to be the final step to the top of a mid-size city';s establishment. "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herb_Kohl" grew up in Milwaukee, joined the army as a reserve, inherited a chain of grocery stores and in 1989 became a United States senator. It was only fitting that such a civic pillar acquire the Milwaukee Bucks, which he owned from 1985-2014. Similarly, "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Taylor" hails from a farm in south-western Minnesota. In 1975 he bought a local business that made wedding invitations, and built it up into one of America';s largest printing companies. He later rose to become minority leader in the state senate, making him a logical candidate to buy the Minnesota Timberwolves when they came up for sale in 1994.

 Cementing his role as a custodian of Minneapolis';s for-profit public trusts, he picked up the recently bankrupt Star-Tribune newspaper for $100m in 2014.

Such owners are now an endangered species in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The new breed is personified by Mark Rachesky, the head of a $6 billion "http://www.mhrfund.com" that specialises in distressed investments, who was identified on March 4th as a possible "http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/id/12419889/lionsgate-entertainment-chairman-mark-rachesky-bid-atlanta-hawks" for the Atlanta Hawks. During the past five years, 11 of the league';s 30 teams have changed hands; two more deals (of the "http://www.economist.com/blogs/gametheory/2014/09/race-relations-basketball" and the Brooklyn Nets) are currently in process. Whereas the sellers (including Mr Kohl) have tended to come from sedate industries that held on to assets for the long term, like community banking and real estate, the new buyers have hailed primarily from  disruptive  fields like private equity, hedge funds, information technology and venture capital, where overnight change and rapid turnover in a company';s holdings are the norm. And as takeover artists from Wall Street and Silicon Valley have set their sights on the NBA, they have transformed the league';s rigid labour market into a version of the freewheeling casino environments where they made their fortunes.

The NBA does not make it easy for players to change teams. Unlike European football clubs, which are free to buy and sell talent at will, the major American sports all ban significant cash transactions, requiring their franchises to make trades instead. (Despite America';s free-market ideology, its sports leagues are among the world';s most regulated and egalitarian. In 1976 Major League Baseball (MLB) set a low limit on the cash teams could exchange to stop a club from "http://athletics.scout.com/story/655697-oakland-a-s-history-finley-attemps-fire-sale", and the other sports soon followed suit.) Some leagues still allow enough loopholes to facilitate a vibrant barter economy: for example, MLB teams are free to pay any portion of the salary of a player being traded. But the NBA has further dried up liquidity by imposing a "http://www.cbafaq.com/salarycap.htm", which require potential trading partners to align their assets in both financial and athletic terms. Faced with such obstacles, cautious, by-the-book general managers (GMs) threw up their hands: it was not until 1996 that the number of players swapped at the annual February trade deadline first reached double digits (see chart).

In recent years, however, GMs have rapidly thrown off these shackles. At this year';s deadline on February 19th, the rights to a whopping 43 players (including four currently overseas) switched teams. That sum accounts for nearly 10% of the entire league, and represented almost a 50% increase on the prior maximum of 29 set in 2005. In addition, 14 future picks in the NBA';s annual draft of incoming players also changed hands, compared with eight last year a figure that, according to David Corby of "http://www.basketball-reference.com", is also probably the highest ever. Of the 11 deals made on deadline day, four involved three different clubs. This dizzying carousel proved overwhelming both for professional NBA reporters  my brain is shredded right now , Marc Stein of ESPN"http://espn.go.com/nba/story/_/page/tradetracker/nba-trade-tracker-2015" on the air and for players themselves.  Just over here sitting in the wind,  "https://twitter.com/Jarrettjack03/status/568473055934091264""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarrett_Jack" of the Nets as he waited to learn his fate.

The magnitude of this short-term spike in activity was partially due to the league';s current "http://www.economist.com/blogs/gametheory/2013/12/competitive-balance-basketball". The NBA is split into eastern and western conferences, which each send their best eight teams to the playoffs. In recent years an unprecedented skills gap has opened up between the conferences, causing unusually high parity within them: most teams in the west are very good, and have to duke it out with other strong teams to make the postseason, whereas most teams in the east are pretty bad, and get to spar with similarly weak rivals to secure an undeserved playoff spot. As a result, many more clubs have a credible shot at the postseason than the historical average, increasing uncertainty about who will make it and where they will be seeded. In turn, that means that even a small tweak to a roster can be the difference between a shot at June glory or going home early. That gave GMs far more reason to hunt for trades.

Before too long, however, the pendulum will presumably shift back towards the east among other reasons, superstars will always want to play in New York, no matter how grossly mismanaged the Big Apple';s teams are. Nonetheless, frenetic trade deadlines are probably here to stay. The more durable factor underlying the league';s increased liquidity is the replacement of Mr Kohl';s generation of owners by the likes of Mr Rachevsky.

In recent years a handful of overlapping trends have caused a massive overhaul of the league';s ownership fraternity. First, the statistical revolution in baseball, memorably chronicled in Michael Lewis';s 2003 book  Moneyball , showed that sports teams could use Wall Street-inspired analytical wizardry to win games and make money. At the same time, television networks'; demand for "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_video_recorder"-proof programming drove franchise sale prices towards the billions of dollars rather than the mere hundreds of millions, making them attractive investments to richer and savvier potential owners. Finally, a disproportionate share of the fortunes minted over the past 20 years have emerged from the finance and technology industries. In turn, these owners have hired like-minded executives with technical backgrounds and a penchant for wheeling and dealing. And the new wave of GMs tend to see the NBA';s convoluted rules not as a straitjacket but as an opportunity for  "http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regulatory-arbitrage.asp" .

This trend probably began in earnest in 2002, when two private-equity magnates bought the Boston Celtics and hired Danny Ainge, an analytically minded former player, as GM. Mr Ainge quickly dispensed with the conventional wisdom that building a winner required finding players whose skills would complement each other. Instead, he recognised that in order to win in a superstar-driven league like the NBA, one first had to acquire the superstars, and only then worry about surrounding them with appropriate role players. Mr Ainge then set about accumulating as many tradeable properties primarily future draft picks and young players who were underpaid for their skills as he could in the hope of swapping them later for elite talent, regardless of how well they fit into Boston';s existing roster. The resulting teams were awkwardly constructed: they spent a few years in purgatory, and in 2006-07 won just 29% of their games. But Mr Ainge';s plan came to fruition when he was able to exchange his hoard for "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Allen" and Kevin Garnett, two disgruntled stars stuck on bad teams. The Celtics won the championship the very next season.

Mr Ainge';s success has spawned hordes of imitators: today, the phrase  stockpiling assets  has become an NBA clich. In 2007 "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Alexander_%28businessman%29", a bond trader and the owner of the Houston Rockets, hired as his GM Daryl Morey, a protg of Mr Ainge';s. Mr Morey soon emerged as the face of the league';s burgeoning quantitative analytics movement when Mr Lewis featured him in a "http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/15/magazine/15Battier-t.html?pagewanted=all". True to form, the GM spent years preparing his franchise to make moves for two superstars, "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Harden" (who arrived in a trade) and "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwight_Howard" (signed as a free agent). Although the Rockets currently have the third-best record in the crowded western conference, Mr Morey never rests: he made two more trades on deadline day.

The Wall Street-isation of the league has now become unmistakable. Half of the teams that dealt at the trade deadline have owners who came from high finance or Silicon Valley. Mr Morey says he believes the advent of advanced analytics has directly led to greater liquidity, by providing teams a consistent measuring stick for valuing players and draft picks and thus making it more likely they can agree to terms.

In the financial markets where so many of the new owners cut their teeth, extreme liquidity can be a curse as well as a blessing. When the number of counterparties seems infinite, traders are free to concoct ever-more-complex schemes involving ever-greater leverage which create an ever-bigger threat of systemic collapse whenever one node in this interconnected network (such as Lehman Brothers) fails. Similarly, emerging markets have long been vulnerable to rapid reversals in flows of speculative  hot money  from abroad, which can send their economies into free-fall faster than policymakers can react. A similar argument can be made to an extent about sports: fans build loyalty in part by following home-grown stars for their bulk of their careers. A league where they have to reacquaint themselves with a new cast of characters every few months could make supporting the local team feel too much like  "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WSD6Y2YWj4" , as Jerry Seinfeld memorably put it. In fact, the NBA has instituted a series of provisions, such as  "http://www.hoopsrumors.com/2013/05/bird-rights.html" , intended explicitly to encourage players to re-sign with their current teams rather than switch jerseys.

But there are also powerful arguments to be made in favour of a free-trading NBA. First, trades are a surefire way to drum up fan interest: sports blogs and Twitter virtually exploded with activity ahead of this year';s hyperactive deadline. Moreover, additional liquidity is also likely to improve overall play and thus the quality of the spectacle provided for fans. Unlike, say, baseball, which is primarily a sequence of individual confrontations, basketball is the consummate team sport and thus a game of positive and negative externalities. Certain combinations of players (such as, say,  "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stockton" to "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Malone" ) create wholes that are greater than the sum of the parts; others, like the "http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/2013.html" or the "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_at_the_2004_Summer_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_tournament", suffered from  too many cooks in the kitchen  and performed far below expectations. On one hand, providing clubs more flexibility will probably lead to more  asset-stockpiling  clunkers like the mid-2000s Celtics. But on the other, it means that once clubs secure their stars, they will have an easier time surrounding them with optimally complementary talent.

Similarly, a more liquid market should shorten the time that hapless teams are stuck in the cellar. In a league where trading is difficult, losing franchises can remain bad for years on end, until they manage to draft enough amateur talent to regain competitiveness. In contrast, a wheeler-dealer league permits GMs to zip around the  success cycle  with pinpoint precision. If a club thinks it is on the brink of contention and its immediate rivals are on the downswing, it can  go all in  and swap a bunch of future draft picks for a star on a struggling franchise; conversely, a team that sees its window of opportunity closing can hold a  fire sale  and hope to rebuild in two years rather than five or six. This should help prevent decade-long stretches of futility that can permanently damage a fan base.

It';s easy to bemoan the  "http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/28/opinion/28wolfe.html"  extending their tentacles into ever-more-remote territory particularly when their crosshairs centre on sports teams with emotional resonance for millions of fans. As Zach Lowe of Grantland "http://grantland.com/the-triangle/k-j-mcdaniels-sixers-non-guaranteed-contracts", the modern NBA is  a world in which players are more accounting chips than people &They are  assets'; and  trade chips'; and  movable pieces.';  But just because they made a hash of the global economy a few years ago doesn';t mean they';re poised to do the same with basketball. With all due credit to upstanding statesmen like Mr Kohl and his ilk, fans should greet these "http://www.amazon.com/Barbarians-Gate-The-Fall-Nabisco-ebook/dp/B000FC10QG" with flowers, not pitchforks.

Global Finance: Greystar Buys U.K. Portfolio --- The $915 million deal is the latest in a string of transactions in U.K. student housing

International investors are piling into U.K. student housing, with a flurry of deals showing renewed interest in this small corner of the property market.

Greystar Real Estate Partners of the U.S. has agreed to buy a student-housing portfolio for about GBP 600 million ($915 million) from U.K. private-equity group Round Hill Capital LLC, a person familiar with the deal said.

Last week, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board spent GBP 1.1 billion to acquire the U.K.'s Liberty Living, while a company headed by Russian oligarch Mikhail Fridman paid GBP 532 million for another London student-housing portfolio.

Yields on office buildings and other traditional property types have fallen as investors flush with cash and able to borrow at low rates have pushed prices higher. That has some investors looking elsewhere for higher returns.

Traditionally, real-estate investing "has been focused around the main commercial property types of retail, office, and industrial," a February report from the Investment Property Forum, a U.K. industry body, said.

But investors' hunt for higher long-term returns is producing "significant changes in the market," said Jon Neale, head of U.K. research at broker JLL. The fastest-growing sectors are now those deemed "alternatives" -- like student-housing, hotels, health care and privately rented residential real estate -- GBP 11.6 billion of which traded in 2014, a 33% increase from 2013, JLL figures show.

It remains a small part of the GBP 65 billion of U.K. real estate traded last year, but alternatives "accounted for only a few percentage points of volumes just a few years ago," Mr. Neale said.

For U.K. student accommodation, the average investment yield has been 5.8% this year, compared with 5.1% on offices, according to Real Capital Analytics data.

The yield on student housing is down from 6.4% last year, a reflection of rising prices.

There were about $2.4 billion of student housing transactions in the U.K. in 2014, down 18% from 2013, according to Real Capital Analytics. U.S. firms Greystar, LaSalle Investment and Goldman Sachs have been among the biggest buyers in the last two years, the data show.

Last Friday, the Canadian Pension Plan bought 16,700 student rooms in over 40 residences across 17 cities -- as well as the company that manages the business -- from the Brandeaux Student Accommodation Fund.

This was the Canadian investor's largest-ever real-estate deal in Europe, and its first there in the alternative space, said Andrea Orlandi, head of European real-estate investments.

For CPP, student accommodation provides "a noticeable pickup in the yield" offered by office investments, Mr. Orlandi said.

The opportunity to buy the management company and its team means, "we can look to buy more assets" in a sector "that can, and will, consolidate in the future," he said.

The U.K. has long been a destination for foreign students looking to study at one of the renowned universities, or simply improve their English. London in particular is a magnet for foreign students.

Last Tuesday, Carlyle Group sold Pure Student Living -- with 2,170 student rooms across five central London sites -- to a Luxembourg-based investment vehicle called LetterOne Treasury Services, led by Mr. Fridman.

The deal saw Carlyle exit from U.K. student accommodation after a five-year run. But the U.S. investor "remains committed to student housing as a long-term institutional asset class," the firm said in a statement, noting it still has over 1,700 rooms in the Netherlands managed under The Student Hotel brand.

In the Greystar deal Monday, Round Hill is selling three London residences with 2,375 beds, a portfolio it bought for $415 million from Blackstone Group in 2012. Round Hill will retain the student-housing brand Nido, its management business and one student residence in London it bought earlier this year.
