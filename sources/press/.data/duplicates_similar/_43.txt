SEC Probes Why Facebook Didn't Warn Sooner on Privacy Lapse; Facebook faces questions on what it knew and when about Cambridge Analytica's use of social-media data

Securities regulators are investigating whether Facebook Inc. adequately warned investors that developers and other third parties may have obtained users' data without their permission or in violation of Facebook policies, people familiar with the matter said.

The Securities and Exchange Commission's probe of the social-media company, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-fbi-question-facebook-over-user-data-1530575905?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1", follows revelations that Cambridge Analytica, a data-analytics firm that had ties to President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, got access to information on millions of Facebook users.

The SEC has requested information from Facebook as it seeks to understand how much the company knew about Cambridge Analytica's use of the data, these people said. The agency also wants to know how Facebook analyzed the risk it faced if developers were to share data with others in violation of its policies, they added.

The SEC, one of several government agencies investigating Facebook and its handling of user data, enforces securities laws governing what must be disclosed to shareholders so they can make informed investment decisions. It could close its investigation, which is in its early stages, without taking enforcement action against Facebook.

Facebook and the SEC declined to comment.

The SEC has shown greater interest in recent months in probing data-security breaches and lapses. It has taken the position, most recently in a case filed against Altaba Inc., the successor company of Yahoo Inc., that public companies must disclose material data leaks or breaches they know about. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/yahoos-successor-to-pay-35-million-in-settlement-over-cyber-breach-1524588040".

The Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission also are probing the data leak and how Facebook and other parties handled it. The FTC is looking at whether Facebook violated terms of an earlier consent decree requiring it to get user consent for collecting personal data and sharing it with others.

The SEC is probing whether Facebook should have disclosed to shareholders its knowledge of the Cambridge Analytica violation in 2015, when it learned that Aleksandr Kogan, a professor at the University of Cambridge, had improperly shared data with Cambridge Analytica in 2014 for as many as 87 million Facebook users.

Facebook has said it told Mr. Kogan and Cambridge Analytica in 2015 to delete the data and believed they had done so. Cambridge Analytica, Mr. Kogan and another data-analytics expert who worked on the project, Christopher Wylie, certified they had destroyed the data, Facebook has said. The company said it learned in 2018 that it was possible not all of the data were destroyed.

That aspect didn't come to light until March, when the New York Times and Guardian Media Group revealed more about the data harvesting and Cambridge Analytica's voter-profiling efforts.

Facebook's shares fell about 17% in the weeks after news of the breach broke. Since then, the shares have climbed more than 30% and recently have been at or near all-time highs.

In April, Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg said "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mark-zuckerberg-to-testify-before-house-committee-on-april-11-1522844990" from the social network. Later that month, Facebook updated its investor disclosures to reflect that likelihood and said the FTC and other government agencies were probing how it responded to the episode. The company's April quarterly investor filing said it could discover "additional incidents of misuse of user data or other undesirable activity by third parties" and said such incidents could "negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation and brands, and adversely affect our business and financial results."

Facebook has characterized the Cambridge Analytica incident as a "breach of trust" but not a data breach. Its prior investor filing, the 2017 annual report in February, used the word "misuse" just once when describing the risk of hackers breaking into its systems to steal user data. It didn't address the risk of app developers or other commercial entities such as Cambridge Analytica improperly obtaining user data but warned if "developers fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices &our data or our users data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed."

Facebook officials believed what they had discovered in 2015 wasn't material information to investors because the data shared with Cambridge Analytica was less sensitive than other types of data that Facebook keeps, such as some users' payment information, a person familiar with the matter said. The Cambridge Analytica trove included data on people who downloaded a personality-test app Mr. Kogan developed and some details about their friends.

John Reed Stark, a cybersecurity consultant and former SEC enforcement attorney, said the way Facebook reported the incident could raise a red flag for the SEC if Facebook earned revenue from contracts with third-party vendors that misused private member data yet failed to disclose that the contracts potentially violate global and U.S. privacy laws as well as Facebook's terms of use.

Glasswing Ventures closed a $112 million fund focused on artificial intelligence startups on the East Coast.

About two years ago the Boston firm set a $150 million target for the vehicle in a regulatory filing.

Managing Partner Rudina Seseri said the firm's goal had been to raise above $100 million. She added that the fund is "very strong," with backing from endowments, fund-to-funds and family offices.

Glasswing will invest in both seed and pre-seed companies making cybersecurity and enterprise software. As venture capitalists face fierce competition for artificial intelligence deals, Ms. Seseri said the firm's deep focus and network of artificial intelligence experts set it apart.

"Pretty much every company is calling themselves an AI company," Ms. Seseri said. "Calling themselves an AI company doesn't make them an AI company."

Analysis. Commodities Search is on for tech experts using algorithms to repair a blunted information edge

Commodity houses are looking for data experts to help them gain an edge after seeing their margins squeezed by rivals.

Currencies, equities and interest rate investors have for years used algorithms, machine learning and artificial intelligence to turn data into trades.

Now, commodity traders are seeking ways of exploiting their information to help them profit from price swings.

"It is really a combination of knowing what to look for and using the right mathematical tools for it," said Peter Leoni, who holds a mathematics PhD and is one of the two data scientists within a newly created team of 10 at EDF Trading, the London-based trading arm of the French utility group.

"We want to be able to extract data and put it into algorithms," added Philipp Bssenschtt, EDFT chief commercial officer. "We then plan to move on to machine learning in order to improve decision-making in trading and, as a result, our profitability."

The French trading arm is investing in people, processes and systems to centralise its data   and it is not alone. "Everybody [in the commodity world] is waking up to the fact that the age of digitisation is upon us," said Damian Stewart at headhunters Human Capital.

In an industry where traders with proprietary knowledge, from outages at west African oilfields to crop conditions in Russia, vied to gain an upper hand over rivals, the democratisation of information over the past two decades has been a challenge.

Through the broad dissemination of news, weather reports and cargo-tracking, commodity traders have found their margins under pressure as their information edge   which once buttressed their profits as middlemen   has been blunted.

Return on equity for leading trading houses, a measure of the profit generated from the money shareholders have invested, has dropped significantly.

Some of the oil and metals traders enjoyed returns of about of 50-60 per cent in the mid-2000s but this has declined to levels in the mid-teens.

Agricultural traders' returns have historically been lower but they have also dropped with the commodity companies known as the ABCDs   Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Company   all recording single-digit ROE in their latest results.

As a consequence, an increasing number of traders are hoping to increase their competitiveness by feeding computer programs with mountains of information they have accumulated from years of trading physical raw materials to try and detect patterns that could form the basis for trading ideas.

"In agriculture, metals or energy, the traders are looking to gather data on a large scale and run machine-learning algorithms to find patterns linking fundamentals with price movements," said Etienne Amic, a former JPMorgan banker and chairman of Vortexa, a company making cargo-tracking software. Cargill, for example, started to build its global digital team two years ago and now has 75 people focused on digital innovation and incubation with a data science team of 12.

According to Gert-Jan van den Akker, president of Cargill's agricultural supply chain division, the combination of data and cutting-edge technology is already leading to better trading decisions. "Humans have always played a vital role in trading and understanding futures markets but we're no longer relying on human brain power alone," he said.

At the same time, computer models and algorithmic programs are also exerting greater influence on the prices of commodities in the futures markets, making it harder to hedge positions.

"We notice that the fundamentals and prices increasingly get out of balance in the market with the increased volumes executed by algos," said EDFT's Mr Bssenschtt.

Between 2012 and 2016, almost twothirds of crude oil contracts traded on CME's futures exchange were automated, up from 54 per cent, according to a 2017 study by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

In soyabeans and wheat, the figure rose from 39 per cent to almost half while in precious metals it has climbed from 46 per cent to 54 per cent.

Some traders are joining algorithmic funds to learn how they work. BayWa, a German agricultural trader, has linked up with a US fund specialising in computer-backed "quantitative" trading, Molinero Capital Management, and a German fund, Quantumrock Capital.

Despite this enthusiasm, digitisation may not come easily for some traders. Compared with other financial and industrial sectors, "they are coming from way behind", said one consultant.

One issue is that some of the larger commodities traders face internal resistance in centralising information on one platform. With each desk in a trading house in charge of its profit-andloss account, data are closely guarded even from colleagues, said Antti Belt, head of digital commodity trading at Boston Consulting Group. "The move to 'share all our data with each other' is a very, very big cultural shift," he added.

Another problem is that in some trading houses, staff operate on multiple technology platforms, with different units using separate systems.

Rather than focusing on analytics, some data scientists and engineers are having to focus on harmonising the platforms before bringing on the data from different parts of the company.

Even when the digital infrastructure is in place, it may take some time before AI becomes a large part of commodities trading. Vitol's chief information officer Gerard Delsad has increased his team by a fifth to more than 100 in the past three years, including several data scientists.

He said: "You still the need the trader to give some ideas, some hints [of] where to look, and then you can find some interesting stuff."

Nevertheless, digitisation is increasingly driving trading and must be embraced, said many commodities executives. Mr Bssenschtt added: "It's another tool that traders have to understand."

Departure of TP ICAP chief exposes tensions at top

Financials. Productivity test Stresses emerged after Tullett Prebon's 'ill-fated' 1.3bn purchase of broking business

TP ICAP's removal of chief executive John Phizackerley blows the lid on the tensions that have been simmering for months between the interdealer broker's board, shareholders and employees.

At a short meeting on Monday in London, Mr Phizackerley was told by chairman Rupert Robson that his near four-year tenure was over. For the ebullient Mr Phizackerley, it was a shock   the two had been due to discuss the vacant role of chief financial officer this week.

The reason behind the executive's ousting was the pressure related to Tullett Prebon's 1.3bn purchase of ICAP's global broking business   an "ill-fated and strategically questionable acquisition", according to Paul McGinnis, an analyst at Shore Capital.

Completed in late 2016, the deal transformed the London-based group into the world's largest broker. Its ranks of voice brokers who negotiate deals over the phone nearly doubled, to more than 3,000.

It gave TP ICAP the scale to compete in swaps and fixed income trading as the market was being transformed by the advance of electronic trading, and tougher regulations that squeezed the investment banks that are its main customers and piled on the broker's own compliance costs.

But stresses started to show in March, when it warned of a sharp rise in costs arising from the acquisition.

None of the issues around costs, nor a 100m synergy target Mr Robson raised at Monday's meeting, were brought up when the board signed off the coming half-year results in late June, Mr Phizackerley told the Financial Times. Central to the dispute between the two men is a controversial scheme in which Mr Phizackerley and other management were incentivised to integrate ICAP over three years, to December 2019.

Based largely on total shareholder returns, the directors would share a 60m bonus pool instead of being paid an annual bonus. Mr Phizackerley could have earned up to 15m from the scheme.

TP ICAP has yet to meet to decide if the scheme will be extended to the new chief executive Nicolas Breteau.

Its initial cost savings target rose from 60m to 80m and then further, to 100m. To get there, Mr Phizackerley saw improved productivity from his brokers, who provided 70 per cent of group turnover, as important.

At the same time, he sought to curb their pay, but that jarred with the people who felt they earned the profits. They saw management pay rising while their own contracts were being examined for ways to save money. "Morale has been awful. People have been openly talking about going on job interviews," said one employee who declined to be identified.

Mr Phizackerley hired consultants McKinsey to create a blueprint to transform the broker. However, employees worried that the resulting strategy misunderstood broking and the company. The downbeat mood has been compounded by a perceived lack of investment. As its market changed, asset managers and hedge funds emerged as new potential customers, and TP ICAP targeted them. But one former senior executive pointed out that asset managers need different services, as well as technology, than investment banks. "TP ICAP lacks the money or nous to deliver that," he said.

New initiatives have yet to pay off. An institutional services unit, and data and analytics, are also "strategic priorities". However, first-quarter numbers showed a 7 per cent decline in the institutional business and only 4 per cent growth in the data unit.

In March TP ICAP ran dual IT systems longer than it wanted because of delays to the introduction of Mifid II, but Europe's markets legislation has required more permanent costs than it anticipated. A new IT hub in Belfast, initially creating 300 jobs, will now employ more than 450 people.

The rising costs from the ICAP deal frustrated many investors. At TP ICAP's annual meeting in May more than 11 per cent of shareholders voted against the directors' remuneration report.

More than 5 per cent voted against Mr Robson's re-election; less than 1 per cent voted against Mr Phizackerley. By early June the declining share price and investor unrest was irritating Mr Robson and Mr Phizackerley, who had argued he was hitting his targets.

Now Mr Breteau faces a similar challenge. Like his predecessor, he wants to improve the productivity of TP ICAP's brokers but he also wants to invest.

However, costs continue to rise. TP ICAP said yesterday finance costs this year would surge to 35m owing to additional UK regulatory capital requirements and refinancing a revolving credit facility.

Brexit means TP ICAP is exploring creating a new European hub in Paris, to guarantee access to EU markets. That, too, would incur additional regulatory capital   the group at present holds about 620m   and some brokers may yet have to move.

Some analysts have speculated that may require Mr Breteau to sell assets to raise capital. TP ICAP's problems are not over yet.

Chinese car sales: peer pressure

Credit restrictions in peer-to-peer lending are slowing car sales in China. Loan issuance by carmakers could fill the gap created. Insurance sales data show demand for cars is falling in small cities but remains robust in the largest, wealthiest cities.

China's crackdown on risky peer-topeer lending is beginning to weigh on the world's largest car market. Lending cuts mean pressure on global carmaker revenues. To raise sales, they should focus on offering more high-quality loans of their own.

After opening up the consumer finance market four years ago, regulators in China seem determined to seal it back up again. A new licensing framework targets popular P2P platforms with high delinquency rates. Auto loans have already fallen.

China's P2P lending hit Rmb2.8tn ($422bn) last year. Around one-tenth of this is used to buy cars via lenders such as Yixin and Uxin, which listed on the Nasdaq exchange in June.

P2P loans were provided for 2.2m cars in China last year, according to Bernstein estimates. That equates to roughly 8 per cent of the market for new cars. The loan clampdown corresponds to a meaningful drop in car sales at a time when trade barriers and China's slowing economy are already putting pressure on sales.

Carmakers' captive finance arms should spot an opportunity when they see one. GM and BMW are the largest lenders in this space, yet top the ranking with total issuance of just Rmb60bn over the past three years.

This could be increased easily.

Car finance arms typically lend to low-risk borrowers and require conservative loan-to-value ratios near two-thirds   two factors that will endear them to regulators. Boosting this form of financing would offset the impact of cuts to P2P loans.

There is no need for carmakers to risk higher non-performing loan rates either. China's geographical divergence in credit quality is reflected in sales. Insurance volume data, a proxy for car sales, indicate that car sales in cities with the lowest gross domestic product fell more than 5 per cent in the last year. Sales in the country's wealthiest cities grew by the same amount.

Global carmaker dependence on China means keeping a careful eye on financial regulation. But the cleanout of P2P lenders could be a boon to other lenders when consumer credit is still in demand in the country's largest, richest cities.

Owner of China's Top News-Aggregation App in IPO Talks; Hong Kong offering may value Jinri Toutiao owner Beijing Bytedance Technology at over $45 billion

Corrections & Amplifications

Investment firm DST Global isn't an investor in Beijing Bytedance Technology Co. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that it was a shareholder in the Chinese company. (July 11, 2018)

The owner of China's most popular news-aggregation app is holding discussions about a multibillion-dollar initial public offering that could take place this year, according to people familiar with the matter.

Beijing Bytedance Technology Co. is considering a Hong Kong IPO that may value it at over $45 billion, the people said. It isn't clear how much Bytedance intends to raise, but it would join a rush of "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-biggest-tech-unicorns-stampede-to-go-public-1525176003" going public.

Bytedance's potential listing shows both the eagerness of Chinese tech companies to go public and the continued appetite for such IPOs, especially those helping to transform the consumer landscape.

The six-year-old company owns Jinri Toutiao "Today's Headlines" a mobile app that provides news headlines and third-party content for millions of Chinese, based on their interests and viewing history. It also owns two popular short-video apps in China, and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lip-syncing-app-musical-ly-is-acquired-for-as-much-as-1-billion-1510278123", a U.S. short-video streaming app, for close to $1 billion.

A spokesman for Bytedance said the company "doesn't currently have plans for an IPO."

Bytedance was valued at more than $20 billion in an equity fundraising round in late 2017, according to people familiar with the company. Earlier this year it "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-tech-unicorns-try-a-different-approach-to-raising-cash-1526981401" by selling convertible bonds to U.S. private-equity firm KKR & Co. Venture firm Sequoia Capital is among the company's other shareholders, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

Some Bytedance shares recently changed hands in private transactions at prices that implied a valuation of around $40 billion, said a person familiar with the matter.

The company is hoping to take advantage of what are still relatively hospitable market conditions for IPOs and major technology stocks, according to one person familiar with the company. Despite recent price declines, shares of Chinese internet giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. are still up more than 30% from a year ago.

Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp., whose shares started trading in Hong Kong Monday after it completed a $4.7 billion IPO, had a lackluster first day before soaring Tuesday. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/xiaomi-dials-up-big-gains-on-second-day-of-trading-1531222934" after two major index providers said they would include it in benchmarks widely followed by local and global investors.

Meituan Dianping, a fast-growing Chinese startup that provides a range of online services, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-meituan-dianping-files-for-ipo-reveals-loss-of-nearly-3-billion-in-2017-1529895226" in Hong Kong in the coming months, aiming for a market valuation of more than $60 billion, the Journal previously reported.

Global investors think the trio of Bytedance, Meituan Dianping and ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing Technology Co. will reshape the consumer landscape in China. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-ride-hailing-giant-hits-accelerator-on-talks-for-potential-ipo-1524553831" that could value it at over $70 billion, though the share sale is now more likely next year, people familiar with the transaction said. A Didi representative declined to comment.

Bytedance may also hold off its IPO plans until the first quarter of next year, said a person familiar with the situation.

One rival of Bytedance's Jinri Toutiao, Tencent-backed Qutoutiao, has been talking with investors about its own coming IPO in the U.S., according to a person familiar with the matter.

Some of Bytedance's popular apps have recently drawn scrutiny from Chinese regulators.

In April, citing "vulgar" and "improper" content, censors closed one that allowed people to share jokes and humorous videos. Bytedance founder Zhang Yiming apologized publicly for creating a product that "collided with core socialist values."

More recently, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-bans-ads-on-booming-video-app-1531217118" after a promotional spot for the app on a search engine made light of a venerated Chinese soldier in the Korean War. Douyin, which has many videos of lip-syncing teenagers and cute animals, was the most-downloaded app on China's Apple store earlier this year, according to analytics firm AppAnnie.

Business & Technology: Ad-Tech Company Raises Funding

Ad-tech company MediaMath has raised $225 million from investment firm Searchlight Capital Partners, an unusually large funding round in a sector rife with turbulence and consolidation.

New York-based MediaMath has raised more than $500 million to date. The latest round values the company at north of $1 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.

MediaMath operates a demand-side platform, or DSP -- technology that lets advertisers and their agencies buy online ads using automated systems -- and a data-management platform, or DMP, which lets advertisers store and analyze data.

Some of the new funds will be directed toward buying out one of MediaMath's investors, Safeguard Scientifics Inc., the publicly traded technology investment company that said in January it would stop investing in new companies.

MediaMath Chief Executive Joe Zawadzki said the company would also use the funding on acquisitions and to accelerate its development of technology in areas including identity, artificial intelligence, connected-television and digital out-of-home advertising.

Mr. Zawadzki said MediaMath has grown every year for the past 11 years and now the marketing industry is looking for a "re-evaluation of the next set of capabilities that need to get invented and implemented."

The sector is going through a period of upheaval in a market dominated by Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc. Digital-ad companies are also grappling with Europe's General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May.

In an industry where traders with proprietary knowledge, from outages at west African oilfields to crop conditions in Russia, vied to gain an upper hand over rivals, the democratisation of information over the past two decades has been a challenge.

Through the broad dissemination of news, weather reports and cargo-tracking, commodity traders have found their margins under pressure as their information edge, that once buttressed their profits as middlemen, has been blunted.

Return on equity for leading trading houses, a measure of the profit generated from the money shareholders have invested, has dropped significantly.

Some of the oil and metals traders enjoyed returns of about of 50-60 per cent in the mid-2000s, but this has declined to levels in the mid-teens.

Agricultural traders  returns have historically been lower, but they have also dropped, with the commodity companies known as the ABCDs   Archer Daniels Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus Company   all recording single-digit ROE in their latest results.

As a consequence, an increasing number of traders are hoping to increase their competitiveness by feeding computer programmes with mountains of information they have accumulated from years of trading physical raw materials to try and detect patterns that could form the basis for trading ideas.

 In agriculture, metals or energy, the traders are looking to gather data on a large scale and run machine-learning algorithms to find patterns linking fundamentals with price movements,  said Etienne Amic, a former JPMorgan banker and chairman of Vortexa, a company making cargo-tracking software.

Cargill, for example, started to build its global digital team two years ago and now has 75 people focused on digital innovation and incubation, with a data science team of 12.

According to Gert-Jan van den Akker, president of Cargill s agricultural supply chain division, the combination of data and cutting-edge technology is already leading to better trading decisions.

 Humans have always played a vital role in trading and understanding futures markets, but we re no longer relying on human brain power alone,  he said.

At the same time, computer models and algorithmic programs are also exerting greater influence on the prices of commodities in the futures markets, making it more difficult to hedge positions.

 We notice that the fundamentals and prices increasingly get out of balance in the market with the increased volumes executed by algos,  said Mr Bssenschtt of EDFT.

Between 2012 and 2016, almost two-thirds of crude oil contracts traded on CME s futures exchange were automated, up from 54 per cent, according to a 2017 study by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

In soyabeans and wheat, the figure rose from 39 per cent to almost half, while in precious metals it has climbed to 54 per cent from 46 per cent.

Some traders are joining forces with algorithmic funds to learn how they work. BayWa, a German midsized agricultural trader, has linked up with Molinero Capital Management, a US fund specialising in computer-backed  quantitative  trading, and German fund Quantumrock Capital.

Despite this new enthusiasm, the road to electronification may not come easily for some traders. Compared to other financial and industrial sectors,  they are coming from way behind,  said one consultant.

One issue is that some of the larger commodities traders face internal resistance in centralising information on one platform.

With each desk in a trading house in charge of its profit-and-loss account, data are closely guarded even from colleagues, said Antti Belt, head of digital commodity trading at Boston Consulting Group.  The move to  share all our data with each other  is a very, very big cultural shift,  he added.

Another problem is that in some trading houses, staff operate on multiple technology platforms, with different units using separate systems.

Rather than focusing on analytics, some data scientists and engineers are having to focus on harmonising the platforms before bringing on the data from different parts of the company.

Even where the digital infrastructure is in place, it may take some time before AI becomes a large part of commodities trading. Vitol s chief information officer Gerard Delsad has increased his team by a fifth to more than 100 in the past three years, including several data scientists.

He said a computer still struggles to find patterns in the data and come up with trading ideas on its own.  You still need the trader to give some ideas, some hints [of] where to look, and then you can find some interesting stuff. 

Nevertheless, digitisation is increasingly driving trading and needs to be embraced, say many commodities executives.

Mr Bssenschtt said:  It s another tool that traders have to understand.

China turns to an old hand for the tech age

Enterprise formed in the time of steam takes charge of $15bn New Era fund focused on investing in start-ups

FT Montage/Bloomberg China Merchants Group has been adopting new technology to resist foreign competitors for nearly 150 years. Founded in the 19th century, the company brought steam shipping to China so it could compete with western traders.

Now an arm of the Chinese state, CMG has been enlisted again to buy up technology at a time when global private equity is vying for a share of China's burgeoning tech market.

The country's largest and oldest stateowned enterprise, CMG said this month that it would partner with a Londonbased company to raise a Rmb100bn ($15bn) fund mainly focused on investing in Chinese start-ups.

The China New Era Technology Fund will be launched in direct competition with the likes of SoftBank's $100bn Vision Fund, as well as other huge investment vehicles raised by leading global private equity houses such as Sequoia Capital, Carlyle, KKR and Hillhouse Capital Management.

"They have been very important to China in the past, especially in reform," said Li Wei, a professor of economics at Cheung Kong Graduate School of Business in Beijing. "But you haven't heard much about them in technology ... It's not too surprising to see them moving into this area, upgrading themselves once again."

CMG is already one of the world's largest investors. Since the beginning of 2015, its investment arm, China Merchants Capital, which will oversee the New Era fund, has launched 31 funds aiming to raise a combined total of at least $52bn, according to publicly disclosed information.

But experts say little is known about the returns of those funds, most of which have been launched in co-operation with local governments or state companies.

Before New Era, China Merchants Capital's largest fund was a Rmb60bn vehicle launched with China Construction Bank in 2016. While almost no information is available on its investment activity, the fund said it would focus on high-tech, manufacturing and medical tech.

CMG's experience investing directly into Chinese tech groups is limited, although it has taken part in the fundraising of several high-profile companies. In 2015, China Merchants Bank joined Apple, Tencent and Ant Financial to invest a combined $2.5bn into the ride-hailing service Didi Chuxing, a company that now touts an $80bn valuation. It also invested in the ecommerce logistics provider SF Express in 2013.

Success in Chinese tech investing is set to become increasingly difficult as more capital pours into the sector.

"Fifteen billion dollars can seem like a droplet in China," said Peter Fuhrman, chairman and chief executive of tech-focused investment banking group China First Capital, based in Shenzhen. "We're all bobbing in an ocean of risk capital. Still, one can't but wonder, given the quite so-so cash returns from China high-tech investing, if all this money will find investable opportunities and if there weren't more productive uses for at least some of all this bounty."

But CMG has always set itself apart from the rest of the country's state groups. It is unlike any other company under the control of the Chinese government as it was founded before the Chinese Communist party and is based in Hong Kong, outside mainland China.

The business was launched in 1872 as China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, a logistics and shipping jointstock company formed between Chinese merchants based in the country's bustling port cities and the Qing dynasty court.

Mirroring its New Era fund today, it was designed to compete for technology with foreign rivals. At that time it was focused on obtaining steam transport technology to "counter the inroads of western steam shipping in Chinese coastal trade", according to research by University of Queensland professor Chi-Kong Lai.

Nearly a century later, after falling under the control of the government, CMG became the single most important company in the early development of the city of Shenzhen, China's so-called "window to the world" as it opened to the west. Then led by former intelligence officer and guerrilla soldier Yuan Geng, the company used its base in Hong Kong to attract some of the first investors from the British-controlled city into the small Chinese town of Shenzhen, which has since grown into one of the world's largest manufacturing hubs.

Its work in opening China to global investment gained CMG and Yuan, who led the company until the early 1990s, status as leading figures in the country's reform era.

Today the company is a sprawling state conglomerate with $1.1tn in assets and holdings in real estate, ports, shipping, banking, asset management, toll roads and even healthcare.

The company has 46 ports in 18 countries, according to the state-run People's Daily, with deals last year in the sector including the controversial takeover of the Hambantota terminal in Sri Lanka and the $924m acquisition of Brazilian operator TCP Participaes.

CMG did not respond to requests for comment. But one person who has advised it on overseas investments said the Chinese government was using it in the same way the company opened up Shenzhen to the outside world, helping to "unlock foreign markets". Belt and Road troubles See Comment Focus on the future Rich local governments back investment funds Over the past three years, a handful of state-backed groups have launched investment funds with committed capital sometimes reaching above $10bn.

Many of the vehicles are overseen by rich local governments, such as the $15.6bn fund launched by Shanghai region municipalities earlier this year, or the $14.5bn Haihe Fund opened by the local government of Tianjin.

Overwhelmingly, the funds focus on technology, artificial intelligence, biotech and on upgrading outdated manufacturing technology.

But market observers have questioned whether such massive amounts of cash can be used efficiently. "We know that the government has money but how long can they lay it out like this, and how effective will the spending be? That's the question for these types of funds," said Hao Zhou, senior emerging markets economist at Commerzbank in Singapore.

China Merchants Group's $15bn New Era fund marks a shift in how state companies run their investments. The company has said it is partnering with the UK's Centricus, the investment firm that helped to structure SoftBank's record-setting $100bn technology Vision Fund. It has also brought on a Chinese company that employs Joshua Fink, son of BlackRock founder Larry Fink.

The fund must still compete with a sea of capital in China. But the willingness of a state-owned enterprise to partner with foreign managers is a sign that at least some are trying to introduce global expertise to the industry.

Custom-Parts Marketplace Xometry Raises $25 Million in New Funding; Company will also buy rival MakeTime as it builds business matching manufacturers to small-batch suppliers.

Xometry Inc., an online marketplace for custom-manufactured parts, has acquired rival firm MakeTime Inc. and raised $25 million to fuel future expansion.

The deal creates what Xometry says is the industry's largest distributed on-demand manufacturing network, with more than 2,300 domestic manufacturers and machine shops that make prototypes and smaller runs of parts for customers including BMW AG and General Electric Co., which are also investors.

Businesses upload their design files to the Gaithersburg, Md.,-based firm's platform, which uses machine learning to match companies with vetted suppliers, generating instant price quotes and lead-time estimates. The aim is to streamline the sourcing process and reduce costs for manufacturers.

The combined company has a total of about 170 employees, with offices in Maryland and in Lexington, Ky., where MakeTime is based. Xometry declined to disclose the financial terms of the deal.

In addition to expanding Xometry's manufacturing network, the acquisition brings customers greater ability to check pricing and get other feedback from factories earlier in the design stage, through add-ons for 3-D computer-aided software. MakeTime has one for Autodesk Fusion, while Xometry has one for SolidWorks, another 3-D design program.

U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum imports have made pricing more volatile in recent months, and Xometry co-founder and Chief Executive Randy Altschuler says the company's platform "can reflect what the market costs are for those materials,"

Xometry will also incorporate a MakeTime program that gives machine shops in its network access to special offers on cutting tools, software, computer equipment and manufacturing equipment financing programs.

Founded in late 2013, Xometry has more than 10,000 customers in industries ranging from automotive and medical devices to aerospace and consumer products. Its annual revenue has doubled over the past year, to around $40 million, and the company now offers injection molding capabilities as well as sheet metal fabrication, urethane casting and computer numerical controlled machining.

The $25 million funding round is led by Foundry Group, one of MakeTime's investors. It includes contributions from Almaz Capital and Maryland Venture Fund, as well as money from existing Xometry investors such as the venture-capital arms of BMW and GE and Highland Capital Partners. Xometry has raised $63 million so far.

Rental Investors Gamble on Affluent Tenants

By Ryan Dezember and Laura Kusisto

10 July 2018
The Wall Street Journal

Wall Street is betting that more well-off Americans will want to be renters.

Financiers who loaded up on homes after the housing bust for pennies on the dollar are buying yet more -- despite home prices in many markets being at all-time highs.

Their wager: High prices, higher mortgage rates and skimpy inventory are making homeownership harder. Well-to-do families who might have bought a single-family home in another era are willing to rent a house now, especially if it means access to a good school system.

The number of homes purchased by major investors in 2017 was at least 29,000, up 60% from the previous year, estimates Amherst Capital Management LLC, a real-estate investment firm.

That marked the first time since 2013 -- when investors like Blackstone Group LP's Stephen Schwarzman and Barry Sternlicht of Starwood Capital Group gobbled up foreclosed homes -- that investors bought more houses year-over-year. Single-family homes have become far more attractive to investors than apartments, where a nationwide glut has driven down rental yields.

This year, investors have raised billions of dollars to purchase more homes. They have been particularly aggressive buyers in places like Atlanta, Phoenix, and other metro areas with good schools and faster-growing economies.

On Monday, the investment firm Pretium Partners LLC said it had raised more than $1 billion so that its Progress Residential could add to its 26,000 rental homes. Pretium was founded by a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive who helped oversee the bank's lucrative bet against the housing market a decade ago.

Cash to acquire and renovate homes has become so abundant lately that some rental investors can't spend it fast enough. Without enough homes to buy, some investors are now building their own in popular residential markets like Miami and Nashville, Tenn. -- upending a traditional pattern of Americans buying starter homes and moving up.

"The American dream no longer includes homeownership," said Jordan Kavana, chief executive of Transcendent Investment Management LLC, a south Florida firm that has been a big acquirer of rental homes.

Transcendent says it has secured more than $250 million, mostly from wealthy Chinese, that it will use to build thousands of rental homes in the Southeast. Toronto's Tricon Capital Group Inc. said it is teaming with a U.S. pension fund and a sovereign-wealth fund to enlarge its home-purchasing program over the next three years by about $2 billion, enough for perhaps 12,000 houses.

"We're seeing a wider variety of investors coming into this asset class: sovereign-wealth funds, insurance companies, hedge funds, pensions, asset managers," said Sandeep Bordia, Amherst's head of Research and Analytics.

Managing far-flung clusters of homes -- much harder than running an apartment building -- has long been a hurdle for investors. But analysts and rental executives say investors are gaining confidence it can be done profitably. Also, wealthier tenants in the single-family-home market typically have children and need more bedrooms than most apartments offer. They're also willing to accept rent increases to stay in good school districts.

These investors' war chests have been swelled by rising home prices, which give them more valuable collateral. Transcendent's fund will add about $750 million of debt on top of investors' $250 million or so, giving the firm spending power of about $1 billion over the next three years. Mr. Kavana expects to develop as many as 3,000 homes for his predominantly Chinese clients. "They get that this is a linchpin of the American economy," he said.

Invitation Homes, the industry's 83,000-home heavyweight created by the combination of Messrs. Schwarzman's and Sternlicht's rental ventures, last month sold the largest ever rent-backed bond. The houses that Invitation borrowed $1.3 billion against were valued at 26% more than when they were used as collateral in earlier bond deals, according to Kroll Bond Rating Agency.

American Homes 4 Rent, the country's second-largest single-family rental owner, has been adding houses with proceeds from $500 million of unsecured debt the Agoura Hills, Calif. company sold in January.

Bruce McNeilage, who sold 42 houses in suburban Nashville to American Homes in 2015, has since flipped another 400 or so in middle Tennessee and around Atlanta to larger landlords. He's building dozens of houses in both regions and buying in the Carolinas, some to sell and some to rent out himself.

Mr. McNeilage had planned to slow down, but local lenders offered financing that was too favorable to pass up.

Quantum National Bank, for instance, recently sent Atlanta-area landlords and flippers a memo advertising $10 million that it hoped to lend at promotional rates against rental homes, in chunks ranging from $150,000 to $1.5 million.

The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and growth-equity firm TCV are acquiring a stake in Sportradar AG, a Swiss provider of sports data, from EQT and certain minority shareholders at an enterprise value of  2.1 billion ($2.47 billion).

The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter, according to a news release.

Carsten Koerl, founder and chief executive, will retain his ownership position in Sportradar. EQT will reinvest a portion of its sale proceeds into the company.

Sportradar uses a network of data journalists to gather statistics from more than 400,000 sporting events annually, according to its website. Clients include gambling companies, sports federations and the media. Based in St. Gallen, the company was founded in 2000 and employs more than 1,900 people world-wide.

EQT had been seeking a buyer for its minority stake in Sportradar, WSJ Pro Private Equity "https://www.wsj.com/articles/eqt-seeks-buyer-for-stake-in-data-firm-sportradar-1516627166?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=2".

The European firm invested  44 million in Sportradar July 2012. Before EQT's cash injection, Sportradar had an enterprise valuation of  127.5 million, EQT said at the time. EQT originally used cash from its Expansion Capital II fund, which targeted minority investments in midmarket European businesses. Two years later, that fund sold the entire Sportradar stake at an undisclosed valuation to EQT's sixth flagship buyout fund, a  4.82 billion vehicle raised in 2011.

The company received more high-profile backing in 2015, when U.S. investment firm Revolution Growth, basketball legend Michael Jordan and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban invested  40 million. The three remain existing shareholders of the company.

Sportradar has made a number of bolt-on deals in Asia and in the U.S. The company's U.S. arm last year bought data company Mocap Analytics Inc.

Based in Toronto, CPPIB invests in public and private equities, real estate, infrastructure and fixed income instruments. As of March 31, the CPP Fund totaled C$356.1 billion.

Founded in 1995 and based in Menlo Park, Calif., TCV provides capital to growth-stage private and public companies in the technology industry.

Index Ventures said it has raised $1.65 billion for two new funds.

The firm has $650 million for its ninth venture-capital fund and $1 billion for its fourth growth-equity fund. For its previous venture fund Index raised $550 million in 2016 and about $700 million for its last growth equity fund in 2015.

This year has been "one of the best year's we've had at Index," said Mike Volpi, general partner. Index previously invested in Adyen BV, Dropbox Inc. and Zuora Inc., all of which have gone public this year. Index also invested in Sonos Inc., which is planning an IPO in the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/index-redpoint-set-for-sonos-ipo-payoff-1531135854".

Index got its start in 1996 before it expanded to London and later the U.S. These days, the firm says its portfolio companies are split about evenly across Europe and the U.S.

Mr. Volpi says Index's strategy for its next funds will be more of the same. "I don't see us changing a great deal," he said. "The strategy has worked to date."

Index will prioritize Series A investing from its venture fund, with a particular emphasis on financial services businesses, mobility, e-commerce and artificial intelligence-focused enterprise startups.

Mr. Volpi said he expects the Series A checks to be between $5 million and $15 million. Growth fund checks will be between $30 million to $50 million.

Quorum, Maker of Energy Software, Explores a Sale

Quorum Business Solutions Inc., a software provider to the energy industry, is betting a rebound in oil prices will help it land a new owner.

The private-equity-backed company is working with investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG to explore a possible sale, according to people familiar with the situation. Quorum is timing it with recovery of the oil-and-gas sector after years of sluggish activity.

Quorum, which offers software products including those that support marketing, transportation and storage of pipelines, is projected to generate roughly $43 million in 2018 full-year cash earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to people familiar with the sale, citing marketing documents. Both private-equity and corporate buyers are looking at the company, according to another person familiar with the situation.

Last month, Insight Venture Partners sold much of its stake in oil-and-gas software company Drilling Info Holdings Inc. to fellow private-equity firm Genstar Capital in a deal that valued it at roughly $1 billion, according to people familiar with the sale.

Technology-focused buyout shop Silver Lake invested in Quorum in 2014 in a deal that valued the company at $310 million. The firm initially financed its investment using equity from its core buyout fund and from Silver Lake Kraftwerk, a growth-capital vehicle dedicated to backing tech businesses in the operations, energy and resources industries.

Since Silver Lake's investment, Quorum has become an active acquirer. In April, the company announced it had entered into an agreement to buy Entero Corp., a software provider for the upstream and midstream sectors. In September of last year, it acquired WellEz Information Management LLC, a cloud-based well-life-cycle analytics provider.

---

Oil Prices' Increase

Sets Stage for Deal

Quorum is one of at least two dozen software providers in the energy sector that private-equity firms took a stake in between 2012 and 2014, before oil prices plummeted, according to data provider PitchBook Data Inc.

Many of those companies have reached a stage at which their investors would typically look to exit. Industry experts say with prices of Brent crude, the global benchmark, up more than 19% so far this year, valuations for these companies have improved, encouraging more of them to explore sales.

Energy-technology companies have sprung up as the oil-and-gas industry expanded, providing software for land management, life-cycle reporting of wells, accounting and tracking of active oil rigs. The rebounding sector could mean that more energy companies seek their services to help manage increasingly complex operations.

Private-equity interest in energy-focused software deals has picked up after more than a two-year lull. So far this year, private-equity firms have backed five deals in the sector, putting the industry on pace to exceed the eight deals done in 2017, according to PitchBook.

Watchdog blocks Cohen from relaunching fund to UK clients

? FCA red light on Point72 ? Manager not 'fit and proper' ? Blow to revival plan

Steven Cohen, the US hedge fund manager, has been blocked by the UK regulator from reopening his multibillion-dollar fund to investors in Britain, after a two-year ban over insider trading at his previous firm expired at the start of this year.

Mr Cohen recently returned to the US hedge fund business and had hoped to move back into Europe by managing outside money again in the UK.

But the Financial Conduct Authority has refused to allow him to reopen his fund to clients in Britain, according to two people familiar with the application.

The FCA ruled that Mr Cohen was not "fit and proper" to do so, one person said.

It is the second time in 12 months that the 62-year-old's new fund, Point72, has hit a British roadblock in his attempt to rebuild his business after the misconduct that sank SAC Capital, his previous outfit.

Last year the FCA was wary of giving its approval before the end of the term on the US Securities and Exchange Commission ban. While Point72 was not formally denied permission, it was given an indication from the regulator that it would not be approved. The application was withdrawn and resubmitted this year, only to be rebuffed again.

Point72 and the FCA declined to comment.

Mr Cohen has been focused on managing much of his personal fortune via Point72 since SAC Capital was banned by the SEC from managing clients' money after admitting to trading on inside information.

Since the SEC lifted its ban on Mr Cohen in January, Point72 has raised $3bn from outside investors, giving it $12bn of assets including his personal funds. But it still had to seek authorisaemployees tion from the FCA to make a full return to the UK.

Family offices do not need the FCA's approval to operate in the UK. But they need it if they want to manage anyone else's money or to make certain changes to the way a fund is structured.

Point72 opened the London office for its family business in 2016 and hired Will Tovey, former head of Barclays' equities distribution business in Europe, to run the British operation.

The fund recently hired senior UK executives from Credit Suisse and Och-Ziff after moving into a new London office in St James's Square, and had planned to expand from 50 in London to as many as 100. SAC Capital pleaded guilty to insider trading in 2013 and paid a record $1.8bn in fines. Mr Cohen was never personally charged with insider trading but was barred from supervising funds that managed outside money as part of the settlement, and several of his portfolio managers were convicted and sentenced to prison terms.

Point72 is also battling a lawsuit filed by its head of talent analytics, who has accused it of rampant sexism and underpaying female workers. Douglas Haynes, its president, who was one of the named defendants in the case, stepped down in the wake of the lawsuit.

The fund has said it "emphatically denies" the allegations and stands by its record of hiring and developing women. Lauren Bonner, the claimant, asked for $13m to settle the suit, according to a person familiar with the case. The fund is seeking to compel arbitration. Lex page 18

Sonos highlights accelerating growth in pitch to investors

Technology

Wireless speaker maker Sonos has unveiled its pitch to investors as it heads for an initial public offering, showing accelerating growth in revenues that came close to $1bn last year while annual losses narrowed.

The Santa Barbara-based company plans to raise $100m, likely to be a place holder amount, when it lists on Nasdaq under the symbol "SONO", it said in yesterday's S-1 filing. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Allen & Co are Sonos' lead underwriters.

As new tech group listings regain momentum, Sonos' IPO will provide a payday for investors in the 16-yearold company such as KKR and Index Ventures.

Sonos has not turned an annual profit since 2014 but it has narrowed its net losses over the past three years, from $68.8m in fiscal 2015 to $14.2m in the year ending September 2017. Revenues hit $992.5m in fiscal 2017 from 3.9m products sold.

The pace of revenue growth at the company has been uneven, fluctuating between 75 per cent in 2014 and 7 per cent in 2016.

Sonos is hoping to capitalise on the growth of music streaming services and voice-activated virtual assistants.

Patrick Spence, Sonos chief executive, says this "sonic internet" can also be an antidote to smartphone addiction.

"Advances in artificial intelligence and voice technology are transforming [the internet] from something we tap and scroll to something we talk and listen to," Mr Spence wrote in a letter to investors. "Together, artificial intelligence, voice assistants and an enormous wave of sonic content are giving rise to something greater than the sum of their parts."

Growth has accelerated since last October's introduction of the Alexapowered Sonos One smart speaker, driving 18 per cent growth to $655.7m in the six months to March 2018.

The filing reveals that private equity firm KKR is Sonos' largest shareholder with a 25 per cent stake ahead of the IPO, followed by tech investor Index Ventures and co-founder John MacFarlane, who each own around 13 per cent.

Private Equity Seeks to Retool Industrial Businesses With Technology

Triton is giving its portfolio companies a technology upgrade.

When the firm acquired Aventics GmbH in 2014, part of the plan for revitalizing the seller of shock absorbers, high-pressure valves and other pneumatic equipment was a focus on digital innovation.

Key to the effort was a new service that extracts data from its customers' equipment, notifies them when maintenance is required and hooks them up to an e-commerce platform to buy a replacement.

Private equity has long prized software companies, thanks to the reliable profits associated with selling subscription services rather than products. The example of Aventics shows how some firms now are profiting by applying the same logic in the less fashionable area of industrial machinery.

Triton isn't the only firm aiming to capitalize on digitalization. Nordic Capital, for instance, touts the role of its operations team in encouraging industrial maintenance company Quant AB to improve its data gathering with smart sensors.

Meanwhile, Aesseal PLC, a provider of industrial seals owned by 3i Group PLC, is developing services that gather data from the components it sells. And KKR & Co.-backed pump maker Gardner Denver Inc. last year hired an "Internet of Things" specialist to develop an analytics platform.

In the case of Aventics, the effort seems to have paid off. Triton in May announced a deal to sell the company for  527 million ($621.8 million) to Emerson Electric Co. The U.S. engineering giant pointed to the digital push as a key part of Aventics's appeal.

Triton is set to seal a 5.5-times return on invested capital and an internal rate of return of 60% from the sale, five years after it bought Aventics from German corporate Bosch Rexroth AG, said a person familiar with the matter.

Around the time of the Aventics deal, the firm was beginning a concerted push to transform companies in "mature sectors" such as industrial machinery into digital-oriented businesses that are "worth a lot more," said Managing Partner Peder Prahl.

"Most private-equity firms focus on things you can digitalize completely," he said. "It's attractive, but it's very expensive, because everyone wants to do it."

Triton sometimes pushes companies to adopt entirely new initiatives, but also helps portfolio companies speed up their progress by refining and accelerating existing strategies, said Anders Thulin, a senior digital expert at Triton.

"The speed is something we focus on can we capture that value faster?" he said.

The firm runs a digital "full potential" analysis for every company it buys, said Mr. Thulin. After investing, it sets digital key performance indicators for each management team and often assigns a digital specialist to work with the company.

In some cases, the firm may encourage portfolio companies to consider software companies as acquisition targets for the first time.

In the case of Alimak Hek Group AB, an elevator manufacturer Triton listed in 2015 and fully exited last year after a decadelong hold, digitalization was a "very important part" of a successful investment outcome, Mr. Thulin said. Under Triton's ownership, Alimak modernized its sales management system and retrofitted its elevators with sensors that for a service fee let customers predict when equipment needs maintenance.

When Triton was positioning the company for a sale, it was important to demonstrate that Alimak had digital potential even though the new revenue stream only accounted for a small part of its business.

"They are moving into the new world, but it's real it's not just a slide," Mr. Thulin said.

Turning industrial companies into digital businesses is not a new concept, but it has recently become a priority for private-equity firms seeking to sell industrial companies, said Nick Sealy, who co-leads European investment banking at Robert W. Baird & Co.

"People were saying,  you can have all this clever stuff in services, it's never going to come to grease town,'" he said. "It has [gotten] more important in the last couple of years."

Part of the reason was the sluggish rate of global economic growth in recent years, Mr. Sealy said. It has become essential for private-equity firms and the companies they own to generate growth by improving their operations, rather than relying on business-as-usual to deliver returns.

"When you get into a tough low-growth environment, you need to go back to the drawing board," he said. "People are re-examining all aspects of their business models."

While Triton emphasizes its proactive approach, other firms are making similar moves to avoid being left behind.

"The level of disruption to previously safe business models is much higher than it was," Mr. Sealy said. "Some might say,  Here is a way to steal a march on my competitors,' but other people look at it defensively."

Business News: App Tracks Driving Habits

Mitsubishi Motors Corp. is trying a novel approach to get more American car owners interested in sharing driving data with auto insurers: $10 off an oil change.

The Japanese car maker has introduced a game-like interface to entice its vehicle owners in the U.S. to sign up for a smartphone app that relays digital data on driving habits to insurers, starting last month with State Auto Insurance Cos. In return, drivers earn virtual "badges" for good road manners such as staying within speed limits and avoiding sudden stops over certain periods of time and miles traveled.

Those badges can be exchanged for rewards such as discounts on car accessories and oil changes. Drivers using the app also might see their insurance premiums fall -- or rise -- based on their driving practices.

The rewards-linked app is the first of its kind offered by an auto maker and marks an early attempt to create a new source of revenue using data extracted from vehicles, a potential growth area as more cars get connected to the internet with built-in wireless Wi-Fi hot spots and cellular modems.

"Almost every auto maker is actively looking at this space," said Bryan Arnett, a senior manager for product planning at Mitsubishi's U.S. subsidiary. "This could help stabilize the business if the market slips" for new car sales, he said.

McKinsey & Co. estimates monetizing data from connected cars will be worth as much as $750 billion by 2030. With most cars built after 2020 expected to come with preinstalled modems and other internet-connected devices, harvesting car data could be a significant growth opportunity for the auto industry as it grapples with changes wrought by autonomous vehicles.

The Mitsubishi app uses smartphone sensors that measure things such as acceleration, location and rotation. Insurers pay Mitsubishi for the data stream, which in turn allows them to study driving patterns and fine-tune their risk profiles. Industry experts say that one day insurers might effectively require drivers to share their driving data in real time, or face steep premium charges for failing to do so.

Such services are currently opt-in, but they have raised privacy concerns among car owners and public-interest groups. Mitsubishi says it takes privacy concerns seriously and notes users can disable the data sharing at any time with a dashboard switch.

For insurers, having access to data on the time of day, miles traveled and the frequency of lane changes is valuable because it shows how drivers behave behind the wheel.

The Mitsubishi app was developed by LexisNexis Risk Solutions, which provides insurers with driver profiles used to set policies. Traditionally, LexisNexis, a unit of RELX PLC, has used public data such as a consumer's credit rating, ZIP Code, age, gender and other information to divine driving characteristics. LexisNexis says its algorithm uses machine learning to determine whether a policyholder is actually driving, sitting in the passenger seat or riding in a bus or taxi.

Insurance rates for drivers with the app are figured after a period in which insurers build a customer risk profile. That provides a price quote less likely to change than those that provide sign-up discounts but can rise or fall sharply at renewal based on retroactive driving data, said Mike LaRocco, State Auto's chief executive.

Business News: Defense Industry Adds Venture Capital to Arsenal

Defense companies are looking beyond their own laboratories for the next technology breakthrough.

Long known for acquiring suppliers and spending big on research that might not pay off for years, Boeing Co., Lockheed Martin Corp. and others are now vying to invest in startups. Executives say they can no longer rely solely on their own researchers to outflank new drone, software and battery companies.

"We disrupt ourselves so someone else doesn't disrupt us," said Brian Schettler, managing director of Boeing's HorizonX venture arm, which launched in April 2017.

The corporate venture-capital market has more than doubled over the past five years. American companies made more than 1,200 deals worth a record $34.3 billion in 2017, according to the National Venture Capital Association and PitchBook.

Aerospace and defense companies face stiff competition for deals. Alongside traditional players such as tech firms and drugmakers, a growing array of manufacturers -- from power-tool maker Stanley Black & Decker Inc. to General Motors Co. -- are sifting startups for technology that could ensure their future.

While a handful of industrial giants such as General Electric Co. and 3M Co. have long-established venture arms, the new entrants share a common focus on artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles and other areas that could lead to new manufacturing processes and storage technologies, changing the way companies design and produce.

"There is an ongoing collision of the tech world with industrials," said analyst Rob Wertheimer, at Melius Research LLC.

Boeing's HorizonX arm announced eight deals this year, adding to a portfolio of investments that include stakes in electric-airplane maker Zunum Aero and in Upskill, a productivity software company.

Lockheed in June doubled the size of its two-year-old Lockheed Martin Ventures unit to $200 million with savings from recent changes to U.S. tax law.

Like its competitors, Lockheed hopes to harvest technology from the companies it invests in for its own systems and platforms.

Defense executives first woke up to the threat that startups pose to their businesses in April 2016, when Elon Musk's SpaceX won its first rocket-launch deal from the Pentagon -- ending a decadelong monopoly for a Boeing-Lockheed joint venture.

Other companies say more mundane products have shaken their faith in their monopoly on good ideas.

Don Allan, Stanley Black & Decker's chief financial officer, said the debut of internet-based home-security systems such as Nest and Ring raised concerns internally that such technology could threaten the company's commercial-protection business.

The two startups have since been acquired by Google's Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., respectively.

Mr. Allan said the company gathered its business heads three years ago to identify other threats. They established a venture-capital arm that has made 13 deals, including two this year. The unit has invested in firms developing 3-D printing and security systems, as well as energy-storage systems that could alter the design of its power tools.

"We see now how fast batteries are changing," Mr. Allan said.

Those badges can be exchanged for rewards such as discounts on car accessories and oil changes. By year's end, the Japanese auto maker says it plans to expand to free cups of coffee and gift cards. Drivers using the app also may see their insurance premiums fall or rise based on their driving practices.

The rewards-linked app is the first of its kind offered by an auto maker and marks an early attempt to create a new source of revenue using data extracted from vehicles, a potential growth area as "https://www.wsj.com/articles/auto-makers-at-odds-over-talking-car-standards-1525608000" with built-in wireless Wi-Fi hot spots and cellular modems.

For insurers, having access to data on the time of day, miles traveled and the frequency of lane changes is valuable because it shows how drivers behave behind the wheel.

The Mitsubishi app was developed by LexisNexis Risk Solutions, which provides insurers with driver profiles used to set policies.

LexisNexis says its algorithm uses machine learning to determine if a policyholder is actually driving, sitting in the passenger seat or riding in a bus or taxi.

"It's all about getting more data points" to create a better risk profile, said Pavan Mathew, director of LexisNexis's automotive business.

Insurance rates for drivers with the app are determined after a trial period during which insurers build a customer risk profile. That provides a price quote less likely to change than those that provide initial discounts for signing up but can rise or fall sharply at renewal based on retroactive driving data, said Mike LaRocco, State Auto's CEO. "They'll get a much more accurate quote from day one," he said.

The free Mitsubishi app requires no extra hardware and can be used on any connected device. It can be used by owners of new or previously sold Mitsubishi vehicles within a five-year warranty period. Renault SA partner Nissan Motor Co. owns a controlling stake in Mitsubishi, but company officials say there are no plans so far to introduce the app to other brands in the auto-maker group. Mitsubishi sold just over 100,000 vehicles in North America in 2017, the most in five years but well below its peak vehicle sales of 345,000 in 2002.

Similar app-based programs are offered by insurers such as Progressive Corp., Allstate Corp. and State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. Auto makers have also linked their fee-based dashboard telematics services, which connect vehicles to the internet via modems, including General Motors Co.'s OnStar, Ford Motor Co.'s SYNC and Subaru Corp.'s StarLink systems, to select insurers' programs. Ford also has a smartphone app for sharing driving data with insurers.

These initiatives "https://www.wsj.com/articles/car-insurers-find-tracking-devices-are-a-tough-sell-1452476714" in a big way with American drivers due in part to privacy concerns, even though they can result in discounted insurance rates. Less than 4% of U.S. auto insurance policies linked to dynamic-driving data last year, but market research firm Berg Insight estimates that will grow steadily to more than 10% by 2021.

Trade Dispute Hits China's Debt Efforts

The U.S.-China tariff fight is officially hitting businesses as the first round of levies goes into effect. It is also cutting into China's efforts to curb debt.

The government embarked on a campaign about two years ago to rein in financial risk, with measures aimed at controlling debt in the financial system. Analysts were hopeful Beijing was getting more serious about fighting debt in the broader economy.

The focus of China's leadership has changed significantly in recent months. The trade spat has sent Chinese stock markets tumbling and pressured the value of the yuan. The prospect of several rounds of tariffs will knock a few decimal points off China's economic growth, analysts say. All this puts authorities in a difficult position to also deal with debt.

A "https://bit.ly/2KTqy2f" on a top-level finance meeting this week offered a clue to Beijing's priorities. A three-year plan reviewed by officials included the tasks of preventing major risks and maintaining financial market liquidity, it said. The statement didn't mention debt.

Instead, regulators even raised the issue of "external shocks" and the need to respond to them, according to a "https://bit.ly/2lUFsKF".

Guo Shuqing, the head of the banking and insurance regulator, has also weighed in on trade. The blow to multinationals means the trade war isn't sustainable, he said in a statement Thursday.

The signal from Beijing is that it wants to redistribute debt, but not deleverage in a broad sense, analysts say. "They want to direct liquidity away local government financing vehicles, zombie enterprises and some parts of shadow financing, and move it to productive areas of the economy," said Jonas Short, an analyst at Everbright Sun Hung Kai.

The cooling of efforts to control debt also comes as Beijing has tried to shore up economic growth. In late June, the People's Bank of China reduced the amount of reserves banks are required to keep with the central bank.

The move marked a shift away from tight credit controls imposed in recent years, damping hopes for deleveraging anytime soon.

"I never thought the deleveraging campaign was about overall macro deleveraging," said Chen Long, an analyst with research firm Gavekal Dragonomics. "It's structural deleveraging some leverage goes up, some down."

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Credit Suisse Fined $77 Million Over  Relationship Hires' in Asia

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/credit-suisse-fined-77-million-over-relationship-hires-in-asia-1530805628" to be ensnared by U.S. authorities over the practice of hiring friends and family of Chinese officials, so-called princelings, to win business.

The Switzerland-based bank agreed to pay $77 million to settle charges from the U.S. Justice Department and Securities and Exchange Commission over the use of "relationship hires" between 2007 and 2013 that helped its Hong Kong subsidiary secure business, in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.

The Hong Kong unit "engaged in a corrupt scheme to win business with Chinese state-owned entities by hiring friends and family of Chinese government officials, generating the bank at least $46 million in profits," Acting Assistant Attorney General John Cronan said in a statement Thursday.

JPMorgan Asks Several Dozen Employees to Move Due to Brexit

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgan-asks-several-dozen-staff-to-move-due-to-brexit-1530813816" of employee relocations across Europe related to Brexit, according to an internal memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

The bank has asked several dozen employees across business lines to consider relocation as it plans to boost its presence in existing European branches, including Paris, Madrid and Milan, according to the Thursday memo.

Doubts Grow Aramco IPO Will Ever Happen

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/doubts-grow-aramco-ipo-will-ever-happen-1530813982" of Saudi Arabia's state oil company, a centerpiece of the government's plan to open its economy, have stalled, leaving government officials and people close to the process doubting that it will go forward at all.

The initial public offering of Saudi Arabian Oil Co., better known as Aramco, was meant to be the cornerstone of the kingdom's plan to be less reliant on oil. It would create the largest public company in the history of capital markets, an opportunity coveted by Wall Street's biggest names.

Yet doubts have crystallized in recent months, after two years of work to prepare Aramco for its debut. Saudi officials and people close to the process say the company and the country simply aren't ready for an IPO that could raise $100 billion but also bring unprecedented scrutiny to the kingdom's crown jewel.

"Everyone is almost certain it is not going to happen," said a senior executive at Aramco, speaking of the IPO.

A Fifth of All Bitcoin Is Missing. These Crypto Hunters Can Help.

According to Chainalysis, a blockchain-analysis firm based in New York City, about a fifth of all bitcoin around $20 billion is lost, most of it permanently. When people purchase bitcoin, the details of their transactions are stored in software called a "wallet," which they can unlock with a personal-identification number. Unlike an ATM PIN, this password can't be recovered easily, since there is no bank to retrieve it.

Analysis: Is the Dollar to Blame for the Global Market Malaise?

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-the-dollar-to-blame-for-the-global-market-malaise-1530804989" and investors retreat from the riskiest assets.

Already, bets on low volatility have blown up, money has fled from Turkey and Argentina in particular and from emerging markets more generally, stocks of the biggest banks are under pressure and Italian bonds have been in turmoil. For the next domino to fall, follow the debt: The banks in highly indebted China, Australia, Sweden and Canada and then on to investment-grade corporate bonds everywhere.

That is the theory of Ian Harnett, chief investment strategist at Absolute Strategy Research. What may seem like unrelated events including the bursting of the bitcoin bubble are symptoms of tighter money, most obvious in Federal Reserve rate rises and the recent jump in the greenback, he says.

The theory stands in contrast to the mainstream explanation: The events are mostly not connected, and where they are, mostly the dollar is not the cause. The dollar rose a lot in a short period, which surely hurt some of the most vulnerable emerging markets. But the rise in the dollar was not the cause of slower growth in Europe and China indeed its strength against the euro was clearly the result of the deceleration in the European economy. Some economies may be going through a soft patch, and a trade war is a true danger, but much of the fall in asset prices reflects hope disappointed.

Mr. Harnett's theory chimes with historical patterns, however. Long periods of easy money have frequently led to excessive risk-taking and large debt build-ups, ending with a bang when monetary conditions start to return to normal. It is not that a stronger dollar caused Italy's political ructions, for example, but that the rise in the dollar has made investors more sensitive to risks, prompting them belatedly to pay attention. One sign that the problem is global: stocks of the big banks rated as globally systemically important are, on average, down more than 20% from their peaks of the past 12 months.

Malaysia Is on the Path to Transparency

The arrest of Malaysia's former Prime Minister Najib Razak as part of a multibillion-dollar corruption probe "was an important step toward transparency and justice" in a country "where graft is commonplace in the highest echelons of government," "https://wapo.st/2Kx6GFU". "Malaysian authorities should move forward with the case carefully" because "Mr. Najib still has supporters across the country, so any sign that his prosecution is being mishandled could cause unrest and undermine the investigative efforts of other countries," the board writes. The board also suggested steps the Malaysian government can take "to ensure that corruption is addressed at all levels of government."

Conquering the great digital frontier, like any other frontier, requires a particular kind of sacrifice.

Step forward Daniel Kalt, a chief economist (and regional chief investment officer) at UBS Wealth Management, who has bravely offered himself up for digital replication.

The Australian Financial Review this week reports that UBS has created a  digital clone  of Mr Kalt. This means that it has  trained 10advisors in itsBellevue branch in centralZurich, to use the digitalsemblance of MrKalt, who will soon be put it in front of100clients in the private bank .

A part of the Swiss bank's  innovation  strategy, the experiment is being carried out alongside IBM and FaceMe, an artificial intelligence company. It also includes  Fin , a  friendly helper and digital assistant  who appears to have been newly invented, rather than directly conjured from a live human soul.

According to the UBS website:The avatars, which can interact via voice and eye contact with the clients and their advisors, are being deployed to client meetings via a TV screen. The aim is to explore how to create a new frictionless access to UBS's expertise for our clients and to test the acceptance of digital assistants in a wealth management context.

Digital assistants must obviously be accepted, like everyone else. But setting aside all ethical considerations, the experiment is a classic example of a phenomenon now so widespread that it deserves its own name (perhaps the  robot phenomenon ).

It is a phenomenon whereby minor tweaks to communications infrastructure, or some other primarily administrative function, are presented as science-fiction-come-true.

This is closely linked to the tech industry's heavy reliance on hyperbole - a linguistic shift which has even infiltrated the Bank of England. It is usually of particular importance in industries that rely heavily on marketing. Industries like, well, wealth management.

So what exactly will the digital Mr Kalt be doing (while he's at work)? AFR says it will allow the  house view  to be  disseminated to a broader range of clients than would be able [to] get access to Mr Kalt's human form .

In case you're wondering what this view might be, here is Mr Kalt, on CNN Money in April. We can't clarify which exact version this is, but it's definitely digital.

Hiring at private U.S. employers grew less than expected in June, according to a report, as businesses struggled to find qualified workers.

Firms across the country added 177,000 workers last month, according to payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody's Analytics.

Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected the addition of 185,000 jobs in June.

The health-care sector led the job growth by adding 37,000 jobs as the labor market continued to move closer to full employment, the report said.

"Business' number one problem is finding qualified workers," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. "At the current pace of job growth, if sustained, this problem is set to get much worse. These labor shortages will only intensify across all industries and company sizes."

Growth in medium-size businesses in June outpaced job gains at small and large businesses.

The ADP report is based on private-payroll data in addition to government data.

The ADP report comes ahead of the monthly jobs report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday. Economists expect nonfarm jobs to rise by 195,000 for June, compared with a gain of 223,000 the prior month.

Regulator warns on European banks  reliance on cloud computing

The use of cloud computing by banks for increasingly core services could present a risk to the financial system because so many institutions rely on a few key providers, the European Union s regulator of regulators has warned.

In a report published on Tuesday the European Banking Authority highlighted the use of the cloud as one of seven key risks and opportunities for the banking sector presented by technology, along with blockchain technology and the use of so-called Big Data for credit scoring.

Banks  outsourcing risk using the cloud  could be also considered important, not only from the point of view of individual institutions but also at an industry or systemic level, as large suppliers of cloud services could become a single point of failure should many institutions rely on them,  the EBA report reads.

 Additionally, a possible impact on the wider operational risk could arise from issues with data security, systems and banking secrecy, especially when cloud services are hosted in jurisdictions subject to different laws and regulations from the institution. 

Banks  use of the cloud is increasingly a concern for regulators on both sides of the Atlantic but so is lenders  legacy IT systems, which have thrown up a host of operational issues, with recent outages leaving hundreds of thousands of customers locked out of their accounts. The Bank of England and the UK s Financial Conduct Authority are expected to outline their expectations of banks  so-called operational resilience later this week.

The EBA published two reports on fintech on Tuesday, intended to highlight trends that present both risk and reward for incumbent banks. The idea is to stimulate discussion among banking watchdogs, the EBA said, rather than propose any particular policy for now.

As well as the cloud, another key area it discussed was the increasing use of distributed ledger technology, or DLT, which underpins crypto assets. The EBA studied how it is being deployed in trade finance. It said while it should reduce costs and potentially  enhance the customer experience , there were data privacy and governance concerns.

Separately, the FCA announced on Tuesday that 29 fintech companies had successfully gained access to a programme that allows companies to test new products with temporary FCA authorisation. Of these, 40 per cent are using DLT, the FCA said.

The FCA also accepted a  small number  of firms testing cryptoassets.  We are keen to explore whether, in a controlled environment, consumer benefits can be delivered while effectively managing the associated risks,  the FCA said.

US FDIC wins largest ever damages award against an accounting firm

PwC has been ordered to pay $625m over its role auditing the collapsed US lender Colonial Bank, in the largest damages award ever made against an accounting firm.

A court on Monday said PwC should pay damages to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which lost an estimated $2.8bn from the failure of Colonial in 2009. PwC audited the parent company Colonial BancGroup.

The firm said it would appeal the award.

In absolute terms, such a payout would be the industry s largest on record, according to the research group Audit Analytics. It would top a $456m settlement that KPMG reached with the US Department of Justice in 2005 over tax avoidance schemes.

Colonial s failure was caused by what the court described as a  massive fraud  orchestrated by some executives at the bank along with Taylor, Bean & Whitaker, the now-defunct mortgage group that was its largest customer.

Barbara Jacobs Rothstein, US District Judge in Alabama, had earlier accepted that PwC had been duped by determined fraudsters. However, she said the firm had failed to perform adequate checks.

On Monday, she found that PWC s  negligence  meant the FDIC was entitled to $625m in damages.

Phil Beck of Bartlit Beck, who represented the firm, said:  PwC US is disappointed by today s ruling and we don t believe the FDIC is entitled to the recovery of any damages. 

He said the court had previously found  that numerous employees at Colonial actively and substantially interfered with our audits. We intend to pursue an appeal of this matter at the earliest opportunity. 

The FDIC declined to comment.

Alphabet joins funding for scooter start-up Lime

Alphabet is joining a $300m funding round for electric scooter start-up Lime, adding to an increasingly complex web of deals in transport and "smart city" ventures by the internet company and Larry Page, its cofounder.

The holding company of Google and Waymo is investing directly in the scooter start-up in addition to its own venture-capital arm, GV, according to people familiar with the financing. Formerly known as Google Ventures, GV acts like a traditional Silicon Valley venture capital fund and is leading Lime's round.

By injecting a similar sum to that put in by GV, Alphabet is adding to a small number of deals it has backed directly at the holding company level   even though it already has a number of other internal funding vehicles to handle outside investments. Other Alphabet investments include SpinLaunch, which is developing a space catapult, and United Masters, which is using data analytics to reinvent the music label. The round values Lime at about $800m, or $1.1bn including the funds raised, according to people with knowledge of the terms. Spokespeople for Lime, Alphabet and GV all declined to comment. Axios had reported GV's investment in Lime earlier this month but Alphabet's additional involvement has not previously been disclosed.

The two-pronged investment highlights the growing complexity in the way Alphabet is putting some of its excess cash to work in search of future growth.

It has another investment vehicle for later-stage investments, called CapitalG, and Google itself makes direct investments in other companies. Google set up its own artificial intelligence fund, Gradient Ventures, last year, backing the kind of early-stage start-ups that might otherwise have been expected to get money from GV.

"You definitely want Alphabet to be aggressive in making big bets in the future: it's the only way to sustain above-average growth in the long term," said Youssef Squali, an internet analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.

Salesforce chief backs marine insurance start-up Windward

Insurance

Marc Benioff, founder and chief executive of cloud computing company Salesforce, has joined investors backing Windward   a group aiming to shake up the marine insurance world.

Marine insurance is often seen as one of the more traditional parts of specialist insurance, with decisions made by individual underwriters without the same volume of data that is available elsewhere.

Windward hopes that its tracking and analysis technology will be used by insurers to make detailed decisions about the sort of risks that each individual ship is running.

Mr Benioff has joined a $16.5m funding round for the company. The round was led by XL Innovate, the venture capital arm of insurer XL Group.

Israel-based Windward has already attracted some big names including John Browne, former BP chief executive, David Petraeus, former CIA director, and Tom Glocer, former chief executive of Thomson Reuters.

Ami Daniel, Windward's chief executive, said: "We gather and build data from around the world such as nautical charts, port complexity analysis and shipping data and create a true picture of what is happening. We are using artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict whether a ship or portfolio will have an accident or accidents."

He added: "There is a tremendous amount of expertise in the insurance market, but risk models are very much based on past claims, the weight of the vessel and the domicile."

Mr Daniel said that attracting big name investors helped the company to build credibility with clients.

"Insurance companies and governments don't necessarily want to work with a start-up out of a garage. A big part of getting round the table is being seen as credible."

Tom Hutton, the managing partner of XL Innovate who is to join the Windward board, said the company had the potential to grow strongly in marine insurance.

"The marine sector is substantial, and exemplified by not being particularly data- or tech-enhanced compared to other areas of underwriting such as property, motor or life insurance," he said.

"The industry has worked in the same way for a long time."

XL Innovate's investment did not necessarily mean that the fund's parent company, insurer XL Catlin, would use Windward's system although Mr Hutton said: "We have every expectation that XL Catlin will become a client, as will other companies."

Tech's  Dirty Secret': The App Developers Sifting Through Your Gmail; Software developers scan hundreds of millions of emails of users who sign up for email-based services

Google said a year ago it would "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-to-stop-reading-users-emails-to-target-ads-1498247136" for information to personalize advertisements, saying it wanted users to "remain confident that Google will keep privacy and security paramount."

But the internet giant continues to let hundreds of outside software developers scan the inboxes of millions of Gmail users who signed up for email-based services offering shopping price comparisons, automated travel-itinerary planners or other tools. Google does little to police those developers, who train their computers and, in some cases, employees to read their users' emails, a Wall Street Journal examination has found.

One of those companies is Return Path Inc., which collects data for marketers by scanning the inboxes of more than two million people who have signed up for one of the free apps in Return Path's partner network using a Gmail, Microsoft Corp. or Yahoo email address. Computers normally do the scanning, analyzing about 100 million emails a day. At one point about two years ago, Return Path employees read about 8,000 unredacted emails to help train the company's software, people familiar with the episode say.

In another case, employees of Edison Software, another Gmail developer that makes a mobile app for reading and organizing email, personally reviewed the emails of hundreds of users to build a new feature, says Mikael Berner, the company's CEO.

Letting employees read user emails has become "common practice" for companies that collect this type of data, says Thede Loder, the former chief technology officer at eDataSource Inc., a rival to Return Path. He says engineers at eDataSource occasionally reviewed emails when building and improving software algorithms.

"Some people might consider that to be a dirty secret," says Mr. Loder. "It's kind of reality."

Neither Return Path nor Edison asked users specifically whether it could read their emails. Both companies say the practice is covered by their user agreements, and that they used strict protocols for the employees who read emails. eDataSource says it previously allowed employees to read some email data but recently ended that practice to better protect user privacy.

Google, a unit of Alphabet Inc., says it provides data only to outside developers it has vetted and to whom users have explicitly granted permission to access email. Google's own employees read emails only "in very specific cases where you ask us to and give consent, or where we need to for security purposes, such as investigating a bug or abuse," the company said in a written statement.

This examination of email data privacy is based on interviews with more than two dozen current and former employees of email app makers and data companies. The latitude outside developers have in handling user data shows how even as Google and other tech giants have touted efforts to tighten privacy, they have left the door open to others with different oversight practices.

Facebook Inc. for years let outside developers gain access to its users' data. That practice, which Facebook has said it stopped by 2015, spawned a scandal when the social-media giant this year said it suspected one developer of "https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebooks-lax-data-policies-led-to-cambridge-analytica-crisis-1521590720". The episode led to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/attorneys-general-profoundly-concerned-over-facebook-user-data-1522090027" in the U.S. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-woman-who-is-reining-in-americas-technology-giants-1522856428" over how internet companies protect user information.

There is no indication that Return Path, Edison or other developers of Gmail add-ons have misused data in that fashion. Nevertheless, privacy advocates and many tech industry executives say opening access to email data risks similar leaks.

For companies that want data for marketing and other purposes, tapping into email is attractive because it contains shopping histories, travel itineraries, financial records and personal communications. Data-mining companies commonly use free apps and services to hook users into giving up access to their inboxes without clearly stating what data they collect and what they are doing with it, according to current and former employees of these companies.

Gmail is especially valuable as the world's dominant email service, with 1.4 billion users. Nearly two-thirds of all active email users globally have a Gmail account, according to comScore, and Gmail has more users than the next 25 largest email providers combined. The data miners generally have access to other email services besides Gmail, including those from Microsoft and Verizon Communications Inc.'s Oath unit, formed after the company acquired email pioneer Yahoo. Those are the next two largest email providers, according to comScore.

Oath says access to email data is considered "on a case-by-case basis" and requires "express consent" from users. A Microsoft spokeswoman says it is committed to protecting customers' privacy and that its terms of use for developers prohibit accessing customer data without consent, and provide guidelines for how data can and can't be used. Neither company's privacy or developer policies mention allowing people to see user data.

Google's developer agreement prohibits exposing a user's private data to anyone else "without explicit opt-in consent from that user." Its rules also bar app developers from making permanent copies of user data and storing them in a database.

Developers say Google does little to enforce those policies. "I have not seen any evidence of human review" by Google employees, says Zvi Band, the co-founder of Contactually, an email app for real-estate agents. He says Contactually has never had employees review emails with their own eyes.

Google said it manually reviews every developer and application requesting access to Gmail. The company checks the domain name of the sender to look for anyone who has a history of abusing Google policies, and reads the privacy policies to make sure they are clear. "If we ever run into areas where disclosures and practices are unclear, Google takes quick action with the developer," a spokesman said.

Google says it lets any user revoke access to apps at any point. Business users of Gmail can also restrict access to certain email apps to the employees in their organization, the company said, "ensuring that only apps that have been vetted and are trusted by their organization are used."

Google has contended with privacy concerns since it launched Gmail in 2004. The company's software scanned email messages and sold ads across the top of inboxes related to their content. That year, 31 privacy and consumer groups "https://www.privacyrights.org/blog/thirty-one-privacy-and-civil-liberties-organizations-urge-google-suspend-gmail" to Google co-founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin saying the practice "violates the implicit trust of an email service provider." Google responded that other email providers were already using computers to scan email to protect against spam and hackers, and that showing ads helped offset the cost of its free service.

While some users complained the ads were creepy, people signed up for Gmail in droves.

Between 2010 and 2016, Google faced at least three lawsuits, brought by student users of Google apps as well as a broader set of email users, who accused it of violating federal wiretapping laws. Google, in its legal defense, emphasized that its privacy policy for Gmail said that "no human reads your email to target ads or related information to you without your consent." Google settled one of the lawsuits; the other two were dismissed.

In 2014, Google said it would "https://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/04/30/google-stops-scanning-student-gmail-accounts-for-ads/", business and government users. In June of last year, it said it was halting all Gmail scanning for ads.

Meanwhile, Google in 2014 started promoting Gmail as "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-opens-gmail-making-it-more-of-a-platform-for-developers-1403719202" to leverage the contents of users' email to develop apps for such productivity tasks as scheduling meetings. A new Gmail version launched this spring adds a link next to inboxes to a curated menu of 34 add-ons, including one that offers to track users' outgoing emails to report whether recipients open them.

Google says apps make Gmail more useful. Turning Gmail into a platform emulates Microsoft's Windows and Apple Inc.'s iPhone, which attracted outside developers to make their software more useful to corporate users.

Google doesn't disclose how many apps have access to Gmail. The total number of email apps in the top two mobile app stores, for Apple's iOS and Android, jumped to 379 last year, from 142 five years earlier, according to researcher App Annie. Most can link to Gmail and other major providers.

Almost anyone can build an app that connects to Gmail accounts using Google's software called an application programming interface, or API. When Gmail users open one of these apps, they are shown a button asking permission to access their inbox. If they click it, Google grants the developer a key to access the entire contents of their inbox, including the ability to read the contents of messages and send and delete individual messages on their behalf. Microsoft also offers API tools for email.

With Gmail, the developers who get this access range from one-person startups to large corporations, and their processes for protecting data privacy vary.

Return Path, based in New York, gains access to inboxes when users sign up for one of its apps or one of the 163 apps offered by Return Path's partners. Return Path gives the app makers software tools for managing email data in return for letting it peer into their users' inboxes.

Return Path's system is designed to check if commercial emails are read by their intended recipients. It provides customers including Overstock.com Inc. a dashboard where they can see which of their marketing messages reached the most customers. Overstock didn't respond to a request for comment.

Marketers can view screenshots of some actual emails with names and addresses stripped out to see what their competitors are sending. Return Path says it doesn't let marketers target emails specifically to users.

Navideh Forghani, 34 years old, of Phoenix, signed up this year for Earny Inc., a tool that compares receipts in inboxes to prices across the web. When Earny finds a better price for items its users purchase, it automatically contacts the sellers and obtains refunds for the difference, which it shares with the users.

Earny had a partnership with Return Path, which connected its computer scanners to Ms. Forghani's email and began collecting and processing all of the new messages that arrived in her inbox. Ms. Forghani says she didn't read Earny's privacy policy closely and has never heard of Return Path. "It is definitely concerning," she says of the information collection.

Matt Blumberg, Return Path's chief executive, says users are given clear notice that their email will be monitored. All of Return Path's partner apps mention the email monitoring on their websites, he says, and Earny's privacy policy states that Return Path would "have access to your information and will be permitted to use that information according to their own privacy policy."

Oded Vakrat, Earny's CEO, says his company doesn't sell or share data with any outside companies. Earny users can opt out of Return Path's email monitoring, he says. "We are actively looking for ways to improve and go above and beyond with how we communicate our privacy policy," he says.

Return Path says its computers are supposed to strip out personal emails from what it sends into its system by examining senders' domain names and searching for specific words, such as "grandma." The computers are supposed to delete such emails.

In 2016, Return Path discovered its algorithm was mislabeling many personal emails as commercial, according to a person familiar with the matter. That meant millions of personal messages that should have been deleted were passing through to Return Path's servers, the person says.

To correct the problem, Return Path assigned two data analysts to spend several days reading 8,000 emails and manually labeling each one, the person says. The data helped train the company's computers to better distinguish between personal and commercial emails.

Return Path declined to comment on details of the incident, but said it sometimes lets employees see emails when fixing problems with its algorithms. The company uses "extreme caution" to safeguard privacy by limiting access to a few engineers and data scientists and deleting all data after the work is completed, says Mr. Blumberg.

Jules Polonetsky, CEO of the nonprofit Future of Privacy Forum, says he thinks users want to know specifically whether humans are reviewing their data, and that apps should explain that clearly.

At Edison Software, based in San Jose, Calif., executives and engineers developing a new feature to suggest "smart replies" based on emails' content initially used their own emails for the process, but there wasn't enough data to train the algorithm, says Mr. Berner, the CEO.

Two of its artificial-intelligence engineers signed agreements not to share anything they read, Mr. Berner says. Then, working on machines that prevented them from downloading information to other devices, they read the personal email messages of hundreds of users with user information already redacted along with the system's suggested replies, manually indicating whether each made sense.

Neither Return Path nor Edison mentions the possibility of humans viewing users' emails in their privacy policies.

Mr. Berner says he believes Edison's privacy policy covers this practice by telling users the company collects and stores personal messages to improve its artificial-intelligence algorithms. Edison users can opt out of data collection, he says. The practice, he says, is similar to a telephone company technician listening to a phone line to make sure it is working.

Insurers Ready to Take On Storm Season

By Mengqi Sun and Leslie Scism

Major Atlantic Ocean hurricanes, California wildfires and Mexico earthquakes made 2017 one of the costliest years ever for insurers. But even that slate of disasters wasn't enough to dent insurers' fat capital cushions.

The U.S. property-casualty industry held $752.5 billion in surplus at the end of 2017, a 7.4% increase from the year before, according to Verisk Analytics' ISO and the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America. Global reinsurance capital stood at $605 billion, 2% higher than the prior year, according to Aon PLC's reinsurance brokers.

All that capital positions these industries -- and their policyholders -- well for any hurricanes in the next few months of the often make-or-break Atlantic season, even if third- and fourth-quarter earnings are wiped out. Capital is the money that insurers have on hand that isn't required to back existing obligations.

For primary insurers selling policies to individuals and businesses, the reinsurance helps further. Reinsurers essentially act as insurers for other insurance companies, paying the cost of claims on policies issued by primary insurers once they reach contractual, designated levels. Global reinsurance companies bore much of the financial costs from Hurricane Irma in Florida last year.

"If you look back toward the events last year . . . and think about the implications for capital, for many companies -- and that would include insurers and reinsurers -- it was simply an earnings event for the year," said Paul Schultz, chief executive of Aon Securities. "The losses . . . didn't really cut into their capital base."

For the year, global insured catastrophe losses were about 160% higher than the average of $51 billion for such losses from 2000 to 2016, according to Wells Fargo Securities. Private-sector insurers' and reinsurers' payments on claims are estimated at $124 billion to $134 billion.

Those losses pushed net income at private U.S. property-casualty insurers down to $36.1 billion, compared with $42.9 billion in 2016, according to PCI and ISO. Helping offset some of the pain from the disasters, insurers posted steady returns on their investment portfolios and solid results in many product lines that weren't exposed to the storms.

Big car and home insurer Allstate Corp., for instance, posted net profit of $3.07 billion for the year, even as catastrophe losses reached $3.23 billion. Its bottom line benefited from premium growth and other improvements in the company's car-insurance operations, among other factors.

Also helping keep capital so robust is the simple fact that pension funds, hedge funds and other big investors continue to deploy money into the industry through "catastrophe bonds" and other reinsurance vehicles. With interest rates remaining low globally since the 2008 financial crisis, many yield-hungry investors are buying these securities in search of better returns than traditional fixed-income holdings.

Outside investors added another $8 billion last year, bringing the total of alternative capital to $89 billion at the end of 2017, according to Aon Securities.

Outstanding cat bonds and other insurance-linked securities totaled $32.8 billion as of March 31, representing growth of about $1.8 billion since the end of 2017, according to data from researcher Artemis provided by Wells Fargo Securities. Sophisticated investors buy these high-yielding securities with the understanding that they could lose some or all of their principal to help pay claims if a specified type of disaster occurs in a designated region. Cat-bond issuance in the first quarter was $4.24 billion, or about $2.4 billion above the 10-year first-quarter average, according to the Artemis data.

The continued appetite was "part of the reason that reinsurance rates probably didn't climb as much as a lot of market participants thought it would," said James Lynch, chief actuary at the trade group Insurance Information Institute.

Some executives and analysts last fall predicted that premium rates on property catastrophe reinsurance in hurricane-prone areas would rise to 20%. But premium rates increased much more modestly, analysts and brokers say.

For instance, the risk-adjusted Florida Property-Catastrophe Rate-on-Line Index, which shows the reinsurance rate for the region and is one of the indexes reflective of the marketplace, rose 1.2% this year, as calculated by brokerage firm JLT Re.

Outside of the hurricanes, wildfires and other disasters, a lot of things went right for primary insurers to explain their improved fortunes.

The industry's capital declined in 2017 from the second quarter to the third, but "earnings and investment income throughout the rest of the year helped the industry reach higher capital levels" than at the start of the year, according to Elyse Greenspan, an insurance-stock analyst with Wells Fargo Securities.

Alphabet adds to transport bets with scooter deal

Google parent s stake in Lime highlights complex, overlapping investment strategy

Alphabet is joining a $300m funding round for electric scooter start-up Lime, adding to an increasingly complex web of deals in transport and  smart city  ventures by the internet company and Larry Page, its co-founder.

The holding company of Google and Waymo is investing directly in the scooter start-up in addition to its own venture-capital arm, GV, according to people familiar with the financing. Formerly known as Google Ventures, GV acts like a traditional Silicon Valley venture capital fund and is leading Lime s round.

By injecting a similar amount to that put in by GV, Alphabet is adding to a small number of deals it has backed directly at the holding company level   even though it already has a number of other internal funding vehicles to handle outside investments. Other Alphabet investments include United Masters, which is using data analytics to reinvent the music label.

The round values Lime at about $800m, or $1.1bn after including the funds raised, according to people with knowledge of the terms. Spokespeople for Lime, Alphabet and GV all declined to comment. Axios had reported GV s investment in Lime earlier this month but Alphabet s additional involvement has not previously been disclosed.

The two-pronged investment highlights the growing complexity in the way Alphabet is putting some of its excess cash to work in search of future growth.

It has another investment vehicle for later stage investments, called CapitalG, and Google itself makes direct investments in other companies. Google set up its own artificial intelligence fund, Gradient Ventures, last year, backing the kind of early-stage start-ups that might otherwise have been expected to get money from GV.

The bewildering array of apparently overlapping investment vehicles was another example of Alphabet s failure to disclose enough to shareholders, said Youssef Squali, an internet analyst at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.  We need to understand the logic of having four sources of investment,  he said.

Mr Squali added that Alphabet shareholders were showing growing interest in the company s so-called other bets   the name it gives to long-range investments in new businesses beyond Google   and they were likely to support the apparent proliferation of new investment conduits.

 You definitely want Alphabet to be aggressive in making big bets in the future, it s the only way to sustain above-average growth in the long term,  he said.

Together, CapitalG, GV and Gradient invested in more than 100 deals in 2017, according to Crunchbase, making the group the most active corporate investor last year.

Others in Silicon Valley who have invested alongside Alphabet say the holding company typically gets involved directly in deals that are considered strategic to the group s business. That could point to deeper ties with Lime in future and give it a powerful ally in the intensely competitive scooter-sharing business. Lime s main rival Bird announced last week it had raised $300m from venture investors including Sequoia and Accel.

However, the deal with Lime could also present conflicts with existing investments elsewhere within the Alphabet group.

GV was an early investor in Uber, while Alphabet also has a stake in rival Lyft through Capital G. Both Uber and Lyft have signalled their interest in entering the scooter market, which threatens to take away ride-sharing customers for shorter trips around town. Lime is already competing with Uber and Lyft, as well as several other companies, for a permit to operate a scooter service in San Francisco.

Then there is Waymo, Alphabet s autonomous driving company, and Sidewalk Labs, its  smart cities  unit that already has various projects focused on tackling urban transit.

The growing range of investments reflects a longstanding interest on the part of Mr Page in backing more effective forms of transport and finding ways to make cities operate more efficiently. At times that has spilled over into personal investments beyond Alphabet, such as Mr Page s flying car start-up, Kitty Hawk.

This has been updated to remove a reference to Alphabet directly investing in SpinLaunch, which is developing a space catapult. In fact, GV invested in SpinLaunch.

Startup Helps Companies Count Office Workers, But Maintain Privacy; Startup Density raised $12 million in Series B funding round led by Founders Fund

Density Inc. founder Andrew Farah wanted to know how many people were at his favorite Syracuse, N.Y., coffee shop.

But he soon found arriving at an answer wasn't so easy. He tried tracking how many devices were accessing the store's Wi-Fi, but that wasn't accurate since people carry multiple devices. He considered using a camera, but there were privacy concerns.

Several years later, Mr. Farah is shipping Density sensors. The technology he developed can anonymously count how many people are using a room in an office, without saving data about who they are or what they look like.

The company has raised $12 million in Series B funding led by Founders Fund, with participation from Upfront Ventures, Ludlow Ventures, Yammer Chief Executive David Sacks and Jason Calacanis. The company is shipping its sensors as European Union data protection rules and the recent Cambridge Analytica scandal have ratcheted up public attention on privacy issues.

Mr. Farah initially envisioned his product in small businesses like coffee shops, but the company is now focused on Fortune 500 enterprises. These businesses use the people-counting data to determine if their existing office space is overcrowded or under-utilized.

They can use this when making real estate decisions and planning office spaces. Some companies have even used Density to measure how many employees are coming to lunch on a given day, allowing them to better plan how much food they need to prepare.

The company markets its sensor as "the anti-camera" because it uses depth data rather than images to determine when people come in and out of a room. Many companies are highly sensitive about having them in certain meeting rooms or using them to track employees, Mr. Farah said.

"Cameras in conference rooms for meetings is extremely common," he said. "But streaming analytics on top of that is essentially taboo. Even if people are comfortable having a camera in a room, it tracking them creeps out culture."

Founders Fund Partner Cyan Bannister previously worked in cybersecurity, and her interest in privacy contributed to her decision to invest in Density, she said. She also invested in Brave, a secure ad-blocking browser.

"I don't know about you but I feel really uncomfortable being in a space where there's a camera pointed at me," she said.

Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly said Density's latest round was a Series A. The funding was a Series A round. (July 2, 2018)

Domo Shares Rise in First Day of Trading; CEO says IPO "best way to finance" company

Domo Inc. shares jumped in their first day of trading Friday, as investors swept aside concerns about the business analytics software company's financial outlook.

Naysayers predicted a poor showing by Domo, but after "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ipo-gives-domo-urgent-cash-1530242950?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1", the company's stock price closed at $27.30, a 30% increase.

While it was a good first day for investors, Domo went public with a market value of $524 million. That is well below the $2.3 billion at which private investors valued the company last year.

At $27.30 a share, Domo's market capitalization is approaching $700 million.

Private investment rounds included financing from BlackRock, Institutional Venture Partners, Benchmark and GGV Capital.

Domo's cash position prompted concerns by some observers. The company had less than $72 million in the bank as of April 30.

Founder and Chief Executive Josh James said in an interview that the more than $193 million raised in the IPO improves the company's cash position. Domo had negative cash flow of $148.7 million in its most recent year.

Mr. James said "there were lots of ways to finance" Domo, but that the IPO is a "really efficient form."

One bright spot in Domo's finances is that its top line is growing. Revenue jumped to $108.5 million from $74.5 million in its most recent fiscal year. Net loss narrowed to $176.6 million from $183.1 million this year.

This wasn't the first IPO for Mr. James. He also co-founded Omniture Inc., which went public in 2006 and was later acquired by Adobe Systems Inc. for $1.8 billion.

Apple-Samsung armistice, Line to launch crypto exchange, Philips Hue s great outdoors

I can't wait to get my headache pills delivered to me in an Amazon-badged delivery van.

Ok, so I must need my head examining, not cured, to be excited at that prospect, but it's a kludgy way of saying the ecommerce leviathan has just bought an online pharmacy and announced separately plans for its own-brand delivery vans.

The news sent shares in America s biggest drug stores sinking, shortly after the opening bell on Wall Street. Walgreens Boots Alliance dropped 10 per cent, while CVS Health declined 9.5 per cent.

The logistics industry may have been equally worried at the delivery van news, although Amazon was keen to stress it was to cope with increasing demand and it would continue to use traditional carriers such as the US Postal Service.

It will build its own service byencouraging individuals to launch delivery businesses that will lease van fleets from Amazon, which will offer discounts on uniforms, fuel and insurance coverage. It says it wants to keep start-up costs as low as $10,000, with business owners potentially making as much as $300,000 in annual operating profit with fleets of up to 40 vehicles.

This adds to its optionsfor solving the problem of  last mile  deliveries, which include partnerships with General Motors and Volvo for in-car deliveries.

Three Issues on the Corporate Cybersecurity Agenda

Corporate boards, chief executives and cybersecurity specialists are reassessing how they handle sensitive information and respond to potential cybersecurity incidents as they head into the second half of 2018.

Their cybersecurity priorities include both internal and external changes. Internally, Equifax Inc., for example, is modifying how its board oversees cybersecurity matters following a data breach in 2017 that affected more than 147 million U.S. consumers. Other companies are reconsidering whether CISOs should report to the board, the CEO or other technology executives.

Externally, companies including Options Clearing Corp., a Chicago-based equities derivatives clearing organization, have sought to address hardware vulnerabilities reported this year that have affected routers, processing chips and other third-party products across the technology industry.

"A company like ours is not going to be able to test vendor technology at that level," said Mark Morrison, the OCC's senior vice president and chief security officer. Mr. Morrison said he's exploring ways to make it harder for hackers to penetrate the company through third parties. These include using artificial intelligence tools to comb his technology infrastructure for anomalies in activity.

A Bigger Role for Boards. Corporate boards, facing increased scrutiny over how their companies protect consumer data and respond to breaches, are spending more time on cybersecurity issues. Some are reorganizing director duties to ensure the topic is prioritized.

Equifax recently brought in a new director   Scott McGregor, former president and CEO of Broadcom Inc.   to strengthen the board's oversight of data security and technology, according to the company's latest proxy statement.

Equifax now also requires the board's technology committee to coordinate more closely with its audit committee. The technology committee receives regular reports directly from the company's CISO without other senior managers present, according to the proxy statement.

Boards generally should consider forming a committee or subcommittee to oversee cybersecurity, said Jim Pflaging, a principal and business strategy practice leader at The Chertoff Group, a security and risk management advisor.

SailPoint Technologies Holdings Inc., an identity management vendor, created a board-level cybersecurity committee in May, charged with advising management on the effectiveness of the company's security strategy. SailPoint's CIO and CISO are expected to brief the three directors in the group, including Mr. Pflaging, who chairs it. He serves on the board of several technology firms.

SailPoint's committee members plan to review the company's controls and processes for defending and protecting against cybersecurity threats and review budget, investment and staff, according to the group's charter.

Rethinking the Reporting Structure. As boards begin to play a bigger role in corporate cybersecurity, there may be a push for CISOs to report directly to them. That's not wise, said Mr. Pflaging, because directors are supposed to provide guidance about corporate strategy, not the kind of daily management needed to build a strong cyberdefense.

The CEO is often the best boss for the CISO, in part because that setup signals that cybersecurity should be prioritized, said Mr. Pflaging. But that structure does come with a drawback.

"The upside to reporting to the CEO is that you're getting attention at the highest level," said Matt Comyns, managing partner of the cybersecurity practice at executive search firm Caldwell Partners International Inc. "The downside is that the CEO has a lot going on. If you need a lot of support day -to-day as a CISO, you're not going to get it from a CEO."

In some cases, the best scenario is when the CISO reports to the CIO but has a dotted-line relationship to the CEO or the board, according to Mr. Comyns. That keeps the CISO close to the company's technology staff while providing the added benefit of being able to present an unfiltered view to executive leadership.

In a good relationship, the CIO can help security executives get buy-in for initiatives across the company and get support for budget proposals, he said. "If you have a CIO who is pro-security, then two heads are better than one."

Getting the Security Supply Chain In Order. Cybersecurity executives are also scrutinizing how vendors and other third parties protect their data and systems.

Mr. Morrison at OCC said the disclosure in January of two widespread hardware vulnerabilities, called Spectre and Meltdown, illustrated how vendors can be a weak point.

"What we're seeing with the Spectre and Meltdown," he said, "is that adversaries are moving into lower levels of the operating stack to exploit vulnerabilities there."

Companies don't have the time, resources or expertise to rigorously test the security strength of all vendor products, Mr. Morrison said.

"[W]e can't just rip out those chips when Spectre and Meltdown are announced, but we can put more roadblocks in so that if an adversary is attacking, that's more difficult," he said.

To do this, companies should also analyze what a hacker would need to do to infiltrate their systems and what steps the business needs to make to prevent a hack, such as identifying any potential weak points in a firewall, Mr. Morrison said.

Germany are out of the World Cup after losing 2-0 to South Korea. Cue general English bedlam and schadenfreud jokes.

While sad for a Teutonic nation with a proud footballing history, it's also sad for Goldman Sachs' Soccerbot 3000!", which predicted the German nation to carry itself to the World Cup final over 2 weeks ago:

It seems  200,000 models: harnessing recent developments in 'machine learning,'  which generated  1,000,000 possible evolutions [sic] of the tournament to gauge the probability of each team progressing through the rounds  were not quite prepared for the brilliance of Son Heung-min.

UBS Global Wealth Management, who had Germany favourites to win with a spuriously precise 24 per cent chance of victory, may also feel somewhat red in the face.

What was it Mark Haefele, chief investment officer, said again? Oh, here it is:No matter whether they are analyzing global markets or soccer tournaments, people tend to be biased towards local favorites. The same quantitative discipline that the Chief Investment Office applies to investments has proven useful in successfully looking beyond a home bias in portfolios and sports events.

German data start-up Celonis reaches $1bn valuation

Technology

German data analytics start-up Celonis has achieved a $1bn valuation in its latest funding round, as the "process mining" pioneer notches up some of the world's biggest companies as clients.

The Munich-based business, launched in 2011 with  12,500 pooled by its three founders, announced yesterday that it had raised $50m in its series B round from its first-round venture capital backers Accel and 83 North.

Celonis joins a small group of German start-ups to have reached the $1bn milestone. Germany accounts for only four of the world's 242 "unicorns"   private companies with billion-dollar valuations   according to CB Insights. The rest of Europe hosts only seven others, although more have been acquired or gone public, including Spotify.

Process mining takes the flow of information within a company   from invoices and logistics, for example   and visualises it in a way that makes inefficiencies in the business's workflow easier to spot and fix.

Alexander Rinke, co-chief executive, said the software digitises and automates some tasks that previously took consultants months.

"Traditionally what you would have done is hired Ernst & Young or Deloitte to come into the organisation to conduct assessments, visit all the different plants," he said.

"For example, a call centre in a supply operation: you'd do interviews, workshops, try to understand how the processes work. It takes months." Celonis has secured as clients some of the world's most prominent companies, including BMW, General Motors, Vodafone and Dow Chemical. In pharmaceuticals alone it has contracts with Bayer, Novartis, Merck and Roche.

Mr Rinke said its biggest growth area was digital-native groups such as Uber, which began mining data using Celonis this year.

"Think about a business like Uber, with their scale supporting hundreds of millions of rides every year," he said. "Whenever a customer has an issue, they call or text the service centre.

"So there is a tremendous volume in business processes to resolve these issues that we can accelerate or improve."

Laurel Bowden, partner at 83 North, hailed Celonis's "over-delivery" on its goals. "On every measure, [Celonis] has exceeded on their plans," she said. "Not just bookings and growth, but the plan, the road map, their expansion in the US and building out a direct sales force."

Mr Rinke said the company's revenues, which it has not disclosed, had grown at a consistent annual rate of 300 per cent. The Munich headquarters has been moved four times to accommodate the growth, while the company's presence in the US   which started with a New York office in 2016   has grown to include offices in Detroit, San Francisco, Miami and Raleigh. It also has an office in London.

Munich has a growing tech scene, supported by the Technical University and the presence of several global brands, including BMW, Linde, Siemens and Continental, with investments in newly launched companies last year climbing 88 per cent to  4.3bn.

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

Coming up with headlines that will draw readers in isn't just a preoccupation of journalists and editors, but in recent years of Wall Street analysts.

The migration of research to email and online platforms, and the sheer volume of it that investors receive, make it hard to stand out.

So while there is still a place for headlines like "Quarterly Update" and "Price Pressures Rising," to make a splash analysts will try for something with a little more pizazz, or clickbait.

That is where the problems start, as some of these highlights of analyst reports from the second quarter show.

"Charts of Darkness for Apocalypse Dow," from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Yes, Joseph Conrad's 1899 novella "Heart of Darkness" was the inspiration for Francis Ford Coppola's "Apocalypse Now," that "chart" rhymes with "heart" and that "Dow" rhymes with "now." We get it.

"Keep Your Eyes on the Prize," from Evercore ISI. An innocuous title for a note on Blackstone Group, but also the title of song that rose to prominence during the civil-rights movement.

Blackstone chief executive Stephen Schwarzman took home at least $800 million in 2017.

"Getting high on the Fed's supply of reserves," from Citigroup. To be honest, if you are writing about the short-end notes market you probably need all the help you can get.

"Facebook 1Q18 Earnings: No Nipple Slips Here," from MoffettNathanson.

That title was inspired by a comment from Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg about the ability of artificial intelligence to detect nudity better than it now spots hate speech.

AI versus esports, Andreessen Horowitz cryptocurrency fund, death of the telephone

Huawei has been revealed as the biggest corporate sponsor of overseas trips for Australian politicians, my FT colleagues Jamie Smyth and Louise Lucas report today.

The revelation comes just weeks ahead of a closely watched decision on whether the Chinese telecoms group will be allowed to supply equipment for Australia's next-generation mobile network.

A report by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, a defence think-tank, has found that Huawei paid for all or part of 12 trips to China by MPs over the past eight years, which is equivalent to more than one in five of all trips sponsored by companies since 2010.

Commerzbank tests AI to generate research notes as Mifid starts to bite

Commerzbank is experimenting with artificial intelligence technology that automatically generates sports reports to see if it can write basic analysts' research notes, as new regulations force banks across the world to trim research costs.

The German bank is working on the project with Retresco, a content automation company in which it invested two years ago through its fintech incubator unit.

The project is at an early stage and could take years to produce reports that banks would be happy to send to their clients, but the notion of AI replacing human analysts is already attracting attention from senior bankers.

"There's definitely work that can be done, parts of the [research] process that can be enhanced by algos and AI tools," the head of one investment bank told the Financial Times, describing earnings reports as something that "should be robo-written".

The Europe head of another investment bank said that research was an area that was rife for automation, while analysts at several other banks said that their managers were experimenting with AI and automation applications.

Banks are under fierce pressure to cut the costs of producing research on stocks and bonds following the implementation in January of European investor protections known as Mifid II.

The measures force investors to pay for research explicitly instead of bundling its costs into trading commissions. Some firms say their implied research revenue has fallen by as much as 30 per cent as a result.

Equity research on companies' earnings is one of the areas that Retresco and Commerzbank have been focusing on after they analysed the bank's warehouse of research reports and the data behind them.

Michael Spitz, head of Commerzbank's research and development unit Mainincubator, said the area showed promise because "equity research reports reviewing quarterly earnings are structured in similar ways" and the source documents are often prepared under common reporting standards.

That makes it easier for a machine learning programme to extract and contextualise relevant data, which can be then framed in a report using natural language processing tools.

Insurtech sets sights on SMEs

Cluster of start-ups aims to take market share from more traditional insurance companies

For years, personal insurance has dominated the insurtech world. The opportunity to shake up a staid industry by developing snazzy apps offering new ways to buy car, home or travel insurance has pulled in an ever growing number of entrepreneurs and investors.

But as the personal market has got more crowded, the money has flowed elsewhere, and small business insurance has started to grab an increasing amount of attention.

 It is the hottest sector bar none now,  says Nigel Walsh, a partner at Deloitte who specialises in insurance technology.  It is a huge sector to go for, which has been largely untapped. 

A cluster of start-ups is targeting the small business market, fromNext Insurance, CoverWallet and Embroker in the US to Simply Business in the UK. They hope that by offering a convenient online service to harassed start-up owners, they can take market share from more traditional insurance companies and brokers.

Rapid growth at Next Insurance

The big boys of the industry are starting to take notice. Last year Travelers paid 400m for Simply Business, which had been valued at 120m only a year earlier.

In the UK, Direct Line has been working on its Direct Line for Business brand, while Munich Re has put money into Next Insurance.

Not to be left behind, Zurich announced a commercial tie-up with CoverWallet in February, and followed that up with aminority investmentearlier this month. The two are already offering small business insurance together in Spain, and more countries could follow.

Giovanni Giuliani, chief strategy, innovation and business development officer at Zurich, says:  Customers, especially at the small end, are starting to exhibit the same behaviour as retail customers, going online much more than in the past. 

 It is important to have the right model   fast underwriting and standardised solutions but also mastering the differences between businesses,  says Mr Giuliani.  I don t think anyone has done it right yet. 

One of the big opportunities, argues Mr Walsh, is to give small business owners a better understanding of which insurance policies they need to buy.

 There are lots of areas that are essential, but aren t well understood,  he says. Cyber insurance is one example:  If you are a one-man band and you have a cyber attack, how long can you afford not to take payments before you start to have cash flow problems? 

Aoibheann Baskiran, a vice-president at Travelers, sayssmall businesses are increasingly going online to research their needs:  Usually the first port of call is online to understand what the cover is,  she says.  People rely on communities to understand how other companies in their area buy cover. 

The rush into commercial insurancehas its dangers though. One is that, over time, the small business market starts to resemble the retail market where in many countries competition is fierce, marketing spend is huge and policies are bought online on the basis of price only.

 If a lot of capital comes in, it will be a less lucrative segment,  warns Mr Giuliani.

Further fintech fascination

Robot research.First it was the robot traders. Now it is the robot analysts. Commerzbank, working with a company called Retresco, has taken a look at its equity analysts  research reports and decided that a lot of the work can be done by robots. It might take years before the artificial intelligence produces something that the bank can send out to clients, but it could be the future for plain vanilla results analysis. Journalism and computer gaming are among the areas facing disruption from AI. But bankers say the standardised reporting standards of quarterly earnings makes it easier for a machine learning programme to extract and contextualise relevant data, which can be then framed in a report using natural language processing tools. Retresco s original business uses similar technology to write soccer reports in Germany.

Crypto fundAndreessen Horowitz has become the first venture capital firm to raise a large fund focused on cryptocurrencies, as start-up investors search for ways to join a boom that has threatened to pass the traditional VC world by. The Silicon Valley firm said it had raised $300m to back new cryptocurrency-related ideas, including investing directly in the currencies themselves

Beautiful branches.If cash is no longer king, then is there any future for the bank branches that process the notes and coins? Bricks and mortar branches are closing at a rapid rate in some countries but Halifax in the UK (part of Lloyds Banking Group) is out to prove that they still have a role. An experimental branch in London includes coding classes for kids, biometric safe deposit boxes and wall mounted tablets so that customers can contact the online help desk.

Terms of the AppNexus deal, which was announced Monday, weren't disclosed. The Wall Street Journal reported last week AT&T was expected to pay around $1.6 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.

AppNexus offers technology that helps advertisers buy ads, using automated software, across a range of websites and apps. The company also supplies technology to publishers so they can manage and sell ad space on their websites. Its marketplace, which connects both the buyers and sellers of ads, extends into the video and web-connected television space.

The technology could help AT&T capitalize on the media content it added through its recent purchase of Time Warner Inc., owner of CNN, TBS and TNT.

But Brian Lesser, the CEO of AT&T's advertising and analytics group, said in an interview that the company's ambition is not just to help boost ad revenue from its own content but to create a platform that also connects advertisers with audiences from rival media outlets, across television and digital video.

"Right now if you are a buyer at an agency or an advertiser you have lots of great options in front of you in terms of audience-based television and video, but they're not connected," Mr. Lesser said.

AT&T also wants to offer data to allow advertisers to measure the "real performance" of their ad campaigns, such as whether someone who saw an automobile ad on their connected TV walked into a car dealership, Mr. Lesser said.

Several Madison Avenue executives gave a thumbs-up to the deal after reports it was in the works surfaced, predicting it could offer them more "https://www.wsj.com/articles/at-ts-interest-in-ad-tech-gets-thumbs-up-on-madison-avenue-1529692570".

Google took a 31.7% share of the $232.27 billion spent globally on digital advertising last year, according to eMarketer, while Facebook took a 17.9% share. Combined, Google and Facebook accounted for 58.5% of the digital ad dollars spent in the U.S. last year.

After initial reports of AT&T's interest in AppNexus, there were questions in the ad industry about whether the telecom firm would look to maintain AppNexus's services for third-party publishers, or only use its technology to monetize its own content with ads.

A person familiar with the matter says this marketplace will remain, which gives AT&T access to AppNexus's global advertiser and publisher clients and will expand its presence beyond the U.S.

On closing the Time Warner deal earlier this month, AT&T restructured the combined company into four units, including an advertising and analytics division. Mr. Lesser, who was on the board of AppNexus, joined last October from WPP PLC's GroupM media-buying unit to oversee those operations.

AT&T had been sidelined from doing deals while its acquisition of Time Warner was held up by a U.S. Justice Department lawsuit. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-is-set-to-decide-whether-at-t-and-time-warner-can-merge-1528832942" earlier this month.

"We have a lot of ambitions in this area so I wouldn't be surprised if there were other acquisitions, but we've got a lot of great people and great resources right off the bat once we close this deal," said Mr. Lesser.

News Corp, parent of The Wall Street Journal, is an investor in AppNexus, alongside others, including WPP and investment firm TCV. AppNexus was valued at $1.8 billion in a 2015 funding round.

The companies said the transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2018.

Oil Hedge Funds Struggle in Age of Algos; Despite the recent rally in raw materials, hedge funds that trade commodities keep shuttering

Raw materials have staged a powerful rally over the past year, but that hasn't helped some of the biggest commodities hedge funds, which are closing up shop to a degree not seen since at least the turn of the century.

In 2017, closures of commodities hedge funds outnumbered launches for the first time in data going back to 2000, according to data provider Eurekahedge a trend that has continued into this year.

The reason? Investors who were burned by the severe two-year market rout that started in 2014 aren't rushing back, fund managers and traders say, despite prices of commodities, including oil, copper, lumber and cotton, all rebounding to multiyear highs.

The long string of fund closures also reflects "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-up-oil-down-blame-the-algorithms-1499684402", they say, one that is increasingly driven more by algorithms than fundamental information.

This year, longtime oil investor T. Boone Pickens"https://www.wsj.com/articles/t-boone-pickens-calls-it-quits-on-energy-trading-1515754980", BP Capital, and Jamison Capital Partners LP "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jamison-capital-to-close-commodities-hedge-fund-1516925056". In August, legendary oil trader Andrew Hall "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-trader-andrew-hall-is-closing-his-astenbeck-hedge-fund-1501776384" at Astenbeck Capital Management LLC.

The number of commodity funds reporting returns has fallen to an all-time low of 130 this year, compared with a peak of 371 funds in 2011, according to data going back to 2007 from research firm eVestment. That comes as assets under management have rebounded to about $83 billion this year from a low of $66 billion in 2015.

"Hedge funds that exclusively trade commodities are a dying breed," said Chris Solarz, managing director at investment-advisory firm Cliffwater LLC. "The big guys are nonexistent."

Such funds have weathered ebbs and flows before, but a longer-term trend of shuttering could mean that a comeback this time will be more difficult.

Big, bold bets the kind that catapulted traders such as Mr. Hall to fame are now much harder to pull off, money managers say. Some have avoided outright bets on prices going up or down, opting instead for trading off small price inefficiencies.

Some traders have also become wary of erratic moves that seem to defy supply and demand signals. On Friday, U.S. oil prices surged 4.6% to a four-week high, the biggest one-day jump in nearly two years, even as members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries"https://www.wsj.com/articles/opec-meeting-starts-amid-detente-between-saudi-iran-1529661983" confounding analysts and traders.

While computerized trading "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-quants-run-wall-street-now-1495389108" such as stocks, bonds and currencies, commodities which historically have been bought and sold over the phone and require physical delivery and storage have been slow to follow.

Automated trading in energy-related contracts for the first time accounted for more than half of futures volume from late 2014 to late 2016, compared with more than 80% in foreign exchange futures and more than 70% in equities, according to data analysis from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

"The market is evolving. It has created new challenges for hedgers and investors to maintain expected trading performance," said Peter Hahn, co-founder of quantitative research firm Bridgeton Research Group.

Mr. Hahn said many commodity funds are turning to a hybrid approach, mixing fundamental bets and quantitative trading as they looking for new advantages. "It's a matter of adapting and understanding how to trade with those new participants," he said.

Marwan Younes, chief investment officer of Massar Capital Management, favors a broad data-crunching approach rather than have traders well-versed in one specific sector, such as agriculture or natural gas. His fund is up 7.6% this year through May, according to a person familiar with the matter.

"Twenty years ago, if you were to talk to a commodity manager and ask him why should we invest with you, the typical answer would be, 'Well I have all these networks of people and call them for any information I need.' Today, pointing to proprietary information to be your edge is really dubious," Mr. Younes said.

Eric Armitage, the chief executive of London-based East Alpha who started building quantitative models for BP PLC in 2001, said traders have to adapt to changes in available data, for example satellite imagery.

"You can't do this as a dark room quant," he said. "You need to know where the holes are in this data or where this data could be fake."

East Alpha is now dabbling in artificial intelligence, such as using facial-recognition software to spot patterns in market moves.

Years of underperformance in commodities have made it a tough sell, investors said, particularly as other assets such as stocks have soared.

"At the end of the day, returns trump everything else. And commodity hedge fund returns have been abysmal," Cliffwater's Mr. Solarz said.

But with commodity prices on the rise, some fund managers remain convinced that a comeback is just around the corner, and those left in the game are reluctant to completely abandon fundamental analysis.

"Algos, whilst creating volatility, may also take markets to levels that we would not otherwise see," said Luke Sadrian, chief investment officer at Commodities World Capital, a London-based commodity hedge fund. "We still believe that fundamentals are hugely important, but adapt or die."

While algorithms have taken the blame for confounding moves in commodity markets, other fund managers deny they have had a significant impact. And those able to hang on "https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-oil-soars-few-hedge-funds-are-left-to-profit-1528277401" Pierre Andurand's $1.2 billion Andurand Commodities Fund was up more than 16% this year through May, after sustaining heavy losses about the same time last year.

Energy-focused hedge fund BBL Commodities is raising money for "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-hedge-fund-bbl-looks-to-launch-1-billion-macro-fund-1521383520" to wager on macroeconomic trends. BBL also brought on grains and metals traders to gain better insight into those markets and inform other investing strategies.

Founder Jonathan Goldberg said trading exclusively on information that everyone has access to, such as government data and inventory reports, is a fool's errand. "You're not going to be able to click quicker than a machine that is like saying you can deliver a package quicker than Amazon," he said. "Maybe you could have 10 years ago, but you can't now."

How Hackers Use Hidden Tunnels to Steal Data and Avoid Detection

Cybercriminals and state-sponsored hackers, looking for alternatives to conventional forms of attack such as malware, have learned to piggyback on common business applications and protocols to sneak data out of companies, according to a report published Wednesday.

Financial firms especially are at risk of these so-called hidden tunnels, which allow attackers to bypass strong access controls and intrusion detection systems, according to the report from cybersecurity firm Vectra Networks Inc. In the financial sector, there are about 23 hidden tunnels disguised as encrypted web traffic for every 10,000 devices, compared with 11 such tunnels for every 10,000 devices across all industries, the study found.

These tunnels work by blending in with legitimate applications that connect a company's network to outside systems, such as third-party analytics tools, cloud-based financial applications and stock ticker feeds, according to Chris Morales, Vectra's head of security analytics. Hackers can steal large amounts of data using this technique by breaking it down into chunks that are too small to be detected by security tools, he said. They also can encrypt these chunks of data using common protocols, making them harder to spot.

"It's just like taking apart a car, moving it in small pieces and reassembling it on the outside," said Mr. Morales. Hidden tunnels can be created by hackers after they get a foothold into a company's network through, for example, phishing attacks or exploiting an unpatched vulnerability.

Cybercriminals increasingly are using hidden tunnels and other techniques that don't rely on malware, because such methods allow them to evade firewalls and stay in a company's network undetected for long periods of time.

An April report from the cybersecurity firm Mandiant, a unit of FireEye Inc., found that organizations aren't getting faster at detecting and responding to attacks. The global median dwell time -- a measurement of the time between the first signs of a compromise and when a company actually detects it -- slightly increased to 101 days in 2017 from 99 days in 2016, the report found.

Hackers roamed around Equifax Inc.'s network for more than four months before the credit-reporting firm uncovered the massive data breach, The "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hackers-entered-equifax-systems-in-march-1505943617" in September. Those hackers "avoided using certain hacking tools that would expose them to the Equifax security operations team," according to the Vectra report.

The hackers also built a hidden infrastructure of 30 Web shells, which would allow them to run commands remotely on Equifax's network even if the company patched its systems, The Wall Street Journal reported. The hackers likely probed Equifax's systems for months after the initial break-in, according to the article.

"Not being able to find out that your network has been compromised for six or nine months is a nightmare," said John Shaffer, chief information officer at Greenhill & Co., an investment bank specializing in mergers and acquisitions.

Mr. Shaffer said hidden tunnels are particularly worrisome because they're difficult to identify. Companies can mitigate the risk of hidden tunnels by closely monitoring where their data is being sent and maintaining lists of third parties with whom they share data.

Mr. Shaffer said he uses about 15 different security products, including a Vectra service that employs artificial intelligence to analyze metadata and cloud events, to help identify signs of compromise that may not be picked up by traditional tools. Greenhill is considering investing more in machine learning and AI tools over the next year to better spot signs of anomalous user behavior, he said.

AI might be useful at detecting hidden tunnels because it enables companies to automatically scan vast amounts of data   much of which is legitimate   to find unusual activity, according to Vectra.

Mr. Shaffer said he's concerned about attackers surreptitiously stealing sensitive financial information, such as data on unannounced deals, from his company. He said he has found hidden tunnels in his network, but not ones that were associated with any signs of compromise or malicious activity.

"Bad actors are not using the standard techniques anymore to get data out of a company," Mr. Shaffer said. "The trick with hidden tunnels is that if you're using software as a service and cloud-based services, you have tunnels going out to these places to share information. You expect some of it, but you need to make sure your data is going where it's supposed to go."

Steele Compliance Solutions Inc., a risk-management and compliance company backed by Bregal Sagemount, is banking on increasing regulatory scrutiny of money laundering with its latest add-on deal.

San Francisco-based Steele said it acquired TransparINT LLC, which provides software that allows compliance officers at large companies to monitor individuals or organizations. The company does so by using machine learning to continuously scan the internet for negative news or media reports based on certain keywords, said Eric Lochner, Steele's chief executive. The software then uses the results from each customer search to improve and refine future searches.

"It uses machine learning to get smarter and smarter," Mr. Lochner said.

The acquisition fits into one of four main pillars of Steele's business, specifically one focused on anti-money-laundering and monitoring individuals or entities in a company's supply chain. TransparINT was launched by an engineer and coder who developed the software after spending years in the banking industry. TransparINT's management team, led by Chief Executive Keith Graham, will continue to manage the business, Mr. Lochner said.

He said TransparINT will provide Steele greater access to financial institutions, while Steele will provide TransparINT with access to its roughly 550 corporate customers. TransparINT counts four of the 10 largest banks as it clients, according to a news release.

TransparINT is the second business that Steele has acquired since New York firm Bregal Sagemount"https://www.wsj.com/articles/bregal-sagemount-invests-in-compliance-company-steele-1465233245?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=5" in the company in 2016. In the fourth quarter of last year, the company acquired Compliance Wave LLC, which provides a range of short compliance training modules.

Mr. Lochner said he expects to see Steele pursue additional acquisitions, including in the area of cybersecurity.

"We plan on being a consolidator," he said. "It's an exciting time."

Mr. Lochner compared technical innovation taking place in the compliance industry to the wave of consolidation and innovation that occurred in human-resource management in the mid-2000s.

"They were using spreadsheets and printing out resumes, and all of that got automated," he said. "We're seeing the exact same thing with compliance officers today. They are asking themselves  how do I make sure that my company is mitigating the risks and at the same time making sure I get efficiency out of the process?'"

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

What's even smarter than smart beta?

Legendary investor Jim Rogers might have an answer. His Ocean Capital Advisors rolled out the Rogers AI Global Macro ETF earlier last week.

His latest product might have been formed by a global voyage Mr. Rogers once took -- a 22-month motorcycle trip that spanned 52 countries, which helped inform his 2003 book "Investment Biker: Around the World with Jim Rogers."

The new exchange-traded fund invests in other ETFs that track a particular country's stock market. The weighting of those underlying ETFs is determined by a "proprietary artificial intelligence-driven algorithm" that analyzes macroeconomic data to predict future stock-market moves. The algorithm uses that information to decide which country ETFs merit an investment, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Initial large allocations within the fund go to ETFs that mirror markets in Brazil, South Korea, Hong Kong and Mexico. Access to the artificial intelligence won't come cheap for investors: The fund's expense ratio weighs in at 1.18%.

Despite his international bona fides, the pricey ETF is surprising when one considers Mr. Rogers's vision for the future. In a 2012 interview with Steve Forbes, he predicted: "There's going to be a huge shift in American society, American culture, in the places where one is going to get rich. The stockbrokers are going to be driving taxis. The smart ones will learn to drive tractors so they can work for the smart farmers. The farmers are going to be driving Lamborghinis."

Maybe next year.

OCC Security Chief: AI Helps Spot Hackers

Artificial intelligence and data analysis tools are making it easier for cybersecurity executives to understand and fend off threats against their organization, said Mark Morrison, senior vice president and chief security officer at Options Clearing Corp., an equities derivatives clearing organization based in Chicago.

AI helps OCC's roughly 60 security employees protect corporate information by quickly alerting staff to suspicious web connections and possibly malicious software attacks, Mr. Morrison said. This technique can help employees more quickly detect the kind of anomalous behavior that could lead to a data breach, such as a computer overseas seeking access to sensitive files. By analyzing data in this way, AI could improve security for companies that have relied on more traditional tools that require closer human oversight, Mr. Morrison said.

"Historically, you'd rely on manual review and that was a very poor way of doing all of this," he said. "It was inefficient and you missed a lot."

OCC, like many companies, finds that AI tools help spot malicious software that hasn't yet been identified as such and therefore can be overlooked by traditional detection tools. So-called signature-based tools aim to identify known forms of viruses and other malware.

Mr. Morrison discussed with WSJ Pro Cybersecurity the benefits of AI technology. Here are edited excerpts.

What kind of attacks has AI helped OCC detect?

All the new tools aggressively are working on ransomware, which, of course, comes with data encryption or destruction capabilities. For a company like ours that deals in transactions, data destruction is a relatively big issue for us. There are also the normal types of phishing attacks and credential stealing or people who come sit on your network to carry out fraudulent transactions.

Does AI make companies more secure than traditional security technology?

Everybody realizes we have to get past signature-based detection. AI doesn't make assumptions and it allows you to synthesize data more quickly. Right now you get a lot of false positives [from traditional detection tools]. You basically get your analyst from your security operations center getting calls at 2:00 a.m. about anomalous activity. If his alarm goes off too many times, he just shuts it off because he's investigated four or five times already and he thinks it's another false positive. Adversaries actually know this, so they establish a whole bunch of false-flag patterns to lull your analyst into a false sense of what's going on. That's a diversionary tactic to let them hide what they're trying to accomplish. When you go into AI, the systems don't have that human element. They're able to synthesize data and process it and follow the rules you've setup every time.

In what capacity are you using AI tools now?

We're trying to improve our data analytics. In cyber, you have the five big categories of the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework, which are: Identify, protect, detect, respond and recover. Given the sophistication of the adversaries, most folks are doing the best they can in the identify, protect and detect side. They realize that in spite of all their efforts, because of vulnerabilities in their underlying infrastructure, there's a certain probability you're going to get breached at some point by an external adversary.

One of the ideas [in using AI] is that you will be able to quickly &identify that you have been breached, or that you have a rogue insider or whatever the case may be. You have to have automated capabilities to, as quickly as you can, maintain your critical business operations even though you are under attack and then be able to recover from that very quickly. You're trying to reduce the amount of time an adversary is in your network undetected.

What kind of data are these tools examining to reduce that time?

It's everything from all the network flow data going across your network, to your login and account access. You're also looking at where that came from, the IP address where it originated, if you recognize that IP address, whether that's from a corporate or other device, if it's a domain in the United States or outside the U.S., the time it came in and the length of time, the applications or database its trying to access.

If the pattern is anomalous, a lot of these programs encourage you to step up your response -- whether that means increasing monitoring, limiting the data that's available for output, suspending the account and suspending the transaction. You can determine that based on the level of threat and the risk that comes from it.

Banking & Finance: Money Managers Embrace the Quants

Asset managers are paying up to hire data scientists and engineers as part of an effort to help portfolio managers with investment decisions and devise new trading strategies.

Many of these traditional stock- and bond-picking firms want these mathematical and computer experts to dive into pools of data -- and the machine-learning tools that harness that data and other information -- in search of fresh perspectives and blind spots.

At Neuberger Berman Group LLC, its data-science team began this year with big plans, if limited resources.

"Just me and an intern," group head Michael Recce said.

Six months later, the group has added a fifth member to its team of data scientists and engineers as it works through a backlog of projects for the firm's portfolio managers. Neuberger's investment managers have already poached some of Mr. Recce's staff, leading him to recruit replacements.

"Each town needs one," he said, paraphrasing Alexander Graham Bell's famous line predicting the telephone's widespread use.

Data scientists, who have already helped usher media companies, retailers and other old-line industries into the digital age, first arrived at Wall Street banks decades ago as computing power and the complexity of derivatives surged.

They built computer models that traded securities, giving rise to the quantitative-investing field that has changed how markets function.

At asset managers, these data scientists aren't about to outnumber the phones found on the trading floors. But many of these traditional stock- and bond-picking firms are spending millions of dollars to beef up their data-analysis capabilities.

"Most of it is at an early stage, and I don't think it's matured yet," said Onur Erzan, a senior partner at consultant McKinsey & Co. "There will be new sources of data and it will help with investment decisions, but the real question is can an asset manager sustain an edge on those kinds of insights."

Data scientists with advanced degrees from top universities can expect to earn as much as $280,000 a year in an entry-level job at an investment firm, according to Options Group, a Wall Street recruiter. Asset managers aren't just competing with other financial firms for talent, but with "the whole economy," said Michael Karp, Options Group's chief executive. "It's a whole new world."

The push into data arrives at a tenuous period for investment firms as trillions of dollars have flowed into low-cost, index-tracking investments and out of funds in which managers actively buy and sell securities and whose uneven performance could no longer justify the higher fees.

Petter Stensland's foray into data began in late 2012 when, as a junk-bond analyst at AllianceBernstein Holding LP, he needed to analyze the prospects of the many oil-and-gas companies emerging in the nation's energy boom.

For many of these producers, their value -- and their ability to repay their debts -- hinged on how much oil or gas they could pull from the land they owned. The problem was there were no reporting standards on energy reserves, and the producers' own views were subjective, Mr. Stensland said.

Mr. Stensland said he and his team began to compile data from the states' oil-and-gas commissions, stitching together decades of history on oil wells' output in each parcel of land (typically about 640 acres). Building Bertha, the database's chosen name, took 15,000 man-hours. The analyst traveled to industry towns such as Midland, Texas, and Roswell, N.M., where he could copy older data preserved in oil-and-gas libraries' microfilm. By mid-2014, Bertha had persuaded the high-yield investment team that certain producers were at greater risk of defaulting on their debt. The firm sold the shakiest bonds.

Business News: Boardrooms Show Increase In Share of Female Directors

Women are gaining more seats in U.S. boardrooms, though not necessarily those with the most power.

In the first five months of this year, 248, or 31%, of new board directors at the country's 3,000 biggest publicly traded companies were women, according to an analysis of corporate filings by ISS Analytics, the data arm of Institutional Shareholder Services. That is the highest percentage in at least a decade, and puts 2018 on track to be a record year for new female board members.

Shareholder pressure, along with the #MeToo movement, is fueling some of the momentum, board recruiters say. "Some [companies] are being dragged forward on this issue, and others are embracing it," said Julie Hembrock Daum, head of executive-recruitment firm Spencer Stuart's North American board practice.

Big investors such as State Street Global Advisors and BlackRock Inc. are urging companies to diversify their boards and, in some cases, are voting against certain board members at firms with all-male boards. Many investors point to correlations that studies by McKinsey & Co. and other consulting firms and business schools have drawn between greater diversity and enhanced financial returns as reasons for demanding greater female representation on boards. Other firms are bringing more women into the boardroom in the wake of sexual-harassment scandals, or to help prevent them, recruiters say.

Wynn Resorts Ltd. added three women to its board in April after its founder, Steve Wynn, stepped down as chief executive amid sexual-misconduct allegations. Matt Maddox, who succeeded Mr. Wynn as CEO, said at the time that the board appointments signified a "turning point" for the company and were part of an effort to bolster its corporate governance.

Despite the uptick in women directors, companies haven't propelled them at the same rate into leadership roles in the boardroom. Though women occupy 18% of board seats at the 3,000 biggest companies, 10% of lead independent directors are women and 4% of boards are led by a chairwoman, not a chairman, according to the ISS data.

The women who are gaining entry into corporate boardrooms often come with a greater set of skills and qualifications on their resumes than their male counterparts, the ISS analysis found -- a reflection, in part, of the specific expertise boards are increasingly looking for in new directors. A greater proportion of today's women directors have direct experience in finance, technology, sales and legal and government affairs than their male counterparts, though few of them have held the role of CEO.

"It shows there are plenty of qualified women out there," said John Roe, head of ISS Analytics.

Typical of the new class of female board members is Susan Li, vice president of finance at Facebook Inc., who was appointed to Alaska Air Group's board of directors last month.

"With more than a decade of experience in Silicon Valley, Susan Li brings valuable perspective on the digital economy," Alaska Air CEO Brad Tilden said.

The Arms Race for Quants Comes to the World's Biggest Asset Managers; Many traditional stock- and bond-picking firms are paying up to hire mathematical and computer experts

Neuberger Berman Group LLC's data-science team began the year with big plans, if limited resources.

"Just me and an intern," group head Michael Recce said.

Six months later, the group has added a fifth member to its team of data scientists and engineers as it works through a backlog of projects for the firm's portfolio managers. Neuberger's investment managers have already poached some of Mr. Recce's staff, leading him to recruit their replacements.

"Each town needs one," he said, paraphrasing Alexander Graham Bell's famous line predicting the telephone's widespread use.

Data scientists, who have already helped usher media companies, retailers and other old-line industries into the digital age, first arrived at Wall Street banks decades ago as computing power and the complexity of derivatives surged. They built computer models that traded securities, giving "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-quants-run-wall-street-now-1495389108" that has changed how markets function.

At asset managers, these scientists aren't about to outnumber the phones found on the trading floors. But many of these traditional stock- and bond-picking firms are now paying up to hire mathematical and computer experts. They want these recruits to dive into pools of data and the machine-learning tools that harness that data and other information in search of trading ideas and blind spots.

"Most of it is at an early stage, and I don't think it's matured yet," said Onur Erzan, a senior partner at consultant McKinsey & Co. "There will be new sources of data and it will help with investment decisions, but the real question is can an asset manager sustain an edge on those kinds of insights."

Mr. Erzan estimates that many managers are spending, on average, tens of millions of dollars to beef up their data-analysis capabilities. The resources arrive at a tenuous period for investment firms as trillions of dollars have flowed into low-cost, index-tracking investments, and out of so-called active managers whose uneven performance could no longer justify higher fees.

Petter Stensland's foray into data began in late 2012 when, as a junk-bond analyst at AllianceBernstein Holding LP, he needed to analyze the prospects of the many oil-and-gas companies emerging in the nation's energy boom.

For many of these producers, their value and their ability to repay their debts hinged on how much oil or gas they could pull from the land they owned. The problem was there were no reporting standards on energy reserves, and the producers' own views were subjective, Mr. Stensland said.

Mr. Stensland said he and his team began to compile data from the states' oil and gas commissions, stitching together decades of history on oil wells' output in each parcel of land (typically around 640 acres). Building Bertha, the database's chosen name, took 15,000 man-hours. The analyst traveled to industry towns such as Midland, Texas, and Roswell, N.M., where he could copy older data preserved in oil and gas libraries' microfilm.

By mid-2014, Bertha had persuaded the high-yield investment team that certain producers were at greater risk of defaulting on their debt. The firm sold the shakiest bonds.

Those insights helped the AB High Income Fund sidestep steep losses that year on junk bonds, a selloff that took down Third Avenue Management LLC's Focused Credit Fund that December.

In 2016, the firm launched a private-equity fund that uses Bertha to help identify undervalued oil-and-gas companies.

Mindful of the crowds that form around popular ideas, some managers have used data and experts outside of the world of finance for fresh perspectives.

Joe Byrum had been analyzing how new corn and soybean hybrids might grow under hundreds of different climate and soil conditions when he fielded a job offer from an asset manager located near the center of the U.S.'s corn-producing heartland. Mr. Byrum joined Des Moines, Iowa-based Principal in July and now leads the $674 billion investment firm's data-science efforts.

"What you find is industries do certain things really well," said Mr. Byrum, who had run the research department at Syngenta, an agricultural company. "There are plenty of opportunities to apply those techniques and approaches" to managing money.

One project that is already under way at Principal: Preserving and cataloging the expertise of the firm's portfolio managers. It might be how investment staff responded to a market crisis, or just simply preserving the daily routines that at one point, become "like driving a car you don't think about it."

"These great people retire, and that expertise is gone," he said. "The opportunity is to capture that knowledge."

Pacific Investment Management Co., one of the world's largest bond investors, assembled its database of home-loan information more than a decade ago. It is massive, with 50 billion details on some 200 million U.S. mortgages.

Pimco built models that could analyze that information, and predict when borrowers might prepay their loans. But because those models were so labor-intensive, the firm could only sample 2-3% of the mortgages at a time, said Mihir Worah, the firm's investment chief of asset allocation and real return.

The firm joined with a research university, whose data-science department developed computer-based machine-learning tools that make short-term predictions gleaned from patterns detected in historic information.

Those tools have allowed Pimco managers to sample as much as 20% of its mortgage database and deliver more accurate forecasts on the groups of borrowers more likely to refinance or sell their homes in the next month, he said.

The information can help them value mortgage bonds the firm has held in various funds.

Hopes Dim for a China Deleveraging

Beijing's two-year campaign to get a grip on the nation's runaway debt problem has its days numbered.

The Chinese economy is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-pboc-leaves-key-short-term-interest-rates-unchanged-1528944348", as shown by ebbing indicators from business activity to household consumption. An escalating trade fight with the U.S. threatens to knock a few decimal points from China's economic growth, targeted at around 6.5% this year.

Analysts say the dual pressures mean Beijing could soon ease monetary policy. "You don't want two negative shocks compounding each other," said Zhiwei Zhang, chief China economist at Deutsche Bank. "That would be damaging."

China has made strides in reining in shadow credit. Annualized growth in total social financing, a measure of credit and liquidity in the economy, eased to an all-time low in May, with contractions in everything from trust loans to corporate bonds. The only form of credit still expanding was traditional bank loans.

But hitting growth targets remains "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-seeking-growth-softens-focus-on-cutting-debt-1513700557". As the prospect of punitive tariffs by the Trump administration becomes a reality, economists expect policy makers to ease efforts to control debt.

"It's necessary and likely," said Ning Zhang, an economist with UBS. Like many analysts, Mr. Zhang expects China to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/dengs-take-chinas-central-bank-looks-to-make-borrowing-easier-1528196076" banks have to keep with the central bank. That would potentially free up billions of yuan for banks to lend, making life slightly easier for Chinese borrowers.

Fueling expectations for such a move, China's State Council said late Wednesday that a targeted cut in banks' reserve requirement ratio was one of several measures it had identified to ease financing difficulties for small and micro firms.

Another option for Beijing is to ease restrictions on projects that encouraged local governments to invest in building roads and other infrastructure. A notable slowdown in infrastructure investment this year has added to worries about a weakening economy.

Within the financial system, regulators could go for a subtler easing move: softening the implementation of a far-reaching regulatory framework aimed at reining in risky lending by banks. The central bank and other financial regulators "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-formally-adopts-tighter-lending-rules-1524837032" this April but have yet to roll out details.

There are indications that Chinese policy makers are moving in the direction of easing already. The central bank injected an unusually large amount of 200 billion yuan ($31 billion) in one-year funds into the banking system Tuesday. The measure was aimed at calming a jittery financial market on the back of U.S. tariff threats.

"They need to reserve tools for the rainy days," said Ting Lu, chief China economist at Nomura International (Hong Kong). The chance of easing climbs as the U.S. targets an increasing amount of Chinese goods, he explained. "The framework this year is very hard for China."

Correction: The Federal Reserve is releasing the results of its annual stress tests of big banks on Thursday, June 21, and Thursday, June 28. Wednesday's newsletter misstated the second date.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Deutsche Bank to Pay $205 Million Fine to End New York Currency-Trading Probe

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/deutsche-bank-to-pay-205-million-fine-to-end-n-y-currency-trading-probe-1529517428" said it fined Deutsche Bank AG $205 million over allegations it sought to manipulate currency prices and mislead clients while failing to protect confidential customer information.

The German lender agreed to the fine in a consent order with New York's Department of Financial Services. In a statement Wednesday, the regulator said Deutsche Bank traders and salespeople sought to skew foreign-exchange prices and charge excessive spreads. The regulator cited other control failures that it said had "the potential to improperly disadvantage customers and improperly affect markets."

The civil investigation covered the years 2007 to 2013, during which Deutsche Bank was the world's largest currency trader.

In a Year Marked by Controversy, Cboe Seeks to Improve the VIX

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-a-year-marked-by-controversy-cboe-seeks-to-improve-the-vix-1529492400" a controversial feature of one of its most-lucrative products: the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX also known on Wall Street as the "fear gauge."

Cboe is making changes to a monthly auction that determines final prices of futures tied to the VIX. While the changes amount to tweaks to its architecture, they also mark a step by the exchange operator to improve a product that has come under intense scrutiny due to manipulation allegations.

Cboe has already made some adjustments to the technology that underpins the monthly auction and is planning to implement other changes that require regulatory approval. Because the VIX tends to rise when stocks fall, and vice versa, its derivatives are popular among traders to hedge portfolios or bet on the future direction of market volatility.

The Arms Race for Quants Comes to the World's Biggest Asset Managers

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-arms-race-for-quants-comes-to-the-worlds-biggest-asset-managers-1529573402" began the year with big plans, if limited resources. "Just me and an intern," group head Michael Recce said.

Six months later, the group has added a fifth member to its team of data scientists and engineers as it works through a backlog of projects for the firm's portfolio managers. Neuberger's investment managers have already poached some of Mr. Recce's staff, leading him to recruit their replacements.

Data scientists, who have already helped usher media companies, retailers and other old-line industries into the digital age, first arrived at Wall Street banks decades ago as computing power and the complexity of derivatives surged. They built computer models that traded securities, giving rise to the quantitative-investing field that has changed how markets function.

Is Bitcoin the Future, or an Echo of a Failed Past?

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-bitcoin-the-future-or-an-echo-of-a-failed-past-1529460361", the digital currency bitcoin has been viewed by some people as the future of money.

Lately, to get some insight into what the future might hold, some are focusing on how bitcoin compares with currencies of the past.

Whistleblower Advocates Challenge Bank of England Over Report

"https://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2018/06/20/whistleblowers-advocates-challenge-bank-of-england-over-report/" the Bank of England to withdraw a four-year-old report arguing against paying financial rewards to tipsters, seeking to correct what the organizations consider misinformation as countries around the world consider whistleblower legislation.

"We are concerned that continued use of the BoE Report as a policy reference will only serve to inhibit the implementation of effective antifraud laws in the U.K.," the U.S.'s National Whistleblower Center and European Center for Whistleblower Rights, based in Berlin, wrote in a letter dated Wednesday to Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England.

The groups asked the bank to take what they called "its deleterious report" off its website within 10 working days, or post alongside it a rebuttal provided by the organizations. A spokesperson for the Bank of England's Prudential Regulatory Authority, which worked on the report with the U.K.'s Financial Conduct Authority, had no comment.

Five Ways to Improve 401(k)s

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/five-ways-to-improve-401-k-s-1529460601" is here to stay. But it is going to change in dramatic ways in the years ahead.

Even fans say the 401(k), the backbone of the nation's retirement-savings system, could do a better job of creating retirement security. At any given time, only about half of private-sector workers are participating in one of these plans. Of those, many save too little or treat their nest eggs like rainy-day funds.

Recommendations include making it easier for 401(k) plans to use annuities to automate the way workers take money out of these plans, and using 401(k)s to dispense customized financial advice on everything from employee benefits to debt repayment. Some predict the 401(k) will morph into an umbrella account that allows employees to save not just for retirement, but also for college, emergencies and health-care expenses.

The Future Robo Adviser: Smart and Ethical?

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-future-robo-adviser-smart-and-ethical-1529460240" to get a lot smarter. Tomorrow's might even have a conscience.

So say those who study the use of artificial intelligence in finance though a digital wealth adviser with morals is likely still a long way off.

The robot advisers of today use algorithms to provide low-cost, automated portfolio-management services to investors seeking discount advice. These easy-to-use tools have grown swiftly: Assets under the control of digital wealth managers are on track to surpass $1 trillion by 2020 after ballooning by triple digits annually since 2013, according to research firm Aite Group.

Banks Share Sensitive Info for Security

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-the-name-of-security-banks-share-information-1529460061", banks around the world increasingly are conducting joint investigations that rely on sharing the details of suspicious transactions and the accounts that are involved.

Banks in the U.S. were given the legal authority to share limited amounts of information with each other, regulators and law-enforcement authorities by the 2001 Patriot Act, a package of measures designed to combat terrorism. But such coordination has spread significantly in recent years, with the number of institutions engaged in the process nearly doubling between 2014 and 2018, according to the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.

In one example of the cooperative efforts, seven of the world's largest banks have been working together to facilitate the sharing of data such as the identities of account holders and the dates and other details of certain financial transactions. This has allowed them to experiment with ways to analyze large amounts of transactions data using artificial-intelligence tools as they try to uncover activities like money laundering or terrorist financing.

Authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere have lauded the effort, but it has raised concern among privacy advocates, who worry it could lead to some people or companies being penalized without due process.

How Government Guarantees Affect Bank Values

The market-value-to-book-value ratio of bank equity more than doubled from 1996 to 2007, driven by the "ability of bank equity holders to capitalize the value of the government safety net," according to "http://nber.org/papers/w24706" by Andrew G. Atkeson, Andrea L. Eisfeldt and Pierre-Olivier Weill from the University of California, Los Angeles, and Adrien d'Avernas of the Stockholm School of Economics. "By increasing leverage and exposure to losses in credit crisis states, bankers increase the capitalized value of government guarantees. We show that changes in the capitalized value of these guarantees, driven mainly by changes in bank leverage, risk taking, and the growth rate of banks' balance sheets, have been at least as important as banks' true franchise values in determining the value of U.S. banks over time," they say. "Under current regulatory limitations on leverage, the ability of banks to capture the value of government guarantees is constrained, and, as a result, market-to-book ratios are lower," they write.

U.S. Should Forgive All Student Debt

Americans hold about $1.5 trillion in student debt, a debt that "too often becomes a millstone on the young people it was intended to assist," Katrina vanden Heuvel writes for "https://wapo.st/2tg8PLB". "Does forgiving $1.5 trillion in student debt over 10 years cost too much money? Republicans clearly didn't think  $1.5 trillion' sounded unreasonable when they forced through that amount in tax cuts to overwhelmingly benefit corporations and the wealthiest Americans. Somehow,  conservatives' think we can afford to lard the pockets of the wealthy but can't rescue a generation drawn from working- and middle-class families burdened with education debts that many cannot afford to pay," she says.

Author to Run New Health Venture

By Anna Wilde Mathews

Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. named prominent surgeon and researcher Atul Gawande as chief executive of their new venture that aims to overhaul workers' health care.

The appointment of Dr. Gawande is effective July 9, and the still-unnamed health-care initiative will be based in Boston, the companies said.

The selection of Dr. Gawande, a best-selling author known for his work on health-care quality, ensures the effort will remain under a spotlight, and provides the most concrete signal so far that the partners' ambitions go beyond conventional tweaks to employer health-benefit plans. Dr. Gawande has little background in the nitty-gritty of health insurance or running a major corporate operation, but he is well regarded across the health industry and has moved his ideas forward through nonprofits he founded.

The leaders of the three partner companies, including Warren Buffett at Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan CEO James Dimon, have spoken about the need to rein in health-care costs and improve care using new approaches. "We said at the outset that the degree of difficulty is high and success is going to require an expert's knowledge, a beginner's mind, and a long-term orientation," said Jeff Bezos, founder and CEO of Amazon, in prepared remarks Wednesday. "Atul embodies all three, and we're starting strong as we move forward in this challenging and worthwhile endeavor."

Dr. Gawande practices general and endocrine surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and is a professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and Harvard Medical School, as well as a writer for the New Yorker magazine. He founded Ariadne Labs and has been executive director of the nonprofit center, which focuses on efforts to improve care and reduce medical errors, for six years.

In addition to running the new venture, Dr. Gawande will continue to practice surgery and keep his position as a professor at Harvard, as well as retain a role at Ariadne Labs as chairman, according to Ariadne Labs.

In January, Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan announced they teamed up to figure out how to reduce health-care costs and improve care for their hundreds of thousands of U.S. employees. The companies said the entity would operate independently and be free from profit-making incentives and constraints. Together, Amazon, Berkshire and JPMorgan have more than one million employees, though not all of them are in the U.S.

The three partners in the joint venture had an in-depth process to select the new CEO. Todd Combs, an investment officer at Berkshire and a JPMorgan board member, did initial interviews with CEO candidates by phone in February, according to people familiar with the discussions. Candidates later were asked to deliver a white paper on how they would create a model for the way employers buy health benefits, what team the CEO would need to execute that strategy and how the new enterprise would use data analytics, the people said.

The new model should lower costs and serve as a template for other employers, but interviewers set few other criteria for the enterprise, the people said. However, CEO candidate interviews did focus on the use of data analytics, the cost of prescription drugs and chronic care management, they said.

Executives from the three companies were interested in Dr. Gawande based on his experience at Ariadne Labs, as well as his role as a surgeon witnessing the successes and failures of the medical system, a person familiar with the matter said. Ariadne Labs has about 100 employees and about $20 million revenue projected for fiscal 2018, according to the nonprofit. Dr. Gawande is also chairman of Lifebox, another nonprofit he founded, which focuses on making surgery safer globally, particularly in low-income countries.

The son of physicians, Dr. Gawande grew up in Athens, Ohio. Much of his prominence stems from his New Yorker articles and books, which have focused on a range of topics including care for those with very serious illnesses, the complexity of the health-care system and practical efforts to improve treatment, such as checklists for physicians.

The yields look attractive but there could be a downturn coming

Call me a cynic, but I suspect that financial capitalism is doomed constantly to repeat the same mistakes.

As an example, I have a hunch that when the next blowout comes, a major contributor will be excessive lending to property. Talk to many commercial real estate lenders about the prime areas   in the City of London, for instance   and they wince at low yields and high valuations.

This in turn is fuelling a massive increase in corporate lending, nicely illustrated by a recent bond binge by everyone s favourite shared office workspace provider, WeWork. The Softbank-backed workspace behemoth houses more hipster start-ups than you can shake a stick at (plus, it gives its tenants free beer). It has raised countless billions, partly off the back of financial documents promoting novel concepts such as  community adjusted ebitda . Good old-fashioned concepts such as real cash profits appear to have gone out of fashion.

But talk to many institutional lenders and they ll tell you that one of the last great niches for high margin lending is   you guessed it   property. I recently ran an event where one of the biggest Dutch institutional lenders said she thought there was real money to be made in, say, bridging loans to developers, mostly in the residential space.

That certainly rings true with the explosion of options available to anyone who wants a vehicle that lends to property. On the public markets, we have a small but nicely formed clutch of commercial real estate lenders such as Starwood, which crank out a return of between 5 and 7.5 per cent from lending tens of millions for a few years to commercial real estate developers.

But the biggest growth has been in lending within the broader residential space, which includes everything from small family builders and developers of flats for sale to buy-to-let landlords. Some of this has made its way on to the stock exchange. Lendinvest, for instance, has a retail bond programme borrowing money at around 5 per cent while institutional lender Urban Exposure has also listed on Aim.

Most of the growth, though, has been on alternative lending platforms online, largely built on the peer-to-peer model. Lendinvest has been the biggest lender (though it no longer allows new investors direct access via its platform) followed by rivals such as Lendy, Relendex and a host of more traditional direct lenders such as Octopus (through its Choice platform) and Alpha Real (through Fitzrovia Finance) which have set up peer-to-peer online platforms.

These platforms target various different kinds of borrowers. Most have focused on bridge funding, usually to a developer or buy-to-let landlord with a portfolio of properties. However, you ll also run into direct buy-to-let mortgage providers such as Landbay as well as commercial real estate lenders like Proplend.

Regardless of whom they lend to, most of their returns seem to cluster around the 4 to 8 per cent level   a decent income boost given the low level of interest rates. Most consumer peer-to-peer lenders struggle to get above 5 per cent and offer unsecured loans. All the property lenders I know have real asset backing for their loans with most demanding a loan to value ratio of less than 75 per cent (meaning the loan is less than three-quarters of the value of the property).

Yet cynics might wonder whether these yields are really so attractive, given the likelihood of rising interest rates (making many conventional bonds more attractive) and the near certainty of a slowdown in the housing market   especially in the all-important Greater London and Southeast area. The changing and increasingly punitive policy climate for buy-to-let landlords is also acting as a real headwind.

But I don t think the cynics paint a complete picture. A downturn is coming both in property and the wider financial markets. Defaults will rise, especially in richly valued commercial real estate markets. But most (though not all) lending is done conservatively; it is not uncommon to see LTVs of less than 60 per cent.

Many investors have now taken the strategic decision to invest some money in alternatives such as property. If tough times are coming, the safer place is arguably in the heavily secured portion of the capital stack   whereas more junior equity might find itself squeezed into oblivion.

I m also highly dubious that the much vaunted policy changes to boost residential housing starts   and the promise of more social housing   will ever materialise in a meaningful way. We could be in for our own version of the cold German winter. German property prices drifted sideways for years, declining in real terms but never turning into a complete rout.

Could we see house price declines of as much as 5 to 15 per cent over the next few years? Absolutely. But I believe (with regret) that supply is incredibly constrained and demand is destined to increase structurally. That is likely to put a floor under residential house price declines.

So, lending might make sense, but you also need to be hugely aware of how your money is being put to work. For any readers adventurous enough to consider this, I d suggest a checklist of detailed questions, including:

* Who does most of the borrowing   buy-to-let landlords, small builders or developers? Personally, I d favour small builders over buy-to-let landlords, because they tend to operate in niche, higher-margin markets where demand is strong and are less vulnerable to any downturn.

* Where is the lending happening regionally? Greater London and the Southeast looks less attractive to me than some of the regions.

* Examine the capital stack in great detail. How much lending is going on above you? What is your lender s median LTV ratio?

* Check out the due diligence process. Does a named person meet every lender and visit every site? I prefer good old fashioned human beings to make the lending decisions rather than AI and Big Data.

I d also be very keen to understand how lending platforms will react to any downturn. For instance, how actively will they manage a lossmaking position involving a development? In the past, bank lenders have reacted like lemmings, selling off half-finished developments as quickly as possible and pushing down prices aggressively. Alternative lenders will need to roll up their sleeves and work out any defaults   and avoid a mass rush for the exit.

So, in sum   be careful. Think about where you are in the capital stack and where you are investing in geographic terms. A return of 4 to 7.5 per cent a year is worth the effort, but not if you suffer big capital losses in the next downturn.

Transcript: Powell, Draghi, Kuroda and Lowe Speak on Panel in Sintra; Central bank leaders discuss inflation, the Phillips curve and trade conflicts at an ECB conference in Portugal

Four of the world's top central bank chiefs spoke on a panel Wednesday, June 20, 2018, at a conference in Sintra, Portugal. They were U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, Bank of Japan Gov. Haruhiko Kuroda and Reserve Bank of Australia Gov. Philip Lowe.

Stephanie Flanders, of Bloomberg Economics, moderated the exchange. They discussed inflation, deflation, the Phillips curve and other topics. Here is a transcript, edited for length and clarity.

STEPHANIE FLANDERS: Well, we've had some spirited debates in the last couple of days around price and wage setting in advanced economies. Do central bank talk too much to markets? Who killed the Phillips curve? I think the feeling was there were potential culprits in this room. Maybe we can have a polling question on who killed it.

But now we get to hear from a group of four individuals who collectively probably have more capacity to actually change price and wage setting in advanced economies than anybody else, maybe even more than (U.S. President) Donald Trump perhaps. (Laughter.)

We're going to have brief, I hope, relatively informal remarks from each of them at the beginning, I get to ask a few questions, and then I promise you will get to ask lots of erudite questions as well.

But President Draghi, do you want to kick us off?

MARIO DRAGHI: Well, thank you, Stephanie.

The first point is there is clearly a variety of reasons why the response of inflation and wages has been so slow, and they go from measurement of the slack, low productivity, the trade unions have disappeared, structural reforms, labor supply has gone up   it has increased a lot   and then non-wage-related aspects like people wanting more stability rather than higher wages, especially because their employment is of low quality, and then the importance of past inflation.

Now to disentangle all these reasons, it's very difficult. But one conclusion is that we see that all these   the combined effect of all these reasons is gradually washing out, is gradually waning.

A good example is one given by the importance of past low inflation for a long time. The ECB staff has calculated that low inflation   past low inflation has dragged about 0.2 percent out of wage growth in the last three years per year   0.2 percent per year. And now we see that this effect is waning out, and as headline inflation is picking up, current headline inflation becomes more and more important, and past low inflation is losing importance. And so that, in a sense, also says that anchoring inflation expectations was crucial and remains crucial, and fortunately, they are well-anchored.

So once this is said, we see that nominal wages are indeed increasing no matter which measure we take. We take compensation per employee, we take compensation per hour, we take negotiated wages   all of them are going up, and they are going up around   now it's 1.9 percent, the last data point for the compensation per employee, and compensation per hour is the same   about the same thing.

Having said that, is this going to be translated into higher inflation? Well, here I think the record is a little more mixed. For example, we had   we had an increasing wage growth, by 0.8 percent, between 2016 and 2018, in this year, but the increasing inflation was only 0.1 percent, and because productivity had gone up by 0.7.

Now what do we expect for productivity? We do expect it will grow less than it has done in the late stage of the cycles, and wages   nominal wages will grow more than they have done in the   up to now.

So all in all, we see the union labor costs on an upward path, and by the way, the other consideration, which was touched in the previous discussion, was related to pricing power, the coming back of pricing power. And there, again, we see encouraging signs because, if we look at an index which more closely reflects input prices; namely the domestic price   domestic non-food price inflation, in April that has gone up by 0.5 percent, which is the highest rate since, I think, in the last six, seven years. So all in all, this is encouraging.

Now what about e-commerce? Is this going to dampen this process of recovering inflation? And again, the previous discussion about whether an increasing concentration does affect the rate of inflation, to some extent, gives some light on this issue. Now the answer that we have is that we find very little evidence that e-commerce has any effect on inflation. It clearly has increased price transparency, clear may have some compression of margins, some cost saving. But all in all, in the aggregate, this doesn't show into a permanent lower inflation. So probably the effects of the e-commerce and other aspects of globalization have to do more with the composition of industries rather than with an aggregate effect that we don't   we cannot find in the data   an aggregate, permanent effect.

So all this makes us confident that inflation is converging towards our objective, and we draw this confidence by the tighter   the ever-tight labor market, by the high-capacity utilization rates, by   and frankly by   as I will say in a moment, by the continuing ample monetary accommodation   also by the disappearance of what we call the tail race of deflation.

So all this leads us   has led the (ECB) governing council last week to give guidance on monetary policy, and the first thing is we need   as I said last week at the press conference, we need to make sure that the ample degree of accommodation that is currently incorporated into the financing conditions on which the staff projections are predicated is maintained for as long as necessary in order to bring about the convergence of inflation towards our objective.

And then we went through the various measures. We said that we intend to maintain our portfolio of accumulated securities for an extended period of time after the end of net purchases, and in any event as long as necessary.

And then we enhanced our guidance on future rate path for our key interest rates. We said that we expect to hold them at the present level at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that inflation evolves along a trajectory that is aligned with the sustained adjustment path that we expect to see in the medium term.

JEROME H. POWELL: (EDITOR'S NOTE: Mr. Powell at this point delivered prepared remarks that have been posted to the Fed's website: "https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/powell20180620a.htm" and so we won't transcribe them here. You can read The Wall Street Journal's story on the speech here. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/powell-says-solid-economy-supports-further-fed-rate-increases-1529501509" )

PHILIP LOWE: In some ways I am the odd one out here. I come from a small economy, not a larger one. We've had positive interest rates for the last decade. We haven't had to go anywhere near zero. We haven't done quantitative easing. We haven't embraced forward guidance. And we've had 27 years without a technical recession, and I'm hoping we can extend that a while longer. (Laughter.) As I said, odd one out.

But I don't really feel like the odd one out, though, because the issues we're discussing here in Sintra are really at the core of the issues we're discussing in Sydney. In Australia, the inflation rate has been below the midpoint of our target for some years. And it's going to stay that way, I think. Wage growth has repeatedly surprised on the downside. And the current rate of wage growth isn't consistent with us achieving our inflation target on a sustained basis. So, like others, we're grappling with why we find ourselves in this situation.

The fact that it's happening in so many countries suggests to me that there are global factors at work, and they are probably structural in nature. And the result of those factors is that the inflation process looks very different in many countries. And at the heart of that I think is the wage process, which looks different. Whether that's going to be permanent, that's hard to tell. But it's certainly persistent enough that it's important for policy. So what I'd like to do in my time is to offer some reflections on two issues that are really at the heart of this conference. And that is: Why is the wage process different? And how much of it's structural? And what are the policy implications of that?

So the wage process, as I said, is different. The relationship between wages and unemployment looks to have changed. And there are three sets of factors that I think are really important here. One is the changes in the industrial relations landscape. And we saw a really good example of that this morning in Professor Schonberg's paper. I think the evidence there is pretty compelling. Changes in industrial relations arrangements in Germany have affected wage and employment outcomes. And the Australian experience is very similar to the German one. It's hard to escape the conclusion that changes in industrial relations has changed the inflation process.

The second one   or, the second factor   I think this is actually more important   is that there's increased perceptions of competition arising out of globalization and technology. Everyone feels like there's more competition. And one of the first things you learn in economics is that if there's more competition prices aren't as high. We discussed this in the earlier session. And there are a couple of factors that are driving those extra perceptions of competition. One is globalization. There's hundreds of millions of extra people that have entered the global labor force, particularly in China and India.

And first of all, that affected manufacturing wages around the world and now I see it affecting services wages. Many more services sectors becoming tradable. I see a lot of examples where business services that used to be supplied in Sydney are now supplied in Manila, or Chengdu, or Bangalore. And that's meaning that everyone feels like there's more competition. And the other factor that's adding to the sense of competition is the nature of technological progress. It's much more likely being embedded in intellectual capital and physical capital. And we're also seeing widening gaps between the leading firms and the laggard firms. And both of those features are affecting the wage dynamics.

With technology progressing so quickly, and particularly for the leading firms, many firms having trouble keeping up. They're having trouble adopting the new technologies. And to remain competitive, they focus on what they can control, and that is their costs. And the main cost they can control is their labor costs. So the technology progress is leading, for many firms, to have a very, very strong mindset on controlling costs. Again, I see lots of examples of this in Australia. Almost every business meeting I go to, business people complain that it's incredibly hard to find workers.

And, I rather naively ask, well, why don't you pay more, attract some workers from another firm? And when I do that, they look at me as if I'm completely mad. That would be the last thing they would do. And I typically get a lecture about how competitive the world is. There's competition from China, Japan. And they worry about kind of technology. And they say, the last thing I can do is increase my costs. It's the one variable I can control. So there's a very strong mindset that I've got to control costs. And I think it's coming from competition. It's a global factor. And it's structural.

The third factor that's affecting the relationship between wages and unemployment is that labor supply in many countries is turning out to be much more flexible. And we're seeing this in a rise in the participation rate. There are a variety of reasons for this. One is   and we see this, again, in Australia   rising labor force participation by all the people as health outcomes have improved. We've seen big advances the health outcomes for many people. And where there's not   our bodies are lasting longer as we're working in services rather than manufacturing.

And that's allowing people to stay in the labor force longer, particularly when there are jobs there. I think that's quite an important factor, and the increasing acceptability of part-time employment is allowing many women in particular to stay in the labor force longer. So the labor supply is turning out to be quite flexible. So even though we're seeing very strong employment growth in a lot of countries, it's not translating into higher wages. So things look different, industrial relations, increased perceptions of competition, and increased labor supply. And I think those factors are going to be around for a long time. So I don't expect the situation that we're dealing with to change quickly.

So what are the policy implications of this? The main one, to me, is that the system that we're operating in looks less inflation-prone than it once was. And that's reflected in most of us worrying about inflation being too low, not too high. It's a very different world than when I was at university. So listening to the discussion of the past two days, I've been trying to think about   or trying to listen for ideas about how we deal with this world that is less inflation prone. And I can take the liberty of summarizing the things I've heard under three broad kinds of approaches one could adopt here. One is that central banks should just try harder. The basic conception of how the economy is working is fine, we just need lots of monetary stimulus. We need to keep at that. We need to just try harder. And eventually it will turn out OK.

The second perspective   a couple of people touched on this yesterday   is we just need to accept that inflation will be low for a while. After all, low inflation isn't that bad. Now, central banks want to achieve their inflation targets. That's clear. But most people out there in the communities that we're supposed to be serving don't really care that much if inflation's a big lower than the target, especially if the labor market outcomes are OK, if there are plenty of jobs being created. So the second perspective is, well, it's not   it's not kind of fantastic, but we just got to be patient, accept that inflation is going to be low for a while, and there's not really a great loss of social welfare from that.

The third perspective is one introduced by (inaudible) yesterday. He said, well, just lift inflation expectations. Central banks should embrace social media. They should communicate better, make it very clear what inflation expectations should be, and the problem is kind of solved.

I think you can make a case for each of those perspectives. I don't think there's a right answer. I see a few problems, though, with the "try harder" approach, just keep on solving this problem with monetary stimulus, is I don't see the risk/return tradeoff from that approach being particularly attractive. In terms of return, the effectiveness of monetary stimulus in driving up inflation, kind of I think there's a question mark over how effective that is. And I can see clear side effects. And the side effects come on the financial side.

If interest rates are low and the economy is growing quite well, that's a great environment to borrow, to buy assets. And we're seeing some of that. So we see higher debt and higher asset prices. It's helpful now, but eventually interest rates will hopefully need to correct, and some of those developments on the financial side will need to be reversed. And that's going to pose risk. So the effectiveness of more monetary stimulus to solve the lack of inflation is questionable, and I see clear risk from doing that.

So I think that does leave us with the possibility of accepting that inflation might be just a bit lower than we'd like for a while. That's difficult for central banks to accept, as they see their job to kind of deliver on the inflation target. But it's not so difficult to accept that if you see your job or your mandate as broader than just delivering on a specific rate of inflation. In Australia, our mandate was written back in 1959. And it hasn't changed since then. We haven't swung with the fashions in central banking. We don't have a single mandate. We don't even have a dual mandate. We have a triple mandate. (Laughter.)

That's price stability, full employment, and the general welfare of the Australian people. (Laughter.) That's an unfashionable mandate, perhaps, in this room, but I am really glad that we have that mandate, especially in the current environment. And I use all three elements of that mandate when I'm explaining what we're doing and why we're doing it. I often ask rhetorically in public and to the politicians: Do you think it would serve our collective welfare to have yet more monetary stimulus so that we can get back to inflation more quickly, if the main way we got back to inflation more quickly was encouraging people to borrow more and push up asset prices even further?

So not everyone's going to answer that question kind of the same way, but most people say, look, no, that's not worth it, especially if the labor market's generating sufficient jobs, which is certainly the case. Last year we've had 3 percent employment growth. So in our case, my view has been that the welfare-maximizing approach   which is really what we're about, maximizing the welfare of the people   is to be patient as long as the labor market is improving. As long as we're moving in the right direction, we don't need to force the process more quickly through monetary stimulus.

One thing, though, that we have done in an effort to get there a bit more quickly is a version of option three, lifting expectations, because as I said yesterday, it's lifting wage expectations. My concern has been that a 2 percent wage norm has become the standard in Australia, and we're getting reasonable labor productivity growth, so 2 percent wage growth and reasonable labor productivity growth doesn't make for 2  percent inflation on a sustained basis.

So I've been talking publicly quite a lot about trying to lift wage norms back to start with a 3 rather than a 2. Whether that works or not, I don't know, but I'd rather do that than try and deliver more monetary stimulus to get inflation rise. I'd rather do it by trying to lift wage expectations.

MR. KURODA: Thank you. Japan's economy has improved significantly over the past five years since the introduction of quantitative and qualitative monetary easing   or QQE   in April 2013. The economy is no longer in deflation, which is defined as a sustained decline in prices. However, wages and prices have continued to show relatively weak development compared with a strong economic expansion.

The mechanism behind this phenomenon is not entirely clear. Today I would like to talk about the recent experience in Japan where the sluggishness in wages and prices seems to be more evident compared with other advanced economies, and discuss its implications for the Bank of Japan's monetary policy.

First is firms' wage-setting stance. For the past few years, total cash earnings per employee have been rising, albeit (with) fluctuations. However, their pace of increase has been moderate compared to the labor market tightening with the unemployment rate being at a record low level of 2.5 percent. In particular, base salaries of full-time employees, which account for almost 70 percent of total employee income, have not risen much despite general labor market tightening.

In Japan, lifetime employment has been widespread, and labor mobility across firms has been relatively low. Therefore, wages of full-time employees tend to reflect the labor market conditions insufficiently, at least in the short run.

In Japan, wage negotiations between labor and the management take place at major firms every spring where the rate of increase in base pay is decided. The rate has been almost zero percent since around 2000 under the prolonged deflation. In 2014, when actual prices started to rise, there was a return to base pay increase for the first time in nearly 15 years. However, the problem is that the pace of increase in base pay still lacks strength. On this point, some have argued that   reflecting that both labor and management in Japan place priority   high priority on the stability of employment and wages. Firms avoided the large-scale layoffs and wage cuts during the prolonged deflation so that firms cannot simply switch to increasing wages, even when the economy grows and the labor market conditions tighten. The deflationary mindset that has become entrenched among people has been quite tenacious, and it will take time to completely dispel this mindset.

Second is firms' price-setting stance. Even though moderate wage increases have been taking place, wage costs have not yet been directly passed on to prices of products and services. Firms that face increases in wage costs will generally consider the following two options to maintain the same level of profitability. One is to pass on the increased wage costs to sales prices, and the other is to improve productivity through streamlining of business processes and labor-saving investment. So far, many firms in Japan have been making effort to raise their productivity.

The fundamental reason behind this is likely to be a tenacious deflationary mindset that I mentioned earlier. Consumers remain reluctant to accept price rises despite the improvement in the employment and the income situation. Therefore, firms are cautious about raising prices due to their concern over losing customers.

Another likely reason is that the productivity of Japanese firms, mainly in the service sector, is low by international standards, and thus there is significant room for improvement. In fact, initiatives are widely being taken in the services and retail sectors such as enhancing efficiency of customer services, cutting back excessive services, and optimizing inventory management and delivery services.

Such efforts by firms in these sectors are encouraged in part by digital technology in recent years, including artificial intelligence and robotics. These measures to improve productivity are expected to produce positive effects in the long run in that they would address structural issues such as a decline in the working-age population and lead to boosting the growth potential of Japan's economy. After easing (inaudible) short run, however, they likely will reduce the upward pressure on prices.

I would now like to make three points from the perspective of monetary policy. First, wages and prices have been improving gradually under the powerful monetary easing over the past five years, although sluggishness remains. Base pay increases have taken hold again in Japan's economy, and the proportion of firms that have raised their base pay has been increasing steadily.

In addition, mainly in the service sector, where there is an acute labor shortage, moves to reflect the increased wage costs in prices have been spreading gradually. As medium- to long-term inflation expectations are projected to rise through the adaptive formation mechanism, if further price rises come to be observed widely the Bank of Japan judges that the momentum toward achieving the price stability target of 2 percent is firmly maintained.

Second, the bank therefore needs to maintain a positive outward gap by persistently pursuing powerful monetary easing, and as a framework of QQE, with yield-curve control. The bank thereby will encourage firms' wage and price setting stance to become more proactive and maintain positive momentum for a long time.

Third, sluggishness in prices is attributable to a rise in productivity that reflects technological innovation in recent years. It is important to continuously examine how this will affect the natural rate of interest as well economic and the financial activities. The effects of new technologies on the economy are often difficult to grasp in an accurate and timely manner using existing statistics. Thus they should be examined in detail from various perspectives.

MS. FLANDERS: Thank you. You've all focused on wages and wage growth &But I'm interested   Governor Kuroda, if I could just come back to you briefly   that Governor Lowe pointed out that even the 2 percent wage growth that they're seeing now in Australia was not enough to achieve the inflation target. How important is more wage inflation to you in hitting your target?

MR. KURODA: The Japanese government has been asking labor and business to raise wages in the last five years. And this year, the government even requested labor and business to agree to a 3 percent wage increase during the so-called spring offensive. The final result is not yet known, but I presume a total wage increase, including base pay as well as other elements of wages, would have risen close to 3 percent.

As I said, the Bank of Japan is aiming at achieving a 2 percent inflation target or a price stability target. While the labor productivity increase in Japan is around 1 percent, that means that a 3 percent wage increase is necessary to be consistent with a 2 percent price stability target. So the government request for a 3 percent wage increase is quite appropriate.

By the way, also the government has been raising minimum wages by 3 percent almost every year. And again, this is consistent with our price stability target.

MS. FLANDERS: Governor Lowe, I'm interested in the context   the conversations that we had yesterday about whether or not central banks can really change people's expectations and the difficulty of talking to households and really changing their way of thinking when they are often really not wanting to pay attention to you at all.

How do you think about your capacity to affect that wage growth? You say that's a major focus now. Is it harder to do that because we're so concerned about talking to markets that it's harder for us to talk directly to households?

MR. LOWE: Yeah, I'm not trying to talk directly to households on this particular issue. I'm trying to talk to businesses. We've got the situation where we've got the central bank governor calling for higher wage growth, the political leaders in a center-right government calling for higher wage growth and senior members of the business community calling for higher wage growth. You know, it doesn't happen.

And then when I talk to individual businesses, they kind of agree in principle the country would be better off having wage growth of 3-point-something, 3-point-something, but not any  

MS. FLANDERS: But then not being told what to do, though.

MR. LOWE: I'm not in their business. (Laughter.) And the reason that it shouldn't happen in their business is they're so worried about competition. You've kind of   in a market economy, we don't have the coordination mechanism to get to something which I think would be a better outcome because no individual business wants to put up its wages more quickly than its competitors. There's a first-move problem.

So the thing that I'm trying to do   and I don't know whether it's going to be effective   is to kind of help solve that coordination problem by saying, look, it's OK, it's OK to give wage increases of 3-point-something. And if that can become the norm, I think we'll be better off. And I don't know whether it's going to be effective or not.

MS. FLANDERS: President Draghi, I'm sort of interested. I mean, the eurozone experience of this is a little bit different and I guess not just because the recovery is not as far along as the many, many years' recovery in Australia. You know, we've heard a lot in the last couple of days and we just heard from Philip, there's something different about the wage-bargaining process at the moment and we're getting a lot of employment growth and not so much wage growth. And yet, if you look at the forecasts for the eurozone, it feels like we're not expecting such a transformation in the labor market outcomes, at least in many countries in the eurozone, maybe in some. We think the natural rate has fallen dramatically. How do you think about whether or not wage bargaining and the wage-employment relationship has changed in the eurozone?

MR. DRAGHI: Well, it's a difficult question because we actually have 19 countries and each one of them has a historical setup in those relations and I don't think they can be easily compared.

MS. FLANDERS: But you have to set monetary policy for all of them. (Laughter.)

MR. DRAGHI: That's right, exactly. And that's the challenge. But it's really changed, in a sense. As I was mentioning, one of the reasons in the list of why the wages are not responding as fast as we were used to is the disappearance of trade unions. Now, in some countries, they were important to begin with, but in others were not. So there is a combination of factors that has changed this relationship. But the point I was making before is that, yes, that's true, that explains the past.

We are convinced that the future looks different, looks much more like what we used to see years ago when this relationship was stable and we were looking at that to predict the movement in wages from the labor market conditions. So by and large, you have a variety of factors we think we are convinced that were very important in the past in explaining this low speed of adjustment, and now they are sort of washing out, they are less important. We see, for example, that   what was discussed in the first day of this conference   the residuals or Phillips curve washing out, moving away. The relationship is increasingly capturing a rather traditional design.

Now, of course, maybe   we've got to be careful here because maybe we're going to see   absolutely, we're going to see things that don't exist; and therefore, we convince ourselves that they exist. But frankly, if I compare, for example, all the projections about future inflation that the ECB has produced over the last four or five years, you clearly see a greater convergence, you clearly see a narrowing down on the confidence intervals, you clearly see an upward trend in underlying inflation.

For example, one thing that's telling is that, over our projection horizon, the underlying inflation   now, the core inflation is higher than headline inflation. So in our projections, we're actually discounting some slowdown in oil prices, but an underlying strength which remains through 2020.

So I would say, yes, I mean, it's a complex continent, 19 countries, very different, lots of reasons they can explain the past. Not sure that this diversity is what can   is the best predictor of the future.

MS. FLANDERS: We've been implicitly talking about as if we have many, hopefully, many more years of recovery to go and to discover what the dynamics of wages and prices will be, but we started the week with quite a provocative speech from (former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence) Summers who said that the world was now economically, politically and socially less prepared for the next downturn than it's ever been.

Chairman Powell, do you agree with that?

MR. POWELL: Well, a couple of things we know are that interest rates have been lower. And they may   we don't know this, but they will probably remain low, which means we'll be closer to the zero lower bound, which may mean that we're more likely to hit the zero lower bound. And I think we've taken that into consideration.

I think there's still fiscal policy space in the United States. There's less than there used to be, there's less than there should be. But there's some room to react.

And I think we   I think we kind of take all of that onboard. And then the real question is   and I guess Larry (Summers) may have said something about this, I didn't pick that part up   but, you know, what's the right policy response to that?

And, you know, if you look at an economy in the case of the United States, which has growth well-above trend, unemployment at 3.8 percent, inflation moving up, not quite at target, but getting close, and the federal-funds rate still in a place that is accommodative in the view of members of the committee, perhaps a hundred basis points below the median estimate of a neutral rate. So what that calls for in our thinking is continued, gradual rate increases.

MS. FLANDERS: And I guess one of the things that came through in Larry Summers's remarks, but also other places, is that, because we know that there is this reduced monetary policy capacity, we expect there to be in the coming   next time we have a downturn, the relationship between fiscal and monetary policy becomes quite a lot more complicated in this environment where you have a lot more unconventional policy or potential for unconventional policies. I mean, even now, there's a potential for conflicts to develop between the fiscal objectives and the monetary objectives.

I mean, Governor Kuroda, I wondered, you know, how you think about the interaction between fiscal and monetary policy over the next few years in a   in a somewhat abstract way. But is it now more complicated than when we first designed those independent central banks?

MR. KURODA: Always the cooperation between fiscal authority and central bank by way of policy coordination or something like that is necessary. But at the same time, the mandate of the central bank is basically price stability and financial system stability. Of course, some central banks like the Federal Reserve and the Reserve Bank of Australia have another mandate of achieving full employment or something like that. But for the Bank of Japan, the mandate is basically price stability and financial stability. And we have to continue to aim at achieving and maintaining price stability and financial stability. And in some cases, that might make active or proactive fiscal policy somewhat difficult, but at this moment I don't see any difficulty of coordinating fiscal policy and monetary policy arising in the near future. I don't see any problem.

MS. FLANDERS: Well, I guess one example is if the government is now going to move to having a broad target for the budget deficit, which includes the debt interest. Then that complicates things for you a little bit.

MR. KURODA: Yeah, the government is aiming at achieving primary surplus by fiscal 2025 and also trying to achieve debt-to-(gross domestic product) ratio to gradually decline over time. And I think that (a) fiscal consolidation program is quite appropriate for the Japanese economy as well &because already the Japanese government has accumulated very large debt over the years and it's quite necessary for the government to consolidate (its) fiscal position, of course gradually, in the medium to long run. And that is not particularly inconsistent with our monetary policy in coming years.

MS. FLANDERS: I had one more question, for Chairman Powell.

We had some discussion yesterday   I think you weren't here for it, but there was some discussion about how central banks should communicate to households and whether perhaps we end up   talking a lot to financial markets means that you're also talking in a very careful   as you all are today   very careful way that then makes it harder for you to speak sort of directly and straightforwardly to households. You said in the   in the panel that we were   that you participated in recently when we were both in Stockholm, you said you thought that maybe there would be less room for   less need for forward guidance in the future. It made me think when Charles Wyplosz was saying you shouldn't be spoon-feeding the markets. You know, do you want to say a little bit more about how you see forward guidance?

MR. POWELL: Sure. So, obviously, we want the public and the markets to understand how we're thinking about the economy, how we're thinking about the path of policy, our reaction function, and that kind of thing. I think during the financial crisis, in order to support the economy, we began to do quite explicit date-based and then state-based forward guidance about the path of policy. And that was   that was, you know, an unconventional tool that we came to rely upon. I think it worked. I think it did assure the public that rates would remain lower and that sort of thing.

So, as we move back to a more normal environment in the United States, we're going to have a shorter statement at the end of the meeting that won't have so much in the way of formal forward guidance. We're still going to have the Summary of Economic Projections, which puts out quite a lot of information about the individual projections of individual members of the committee. So that's really how we're thinking about forward guidance   how I am, anyway.

Q: Lars Svensson, Stockholm School of Economics.

I have a question to Philip Lowe. He was nervous about the side effects of lowering the policy rate and raising inflation to the inflation target in Australia, nervous about the side effects of that. I would like to point out to another side effect of undershooting your inflation target. If you do that on a sustained basis, if you accept lower inflation on average than your inflation target, that is like having an implicit unofficial target below the official target. Once the market and the general public understands that, they will lower their inflation expectations. By the Fisher equation, that means that the average policy rate will then be correspondingly lower, and the gap to the effective lower bound will be shorter/smaller, and we will more likely hit the effective lower bound in the future. Doesn't that make the economy less resilient and more vulnerable? Isn't that a pretty important side effect of undershooting your inflation target?

Q: Ben Friedman from Harvard.

My question is for any or all of our distinguished panelists. The overwhelming focus of discussion at this conference has been about how the flattening of the Phillips curve has made and is making it more difficult for our central banks to raise inflation up to their stated targets. I hope each of you has been thinking about the reverse of that proposition, which is that in the event   we hope unlikely   that something goes wrong and we wind up with inflation above our central banks' targets, then, either because the central bank's policy is behind and   in slowing the economies or something goes wrong with oil prices   there's, of course, the usual laundry list of things that could go wrong   the same flattening of the Phillips curve we've been talking about would then make it more difficult for our central banks to reduce   to reduce inflation back down to the targets. And in a world of dynamic strategy for policy, surely that implication has some bearing on policy today. So I wonder whether our central banks have taken account of and are thinking about the potential difficulty in which they would find themselves should inflation for some reason or other over the next some years wind up being in a situation in which not how do we get from 1 to 2, but how do we get from 3 or something like that to 2.

Q: I'm Stefan Gerlach from EFG.

So my question is also to Philip Lowe, and it's along the line of Lars' questions. So, Philip, you mentioned that the public may not care very much if inflation is 1 percent or if it's 2 percent. But anyone who has borrowed is going to care about what the actual inflation is. In particular, governments are going to care. See, if they have   I mean, they borrow under the assumption that the central bank will deliver on the inflation target. And if inflation ends up being unexpectedly low, ex post real interest rates end up being unexpectedly high.

Now, that's not a problem if you have a public debt-to-GDP ratio of 40 percent, which I think is the Australian case. But it is a problem if the public debt-to-GDP ratio is 140 percent, which is the case in some countries. Now, one can, of course, argue that this is just an example of poor fiscal policy, and the central bank should simply disregard this. But in practice, I mean, shouldn't the central bank worry about the public finance consequences of running unexpectedly low inflation? Thank you.

MS. FLANDERS: Philip Lowe, do you want to answer those   the couple of questions that were particularly related to you? But then I think others will probably have remarks.

MR. LOWE: Thank you. Well, I acknowledge the risks that both Lars and Stefan talk about, but in my mind they're relatively marginal. Our fiscal policy kind of is   we've had excellent fiscal policy for a long time, so we don't have a public debt issue at all. And I remain confident that we are going to get back to 2  percent, it's just going to take us a bit of time. And I accept that it's going to be a gradual process, and because it's gradual   because it's gradual, people might lower their inflation expectations. But if we keep communicating that we're shooting for 2  and we're making gradual process towards that, I don't think we're going to see a persistent decline in inflation expectations.

There is a risk, though, that happens, balancing that risk against the risk that would come from pursuing a policy that pursued a more rapid return of inflation to 2  percent. And in the environment we've been in, I see the risks being quite large from trying to get inflation up more quickly. We've been 1  to 2. I think we can live with that for a while. To try and get it back to 2  very quickly, it wouldn't be mainly through people borrowing more money and having higher asset prices. I think that's a much bigger risk to our economy than people having surprisingly low inflation expectations. We've got very high levels of debt, very high levels of asset prices. And I think that is   that's our number-one domestic risk, not lowering   people having lower inflation expectations. We're trying to balance those two things off.

MS. FLANDERS: Do you want to respond to the point about the flatter   the flipside of the flatter Phillips curve?

MR. POWELL: I would   I would just briefly say, so, if we think inflation is held in place by relatively strongly-anchored inflation expectations, and we've seen years and years of inflation below that, the principal risk we've been worried about through these years is the pressure on inflation expectations, that they might move downward, which would be really bad in a   at a time when we think interest rates are going to be low. It would mean even less room for policy to respond. So that's been the thing we've been   we've been worried about. Not moving inflation up, but just really worried that we'd lose expectations.

So and I think as you get to a place where   as we're getting close now to on-target inflation, I think we're well-aware that if you go   if expectations were to move above 2 percent meaningfully then, yes, it would be some work to get it back. But that project   you know, we haven't really seen inflation expectations get up to 2 percent yet, or inflation itself.

MS. FLANDERS: Do you see any advantages to having inflation   when you've had a prolonged period below inflation   of having inflation that overshoots for some period of time, on this expectations question?

MR. POWELL: You know, that's not the design of our approach. We've said that we would be concerned if inflation were to run persistently above or below 2 percent. And so we haven't said what we're shooting for, and would like an overshoot. That's not something we've said. But I think   you know, as I said in my remarks, it doesn't mean that we can stop thinking about resource utilization. It really is just a question of keeping inflation expectations anchored at 2 percent.

MR. DRAGHI: First, to Lars, I mean, you will be able to guess that we've been asked several times to revise our objective of inflation. And it depends on whether you are located in eurozone. You have countries that was tasked to revising downwards   people, I mean, just not countries. Just not governments, but people saying   claiming that 2 percent was an outrageously high inflation. And countries that   people in countries that have been suggesting that 2 percent was too low inflation. One of the reasons why we refuse to   there are many reasons why it would have been unwise to advise our objective. But one of the reasons why we never revised the downward our objective was exactly what you said. We simply would self-limit our policy space without any clear gain from any point, from any angle. So there is no reason to do that.

On Ben's question, I think I'll say something very close to what Jay has just said. I think it's a high-class problem at this point in time. But we've asked ourselves what if. Of course, you know, if we are being questioned   we've been questioned so many times about the monetary policy being so unconventional, so expansionary, so accommodating, that we had to ask ourselves what if. And the answer is that we have plenty of instruments to do that. We have plenty of instruments to go back. And certainly, our deposit facilities is one that comes to mind immediately. The rhythm of the investment policies is another one that comes to mind. A third would be interest rates, in due time.

So but there is also another observation that came to mind while you were asking the question is: Are we sure that the slope of the Phillips curve remains constant in an entirely new regime of inflation, where expectations are being adjusted to a permanently higher level of inflation? And I'm not sure I would answer yes, because one of the reasons   one of the things that   one of the reasons why we find it so difficult to disentangle different factors is exactly we are unsure that that it's been stable throughout the last 10 years   the slope, I mean.

That's the   the other thing we look at, however   and that also gives guidance to the responding to your question   is we have very different countries in the eurozone. And they are different for a variety of reasons, one of which, however, is relevant to this discussion is how advanced are they on the recovery path? What's their position in the business cycle? And ideally, what we would like to see is higher inflation for countries that are in different   higher, but different inflation rates for countries that are in different positions in the business cycle. And we are seeing some of that, which is another encouraging sign that are proceeding on a convergence path.

MS. FLANDERS: I'm interested, when you say you have lots   plenty of facilities, plenty of instruments   I mean, on most of   it goes back to the point earlier, on most of the estimates of when we might have a recession, a lot of those instruments are not going to allow the kind of room that you had in response to the crisis. I mean, don't you think there will have to be more of a role for countercyclical fiscal policy in that environment?

MR. DRAGHI: Oh, OK, no, but Ben was talking about the opposite problem, namely too high inflation. No, you are  

MS. FLANDERS: Right, but don't you sacrifice  

MR. DRAGHI: Again, what do we do if we have a recession? Well, frankly, even on our medium-term horizon projections, namely until 2020, we don't see a recession. We see   we see lower growth, but nothing that resembles to a recession. So the question is sort of should we actually ask ourselves what we would   not we, actually, not monetary policy. What others would do just in case of a recession. And here, again, it's very difficult to answer in a complex place like eurozone. So you have countries that have fiscal space and countries that don't have fiscal space. And here comes a completely different set of considerations. How do we   how do we ensure that the eurozone becomes gradually somewhat resembling to an optimal currency area? How do we assure that there is a collective convergence? And here, we enter in the sort of the realm of the reform of the monetary union, the deepening of the monetary union.

By the way, on this front, the recent document produced by France and Germany is to be welcome   is to be welcome, because it's an encouraging step in this direction. And it's an important step, made important by the very difficult political circumstances in which this document is being produced. And so that is   and it's also important   it's been made important because I think, if I'm not mistaken, it's the first time we are having a proposal by governments. So we had proposals by the commission. We had proposals in the famous Five Presidents' Report, but they were not governments' proposals. And this is   but we cannot   bottom line of the answer I'm giving to you, we cannot disentangle what would be the policy response in front of a so far hypothetical big recession in the euro area from the question of the reform of the deepening   what we call deepening of the monetary union.

MS. FLANDERS: Just quickly on what you said about the statement, because obviously that's a very timely thing to talk about: Is your interpretation of that agreement that it takes the eurozone closer to having a greater ability to respond fiscally to a future crisis?

MR. DRAGHI: You see, your question can be answered in a variety of ways. And some people would agree with this statement saying, yes, we need a stabilization capacity; others would not.

The important thing that I would draw from this recent development is that not necessarily a specific instrument is being designed, presented, and defined, but it's an approach. It's a   it's a sense that in the future we have to work to deepen the monetary union. Whether this instrument is exactly what you are suggesting, a stabilization budget, or it is an unemployment insurance scheme like has been suggested   hinted at, at least in the document   by the way, we shouldn't   I mean, the document is vague, as you've seen, so much work will be needed on that   it's going to be determined.

The important thing, in my view, is that for the first time, after discussing for several years the deepening of the monetary union, now finally we have something we can work on. And this something doesn't come from five presidents, individuals, but it comes from governments   from the German and French government.

Q: Mario Marcel from the Central Bank of Chile.

President Draghi made reference to underlying inflation and core inflation. And it seems odd to me that we have been discussing price dynamics over a couple of days and very little reference has been made to core and underlying inflation, which is quoted by central banks very often in justifying their decisions. So maybe one reason for that is that the most common measure of core inflation that we have, which is excluding food and fuels, may be too crude as a   as a measure of core inflation. So I wonder how much of what we have discussed these days about   you know, about building alternative price   inflation indicators may be already integrated into the kind of analysis that central banks make. Particularly, President Draghi has made reference on a number of calculations that are made by the ECB.

And a second question is that we have discussed a number of factors that may be pushing inflation down, some of which look like a one-off. But given that there may be a number of those, their effect may be more lasting. But I wonder of how would you react to another one of change in prices, which is raising import tariffs. How would you look at that in terms of measuring inflation and the response of monetary policy?

Q: Thank you. So in the past week just gone we saw the Federal Reserve retire forward guidance that had been in the statement for a long time and we saw the ECB introduce a new form of forward guidance. So I wanted to just take the opportunity to invite both the chairman and the president to comment on what they think we've learned about forward guidance. Specifically, when it is appropriate to use forward guidance? And at what point in the policy cycle does it become, if at all, inappropriate to provide this forward guidance?

MS. FLANDERS: So there was a question about the price-setting that happens from tariff-setting. I guess the broader question coming out of things like even the retaliation that we had announced today from the European Union is, you know, when does this trade issue become a real   start to have a meaningful impact on your assessment of the strength of the global recovery and potentially monetary policy going forward? Chairman Powell?

MR. POWELL: That's your question for me? (Laughter.)

MS. FLANDERS: Well, no, the question   he mentioned   there was a mention of trade. I was just clarifying.

MR. DRAGHI: I can take the import tariffs questions, if you want, and you take the forward guidance   because after all, you lifted it, we don't. (Laughter.)

MR. POWELL: Sure.

MR. DRAGHI: What is being projected in our   in the last set of projections are the tariffs that have been implemented already, which are not very   don't have a very significant effect, either on output or on prices. A completely different analysis would probably be   and, well, we haven't done it yet   when we will consider the tariffs that have been announced or implemented since then, first.

Second, the   it's not easy, but I think at some point we will have to figure out kind of what is the potential   what is the round retaliation effects that's going to take place? And what is the effect   and that's probably the most important thing   what's the effect on confidence? And therefore, what's the effect on business investment? What's the effect on experts? What's the effect on consumers' confidence? We think there have been lessons that one can learn from the past, and they're all   they're all very negative.

So it's not   it's not easy and it's not yet the time, in a sense, to see what the consequence of monetary policy of all this can be. But there is no reason   there's no ground to be   to be optimistic on that. The   on underlying inflation   oh, I'm sorry. Why don't you answer the other question, then I'll answer the underlying inflation?

MR. POWELL: On trade? Yeah. So, first, I'm obviously not going to comment on any particular trade policy, but in principle changes in trade policy could cause us to have to question the outlook. So we have a very wide range of contexts in the business world, in the United States, and around the world. And as we talk to them, they continually and increasingly express concern over trade developments. We talk about that in the beige book, and then the reserve bank presidents talk about it in the (Federal Open Market Committee) meeting. And we talk about it then in the minutes. And I'd say that those concerns seem to be rising. For the first time, we're hearing about decisions to postpone investment, postpone hiring, postpone making decisions. That's a new thing.

If you ask, is it in the forecast yet, is it in the outlook, the answer is no. And you don't see it in the performance of the economy, and we don't have any way to know how to put it into the   into the outlook just yet. So that's where that is.

MS. FLANDERS: Before we get onto the forward guidance, I'm sort of interested in what Governor Kuroda and Governor Lowe have to say on the trade point, because there's a perception that the countries that are more involved in with China will have less   will have some protection from this.

MR. KURODA: Yeah. I mean, rather than direct impact on the Japanese economy the indirect impact on the Japanese economy could be quite significant. If this escalation of tariffs by the U.S. and China continues, and actually implemented, that would significant affect the East Asia supply chains, centering on China, Korea, Japan, Taiwan, as well as Southeast Asian economies. So I really hope that this escalation could be rescinded and normal sort of trading relationship between U.S. and China would prevail. So this is a matter of great concern for Japan.

By the way, I just would like to make one comment on Professor Friedman's question, quite interesting question. Although, I mean   if really inflation rates suddenly accelerate toward 3 or 4 percent, by what factor, if it is through external factors, like sudden currency depreciation or sudden oil price rise, they would have only temporary impact unless the exchange rate continued to depreciate or oil prices continued to rise. So these are temporary factors, so I don't think this would raise a serious problem.

A sudden rise in inflation expectations, that is extremely unlikely. And then you would find that, after all, the Phillips curve was not so flat, the Phillips curve became steeper so that with a tight labor market the wages and prices started to rise, inflation accelerated and so on and so on. Then, of course, you can use a steeper Phillips curve to contain your inflation.

MR. LOWE: Well, on trade, I think what's happening is incredibly disturbing. Can any of us think of a country that's made itself wealthier and boosted productivity growth by building walls? Probably not. I can think of a lot of countries that have made themselves wealthy or more prosperous by reducing walls to people, capital, goods and services. And my country would probably be kind of the posterchild there. So I view what is happening as incredibly worrying.

The tariffs themselves I don't think kind of are going to derail the global expansion, but I can think of two mechanisms where the expansion could be derailed. The first is through financial markets because they're very good at telescoping future events to today. So far, the financial markets have taken a relatively kind of benign interpretation, but that could change very quickly, and so we could see a lot of turbulence as people bring those future events forward to today.

And the other mechanism is that businesses   the option value of waiting goes up a lot and kind of what Jay was saying, kind of people saying, to delay decisions. And in Canada, that's happening. In Mexico, it's happening. Disturbing that it's happening in the United States. It's probably happening in China. I know it's happening in parts of Southeast Asia. So the option value of waiting is very high at the moment, and it wouldn't take that much for financial markets to kind of combine with businesses who are waiting to turn this into a really big global event. So I hope that it has a low probability, but I'm very disturbed at what is happening and I think it's very worrying.

And so on a much smaller issue, on underlying inflation, I agree with Mario about the importance of looking at underlying inflation. And much of our public communication is around measures of underlying inflation, not the exclusion-based ones where you exclude food and energy, but we put a lot of weight on the trimmed mean measure of inflation and the weighted median. And much of our public communication is focused on those two measures.

MR. DRAGHI: Yeah, on the steel and trade and on the discussion of tariffs, there is a more general aspect of what is happening that it's, in a sense, if possible, would be even more worrisome, and that is the, I would say, the desire for unilateral action that has caught several countries, not only the United States. And, yes, we're talking about that in the context of tariffs, but there are other examples of unilateral action that basically undermines the multilateral framework in which, I believe, all of us have grown up.

And so the potential changes that this may start are something that is unknown. It's very worrisome. And again, I cannot see any positive side to that. So it's also a considerable   let me use the word that we use with markets, not with people: uncertainty.

MS. FLANDERS: And there was a question about the lessons of forward guidance.

MR. POWELL: Sure. So fundamentally, as we all know here, even on a good day, there's a tremendous amount of uncertainty about the path of the economy and, hence, the path of policy. And so to be providing a lot of forward guidance all the time is to risk under-communicating about that uncertainty. And I think that's a real risk for us, is to   that we say things and they're often taken as forecasts or even promises and they're really not. So I think in the ordinary course, we should   we should be very careful to communicate as clearly as possible about the level of uncertainty that we have. And I think explicit forward guidance kind of cuts against that.

But in a situation where the central bank needs to correct the public's misperception of the path of rates or needs to provide more accommodation and perhaps is close to the zero lower bound, I think that forward guidance is a very close end-product extension to just regular rate policy. It doesn't have political economy issues with it. It's sort of a commitment technology in a way, even though you probably will wind up saying that it's not a commitment, but the public, we know, will take it as such, to some extent.

And I think it works. I think the record in the crisis was that it did reduce uncertainty about the path of policy and even pushed down expectations about the best path of policy. So a relatively close end-product extension that I would think could well be used in the future when needed, but shouldn't be used in the ordinary course.

Q: Erik Nielsen of Unicredit.

Chairman Powell, last autumn in Washington, you gave a very good speech predicting that the Fed could normalize rates without having any negative impact, material impact on emerging markets. Since then, a few things have happened. You got a big fiscal expansion that sucks up a lot of savings from around the world, you have started to reduce your balance sheet, and you have become chairman. (Laughter.) And then we have had a bit of wobbles in emerging markets. I don't think anybody thinks it's systemic, but it's   but it's certainly out there. So I wonder whether you would sort of expand a little bit on whether you are as confident in what you said at the conference in Washington, today, or whether there is a bit out there that worries you a bit more. The yield curve has flattened a lot, which is, for us in the markets, something we kind of look at and wonder whether that's a forewarning or something more serious.

MR. POWELL: OK. Well, so on emerging markets, I should start by saying that emerging market economies now amount to more than half of economic activity and well more than half of the growth. So they're quite important and important to us. And, you know, the fact that they   having them remain strong is quite important to our own growth, so we recognize and appreciate that.

We also understand that in a world of global capital markets and integrated capital markets and integrated value chains and economies, the things that we do will have spillovers into other   through financial conditions, into other economies. And by the way, vice-versa, of course, as you have seen over the last couple of years.

So, you know, we tried   we understand that. And we know particularly that open   smaller open economies in particular can receive flows at times, which are   which make life difficult. It can be a difficult challenge for them to manage.

So what do we control about that? We control   one thing we control is to try to communicate as clearly as possible about how we see our economy and how we see the path of policy, how we would react to changes in either of those things.

And I think over the last couple of years, if you look back at over the last two years, where we are today is pretty consistent with what we've been saying where we thought we would be now and the way we thought we'd react. So that we do control. And we'll obviously   we'll continue to try very hard to, you know, to carry out our mandate and to avoid surprises wherever possible.

Innovations in Finance (A Special Report) --- Bank of America's Workers Prepare for the Bots: The company expects AI technologies to eliminate existing jobs; it wants its employees to be ready

Bank of America doesn't want employees to worry that its new virtual assistant, Erica, will change or eliminate their jobs. It wants them to prepare for that to happen.

Erica made its debut this year as one of Bank of America's highest-profile efforts to use artificial intelligence. Responding either to speech or text commands, Erica helps customers perform basic banking tasks, like locking a missing debit card or finding routing numbers.

But while the virtual assistant -- the first to be offered in a large U.S. lender's app -- is intended to bolster the customer experience, such innovations pose a threat to existing jobs. To help workers cope, Bank of America recently launched a set of online courses to train them for new and evolving roles in the company.

About three years ago, Chief Operations and Technology Officer Cathy Bessant realized that technological changes were fundamentally transforming the nearly 95,000 jobs in her unit, she says. Her division consists of staffers who build and run the digital tools that underpin the bank, as well as employees in call centers and loan processing. Some of those jobs will go away, Ms. Bessant says, while for others, new roles and responsibilities will emerge.

Across the banking industry, 1.2 million jobs are expected to be affected by AI technologies like Erica, according to a 2018 report by Autonomous Research. Such tools will allow many employees to do their jobs more efficiently, the report says. But thousands of others will find their roles eliminated.

Technology has already changed the nature of work in the banking industry. Many customers, for instance, now perform routine tasks themselves, such as depositing checks digitally instead of visiting a branch. In response, Bank of America and others have minimized the role of tellers and boosted sales staff in branches. AI is expected to continue to affect customer-service roles such as tellers, the Autonomous report says.

Ms. Bessant believes cheap, high-speed computing power means technological change in the industry has now escalated to a pace rivaling the Industrial Revolution. Tasks that involve "routinizable skills that don't add customer or company value" will be automated, she says, and tools like Erica will allow customers to get help quickly without a human intermediary.

The Charlotte, N.C.-based bank already has cut the number of employees across the bank to 209,000 at the end of 2017 from 282,000 at the end of 2011. Going forward, Ms. Bessant doesn't think the number of employees in her unit will necessarily decline further. Instead, she says, the nature of those jobs will change. While some roles will be automated, new jobs will be created to analyze and oversee the automated processes.

The new online courses -- dubbed GT&O University -- are part of an effort to make the transition go as smoothly as possible. The online training, which was rolled out in late April, grew out of the bank's desire to train employees for those new jobs and the "very real and day-to-day need for people to stay motivated about working here," Ms. Bessant says. The courses are available to workers in Ms. Bessant's global tech and operations unit. Employees can choose from classes in four "colleges" encompassing basic banking skills, technology, operations and leadership.

Within each college, employees can pick different topics and sit through beginner, intermediate and advanced training. The topics currently have about 20 to 30 hours of content each, and include AI and various coding languages.

There are also courses on the bank's efficiency initiative known as "operational excellence." In these popular classes, employees learn to document and measure clients' experiences, for example.

The courses are optional, but the bank says they have already been taken more than 20,000 times. The bank says course completions in relevant subjects are starting to become a factor in internal job applications.

When asked how many of the roles in her unit will change in coming years, Ms. Bessant says: "100%. Including, by the way, mine."

Innovations in Finance (A Special Report) --- The Personalized Index Fund's Time May Be Near: Many people may not be up to the task, but some experts expect more individuals will be doing this

Someday soon, your favorite index could be, literally, "the index of my favorite stocks."

While you might not feel qualified, technology already exists to help you build an index just as good as what the experts do, and lower your investment costs in the process.

"Personalized indexing" may not be here yet, but it isn't far off.

Index investing and passive management -- buying and holding a basket of stocks that replicates a benchmark -- has been taking over the investment scene for years. Index funds attract the vast majority of investment flows, compared with active funds. Their low cost, transparency and tax efficiency are the pillars of the multitrillion-dollar exchange-traded-funds business.

Yet what investors have seen is just the beginning.

Whatever the financial-services industry can dream up, and believes the public will buy, it can turn into an index ETF. That is why there already seems to be an index ETF for every occasion and specialty, from artificial intelligence (AIEQ) to gaming (GAMR) to obesity (SLIM) to whatever stuff millennials are into (MILN).

It isn't a big step from that to building an index portfolio that follows your personal rules.

As indexing has evolved, so has the thinking about what index funds are and what they are supposed to do.

Jack Bogle, founder of Vanguard Group and the first index fund, advocated classic indexing, where investors buy into old-school indexes like the S&P 500 and hold them forever. This is truly "passive investing," where both the buyer of the fund and the manager of the fund do virtually nothing.

But many investors these days are "tactical," meaning they trade passive index funds to tilt a portfolio toward whatever sector or region is most promising at any point. As investors, they could be described as "actively passive."

The next extension of this phenomenon becomes the personalized index, one where you make the rules.

While it could be as simple as "buy all large-cap stocks with a positive earnings trend and no debt on the balance sheet," it is more likely to reflect research you trust, with your confidence then leveraged into a portfolio.

Here's how it might work: You go to your brokerage website, logging into the research tools there from your favorite analytical firms, like Morningstar Inc. You screen investments -- mixing and matching what you want to see. You cross-reference different research firms, maybe combining 5-star options from Morningstar with highly rated securities from other research firms and add in personal criteria, like a preference for increasing dividend payouts.

It's a rules-based approach where you make the rules.

Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar, compared the financial concept to what hungry eaters find at Chipotle Mexican Grill: "All of the ingredients are out there, and you order whatever looks good to you, and each person gets their food the way they want it, at a cost they can see and understand. You get exactly what you want."

With the screening done and the rules in place -- including how often to rebalance and how to weight the portfolio -- you click a button to buy the portfolio and -- boom! -- personal index fund.

There will be trading costs to buy the securities -- currently excluded from the expense ratios of traditional funds and outside of the cost structure of ETFs -- but no management fees. And brokerage firms are developing ways to nearly eliminate trading costs, such as flat annual fees for managing a personalized portfolio.

"The technology is here to do it now, but the industry is resisting it because the establishment gets paid to put together baskets of stocks," says David Trainer, president of New Constructs, a Nashville-based research firm. "As cheap as index funds are, the truth is that investment firms have been overcharging people for simply putting stocks into groups. You don't need that middleman anymore, so you will either buy the lowest-cost index funds out there or you will make them and execute them yourself."

Mind you, personalized funds aren't a new concept.

At the height of the internet-stock bubble, various firms started trying to sell investors custom baskets of stocks. The idea was to build low-cost, diversified portfolios where the investor knew, and controlled, all holdings. While the concept was supposed to democratize investing, the leading players moved where the money took them, away from the personalized funds angle and more toward menus of thematic, prepared portfolios.

It's worth remembering, however, that both indexing and the ETF industry didn't become popular concepts overnight. The first ETF opened in January 1993; it took more than 15 years for the industry to reach 1,000 offerings, then took less than 10 years to double from that size.

Thus, the personalized index fund is greeted with skepticism, even as industry watchers can't help but acknowledge its potential.

At a press briefing at the recent Morningstar Investment Conference in Chicago, Morningstar Chief Executive Kunal Kapoor said he believes that "the do-it-yourself crowd will go in that direction [of personalized funds], but the average investor probably won't take it that far."

But a moment later, he was asked what the next generation of investors is demanding from the financial-services industry, and his answer showed the potential of the personalized portfolio.

"Personalization is very big to the new generation," Mr. Kapoor said. "They want something tailored to them instead of being put into a black box. They want to know how their money is working for them. They want transparency and low costs. And those are all things they're going to insist on and won't be satisfied without."

Innovations in Finance (A Special Report) --- The Future Robo Adviser: Smart and Ethical: Well, maybe; but thanks to artificial intelligence , some think it's possible

Today's robo advisers are expected to get a lot smarter. Tomorrow's might even have a conscience.

So say those who study the use of artificial intelligence in finance -- though a digital wealth adviser with morals is likely still a long way off.

The robot advisers of today use algorithms to provide low-cost, automated portfolio-management services to investors seeking discount advice. These easy-to-use tools have grown swiftly: Assets under the control of digital wealth managers are on track to surpass $1 trillion by 2020 after ballooning by triple digits annually since 2013, according to research firm Aite Group.

With their low fees and small minimum-balance requirements, robos have been a boon to middle-income investors, enabling them to access a service once reserved mainly for the affluent. But beyond recommending low-fee index funds based on factors such as an investor's age, income and risk tolerance, and rebalancing portfolios as needed, the tools are limited in what they do.

Critics say not only are robots incapable of providing the kind of personalized, sophisticated financial-planning guidance that human wealth managers can deliver, they don't understand right or wrong. So while robo advisers are required to put clients' interests first when spitting out portfolio recommendations, they can't truly act as fiduciaries, some observers say.

"A robot has no consciousness, no ethics," says Vasant Dhar, a professor of information systems at New York University's Stern School of Business who runs a robo adviser for institutional investors. For a robo to qualify as a fiduciary, "you'd have to have a machine that has a strong moral code and understands the implications" of violating it, such as a regulatory fine or lawsuit, he says.

AI specialists say technology could help robo advisers develop some of the traits that differentiate human advisers from their robotic rivals. To get there, AI would have to accumulate vastly more data, while powering algorithms to simulate different scenarios and "keep introspecting," Dr. Dhar says.

That will take time, if it happens at all, AI specialists say. But the idea is that eventually it will become much easier for an algorithm to provide fiduciary care, perhaps better than a human adviser, who might be tempted to recommend one product over another because of higher commissions or other incentives.

Meanwhile, robo advisers from pioneers such as Betterment LLC and Wealthfront Inc., as well as those from traditional asset managers and Wall Street banks, are grabbing an increased share of assets from their human rivals.

Firms including Bank of America Corp.'s Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley have been targeting younger investors and those with more moderate wealth, offering their robo services to those with just $5,000 in assets. Betterment has no minimum at all. By comparison, human advisers at Merrill typically take on accounts of at least $250,000 in investible assets, while the threshold at Morgan Stanley tends to be even higher.

Aite Group estimates the number of robo-advice clients will climb to 17 million by 2021 from 1.8 million in 2016, with a big chunk of those clients having less than $10,000 in investible assets.

As assets grow and technology advances, the expectation is that robo advisers will become more sophisticated. Future robos might have the ability to interview clients, instead of simply relying on answers from a risk-tolerance questionnaire to make fund recommendations. Some envision consumers accessing robo services though a platform that looks like Amazon.com, where the robo will be armed with troves of data to help it understand investors' lives.

Today's robo advisers aren't really all that intelligent, says Tucker Balch, professor of interactive computing at Georgia Institute of Technology. They're essentially simple programs doing what human advisers do, like making trades and rebalancing clients' portfolios -- just much faster and more frequently. Eventually, that will become the baseline expectation of every investor, he says, which will push firms to use AI to try to differentiate themselves from competitors.

Portfolios managed through robots likely will stretch beyond index-tracking funds into more active approaches that aim to spot opportunities in, say, specific stocks.

Some robos are expanding their offerings already. Wealthfront in March added a higher-cost fund that uses derivatives to replicate a popular hedge-fund strategy known as risk-parity. Wealthfront and others also offer smart-beta funds, which weight stocks by factors other than traditional market capitalization.

Some say human involvement may always be part of the equation. Someone has to write the algorithms for robos, even if the algorithms then teach themselves. And it is humans -- the firms that employ them and the clients who hire them -- who will chose which metrics to maximize.

Mr. Balch is among those who believe human designers can equip robos with ethics. As for a conscience? "The best AIs will ruthlessly strive to maximize their profit," he says, with a conscience arising "as a consequence of what that formula looks like."

In the Name of Security, Banks Share Information; But privacy experts warn this new cooperation could unfairly hurt some customers

In a new effort to combat global crimes and terrorism, banks around the world increasingly are conducting joint investigations that rely on sharing the details of suspicious transactions and the accounts that are involved.

Authorities in the U.S. and elsewhere have lauded the effort, but it has raised concern among privacy advocates, who worry it could lead to some people or companies being penalized without due process.

In one example of the cooperative efforts, seven of the world's largest banks have been working together to facilitate the sharing of data such as the identities of account holders and the dates and other details of certain financial transactions. This has allowed them to experiment with ways to analyze large amounts of transactions data using artificial-intelligence tools as they try to uncover activities like money laundering or terrorist financing.

Created in 2015, this group includes J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Citigroup Inc., Bank of America Corp., Wells Fargo & Co., U.S. Bancorp, HSBC Holdings PLC and Standard Chartered PLC.

"We are working together with other banks and with law enforcement around the world to share information in a more open way," says Colin Bell, HSBC's group head of financial-crime risk. "We play an active or founding member role in partnerships in six countries," he says, adding that together these efforts have "contributed to dozens of arrests and the seizure of millions of dollars of suspected criminal funds."

The banks declined to publicly discuss the details of their cooperation under this group.

Banks in the U.S. were given the legal authority to share limited amounts of information with each other, regulators and law-enforcement authorities by the 2001 Patriot Act, a package of measures designed to combat terrorism. But such coordination has spread significantly in recent years, with the number of institutions engaged in the process nearly doubling between 2014 and 2018, according to the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network.

Praise and concern

Regulators over the past decade have encouraged banks to form information-sharing groups by signaling that the Patriot Act's protections for such cooperation extend to dozens of suspected underlying crimes that can produce tainted money including weapons or human trafficking as well as more benign activities like food-stamp fraud.

"We are highly encouraged by, and supportive of, the private sector's willingness to engage in this type of exchange," Sigal Mandelker, the Treasury's under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, told a Senate panel in January.

But privacy advocates worry that banks may be stretching their authority to share sensitive customer data, unnecessarily exposing personal information, leading to the possibility of individuals or companies being penalized over the mere suspicion of wrongdoing.

"My concern with this program is what customer information is being shared," says Shana O'Toole, president and founder of the Due Process Institute, a Washington nonprofit that acts as an advocate for what it considers fairness in the legal system. "Efficiency is great, but constitutional protections are mandated."

Advance analysis

Traditionally, individual banks have relied on markers such as the size of transactions or names of people on government sanctions lists to flag suspicious activity, an approach that can result in many so-called false positives, or warnings about transactions that turn out to be entirely legitimate. But now banks are using sophisticated new technologies in analyzing the information they're sharing. Artificial intelligence allows them to detect patterns in data that wouldn't otherwise be readily apparent, and sharing information gives the technology more data to work with. For instance, a single bank may be unable to tell whether a company is receiving an atypical amount of income given its size and the business it's in. But by extrapolating from a broader set of data, an artificial-intelligence application could spot an outlier. "What you would get with information-sharing is smarter positives," says Greg Baer, president of the Clearing House, a trade group for large banks.

As information moves more smoothly between financial institutions, the government could also have an easier time obtaining customer data. Reports often filed by banks in conjunction with information sharing can be used by law enforcement in investigations without any need for judicial approval, though a subpoena is needed for the information to be used as court evidence.

There are "all sorts of underlying criminal activities that generate proceeds and therefore potentially tie things to money laundering. So we do look at that broadly," says Jamal El-Hindi, deputy director of the Treasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, which collects and analyzes financial intelligence. "At the same time, we don't want financial institutions to take that so broadly that their purpose in information sharing is not related to countering money laundering and terrorist financing."

Information sharing, Mr. El-Hindi adds, can produce more-targeted investigations. "The more that they can look at some of those things together, the better they're able to piece together some of the puzzles of this criminal activity," he says.

AT&T in Talks to Acquire AppNexus for About $1.6 Billion; Deal would unite telecom giant with prominent ad technology firm

AT&T Inc. is in talks to acquire advertising technology company AppNexus, according to people familiar with the matter, a deal that would give the telecom giant a foothold in digital ad sales as it seeks to become a challenger to Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc.

AT&T is expected to pay around $1.6 billion, the people said. AppNexus, which is backed by investors including ad giant WPP PLC, investment firm TCV and Wall Street Journal parent News Corp, was valued at $1.8 billion in a 2015 funding round.

The company filed confidentially for an initial public offering in 2016 but has held off amid an unforgiving climate for public offerings.

Acquiring AppNexus would advance AT&T's ambitions to build a robust advertising business. AppNexus operates one of the largest online ad exchanges, automated marketplaces that allow advertisers to buy space across thousands of websites, targeting their desired audiences.

Cheddar earlier reported the AT&T talks with AppNexus.

Already, AT&T's DirecTV unit sells TV ads. The company's recent acquisition of Time Warner Inc. renamed WarnerMedia   will give it access to much more TV ad space from channels like TNT, TBS and CNN.

AT&T believes it can appeal to advertisers by allowing granular targeting of TV ads to households with certain characteristics using its huge amount of data on wireless customers to target ads and measure whether they are effective. The company last summer brought in a top executive from WPP, Brian Lesser, to run its advertising and analytics business.

With an acquisition of AppNexus, AT&T would move deeper into the digital ad realm. But it would remain a relatively small player compared to the giants, Google and Facebook, which together are expected to have 56.8% of the U.S. digital ad market this year, according to eMarketer.

While some ad tech firms work only for publishers, helping them manage ad space on their sites, or ad buyers, helping agencies purchase ads, AppNexus is in both lines of business.

The company's chief executive, Brian O'Kelley, is an ad tech veteran. He is credited with building one of the first ad exchanges, Right Media, which he eventually sold to Yahoo in 2007.

AT&T's main rival, Verizon Communications Inc., already is a player in online advertising after its 2015 purchase of AOL for $4.4 billion. Verizon purchased the digital assets of Yahoo in 2016 for $4.83 billion and merged them with AOL to create a new company called Oath.

"By all rights, the carriers really should be the next big mobile media players," said Jon Jackson, founder and chief executive of Mobile Posse, a mobile advertising technology company. "They have over a hundred million subscribers unlocking their AT&T phones 120 times a day, they're in a great position. But first they need to sort out how they get content in front of their subscribers and next sort out how to plug in mobile advertising."

Firm Stakes Claim in Data Turf

The big data scrum in the commercial real-estate industry is about to heat up with the launch of a new service by a startup whose investors include Blackstone Group LP.

VTS provides a mobile-friendly dashboard to landlords and brokers that allows them to track prospective tenants from the time they inquire about a space until they move in. This has given the startup insight on critical market metrics such as current rents and how much interior work landlords must pledge to persuade tenants to sign deals.

Now, the company is offering a tool, set to be announced Monday, that amalgamates the data it has on individual leases to give clients a window into market trends.

"We can show average base rents, tour activity, what kinds of industries are looking and average transaction times for different industries," said Nick Romito, chief executive of VTS. "Now you're making decisions with empirical data vs. 'I've got a feeling the market is hot.' "

VTS isn't the first to recognize the value of such market insight to tenants and landlords. Market data also is being sold by CoStar Group Inc., which listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market in 1998 at under $10 a share and is currently trading above $400. Other startups, like CompStak Inc., have rolled out similar services in recent years.

The emergence of the new players has posed a threat to traditional real-estate-services firms like JLL, CBRE Group Inc. and Newmark Group Inc. These companies, which used to have a monopoly on market data, are being forced to adapt as information becomes available on other sources.

Many of them are shifting from keepers of market data to advisory roles similar to the change in the financial-services industry, where many stock-market brokers have become financial advisers. "The real-estate brokerage world has gone through and is going through a similar transformation, albeit 15 years behind," said Michael Shenot, a managing director at real-estate-services firm JLL.

The real-estate industry has been slow to adopt new technology. Many landlords were protective of building and lease information because they thought they could drive higher rents, some real-estate executives said.

"There are very few industries in the world where you aren't using large data sets to make decisions," VTS's Mr. Romito said. The office, retail and industrial sectors "have been this laggard part of the space where everyone around us is using market information to make decisions except for us," he said.

CoStar was the first major disruptive force in the commercial real-estate data industry. Before its launch in 1987, landlords and brokers held most of the information for such things as commercial rents, building tenancies and occupancy rates.

But CoStar amassed data on properties by talking to brokers and landlords, taking photos and looking at building tenant rosters. Traditional brokerage firms eventually ceded control of some market data to CoStar and formed a love-hate relationship with the company: They liked its data but resented the high prices it charged.

Later entrants have used different approaches to collecting data. CompStak taps a crowdsourcing system to gather specific lease details from brokers and others who report the data in exchange for access to other CompStak information.

CompStak Chief Executive Michael Mandel said that as companies like CompStak and VTS expand there is a greater chance of butting heads.

"As we each get bigger we will start competing more with each other," Mr. Mandel said.

Verscend Technologies Inc., backed by private-equity firm Veritas Capital, has agreed to acquire Cotiviti Holdings Inc. for about $4.16 billion in cash to create a data and analytics firm focused on health care.

Under the agreement, Cotiviti shareholders will receive $44.75 in cash per share of Cotiviti stock owned, which represents a 32% premium to Cotiviti's share price as of June 4, the day before reports surfaced that the company was exploring a sale.

The deal is valued at $4.9 billion, including debt. The transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2018.

Waltham, Mass.-based Verscend is a provider of health care data solutions.

Atlanta-based Cotiviti is a provider of payment accuracy and analytics focused primarily on the health-care industry.

The combined business will operate as a private health care information technology company focused on data analytics. Together, the companies say they plan to provide solutions that increase affordability, reduce waste and improving outcomes and quality.

Shares of Cotiviti, up about 19% in the past year, rose 10.5% to $44.08 in morning trading Tuesday.

SurveyMonkey says it has filed for an initial public offering.

On Monday, the San Mateo, California-based company, incorporated as SVMK Inc., said that it had submitted an S-1 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

A provision of the JOBS Act allows certain companies to keep their S-1 filing private until just weeks before listing on public markets.

SurveyMonkey helps businesses with a range of survey types, including market research and customer satisfaction. SurveyMonkey says that 100% of the Fortune 500 companies use its tools.

Founded in 1999, the business has raised hundreds of millions of dollars of both equity and debt financing. In 2014, it was valued at $2 billion. Its investors have included Social Capital, Salesforce Ventures and Bain Capital Ventures.

Dave Goldberg, the late husband of Facebook Inc. COO Sheryl Sandberg, was SurveyMonkey's chief executive from 2009 until his unexpected death in 2015. Zander Lurie later became the company's CEO, after leaving GoPro Inc.

SurveyMonkey did not disclose when it plans to complete its public offering.

Other venture-backed companies on file for U.S. IPOs include analytics software Domo Inc. and Youxinpai (Beijing) Information Technology Co., Ltd., a Chinese automotive e-commerce platform known as Uxin.

Chernova's Take: Post-IPO Sale Decisions Loom; VCs and LPs must plot a course for when and how to sell shares following expiration of lockups

Now that the IPO pace has picked up, many venture investors and their LPs will have to decide the optimal way to sell shares following the end of lockup periods.

They can put them up for sale on the open market or hire investment bankers yet again to do follow-on offerings.

Most tech investors prefer open-market sales, according to Jay R. Ritter, a University of Florida professor who focuses on IPOs. But open-market sales are more likely to move the stock down.

When early investors in MuleSoft and MongoDB went that route, they saw share prices decline, according to Barclays analysts who studied the deals.

The average price over one month post lockup was 7% lower for MongoDB, for example, than the average for the month pre lockup. The share decline "may have been partly driven by insiders monetizing their stakes in open market transactions," Barclays wrote.

Some companies do choose to sell through follow-on offerings, which can pay off.

Investors in big-data company Talend SA sold shares through a secondary offering last year at a price that was 13% higher than the average share price during the month before lockup expired, Barclays wrote. In that case, it looked like the higher price justified banking fees, which Barclays says could be as high as 5%.

Not every company has a real option, however. In cases where there's a limited stock liquidity, investors are urged to go with a follow-on offering. Appian, for example, conducted such an offering even though it was at a price 14% below the average during the month before lockup, according to Barclays.

In a market where software companies are enjoying strong interest from public market investors, many VCs and the LPs to whom they transfer shares will be tempted to take their chances by selling on the open market. But they shouldn't forget the downside of those moves on the stock.

"If it's a small amount or it's dribbled out over time, then open-market sales generally save on investment banking fees," Dr. Ritter said. "If it's dribbled out, there's not a lot of price impact."

Hedge fund Winton spins out its big data  unit

Hivemind was created to clean up and analyse complex data for use by traders

Winton, one of the largest quantitative investing firms in the world, is spinning off its big data analytics unit, as the demand for unstructured data booms in the investment world.

The company, Hivemind, will seek external capital to continue to grow as its own standalone entity after opening to clients outside of Winton last year. Daniel Mitchell, who ran a team of data scientists at Winton, was appointed Hivemind s chief executive officer.

Two others from Winton, former business development senior vice-president Henrik Grunditz and former managing director in research, Mark Roulston, were named chief revenue officer and senior data scientist.

 By separating the company from Winton s core investment business, we intend to make Hivemind s data science expertise available to a wider market, and to unlock the value we believe exists in the business,  said Winton founder David Harding.

Hivemind s employees will own 25 per cent of the equity in the new company, while Winton will own the rest.

Hivemind is seeking to tap into the need to clean up and analyse reams of complex and unstructured data sets so that they can be used for trading.

Opimas, a consultancy, estimates that investors will by 2020 be spending over $7bn a year on procuring and processing  alternative  data sources, such as satellite imagery, internet scrapes, credit card information or geolocation data.

 Companies today are grappling with the growth in unstructured data, such as text, video or images,  said Mr Mitchell.  Hivemind s cloud-based platform efficiently structures this data so that companies can process and analyse it. 

IDC, another consulting firm, forecasts that the amount of digital data in the world will swell tenfold from 16 zettabytes   a zettabyte is a trillion gigabytes   in 2016 to 163 zettabytes by 2025, but trawling through all this data, cleaning it up and making it usable for practical purposes is a complex, expensive task.

 Concerns that data will prove unreliable or will produce an inaccurate trading signal may nullify the value of alternative data sets,  Deloitte said in a recent report.  Since each alternative data set may be unique or scarce, investment teams may have difficulty finding a way to verify the accuracy of a data set. 

The number of alternative data providers has exploded to over 300 companies, according to Alternativedata.org, a trade body for the nascent industry, which sell their products to asset managers including T Rowe Price, BlackRock, Schroders, and a host of quant hedge funds.

Highlighting the rising interest in big data and quantitative investment approaches, Axa Investment Managers on Monday announced that it would be cutting 210 jobs and ploughing some of the savings into more advanced data collection and analytics.

WorldQuant, one of the bigger algorithm-powered hedge funds, earlier this month set up a  Data Exchange  to streamline its acquisition of data that act as the raw fuel for its investment strategies.

 Because we are a quantitative asset management firm, data is a key ingredient in our development of trading signals,  WorldQuant said in a statement.  Data is integral to our research process; we are constantly scouring the planet for new and better sources of it.

World Cup round-up, volume 2

Barely half a week in to the World Cup, and it's hard not to notice the desperate scramble of the pundit class as they re-frame their carefully manicured pre-tournament narratives. Germany, once a lock-in for the semi-finals among Fleet Street's finest, could face an early exit. The champagne football failed to flow from Brazil's holy trinity in a draw with Switzerland, because as it turns out, Messi is human after all.

It has not been a great start for Goldman Sachs' quantitative World Cup model, either. As we covered last week, the bank makes its predictions by harnessing  recent developments in machine learning , mining  data on team characteristics and individual players to work out which factors help to predict match scores , and algorithm-ing, or something.

However it works, Germany's poor showing at the weekend, plus the lackluster performance of the other big guns, has lead Goldman to revise its week-old tournament probabilities:While these results do not change our model's modal projection, they do affect the overall probabilities. We continue to see Brazil as the most likely to lift the trophy, and France's chances improve somewhat. However, an overall German victory has become a lot less likely with the probability falling from 10.1% to 5.3% because they now stand a lower chance of topping their group. Although our  base case  predicts that Germany will come first and go on to meet Serbia in the round of 16, a second-placed finish puts them on a trajectory to face Brazil instead, where our model predicts they will be defeated.

Germany versus Brazil in the round of 16? Yes please.

Here's the new tournament model which Goldman's Soccerbot 3000 spat out in light of the weekend's action:

England is still losing to Germany in the quarters (on penalties, obviously). At least the English public had the opportunity to bask in Germany's defeat today, before the inevitable sideways passing dirge in less than an hour.

Elsewhere in World Cup related guff is a research piece from Ernst & Young's Item Club, a UK economic forecasting supergroup. It's not another Economics PhD predicting increased sales in televisions, beer, snacks and St-George's-flag-bearing merch, is it?

Oh, it is:The better that England do and the more matches they consequently play in the tournament, the greater the potential positive impact will be on the economy. A decent England performance could lift retail sales (through spending on World Cup merchandise, England replica shirts and on food and drink to enjoy during the matches) and provide a temporary boost to consumer confidence through a  feel good  factor.

Sigh.However, if England crash out early, there will likely be a lot of reduced priced merchandise on offer.

Value investors take note: those Jordan Henderson shirts should be worth something in a few years if they dip below book value. Well, more than SunEdison or Horsehead Holding shares, anyway.The FIFA World Cup also usually gives a lift to sales of televisions as some people look to upgrade to a bigger screen. However, it needs to be kept in mind that the boost to TV sales may be largely just bringing forward sales that would have eventually been made anyway.

So no real change to the economy then, over a year or so.The pub sector will also likely benefit from the FIFA World Cup as many people enjoy watching the matches in a convivial atmosphere.

And apparently the Great British Public likes to watch football in the pub and drink beer, who knew?One concern is that major sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup can often have a negative impact on productivity. However, there will be little risk of this during England s group matches. While the matches against Tunisia and Belgium both take place on weekdays, they kick off at 7pm. Additionally, the match against Panama is on a Sunday.

Looking at England's schedule, there is no possible way they can play on a working day (Monday-Friday) during working hours (8am-7pm). It seems this supergroup is more Zwan than Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young.

Outside of the financial punditry, the FT newsroom awaits England's Volgogradian debut tonight with bated breath. With expectations at a historic low, and thus secret optimism riding high, what could possibly go wrong?

Hedge funds hit amid fears over bitcoin crackdown

Hedge funds investing in cryptocurrencies have suffered plunging returns this year, with performance dropping 35 per cent as digital coins experienced a volatile first half.

Figures from the US analytics firm HFR showed that global hedge funds investing in cryptocurrencies and the technology that underpins digital money have posted negative performance in four out of five months this year, after rising more than 2,700 per cent in 2017.

According to the HFR Blockchain Composite index, crypto hedge funds were down 17 per cent in May after rising 45 per cent in April. The negative returns come amid a tough few months for digital assets, with bitcoin losing more than half its value this year, falling to $6,600 from about $17,500 at the start of the year. The drop has reduced the market capitalisation of bitcoin from nearly $300bn to just over $100bn, according to Coinmarketcap.com.

Concern over a regulatory crackdown on the sector has fuelled negative sentiment and price volatility, analysts said. "I expect crypto markets to remain volatile for the foreseeable future," said Henri Arslanian, fintech and cryptocurrency lead for Asia at PwC. "Whilst retail investors may see volatility in the crypto markets as a downside, many crypto funds see it as an opportunity."

Bitcoin and another cryptocurrency, ether, were given a reprieve on Thursday when a US Securities and Exchange Commission official indicated that they were not securities and did not need to be registered, which would leave them outside the regulator's jurisdiction.

A number of specialist hedge funds have been established over the past few years to take advantage of the cryptocurrency boom. Pantera Capital, for example, was founded in 2013 and claims to be the first US bitcoin investment firm.

In Asia, a number of crypto-focused funds have emerged, including Kinetic Capital, which invests in blockchain technologies. Interest among Asian investors is surging, according to Josh Gu, director of quantitative research at the HFR index division. "Cryptocurrencies have been very volatile. The topic is still hot in China and Japan."

Cryptocurrency hedge funds see returns plunge in volatile times

Specialist funds target digital coin despite mixed messages from regulators

Hedge funds investing in cryptocurrencies have seen plunging returns this year, with performance dropping by 35 per cent as digital coins suffered a volatile first half.

Figures from US analytics firm HFR showed that global hedge funds investing in cryptocurrencies and the technology that underpins digital money have posted negative performance in four out of five months this year, after rising more than 2,700 per cent in 2017.

According to the HFR Blockchain Composite index, crypto hedge funds were down 17 per cent in May, after rising 45 per cent in April.

The negative returns come amid a tough few months for digital assets, with bitcoin losing more than half its value this year, falling to $6,600 from about $17,500 at the start of the year. The drop has reduced the market cap of bitcoin from nearly $300bn to just over $100bn, according to Coinmarketcap.com.

Concern over a regulatory crackdown on the sector has fuelled negative sentiment and price volatility, analysts said.

 I expect the crypto markets to remain volatile for the foreseeable future,  said Henri Arslanian, fintech and cryptocurrency lead for Asia at PwC.  Whilst retail investors may see volatility in the crypto markets as a downside, many crypto funds see it as an opportunity. 

He added that the  long term positive impact of the number of institutional players entering  cryptocurrency investment was more important than short-term price fluctuations.

However, bitcoin and another cryptocurrency, ether, were given something of a reprieve on Thursday when a US Securities and Exchange Commission official indicated that they were not securities and therefore did not need to be registered, which would leave them outside the regulator s jurisdiction.

A number of specialist hedge funds have been established over the past few years to take advantage of the cryptocurrency boom. Pantera Capital, for example, was founded in 2013 and claims to be the first US bitcoin investment firm.

In Asia, a number of crypto-focused funds have recently emerged, including Kinetic Capital, which invests in blockchain technologies.

Interest among Asian investors is surging, according to Josh Gu, director of quantitative research at the HFR index division.  Cryptocurrencies have been very volatile, the topic is still hot in China and Japan. 

He said cryptocurrencies appealed to individual investors with a large risk appetite.  However, the [Chinese] regulator has banned some of the crypto trading platforms because of risk, so some investors might have panicked. 

A number of cryptocurrency trading venues have also suffered from high-profile hacks. Earlier this year, Japan s Financial Services Agency raided the offices of Coincheck to examine its response to a digital attack that caused more than $500m in losses.

Yapian, which operates the Youbit exchange in South Korea, entered bankruptcy proceedings at the end of last year after hackers stole Won5.5 billion ($5 million) of bitcoins   17 per cent of its assets.

Business
Executives Fear Trade Conflicts Could Dent Economic Growth; Uncertainty over tariffs and tightening credit and labor markets could offset boosts from the U.S. tax overhaul

Corporate finance leaders are worried that the good times won't last as an increasingly cloudy long-term economic outlook plays out against the backdrop of trade spats and geopolitical risk.

The passage of the U.S. tax overhaul eliminated significant uncertainty and strengthened earnings for many companies. Economic data from Washington to Beijing has been strong as global growth is estimated to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/imf-forecasts-global-growth-of-3-9-this-year-strongest-since-2011-1523970001" this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Capital spending by companies in the S&P 500 rose about 24% to $166 billion during the first three months of the year compared with 2017, according to Credit Suisse Group AG data.

"That's a very business friendly environment to be operating in, better than in the recent past," said John Shrewsberry, Wells Fargo & Co.'s finance chief.

Longer-term forecasts are less optimistic. The IMF warns that the boost from the U.S. tax cuts "https://www.wsj.com/articles/imf-sees-u-s-potential-growth-at-half-the-pace-of-white-house-estimates-1528995732". Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal worry that a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/economists-think-the-next-u-s-recession-could-begin-in-2020-1525961127" as the Federal Reserve"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-raises-rates-and-signals-faster-pace-in-coming-years-1528912910?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=16".

Some CFOs say a downturn appears overdue, amid signs of tightening credit and labor markets. And the specters of trade tensions and political turmoil from Mexico to London to Washington are haunting even the rosiest of company outlooks.

The widely cited "https://www.wsj.com/articles/political-risk-returns-to-markets-as-tide-of-stimulus-wanes-1528719648" surged 64% between January and May, reaching its highest level in a year even as the capital spending boom got under way.

Nick Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford University and an author of the index, attributed the surge to U.S. President Donald Trump's tougher stance on trade, saying the leader "means business in introducing tariffs and pulling away" from the Group of Seven industrialized nations.

The White House is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-approves-tariffs-on-about-50-billion-of-chinese-goods-1529016073?mod=article_inline" on tens of billions of dollars of Chinese goods starting in July, a move that is likely to spark retaliation from China. The Trump administration also is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-canada-rift-roils-nafta-talks-1528745823" the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.

The trade conflicts have given businesses pause, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. He said companies are clearly increasing capital outlays, but he believes the investment growth would be greater without the trade tensions.

"I think that it is having an impact on investment decisions and hiring decisions," Mr. Zandi said. "Businesses are not pulling back. But they are not fully engaging. Investment spending growth is good. But I think it would be even stronger if not for this cloud created by these trade tensions."

The uncertainty surrounding tariffs and trade both in the U.S. and globally has forced Donald Allan, chief financial officer at tool maker Stanley Black & Decker Inc., to double the amount of time he spends on contingency planning.

"I'm spending at least 40% of my time on that type of stuff, if not more," Mr. Allan said, adding that he frequently consults a variety of external experts from investment bankers to lobbyists to industry associations to get a range of perspectives.

The goal is to make sure "that we're effectively managing all of the risks but also making sure that we're not overreacting," Mr. Allan said.

For Verizon Communications Inc., the concern tied to trade friction was any possible impact it could have on the company's supply chain, said CFO Matthew Ellis. The scope of any disruption is likely to be limited as the telecommunications giant is focused on the U.S., though the company imports some networking equipment from overseas.

"You do your best to make sure you have contingency plans," he said. "You think through, 'Am I solely reliant on one particular supplier, one outcome?'"

Other companies also are bracing for a potential decline in economic sentiment. Discovery Inc., the New York-based media and TV company, plans to have money on hand now that it completed the acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive Inc. in March. "The new Discovery is a free cash flow machine," CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels said Wednesday. He forecasts that cash left over from operations, including capital spending, will reach $2.3 billion this year.

"Having free cash flow in these times of uncertainty gives us a lot of flexibility," Mr. Wiedenfels said.

Mr. Trump's high-profile talks with North Korea, the unfolding impact of Britain's exit from the European Union, and turmoil in the Middle East and Venezuela, are among the additional geopolitical stresses demanding the attention of finance chiefs.

Amid this backdrop, according to Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, companies have the more predictable concern of an economy that is "fairly advanced in a business cycle."

CFOs are increasingly wary of rising costs associated with putting out a product or service such as labor, transportation and energy, he said.

"Until the dust settles, people just definitely have to stand back and wait for that to happen," said Wells Fargo's Mr. Shrewsberry.

Hedge fund attacks Chinese-backed crypto exchange

Institution criticises practice of paying traders to exchange coins

A Hong Kong-based hedge fund has launched an attack on a Chinese-backed cryptocurrency exchange for helping inflate the price of a digital token whose market capitalisation has risen beyond $500m in a matter of months.

Negative reports in the $13.9bn initial coin offering market have increased in recent months as more institutional investors have entered the industry. ICOs have become an alternative source of fundraising for start-ups. However, regulators have raised questions about whether issuers are selling unlicensed securities.

In recent weeks, sceptics of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin have prevailed as the world s most traded digital currency has tumbled to below $7,000 per unit, down from almost $18,000 in December. Many of those critics, including the head of the Bank for International Settlements, have said the value of the instruments, which are designed using blockchain technology, are inflated and pose risks to financial stability.

Amber AI, a Hong Kong-based quant fund that trades primarily in cryptocurrencies, launched an attack on Chinese-backed FCoin Token on Friday, saying that the FCoin exchange was designed to inflate the price of its token.

Amber AI said in its report that people who trade on the exchange pay a trading fee to FCoin and that fee was paid back in the form of FCoin Tokens. Traders were then rewarded for holding the token with a daily payout from a pool that represented 80 per cent of the fees earned by the exchange.

The problem with the design, according to Amber AI, which said it does not have a position in FCoin Token, is that it encourages market participants to deploy bots that trade to reap those rewards. That activity, in turn, has driven the price of the coin from $0.10 to $1.05 in just a matter of months, pushing up the market capitalisation of the digital currency to above $500m.

 This creates a self-reinforcing spiral where the revenue-pool grows as the trading volume grows, hence creating more demand for [FCoin Token],  Amber AI said in its report. Amber AI was set up last year by former Morgan Stanley traders, and runs a quantitative strategy for investing in cryptocurrencies.

FCoin did not respond to emailed questions. The exchange was set up earlier this year by Zhang Jian, the former chief technology officer of Huobi, one of the world s largest cryptocurrency exchanges.

The value of the ICO market has risen to $13.9bn, according to industry intelligence provider Coindesk, with most of that issuance occurring over the past year. In step with that growth, institutional investors have moved into the market, with 167 crypto funds appearing in 2017, according to data from Autonomous Analytics.

Negative reports on ICOs have proliferated in 2018, with investors often posting online complaints. A number of alleged scams have also surfaced.

Heard on the Street
Banks' Regulatory Windfall Misses Mark

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

In the early days of the Trump administration, expectations were high for sweeping financial deregulation that would be a boon to bankers. While much of that agenda has been realized, large banks have reason to be disappointed.

This week marks the first anniversary of a Treasury Department report that laid out the administration's deregulatory vision for banks and credit unions.

One year later, the biggest winners are small and midsize lenders, plus nonbank financial institutions that effectively compete with the largest lenders but under far less scrutiny, says Karen Petrou, analyst at Federal Financial Analytics.

The most significant change was a bill signed by the president that raised the threshold at which banks must submit to annual Federal Reserve stress testing to $250 billion in total assets from $50 billion. This was a major change in the Dodd-Frank regime that will be a boon to around two dozen midsize banks and clears the way for more mergers and acquisitions among smaller banks.

Regulators also have taken some actions to loosen regulations hitting the top Wall Street institutions, including a proposal for streamlined enforcement of the Volcker rule that bans proprietary trading.

But other actions have cut against the biggest banks. Most notably, the Federal Reserve's proposed changes to the stress tests introduce a new capital buffer that may raise capital requirements on investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley while making the process less predictable for all of the largest banks.

Another major letdown for these institutions is the lack of follow-through on the Treasury's recommendation to re-examine the "gold plating" of international standards whereby "globally systemically important" U.S. banks are required to hold higher levels of capital than their peers abroad.

According to an analysis by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., globally systemically important banks in the U.S. on average held tangible capital equivalent to 6.9% of total assets at the end of last year compared with 4.8% at their European peers.

The Treasury report stated that this "can make U.S. institutions less competitive globally" and "can sometimes create an undue burden of higher costs to our economy."

Yet there is no talk emanating from the Fed today of lessening this burden. Asked about the regulatory agenda at a news conference on Wednesday, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said he has a "full docket" ahead of him, but he focused mainly on the need to tailor rules for smaller institutions.

That may not be an accident. Doing anything to help top banks like Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs remains a tough sell politically in Washington.

Despite this, large-cap bank stocks have outperformed regional ones since the election. The large-cap KBW Nasdaq Bank Index has risen 44% over the period compared with a 35% rise for KBW's regional bank index.

Much of that likely can be attributed to macro factors such as higher interest rates and increased trading activity in the markets. Investors shouldn't expect much more upside based on deregulation for the biggest lenders, though.

Rubin's Take: Crypto's Growing Pains

Banking Regulator Walks Back Comments on Discrimination

Fed Limits Credit Exposure Big Banks Can Have With Each Other

Ether Shouldn't Be Subject to SEC Regulation, Official Says

Study Finds  Speed Bumps' Help Protect Ordinary Investors

Crypto's Growing Pains

Cryptocurrencies have lost a bit of their shine during the first half of 2018, after 2017 ended with astronomical prices for the most popular currencies such as bitcoin.

There's no single cause for the significant price drops since then, but much of the decline can be attributed to the persistent manipulation concerns from regulators, the omnipresent threat of hacks hanging over exchanges, and the ability of investors to bet against bitcoin prices via bitcoin futures.

As federal regulators have dug deeper into cryptocurrency issues, combating manipulation in underlying spot markets has been a primary focus.

Last week, my colleagues and I reported that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission had "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-regulators-demand-trading-data-from-bitcoin-exchanges-in-manipulation-probe-1528492835" that make up the index for CME Group Inc.'s bitcoin futures, as part of a broader investigation into possible bitcoin price manipulation.

That article contributed to a drop in the price of bitcoin, which has continued to fall over the past week. But it wasn't the only factor. Much of the price drop in recent days was attributed to worries stemming from "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-falls-sharply-after-another-cryptocurrency-exchange-is-hacked-1528681094", a South Korean exchange the latest in a series of breaches of crypto platforms.

Finally, the past six months have allowed investors to do something that wasn't really possible before December 2017: bet against bitcoin, both as a unique asset and as a proxy for the entire cryptocurrency phenomenon.

A May research note from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco found that the Dec. 17 launch of bitcoin futures at CME triggered "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/05/08/debut-of-bitcoin-futures-triggered-crash-in-price/" because it allowed investors to bet on its price falling.

Given the avalanche of bad news for cryptocurrencies, it probably should come as no surprise that there's an army of investors out there eager to bet against them.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Banking Regulator Walks Back Comments on Discrimination

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/banking-regulator-walks-back-comments-on-discrimination-1528998790" of low-income lending rules won't undermine curbs on bias in banking, as he walked back an earlier statement that he hasn't "personally observed" discrimination.

"There is a lot of evidence of inequity in the world," Comptroller of the Currency Joseph Otting told the Senate Banking Committee a day after he clashed with House Democrats over the issue.

Mr. Otting said he wanted to "correct the record" from Wednesday's testimony. He said he believes discrimination exists, but he hasn't personally experienced it.

Fed Limits Credit Exposure Big Banks Can Have With Each Other

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-limits-credit-exposure-big-banks-can-have-with-each-other-1528999802" of exposure the largest banks operating in the U.S. can have with each other, putting in place a long-awaited rule to reduce the chance of snowballing credit risk in the financial system during times of crisis.

The rule, completed Thursday by the Federal Reserve, would limit the credit exposure that eight "systemically important" U.S. banks have with each other to 15% of high-quality capital, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co., and Citigroup Inc. The same limit would apply to foreign banks with a U.S. holding company with $500 billion or more in assets.

Under the rule, all banks with $250 billion or more in total assets will have to cap their credit exposure to any other company to 25% of high-quality capital.

Ether Shouldn't Be Subject to SEC Regulation, Official Says

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/ether-shouldnt-be-subject-to-sec-regulation-official-says-1528993984" isn't an investment that should be regulated as stocks and bonds are, a senior U.S. regulator said Thursday.

The remarks, made by a top Securities and Exchange Commission official, indicate ether is clear from SEC oversight that could have imposed significant regulatory scrutiny on the foundation and programmers involved with creating it in 2014. Ether is a cryptocurrency, on par with bitcoin, that isn't subject to the extensive investor-protection rules the securities regulator enforces, SEC Corporation Finance Director William Hinman said.

"Based on my understanding of the present state of ether, the Ethereum network and its decentralized structure, current offers and sales of ether are not securities transactions," Mr. Hinman said in remarks prepared for a San Francisco conference.

"https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2018/06/14/crypto-market-rallies-on-secs-officials-ether-stance/"

Study Finds  Speed Bumps' Help Protect Ordinary Investors

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/study-finds-speed-bumps-help-protect-ordinary-investors-1528974002" can help protect ordinary investors from high-frequency traders, according to a study by an economist at the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The study, published Wednesday, bolsters the case for the business model of IEX Group Inc., an upstart exchange that slows down trading with a "speed bump" that pauses inbound orders for 350 microseconds before relaying them to its exchange for execution. IEX also delays outbound updates to its market data feed.

When it sought SEC approval to become an exchange in 2015, IEX said the delay would prevent rapid-fire traders from racing ahead of typical investors and unfairly profiting off the speed advantage. That claim was disputed by high-tech market maker Citadel LLC, which warned the SEC that allowing speed bumps would "increase transaction costs for all investors." The study found a decrease in trading costs for some stocks.

Analysis: Big Banks' Regulatory Bonanza Not as Advertised

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/big-banks-regulatory-bonanza-not-as-advertised-1528968601", expectations were high for sweeping financial deregulation that would be a boon to bankers. While much of that agenda has been realized, large banks have reason to be disappointed.

This week marks the first anniversary of a U.S. Treasury Department report that laid out the administration's deregulatory vision for banks and credit unions.

One year on, the biggest winners are small and mid-sized lenders, plus non-bank financial institutions that effectively compete with the largest lenders but under far less scrutiny, says Karen Petrou, analyst at Federal Financial Analytics.

The Bank Branch is Dying Just Not At These Banks

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-bank-branch-is-dyingjust-not-at-these-banks-1529055000?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=2" have closed nearly 9,000 branches this decade. Yet many smaller banks are in building mode, a sign that broader economic growth is taking hold and community lenders are recovering after lean postcrisis years.

More than 1,200 banks expanded their number of branches from 2012 to last year, according to data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Many of those are tiny their assets averaging $1.65 billion, or less than 0.1% the size of the nation's largest bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Still, the number of small banks adding to branch counts is meaningful, exceeding institutions closing locations over the same time frame by more than 200, according to the FDIC data.

Former HSBC Executive Convicted of Fraud for Front-Running

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-hsbc-executive-convicted-of-fraud-for-front-running-1508779714" found a former high-ranking HSBC Holdings PLC executive guilty on charges that he misused information about a client's $3.5 billion currency trade to make millions of dollars for the bank.

Mark Johnson, HSBC's former global head of foreign-exchange cash trading, was the first banker to face criminal charges stemming from a U.S. Justice Department probe into foreign exchange rate manipulations. He was convicted on eight counts of wire fraud and one count of wire-fraud conspiracy; he was acquitted on a ninth wire-fraud count.

Chinese Insurance Regulator Pleads Guilty to Bribery Charges

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-insurance-regulator-pleads-guilty-to-bribery-charges-1528984329" confessed in court to charges he took bribes worth $3 million, paving the way for the sentencing of an official whose downfall symbolized Beijing's battle against financial risk.

During a one-day public trial Thursday, prosecutors accused Xiang Junbo of abusing his power and accepting money and gifts worth 19.42 million yuan both directly and indirectly over 12 years as a financial sector official, until his removal as head of the insurance regulator in April of last year, state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.

Judges Wouldn't Consider Forgiving Crippling Student Loans Until Now

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/judges-wouldnt-consider-forgiving-crippling-student-loans-until-now-1528974001" to consider reducing student loans. That is now changing, and some judges are throwing lifelines to people struggling to repay their debt.

In interviews with the Wall Street Journal, more than 50 current and former bankruptcy judges, frustrated at seeing borrowers leave federal courtrooms with six-figure debts, say they or their colleagues are more open to chipping away at the decades-old guidelines that determine how such debt is treated.

"If the law's not going to be improved by Congress, we have to help these young people who are drowning in student loan debt," said U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge John Waites in South Carolina.

China Tech Giants' Costly Wars to Go Cashless

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-tech-giants-costly-wars-to-go-cashless-1528977600" Internet giants is taking place in shopping malls, street-food stalls and nail salons across the country anywhere you might pay with the swipe of a phone.

For the past year, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Tencent Holdings Ltd. have been locked in a costly rivalry over mobile payments. This spring, Alibaba affiliate Ant Financial Services Group posted a rare quarterly loss after spending aggressively on discounts and financial rebates to expand users of its Alipay network keep abreast of the pay function in Tencent's enormously popular messaging app WeChat.

The explosive ascent of mobile payment in China means the stakes are high. Hundreds of millions of Chinese now use their smartphones to pay for everything from bus and taxi rides to meals and movie tickets--making wallets with cash or credit cards increasingly superfluous.

Pleading for Student Loan Forgiveness

Nearly 45 million people carry student debt in the U.S. the total amount has more than doubled over the past decade to $1.4 trillion most backed by the federal government. It has eclipsed credit cards as the largest source of consumer debt after mortgages. Almost every other type can be extinguished in bankruptcy, but legal standards made college debt largely untouchable. Borrowers typically must repay student loans over their lifetime, even those facing extreme financial hardship.

Consumer bankruptcy lawyers are starting to notice that "https://www.wsj.com/articles/judges-wouldnt-consider-forgiving-crippling-student-loans-until-now-1528974001". One Las Vegas law firm recently filed the first cancellation request in its 14-year history after hearing a judge at a conference voice concern over student loans. Other lawyers said growing sympathy among judges is making lenders more willing to reach resolutions out of court.

Such rulings are rare because few troubled borrowers attempt to cancel their student loans, because of the historically slim chances of victory. Last year, only 473 people of the millions repaying student loans sought relief using bankruptcy, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis.

No one tracks outcomes of student-loan cancellation cases, and only a handful advance to the point where a judge rules. In one examination of cases in 2017, judges ruled on student-loan debt 16 times, according to lawyer Austin Smith who analyzed WestLaw's database of key decisions. In those decisions, judges preserved student-loan debt in 12 cases, and canceled it in three. One borrower got partial relief.

Graduate Students at Historically Black Colleges Struggle With Loan Repayment

Historically black colleges and universities have some of the lowest shares of graduate student loan borrowers who made progress repaying their federal student loans five years after entering repayment, according to "http://www.aei.org/publication/graduate-schools-with-the-lowest-rates-of-student-loan-repayment/" by Jason D. Delisle of the American Enterprise Institute. Mr. Delisle looked at higher education institutions with 100 or more graduate students and studied their progress paying down federal student loans between 2009 and 2014. He found 12 of the top 20 graduate and professional schools with the highest share of borrowers who hadn't reduced their principal balance in the five-year period are historically black colleges and universities.

Staying Silent About Bond Markups Is a Gambit

"Federal prosecutors decided that lying to your customers about the price you had paid for bonds is fraud," but banks that quietly let customers pay excessive markups may not be protected from charges, Matt Levine writes in a Bloomberg "https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-06-13/bond-traders-enter-murky-water-with-excessive-markups". The Securities and Exchange Commission's recent enforcement action against Bank of America Merrill Lynch shows "the rule here is not that you have to disclose your markup. The rule is that you have to disclose or, preferably, avoid excessive markups. What makes an excessive markup is a bit in the eye of the beholder," he says.

Pro Private Markets
Private-Equity Firms Focus on Cybersecurity

Private-equity firms are catching up with their financial services peers when it comes to technology, with cybersecurity and the cloud identified as investment priorities for the year ahead, according to an industry survey.

Banks and asset managers have already begun to use artificial intelligence and machine learning in parts of their business. Trading units within banks are looking at how to make money from cryptocurrencies; and many financial services institutions have joined with fintech startups.

But private equity has been slow to embrace these innovations. That seems set to change, according to fund administrator Augentius, which asked buyout and real-estate firms about their use of technology.

"It's fair to say the old stereotype of the industry lagging behind when it comes to seeing the importance of technology is now firmly outdated," said Ian Kelly, chief executive of Augentius. "The results underline how attitudes have shifted."

More than half of respondents (55%) identified technology as a high priority for internal spending over the next year, with data management and the cloud identified as the top areas for investment followed by cybersecurity. AI and machine learning were cited by 17% of respondents as areas their firm is investing in the technologies were also identified by half of respondents as having the potential to transform the private-equity and real-estate industries.

"The past decade has seen the sector make profitable use of the vast array of information now available to it via ever-more-sophisticated analytics," Augentius said. "The application of AI is a logical next move. Although there is much still to be developed, firms are already taking tentative, experimental steps, and this could easily emerge as a dominant theme in the near future."

However, there are barriers to adopting new technologies, the biggest being the difficulty of replacing legacy IT systems cited by 40% of respondents. This is a problem across financial services, with banks investing billions to overhaul old systems.

That was followed by an internal lack of technology leadership, talent and skill (39%) again, a problem faced by the broader industry as the most talented programmers are often drawn to technology giants such as Google. Institutions in the City of London have been working out how to compete with these companies for skilled workers by using contemporary office design and offering perks such as unlimited annual leave.

Equifax has recruited an IBM executive to lead its technology efforts as the credit bureau looks to rebound from its massive 2017 data breach. 

The company announced Thursday it has named Bryson Koehler its chief technology officer. Mr. Koehler most recently served as CTO of International Business Machines Corp.'s Watson and its cloud platform. 

At Equifax, he will oversee the company's global information technology strategy and development and work closely with the product, data and analytics teams, the company said. Equifax also noted Mr. Koehler's experience in security throughout the announcement, including his role bringing "all of the security teams together to ensure IBM had the world's most compliant cloud, strengthening the company's technical credibility." 

Re-establishing credibility is a priority for Equifax. In September 2017, the company disclosed that "https://www.wsj.com/articles/weve-been-breached-inside-the-equifax-hack-1505693318" had compromised the data of millions of people. The data included customers' names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, addresses, tax identification numbers, email addresses and driver's license information. The company initially said it affected 143 million, but that "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-hack-might-be-worse-than-you-think-1518191370" to 147.9 million. 

Shortly after the hack was disclosed, Chief Information Officer David Webb and Chief Security Officer Susan Mauldin retired.
