Keywords: At Startups, People Are the 'New Infrastructure'

Silicon Valley of 2015 resembles nothing so much as the beloved Busytown children's books by Richard Scarry. I don't mean all the construction -- though there's plenty of that -- but in terms of what businesses companies are pursuing. In an industry built, like Google, on the strength of an algorithm, the ranks of the billion-dollar startup club are swelling with something altogether different -- companies predicated on the scale and power of their infrastructure. Here's the crazy part -- that infrastructure is made of people.

Uber, Lyft, AirBnB and companies like them are "the FedEx of the modern tech industry, if you think about FedEx as a massively complicated logistics organization that happens to get paid to deliver packages," says Scott Kupor, managing partner at venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz.

It might seem specious to compare Uber with FedEx. One employs about 2,000 people, the other 162,000; one doesn't own a vehicle while the other recorded $3.5 billion in capital expenditures last year. But that's the trick of what I call the New Infrastructure, and it's the reason Uber is valued, premarket, 80% as much as FedEx.

"We just reveal infrastructure that already exists," says Marc Gorlin, chief executive and founder of Roadie, a startup that aims to disrupt -- what else? -- FedEx. Roadie connects people who happen to be driving between two cities with people who have bulky or heavy items they need transported, the sort of thing FedEx and United Parcel Service can't handle and that courier services charge exorbitant rates to move.

It's this act of "revealing infrastructure" -- not the mislabeled "sharing economy" -- that is at the heart of startups such as Uber, AirBnB, Roadie and Instacart, which pays people to pick up and deliver your groceries. America is awash in able-bodied and underemployed young people, motor vehicles and, in the case of AirBnB, homes that are less than fully occupied. It's a combustible mix: Just add a coordinating mechanism, in this instance the always-connected pocket supercomputers known as smartphones, and what you get is a seemingly endless potential to put goods and labor to productive use.

"I think an area of tech that doesn't get talked about as much but is really important is just how many people these companies need," says Brian O'Malley, a partner at venture-capital firm Accel Partners. The New Infrastructure isn't fiber optics or cell towers or data centers -- though none of it could be built without that underlying kit.

And that's perhaps the most remarkable thing about this movement: For the first time in decades, billion-dollar startups are being built not on gains in productivity made possible by eliminating humans, but by their wholesale recruitment.

"This is a very popular meme today in the Valley: If you talk to aspiring entrepreneurs in accelerators or earlier, it's 'We want to be the Uber for something or the AirBnB for blank,' " says Chuck Ganapathi, the founder of Tactile, which makes software that helps salespeople do their jobs better.

The industries these aspiring entrepreneurs want to tackle tend to be things that haven't been touched by technology in a long time -- like the taxi industry -- and, unlike startups in the Valley days of yore, labor-intensive, whether it's cleaning houses or buying groceries.

Taking on these industries isn't for the faint of heart. At the core of all of these businesses is what's known as a two-sided market, in which companies must create markets for both labor (think Uber drivers) and customers.

Just getting one of these markets going can be daunting. "It's the 'cold start' problem," says John Horton, professor at NYU Stern and formerly the staff economist at oDesk, a site that pairs freelancers with employers. "In general, no one wants to come to your market if you don't have the other side of the market," he adds.

Once the two-sided market is in motion, with enough supply to feed demand and vice versa, balancing these markets is no less challenging. It's both a problem for predictive analytics and behavioral economics, requiring a mix of data science and incentives.

"The way we think about this internally at Instacart is this is really a machine learning problem," says Apoorva Mehta, CEO of Instacart. "We have models running at all times of day to predict how many shoppers are needed at any time of day, anywhere."

All two-sided markets also need the ability to shape demand and supply. Uber talks often about its use of surge pricing to get more drivers on the road, but Mr. Mehta says raising prices is also a way to damp demand, persuading customers to buy at times when more shoppers are available.

The jobs created by the New Infrastructure are often derided as being insecure and potentially ill-paying. We live in a time when shrinking unemployment hasn't led to increasing wages, so it's worth asking just what kind of jobs these companies are creating.

Is the New Infrastructure made out of people because there remain tasks at which humans are superior to automation, or has the value of human labor finally sunk so low that it's cheaper -- or at least cheap enough -- to use humans in startups that were previously unworkable? Furthermore, what do these jobs say about how we value certain types of labor, and therefore people, compared with those who build all the technology that enables these startups, and who can therefore afford to use them?

Investors Flee From Meyer's Convexity

One of the investment world's biggest stars has lost some of his shine. Jack Meyer, who more than quadrupled the size of Harvard University's endowment in nearly 15 years at its helm, is in a yearslong skid at his Boston-based hedge-fund firm.

Investors have pulled $3 billion out of Convexity Capital Management LP over the past year after a period of performance the firm itself described as "not good," "disappointing," and "the worst of times," according to investor documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal and people familiar with the firm.

The withdrawals are among the latest signs that even the hedge-fund world's marquee names are finding it hard to cope with low interest rates engineered by central banks around the world and muted swings in prices of stocks, bonds and other assets. Hedge funds, on average, have lagged behind stock and bond indexes for five years in a row.

"We failed to add value, and that was our job," Mr. Meyer, 69 years old, said in an interview. "I would put this pretty high on the 'frustrating period' list."

Convexity's assets under management stand at $10.9 billion, down about one-quarter from the $14.8 billion the firm oversaw in early 2013.

Convexity pursues a complex fixed-income strategy that seeks to take advantage of securities prices it believes are out of sync with one another. But with interest rates at historic lows and markets placid until relatively recently, Mr. Meyer said he found himself stymied.

"The Fed had rates pretty well locked up, and they spent trillions of dollars to keep things exactly where they wanted," Mr. Meyer said. "We are often able to overcome that -- particularly when there's some choppiness in the market -- but during this two-year period, we weren't."

Other hedge-fund managers have expressed similar frustration with the global economic environment. However, some observers are growing impatient with that defense.

"Suddenly it's everyone else's fault," said Brian Shapiro, founder of hedge-fund analytics company Simplify LLC. "It's a form of capitulation. You either produce uncorrelated returns, or you don't."

Convexity reports performance in terms of whether it has beaten or underperformed market benchmarks. That means that even when the firm says it is in the red, investors may have made money -- just not as much as a passive investment that mimics a benchmark.

By the firm's own metrics, Convexity has fallen short of benchmarks by 2.4, 3.7 and 0.3 percentage points in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, the documents show. Since inception, Convexity has beaten benchmarks by an average of 3.73 percentage points a year.

Some investors are starting to lower their expectations for hedge funds overall. Deutsche Bank AG released a survey this week that found only 14% of wealthy investors foresee double-digit returns from hedge funds, off from 37% a year earlier.

Mr. Meyer gained fame in the 1990s as chief investment officer of Harvard Management Co. He chalked up above-average returns by being among the first to embrace so-called alternative investments outside traditional stocks and bonds. Harvard's endowment grew from about $5 billion when he took over to more than $22 billion when he stepped down in 2005. He left Harvard to start his own firm, which he named Convexity after an academic descriptor for fixed-income risk.

Lately, Mr. Meyer has partly shifted tack. He reduced his use of leverage, or borrowed money, and cut back on trades on interest-rate movements, investor documents indicate. The firm reported positive relative performance in the final quarter of 2014 and is up about an additional 0.6 percentage point in 2015.

Bigger Mortgages Likelier to Go Into Foreclosure; Since the recession, the foreclosure rates for more-expensive homes have consistently surpassed those for the overall market.

 Mo' money, mo' problems," proclaimed the late Brooklyn rapper Notorious B.I.G.

He wasn't talking about the current U.S. foreclosure market, but he could have been.

According to numbers from real estate analytics firm CoreLogic, in December 2014 the country's foreclosure rate fell to 1.4%, the lowest level since March 2008. But while the overall market is well on the way to recovery, elevated foreclosure rates persist at the high end. In December, the rate for mortgages of $750,000 or more was 2.5%.

This disconnect has characterized the 2008 crash and its aftermath, says Sam Khater, CoreLogic's deputy chief economist. High-end housing had traditionally seen fewer foreclosures than the market at large, but, he notes, the last decade's recession turned that convention on its head.

The CoreLogic data shows that in January 2006, the foreclosure rate for mortgages of $750,000 or more was 0.1%, compared with an overall rate of 0.5%. By March 2008, though, these numbers had crossed over, with the high-end rate up to 1.5%, versus 1.4% for the overall rate.

pict004.jpg

Ultimately, the foreclosure rate for $750,000-plus mortgages topped out in May 2012 at 6.8%, almost double the peak of 3.6% that the overall market reached in October 2011. And while both rates declined for the last 2 years, the upper end of the market continues to see higher foreclosure levels.

What accounts for this role reversal, which runs contrary to the broader U.S. trend of accelerating gains at the top of the income bracket? One key factor, Mr. Khater says, is that the 2008 housing crash was accompanied by a stock-market crash that disproportionately affected wealthier homeowners.

Also contributing to the elevated rates at the high end, Mr. Khater notes, is the fact that several states with significant stocks of luxury housing have some of the highest foreclosure rates in the country. The three states with the highest December 2014 foreclosure rates are New Jersey (5.2%), New York (4.0%) and Florida (3.7%) all spots with large concentrations of high-end homes.

One reason recovery in these states has lagged behind, Mr. Khater says, is that they are judicial foreclosure states. In such states, foreclosures must be handled through the court system, which can lead to longer processing times.

| Associated Press | While the overall market is well on the way to recovery, elevated foreclosure rates persist at the high end.

Citi Sale Shrinks Bank's Umbrella

Another piece of banking is moving to the shadows.

Citigroup Inc., the nation's third-largest bank by assets, confirmed Tuesday that it would sell its large U.S. subprime-lending business, OneMain Financial, to Springleaf Holdings Inc., a nontraditional lender majority-owned by private-equity firm Fortress Investment Group LLC.

The $4.25 billion deal, reported by The Wall Street Journal on Monday, is the latest example of a core banking business, in this case lending to lower-income customers, moving from a financial conglomerate to a smaller rival that aims to serve customers more efficiently in part because it faces a lower regulatory burden.

The move is emblematic of postcrisis regulations forcing banks out of their old mind-set of trying to serve as many customers as possible under one roof. In this case, Citigroup decided that U.S. subprime borrowers, once a lucrative group to deal with because of the high interest rates they pay, aren't attractive enough to keep in a world of tighter regulation.

Subprime loans are given to borrowers who have low credit scores, which can result after borrowers fall behind on loan payments, go through foreclosure, bankruptcy or for other reasons. In recent years, big banks "have shied away from these borrowers," said Cris deRitis, director of consumer-credit economics at Moody'sAnalytics, a unit of Moody's Corp. "That's exactly what we're seeing today with this merger."

Across trading and lending, hedge funds and private-equity firms have plowed into businesses after once-dominant banks retrenched. In the lending business, some private-equity firms have invested in lenders looking to make inroads against banks.

One impact of the move is that consumers may see fewer protections as smaller, less regulated companies take over bigger portions of the business. Fewer regulators have oversight over nonbank personal loan lenders. However, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau can bring enforcement actions against them if it finds they are engaging in unfair, deceptive or abusive practices, like deceiving consumers about interest rates on their loans. It can also supervise them if it determines they may pose a risk to consumers.

The latest deal underscores large banks' reluctance to return to the subprime market after the financial crisis. Before the downturn, subprime lending served as a greater revenue source for lenders that could charge higher interest rates and fees in exchange for lending to risky borrowers. Regulations that kicked in during the downturn crimped that revenue. A credit-card law in 2009, for example, limited charges that banks could impose.

At a panel discussion last year, Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat said that shadow banking would "serve a very important role to society," filling a void to meet demands that banks no longer can.

Tuesday, in a statement, he said: "While this business didn't fit our strategy, it serves customers who deserve and need credit."

The transaction will turn Springleaf into the country's largest subprime lender by number of branches. Shares of the Evansville, Ind., lender climbed $12.19, or 32%, to $50.23, in 4 p.m. trading. Citigroup's shares rose 24 cents, or 0.5%, to $53.73.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. noted in a research report Tuesday that U.S. banks could lose $11 billion in annual profit, or about 7% of last year's net income, to nontraditional, more focused lending companies.

The biggest piece of that, $4.9 billion according to the Goldman report, comes from the type of consumer lending that Springleaf and OneMain specialize in: loans to individuals for a variety of items from consolidating high-rate debt to paying for home improvements, medical bills or vacations.

The combined lender, to be named OneMain, will have nearly 2,000 branches. It also will have about 2.5 million customers. The deal, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close in the third quarter and result in 200 branch closures.

"This has been the four-year overnight sensation of ending up with this" company, said Wesley Edens, Springleaf's chairman and co-founder of Fortress.

International Property: London: Canary Wharf's Buyers Have Ambitious Plans

The investors behind one of the biggest real-estate deals in U.K. history are preparing to reach much deeper into their pockets.

Qatar's state investment fund and Canadian firm Brookfield Property Partners LP are in the final stages of completing the takeover of Canary Wharf's majority shareholder, Songbird Estates PLC, for GBP 2.6 billion ($4 billion). The new owners will get an initial income return from the sprawling office complex of a mere 4.3%, according to a Green Street Advisors estimate.

But they aren't stopping there. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Brookfield Chief Executive Ric Clark made it clear that the venture plans to develop aggressively Canary Wharf's 30 acres of vacant land.

Songbird -- whose biggest shareholders are China Investment Corp., Morgan Stanley and U.S. investor Simon Glick -- owns 69% of Canary Wharf Group, and has been planning to develop the vacant parcels for years with residential, office and retail projects.

Those plans were hampered by the downturn and the contraction of the financial-services industry, which traditionally rented the bulk of Canary Wharf offices.

In his first public remarks since the deal, Brookfield's Mr. Clark said the new owners are ready to provide Canary Wharf "whatever [it] may need" to fund its pipeline of offices, homes and shops. Over the next six to 10 years, the Canary Wharf Group plans to build 22 new buildings across four projects, providing 5.1 million square feet of new offices, shops and residential space. Overall, Canary Wharf has rights to build 11 million square feet.

Mr. Clark declined to estimate costs. But Green Street estimates the cost of building up Canary Wharf's mixed-use development pipeline is roughly GBP 600 a square foot, or GBP 3.06 billion for 5.1 million square feet.

Canary Wharf Group "can look to their deep-pocketed sponsors in order to help support the business plan," Mr. Clark said. He also provided new behind-the-scenes details on the bidding for Songbird. The bidding enabled Brookfield to succeed at its longtime dream of taking control of the property.

The venture's bullish plans for Canary Wharf highlight global investors' continued faith in the London market even after several years of sharp increases in real-estate values. Investors point to rising office, apartment and retail rents as evidence that the market still has a way to run.

But investors like Brookfield and Qatar Investment are taking bigger risks to go after those rents. John Lutzius, an analyst at Green Street, said the new owners are making smart moves, but he also pointed out: "Land is the most volatile real-estate investment."

Qatar and Brookfield have been among the hungriest London investors, buying property in the last two years worth $7 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively, according to Real Capital Analytics. In December, for example, Qatar bought the London headquarters of HSBC Holdings PLC, Canary Wharf's largest building, for more than GBP 1.1 billion. It also owns the Shard, a skyscraper; Harrods department store; and the 2012 Olympic Village.

The additional capital outlay in Canary Wharf doesn't mean Brookfield plans to temper its wider London ambitions. "We're working on a couple of other things in the city as well," Mr. Clark said. "We have no plans to slow down."

Canary Wharf has come a long way since the late 1980s, when a group of investors led by Canadian developer Olympia & York Developments Ltd. set out to transform an area of derelict shipping docks, five kilometers east of London's traditional financial quarter, into a modern business hub.

The original vision for Canary Wharf was to build skyscrapers with offices that would suit the tastes of the financial-services industry. But lately the company has focused more on residential as the banking sector contracted and London's housing shortage intensified.

While there has been no residential development yet on the land in the original Canary Wharf area, apartment buildings have sprouted on adjoining sites.

Starting this year, Canary Wharf has plans to build 3,610 new homes on its Wood Wharf site in the original Canary Wharf area, along with office space, stores and a primary school. At least a third of these could be rental apartments, said John Garwood, group company secretary at Canary Wharf Group.

Toronto-based Brookfield, which controls about 22,000 rented residential units in the U.S. and Canada, has been maneuvering to take control of Canary Wharf for years. The company made a run at the complex in 2004 but lost out to the group led by Morgan Stanley.

CIC wasn't immediately available for comment. Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Mr. Glick wasn't able to be reached for comment.

Brookfield has relationships with both CIC and Morgan Stanley, Mr. Clark said. "We didn't waste opportunities to bring up Canary Wharf when we saw them," he said.

Brookfield has past connections with Olympia & York, which failed during the downturn of the early 1990s. Brookfield purchased many of its New York properties at steep discounts. A number of Olympia & York former employees, including Mr. Clark, wound up working at Brookfield.

The Brookfield-Qatar venture launched its hostile takeover in November. To succeed, they needed to convince at least one of Songbird's three major shareholders China Investment Corp., Morgan Stanley and U.S. investor Mr. Glick to sell their stakes.

 Going into this, we knew CIC and Morgan Stanley would be sellers. Simon Glick was a bit of an unknown," Mr. Clark said.

CIC wasn't immediately available for comment. Morgan Stanley declined to comment. Mr. Glick wasn't able to be reached for comment.

Brookfield has relationships with both CIC and Morgan Stanley, Mr. Clark said.  We didn't waste opportunities to bring up Canary Wharf when we saw them," he said.

So when it came to making the approach,  we knew at the right price, they'd both exit," he said.

QIA and Brookfield launched a 295 pence-per-share bid in November. Songbird responded by publishing an independent report highlighting Canary Wharf's development pipeline that valued shares at 381 pence.

The bid was later sweetened to 350 pence per share. It was enough. The three major shareholders announced in late January they were ready to accept the bid.

Fed's Exam Has Banks In a Lather

WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's scrutiny of global banks has set off a scramble among foreign firms as they staff up and revamp operations to meet the central bank's rising expectations.

The Fed's "stress tests" are expected to find shortcomings in risk management at the U.S. units of some foreign banks, including Deutsche Bank AG and Banco Santander SA, according to people familiar with the matter. The Fed announces preliminary results on Thursday and full results on March 11.

The foreign banks are finding themselves tripped up not by capital requirements but by what the Fed sees as flaws in how they measure and predict risks and losses at their sprawling operations, including businesses that haven't been heavily regulated in the past.

Last March, for example, the Fed found "widespread and significant deficiencies" in Santander's stress testing and capital planning, including governance of its U.S. operations. The central bank restricted dividend payments by the firm's U.S. arm, but in a sign that governance remains a challenge, Santander's U.S. auto-lending subsidiary later declared a dividend that violated the Fed's order.

The auto-lending unit has declined to comment on the dividend-payment misstep.

The potential stress-test failures would mark the second straight year multiple European firms didn't meet the Fed's expectations for the qualitative, rather than quantitative, part of the tests.

Overseas lenders such as Deutsche Bank, Barclays PLC, Credit Suisse AG and UBS AG are now spending heavily and recruiting project managers, data experts and other staff needed to run the complex computer models involved in the Fed's annual exercise. The outlays here are in addition to even larger sums devoted to compliance in Europe.

The U.S. test assesses whether a bank could keep lending during a severe downturn and determines whether the central bank permits a firm to return capital to shareholders.

At HSBC Holdings PLC, whose U.S. unit failed the Fed tests in 2014, global regulatory and compliance costs increased by $774 million last year to $2.4 billion, including investments needed to restructure the bank in the U.K. and to run U.S. and European stress tests, executives said on a Feb. 23 conference call.

The Fed, concerned about a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis, last year began making the U.S. operations of foreign firms subject to the same regulatory regime that has already forced U.S.-based banks like J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. to change the way they do business. Overseas banks are required by the Fed to organize their U.S. operations under a single holding company by mid-2016. By 2017, they must comply with a rule that will force them to maintain minimum capital levels here.

In the past month, Deutsche Bank, Barclays, Credit Suisse and UBS have all posted jobs related to the U.S. stress tests on the social-networking site LinkedIn. Credit Suisse is forming a U.S. stress-test management group to ensure the bank's overall control environment meets the Federal Reserve's expectations, according to the postings. Barclays is hiring staff to help design and build technology to prepare for the tests.

Santander has appointed a new U.S. chief executive, The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday. Earlier, it put in place new chief financial and risk officers, invested in technology and changed its governance policies as part of an effort to improve regulatory compliance.

All the banks declined to comment on their stress-test preparations. Both Deutsche Bank and Santander have said they are working to improve compliance.

"There has definitely been what is perceived as a quantum increase [in regulation] of foreign banking organization in the U.S.," said V. Gerard Comizio, a partner in the global banking practice group in the Washington office of law firm Paul Hastings.

The Fed declined to comment on the stress-test performance of specific banks. Officials at the central bank have justified the extra capital and stress-testing requirements for U.S. units of foreign banks by noting their activities have expanded significantly in recent decades and could affect financial stability here.

During the 2008 financial crisis, foreign firms were relying heavily on overnight U.S. dollar loans when markets wobbled and froze. The U.S. central bank had to provide what it called "extraordinary support" in the form of dollar funding to those firms.

Still, some European officials have chafed at the added U.S. oversight, saying it isn't necessary to require minimum capital levels at U.S.-based subsidiaries because European parent companies have significantly improved their capital positions. Deutsche Bank and Santander passed stress tests run by the European Central Bank in October, but those examinations didn't include the kind of qualitative criteria that are part of the Fed's effort.

"We're not for a minute suggesting there shouldn't be different stress tests in different jurisdictions," said Jonathan Faull, director general for financial stability at the European Commission. "What I think makes sense is that we should discuss methodologies and to the extent possible look at results together."

Failing the test is both a public-relations hit and a financial constraint. It usually raises questions among investors about banks' ability to manage U.S. regulations. U.S. subsidiaries of banks that fail face limitations on moving profits back to the parent companies.

Deutsche Bank and Santander's challenges aren't unique. Seven foreign-owned firms are taking the stress test this year, but according to Fed projections, 10 additional foreign banks will eventually be subject to new, stricter rules requiring a single U.S. holding company with minimum capital levels. By 2018, all those firms' U.S. holding companies will be subject to the stress tests, according to the projections.

For Santander, the compliance effort has meant integrating its banking subsidiary with Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc., its huge auto-lending business. Santander Consumer hadn't been regulated by the Fed, meaning it wasn't subject to requirements for risk controls, governance structures and the like.

Last May, Santander Consumer declared a $52 million dividend, but then was told by the Fed that the move violated a restriction imposed on its U.S. parent company for failing the Fed's stress test. In November, Santander Consumer said it had received a Justice Department subpoena scrutinizing "the underwriting and securitization" of auto loans.

Deutsche Bank is also in the midst of a reorganization that will include integrating its profitable securities and investment-banking business with Deutsche Bank Trust Corp., its U.S. bank holding company. The latter unit is the one that is expected to fail the stress test, according to people familiar with the matter.

"Doing a reorganization in the middle of your first or second year of stress testing is a disaster for all of these banks," said David Little, managing director for enterprise risk solutions at Moody'sAnalytics. "These are very significant infrastructure builds [and] you can imagine too that these are pretty resource-intensive and everybody is kind of hunting for the same knowledge base."

Dealmaking saga over GFI nears conclusion

The six-month saga over interdealer GFI appears all but over but there are many in the market who think the dealmaking isn't done yet.

Shareholders have voted down the GFI board's structured deal with CME Group and tendered their support for BGC Partners' $6.10 per share offer, which values GFI equity at roughly $780m. Even the GFI board members, such as Mickey Gooch, chairman and co-founder, tried everything they could to direct their deal to the CME have accepted their fate.

The reality is that BGC will become the "largest and most profitable wholesale brokerage company". Many think CME still has a part to play in this drama.

Amid the stories about takeover tactics between interdealer brokers, it got lost that the initial deal involved the break-up of GFI. What CME really wanted, and has been pursuing for more than two years, is Trayport and Fenics, the electronic trading software and risk analytics businesses. A purchase could transform its fledgling European energy trading operations.

These assets are the real crown jewels, especially Trayport. It's a software platform but it allows traders, brokers, utilities and resource companies to conduct voice and electronic trading and clearing of gas, coal, power and emissions in over-the-counter markets in Europe. Widely used in the market, it's a perfect fit for new regulations. There really is nothing out there quite like it.

There's anecdotal evidence explaining why many people expect CME will own it. Most of the rhetoric from BGC to date has been about the brokerage - cutting IT costs and regulatory capital and increasing productivity per broker. There's very little about a push into electronic markets that dominates conversations with ICAP or Tradition, for example. Electronic may be the future but it also need constants investment.

BGC's recent record doesn't suggest it's looking that way either. Deals, such as RP Martin, Smith Mack, Grubb Ellis Newmark and Sterling International Brokers have all boosted their brokerage business. By contrast, its most high profile electronic trading businesses, eSpeed, was offloaded to Nasdaq 18 months ago for around $1.2bn.

Furthermore Terry Duffy, executive chairman, told Reuters in November he believed the assets were available, even if BGC won. Plus, disposing of the units could be a smart financial move for BGC.

Also lost in the takeover battle noise was that CME was potentially getting a steal with Trayport and Fenics. The valuation applied to the assets by Greenhill & Co for GFI's special committee is illuminating.

It came up with a prospective range of between $650m and $728m, based on the units making earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of $52m for 2014 and an enterprise value/ebitda ratio of 12.5-14 times. That multiple was below the median valuations of 17.6 times it had calculated for similar technology companies, MarketAxess Holdings, Advent Software and UK duo Fidessa Group and First Derivatives. However you look at it, that's most of GFI's total equity valuation.

But Trayport is built for a hybrid OTC market. As Shaun Lynn, president of BGC noted on Friday: "We also expect . . . to continue converting voice and hybrid broking to more profitable fully electronic trading, all of which should lead to increased revenues, profitability and cash flows." Why would it be in a hurry to sell, unless it gets an offer it can't refuse?

BGC's sale of eSpeed to Nasdaq may provide the blueprint. A hybrid market (US Treasuries) went fully electronic and BGC got out as newer and faster participants began to enter the market, which would have affected margins.

That led to a hefty outlay for Nasdaq that it has yet to see the full benefit of. Indeed, Nasdaq's market share fell to 30 per cent at the end of last year. However, if the commodities market stays a more hybrid OTC market, then BGC may hang on to the assets.

True, CME was protecting shareholders by aiming to get Trayport for a low price but it was a mistake not to have significantly offered more. It might well pay for it, one way or another.

 Artificial intelligence  and the fridge

Could an internet-connected thing - a smart fridge, a thermostat or a home-help robot - become a millionaire? This is not as ridiculous a question as it may seem.

If we do indeed move toward a world in which devices are connected to the internet and performing mundane chores, it is likely that many of them will be connected to some kind of bank account.

For maximum efficiency, the smart fridge that orders your milk should also be able to also handle the payments to the supermarket. You may not hook the fridge directly to a current account - worried perhaps a software glitch might cause the fridge to accidentally put you in debt by ordering 20,000 worth of dairy products in a single day. But you might set up a pre-paid account with a set amount of milk money that the fridge can access.

What happens if the fridge is able to buy your milk for 1p a litre cheaper than you have budgeted? Perhaps it is able to join with other networked fridges to buy in bulk, lowering the price. Or its ability to search hundreds of thousands of prices allows it to do some bargain hunting. The milk account grows a surplus. But is this money yours?

As the owner of the fridge you would assume so. But is this always clear? What if you do not own the smart fridge, but rent it? Or if it has been supplied to you, free of charge, by its manufacturers or by the dairy? Who owns the surplus then? Would it be like the deals some solar panel companies offer, where they install the equipment for free on the understanding that they keep the money from any electricity generated? At the very least, you will need to read the ownership contract carefully.

And what happens when the artificial intelligence capabilities of appliances increases markedly and the fridge is capable of making more complex decisions? What if, rather than keeping the milk funds in the prepaid account, it connects to an online stock market trading site, invests the money and makes a profit?

It still buys the milk, but now there is an extra 20 in the prepaid account. Does that belong to you? Will there be anything to stop an advanced, AI-enabled fridge opening a online bank account and depositing the money there without your knowledge? Should banks have a "humans-only" policy to stop this happening?

And what would a rich machine buy? A group of Swiss artists have experimented with this idea, creating the Random Darknet Shopper, an automated online shopping bot that was given an allowance of $100 a week in bitcoin and instructed to make one random purchase a week from an online marketplace. The items were displayed in an exhibition at the Kunst Halle in St Gallen.

To the consternation of the performance artists - and the Swiss police - the purchases included 10 ecstasy pills and a false Hungarian passport. This prompted debate over who was liable when a robot broke the law on its own initiative, a debate the police sought to clarify by seizing the contraband goods.

The idea of the shopping robot adds another dimension to the discussion about what a robot-filled future will be like. Last month, an open letter, signed by scientists and entrepreneurs including Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk, urged us to begin considering some of the ethical dilemmas and potential dangers posed by artificial intelligence. Who is liable if a robot has an accident, for example? How will a self-driving car chose what to do if the only way to avoid a head-on collision is to veer on to a crowded pavement?

Scientists at places such as the Future of Life Institute based in the US, the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk at Cambridge university and the Machine Intelligence Research Institute in California (yes, these really exist) are also considering what might happen if we are eventually able to create machines far more intelligent than humans - superintelligences that may break out of the bounds of their programming and begin to disregard human controls.

In science fiction, this scenario - called "singularity" or "transcendence" - usually leads to robot versus human war and a contest for world domination.

But what if, rather than a physical battle, it was an economic one, with robots siphoning off our money or destroying the global economy with out-of-control algorithmic trading programmes? Perhaps it will not make for a great movie, but it seems the more likely outcome.

After all, the financial crisis of the past decade has shown us how easily it could be done, even by dumb humans.

Wood Mackenzie plans 2bn IPO in move to spur higher bids from suitors

Wood Mackenzie is preparing for a stock market listing in which the UK energy research consultancy would seek a valuation of as much as 2bn, say people familiar with the matter.

The Edinburgh company, which is owned by the San Francisco private equity firm Hellman & Friedman, has appointed Lazard to advise on an initial public offering, these people added.

The move is likely to force bidders looking at a takeover of the company to raise their bids. The FT reported on Saturday that US data group Verisk Analytics had offered 1.6bn for "Wood Mac" as the company is known in the energy industry. McGraw Hill Financial has also submitted an offer at about 1.5bn to try to add Wood Mackenzie's data and analytics services to a portfolio that includes energy price reporter Platt's and rating agency Standard & Poor's.

But Wood Mackenzie intends to press forward with plans for an IPO unless suitors make bids above 1.8bn, the low-end of what the company hopes to be valued at in a listing, people close to the situation said. Hellman & Friedman and Lazard declined to comment.

With the rise of so-called dual track processes and a surge in public market valuations, buyout firms have been increasingly able to play off private bidders against the prospect of an IPO when looking to exit an investment. An exit from its ownership of Wood Mackenzie would come three years after Hellman & Friedman bought a 63 per cent stake in a deal valuing the company at 1.1bn.

Wood Mackenzie's management and employees retained a 24 per cent stake and Charterhouse, a European private equity company, held a 13 per cent shareholding after the deal.

The company produces research and analytics on the energy and commodities sectors for clients in the oil and gas, financial services groups, metals and mining space.

Consultants have seen higher demand for their services amid a lower oil price environment that has forced energy companies to trim operating costs and be more strategic with investments.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
UK rent control will create stability

The reimposition of rent controls by a future Labour government would not choke off the return of institutional investment to the UK housing market, according to a major investor.

Insurance companies, pension funds and other institutions were among the largest owners of UK residential property until the 1960s, when the introduction of rent controls prompted them to flee the sector as returns tumbled.

Labour leader Ed Miliband has proposed reintroducing rent controls if his party returns to power after May's general election , in order to give the 9m members of "generation rent" greater protection against rogue landlords and bring down the cost of renting.

This comes just as institutions have returned to the private rented sector, investing 2.5bn during 2014, according to Real Capital Analytics. This is a significant sum considering they held just 4.6bn of the 990bn sector at the end of 2013, according to a survey of 78 institutions by the Investment Property Forum.

John German, head of Invesco Real Estate, said Mr Miliband's proposals - three-year tenancies with only limited rent rises permitted during that period - were unlikely to drive institutions away.

"There are rent controls and rent controls," said Mr German. He believed a policy limiting rent rises to, say, 1 percentage point over the retail price index, "would create exactly the type of investment that a lot of institutions are looking for, which is a linkage to inflation".

Mr German, who also sits on the residential committee of the British Property Federation, added: "The feedback I get from the political parties is that they get the idea residential property is a huge asset class in the UK."

The Upshot: Women Work Around The VC Old Boys Club

It's hard to believe, but the number of women at venture capital firms -- the primary financial engines of Silicon Valley -- is going from terrible to worse. Here's what should not be a surprise: A handful of resourceful female investors and entrepreneurs are finding creative ways around the roadblocks.

During a recent lunch hour in a borrowed conference room in downtown San Francisco, a dozen women with the wherewithal to make early-stage investments listened to pitches from entrepreneurs (of both genders). Those seeking funding were given a rigid 20-minute time limit, which Sonja Hoel Perkins enforced with a large plastic timer borrowed from home, where she uses it to help manage her young childrens' time.

Ms. Perkins is co-founder of Broadway Angels, a unique confederation of investors who, in Ms. Perkins' words, "just happen to be women." Unlike typical VC firms, funding syndicates or even investment clubs, Broadway Angels doesn't raise investment funds nor invest as a group. Instead, it uses its collective networking power to attract entrepreneurs with interesting projects into the room. If any of the members likes what she hears, she can follow up individually with the entrepreneur to make a deal.

After they invest, the women play active advisory roles. The group's members currently have early-stage investments in 35 companies, ranging from $25,000 to $1.2 million. Past investments have been acquired by companies such as Oracle and Equifax.

Broadway's 26 members are or have been venture capitalists, angel investors or tech executives. Ms. Perkins, for example, became the youngest general partner ever at Menlo Ventures in the late 1990s, at age 29. She remains affiliated with the firm. Other prominent members include co-founder Jennifer Scott Fonstad and Theresia Gouw, who recently split off from their respective VC firms to form a new one, Aspect Ventures.

In the complex language of gender politics in Silicon Valley, group members avoid harping on the overwhelmingly male dominance of Valley financing. (According to a Babson College study, the representation of women partners in 2014 was 6%, down from 10% in 1999. Perhaps more damning, only 2.7% of the companies that received venture funding between 2011 and 2013 had female CEOs). Instead, they prefer to let their resumes and their actions do the talking.

Occasionally, though, their shared experiences spill out. In an ironic moment, the group heard a pitch from a company using data analytics to eliminate unconscious bias in recruiting, hiring and promotions of employees in the workplace.

"Can we give this to VC firms for free?" quipped Aileen Lee, a prominent venture capitalist who two years ago left her full time work at Kleiner Perkins to co-found her own VC firm, Cowboy Ventures.

Privately, the women talk about the opportunities that can be lost when a VC firm is all or nearly all male: If an entrepreneur's target market is females, for example, no one in the room may instinctively appreciate the size of the business opportunity.

As VCs look to find great leaders, some men may have trouble believing that a female entrepreneur can make the kind of 24/7, full-on commitment as men. As a result, women are under pressure to be "quadrupally awesome," said one Broadway member.

Another dynamic: Most VC firms require unanimity in their investment decisions; one dissenting voice kills potential funding. It's easier to reach that consensus when everyone in the room has a similar perspective on life and technology.

In the words of Joanna Drake Earl, who advises entrepreneurs and is a partner in Core Ventures group, an early stage VC firm: "VCs are all about pattern recognition," she said. They look for analogies, such as how a new company might be "like an Uber" for some new category. And they identify with certain founder personality traits. Without a diversity of views, it is harder to break the groupthink.

Mark Suster, a Los Angeles-based venture capitalist, basically agrees. "When you lack diversity as a decision making group," opportunities are lost, he said. "There's no doubt that there is a gender diversity problem in venture, and venture needs to fix it."

Danielle Applestone, CEO of The Other Machine Co., which makes a 3-D milling machine, said that pitching to women investors "is a whole different atmosphere." Having received money from Broadway Angels investors, she has found them "the most efficient, professional, and supportive group of investors I have ever met."

Other women have found different paths. Joanna Weidenmiller is a former advertising and luxury retail executive with experience in China and even a stint at the FBI. She is now the CEO of 1-Page Ltd., which uses software to challenge job applicants to solve some of the company's problems or achieve its objectives.

She raised some early rounds from VCs, but when it came time to seek larger funding she started getting a lot of rejections -- complete with occasional doses of sexism -- despite having several Fortune 500 companies pledged as clients. Finally, she made a bold move: She went public -- on the Australian stock market.

It turns out that tech is in demand Down Under. Stable and highly respected, the Australian markets proved the perfect way to raise money. She has used some of the proceeds to pay off her early investors. She has never looked back.

Regarding many VCs, she said: "They treat you a little bit like a girl wanting to play pro football."

Wood Mackenzie, one of the world's leading energy consultancies, has received competing takeover offers that value the private-equity controlled business at as much as 1.6bn as its backers mull an exit, according to people familiar with the matter.

US data company Verisk Analytics has offered to buy Edinburgh-headquartered Wood Mackenzie, one of these people added.

McGraw Hill Financial, the US data company that owns rating agency Standard & Poor's as well as energy price reporting group Platt's, has also submitted a bid that is near that of Verisk's offer. Neither Verisk and McGraw Hill could not immediately be reached for comment.

The takeover bids come as Hellman & Friedman, the buyout group, has been exploring options including a sale or an initial public offering of its majority stake in Wood Mackenzie.

The San-Francisco-based private equity firm acquired a 63 per cent stake from Charterhouse, the UK buyout group, in Wood Mackenzie in deal that valued it at 1.1bn in 2012.

The company's management and employees retained a 24 per cent stake and Charterhouse held a 13 per cent shareholding after the deal.

Wood Mackenzie produces research and analytics on the energy and commodities sectors for clients in the oil and gas, financial services groups, metals and mining space.

Consultants have seen higher demand for their services rise amid a lower oil price environment that has forced energy companies to trim operating costs and be more strategic with investments.

Known as WoodMac in the energy industry, the company has its origins as an Edinburgh stockbroker but its current business formed around a series of reports on North Sea oil that it started publishing in 1973.

Since then, Wood Mackenzie has expanded by acquiring mining and metals research companies, and adding coverage of natural gas, power and refining.

The company was bought out by management and employees from Deutsche Bank in 2001 and in 2004, UK private equity group Candover acquired a stake, which it increased to 67 per cent three years later. In 2009 it sold out to Charterhouse for 550m.

Cold reality will persuade regulators to shift insurance stance, says Axa head; Interview: Henri de Castries

Support for  315bn European scheme will be lacking without 'sensible capital charges'

Devout Catholic Henri de Castries "believes in miracles", but the chief executive of Axa says it is not the Lord but cold economic realities that are going to persuade European regulators to shift their stance on the insurance industry.

The boss of Europe's second-largest insurer by market capitalisation warns that the  315bn European investment scheme launched last year to kick-start growth will not receive any backing from him or the industry unless regulation shifts as well.

"The bureaucrats of Europe will have to define sensible capital charges for infrastructure investments . . . or nothing will happen [with the scheme]. The ball is in the court of the European Commission," he says in an interview with the Financial Times. The support of Axa and the rest of the European insurance industry is seen as key to the success of the Juncker Plan , which over three years will provide  21bn in guarantees to raise  315bn in private funds to invest in new projects.

Mr de Castries has been lobbying to adjust the EU's Solvency II capital requirements, which come into effect next year. Insurers say the rules would require them to hold too much capital against investments in areas such as long-term infrastructure projects, discouraging investment.

"On the one hand we are being asked by politicians to invest in infrastructure to help economic growth, but on the other we are being told by regulators that we are going to be penalised for the same investments," he says.

He adds that if capital rules punish infrastructure investment, money will go elsewhere: "If Europe decides not to be attractive, fine, capital will move."

Axa released its full-year results yesterday, reporting a 12 per cent increase in net profit to  5bn, buoyed mainly by its life and savings division. Revenues were up 1 per cent to  92bn.

Thanks in part to the "good shape" of the US economy, the "gradual increase in long term rates", there was reason to be positive about 2015, he says, with the group's raising its dividend by nearly a fifth compared with last year.

Mr de Castries is sanguine about a potential crisis caused by a Greek exit as well, first because Axa does not hold any Greek debt, but more importantly because Europe itself had insulated itself from Greece in recent years.

"If Greece left the eurozone it would very bad for Greece, but I am not sure it would be that bad for the rest of Europe. It could well be a situation where nothing really happens, just a couple of days of volatility perhaps."

The chief of Axa, which has more than  1tn in assets under management, says that Greece needs to undertake "unavoidable" structural reforms, but if they choose not to, it would be "their problem" more so than for the rest of Europe.

He may be relaxed about a Greek exit, but to combat the low interest rates in developed markets - which has squeezed the group because of its vast bond holdings - Axa has been eager to boost growth in fast-growing emerging markets .

The group has spent about  5bn since 2010 on acquiring companies in several developing economies, most recently targeting acquisitions in Africa. Late last year the group bought Mansard, Nigeria's fourth-largest insurer. "When Asia started to grow 30 years ago, Axa was too small to be a big player. But now we have the critical size worldwide, now we think Africa will be the emerging continent for the next generation," he says.

His eyes light up though when he starts talking about the wider shifts happening in the insurance industry around big data, which he says should transform the business in the developed as well as the emerging world.

"It changes everything - it's the equivalent to oil and electricity a century ago and printing five or six centuries ago," he says.

The insurance industry is increasingly using the large amount of data available to give more targeted insurance policies, for example devices installed in cars to monitor driving habits.

Axa has launched a  200m venture capital fund with a presence in San Francisco, New York, London, Paris, Zurich and Berlin to invest in companies that could help it with big data.

Axa has already made investments in groups such as Flyr, a data science company that predicts airfares, and Climatesecure, a data company helping to insure financial losses caused by weather anomalies.

"The idea is really to have the means to understand what is going on [in this field]." he says.

He says that if you want to "prosper and survive" in insurance you need to understand how it is going to "redesign your existing business model," but also make sure that you are ethical in your treatment of the data.

"It's like California in the mid 1850s, we know there is gold in the mountains, we know a lot of people want to access it, and we know that the ethical level of these people are uncertain. We need to behave impeccably."

Online lenders: money for something

Has the hour of online lending arrived? It seems, at least, close at hand. This week two of the biggest US online lenders, On Deck and Lending Club, both reported triple-digit growth in loan origination, reaching $1.2bn and $4.4bn for full-year 2014, respectively.

Both companies believe that, using technology and big data to make credit assessments, they can outdo traditional banks on both the cost of making loans and the interest rates that they charge borrowers.

At Lending Club, rates are indeed lower than on the credit card debt that most of its loans refinance. And On Deck, a small business lender , provides small, short-term loans that most banks simply do not offer.

Yet the lending infrastructure of these companies is, at their current scale, expensive. On Deck's effective loan interest yield rate was 39 per cent last quarter, and defaults have hovered around 7 per cent; yet it did not turn a profit. One reason for high costs is that, in its earlier years, most On Deck loans originated from financial advisers, to whom On Deck paid commissions.

The company has reduced its reliance on these. Instead it is spending more on advertising to drive business owners directly to its website. Marketing costs rose 83 per cent last year, part of an expense budget that grew 80 per cent. On Deck's operating expense has grown more slowly than its loan origination. Still, the company reported losses every year.

At Lending Club, opex has risen even faster. Excluding stock-based pay, it rose 144 per cent last year (loan origination, grew 110 per cent).

The company, profitable in 2013, swung to a loss last year. Lending Club expects these costs to keep growing, and sees 2015 as a period of more investment and more ad spending. Its stock fell heavily on this news.

Is the growth enough to compensate for their high costs? Optimists on the online model must believe that, like any finance business, the companies are robust enough to survive a crisis.

Shareholders in Lending Club enjoy some protection, since the company itself assumes no direct credit risk. At On Deck, by contrast, nearly half of its loans are funded by the company itself. Both trade at rich multiples: Lending Club at 140 times 2016 earnings (even after the dip), and On Deck at 40 times. Neither runaway costs nor the possibility of a sharp economic downturn are priced in.

The bank vaults that hoard bytes instead of bullion

Thomas Hale visits Spain's BBVA, a retail bank that is striving to be a global leader of the sector's digital transformation

The processors, roughly six feet tall, huddle in subterranean corridors. Apart from their humming, the room is locked in something close to silence. More commonly filled with gold, the vaults of banks now store data too. These processors inhabit the digital vaults of Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria - its 20,000 sq m data centre on the outskirts of Madrid.

The building is a practical necessity, processing hundreds of millions of transactions a day. But the centre - and the data coursing through its veins - is also closely linked to BBVA's vision for the future.

Spain's second-largest bank, which has a major presence in Turkey, Latin America and the US, has established itself as one of the most ardent disciples of digital transformation. Between 2011 and 2013, it spent an average of  850m a year on investing in technology, infastructure - such as data centres - and software development.

It has also invested elsewhere. Last year it bought Simple, a US digital bank, and Spanish start-up Madiva Soluciones . Most recently, it invested in Coinbase , a bitcoin platform based in San Francisco, becoming one of the first mainstream financial institutions to make a play involving the controversial cryptocurrency.

"We're embracing the disruption, to play a part in it, actively lead it," says Teppo Paavola, BBVA's head of new digital businesses. He was hired from PayPal and recently moved to Madrid from San Francisco. "In the end, what will the bank of the future be? All about data."

In an article published in MIT Technology Review last year, Francisco Gonzlez, the bank's chairman, provided some insight into the specific value of data for banks. "Banks hold huge stores of information about their customers, and this is a crucial competitive edge," he wrote. "If banks can convert that information into knowledge, they can use it to offer customers goods and services that better meet their needs."

In the future, BBVA can potentially draw on data from millions of customers - 9m of the digital variety at the end of 2014 - to fuel what it calls "open innovation", building new applications and services. Mr Paavola points out that this data will not personally identify any individual customer or business because it is all "aggregated and irreversibly dissociated" - meaning it can only be used en masse.

The digital obsession is on clear display at another of BBVA's centres, back in the noisier heart of Madrid. The bank's innovation centre, which it describes as a "laboratory for testing new products and services", also serves as a hyperactive promotion for the bank's digital ambitions - the opposite of the data centre's solemnity.

The innovation centre is housed in an elegant Madrid building, which, in former lives, acted as a prison, a palace and slaughterhouse. Nowadays, with 16,000 visitors a year, it resembles a corporate theme park, with designs depicting the future of banking, such as a full-sized model branch. A three-dimensional, pulsating map of Madrid sits alongside screens furiously flickering with Twitter followers, LinkedIn connections and Facebook likes.

Through the map, BBVA can display data about transactions through any of its cards or ATMs across the city - an approach it terms "urban radiology". It can use this data, it says, to provide businesses with information about consumer habits - showing which parts of the city see higher volumes for certain types of purchase, for example, or how events such as football matches can determine consumer behaviour.

The bank is also reshaping itself as a kind of patron for financial technology, or "fintech", companies, many of whom visit its innovation centre. It has multiple channels for working with technology, including BBVA Ventures - its San Francisco-based venture capital arm.

Many of its investments hinge on maximising exposure to world-changing technological breakthroughs. When the bank invested in Coinbase, Jay Reinemann, executive director at BBVA Ventures, said it simply wanted to "understand what was going on".

The logic behind working extensively with other companies is based on the assumption that BBVA is unable to innovate as quickly as the collective mass of fintech start-ups, which also explains the bank's appetite for acquiring smaller companies. "One of the things I've learned is innovation usually happens elsewhere," says Mr Paavola.

BBVA even hosts X Factor- style competitions for tech companies; its Open Talent competition in 2013 was won by Traity, a Spanish company that seeks to help define reputation on the internet. The company now provides consulting services to the bank.

Its Innova Challenge provides anonymised credit card data to innovators around the world, which they can then use to create apps and services. BBVA rewards the best ideas in the competition with cash prizes.

In Spain, BBVA is not alone in its enthusiasm for technology. In recent weeks, for instance, rival Santander has announced a major digital push , including cloud-based services. Caixabank, the country's third-largest bank, set up a "big data" centre in Barcelona last year.

But none of them has pushed as hard as BBVA. Behind the bank's digital obsession is Mr Gonzlez; the chairman suggested at a results conference in February that the bank will, in the future, become "completely digital", adding: "These technology platforms are bringing about a very deep change in how we do things, and how we process data and where we process data."

Typically, BBVA's strategic involvement in other technology companies has not been accompanied by much financial disclosure, as though the value lies more in a declaration of digital intent.

This month, however, it said "digital transformation" and associated cost management would yield annual cost savings of  340m in Spain.

The bank is building another data centre in Mexico. It expects to eventually have a total of four, processing 1bn transactions a day by 2016. The digital vaults might be less conspicuous than BBVA's all-singing all-dancing innovation centre, but their scale and scope is growing.

External innovation

Traity, a Spanish company that tries to measure a person's trustworthiness online, is an example of the innovation that BBVA seeks from outside.

It takes information that users provide from across their social media platforms to build a picture of their overall reliability, which it says enhances trust in online marketplaces where buyers and sellers have never met.

After winning BBVA's Open Talent competition in 2013, which earned the company an investment of  100,000, the company is now working on providing the Spanish bank with a Facebook app, designed to allow BBVA customers to ascertain their "financial personality" through a series of games.

The company, which has about 5m users, believes that its technology could also be used by insurers and, further down the line, if it can fuse online reputation with credit risk, banks.

"We're trying to figure out whether people with certain reputations have better risk profiles," says Juan Cartagena, chief executive and founder, just before flying to London to meet other banks.

Axa chief Henri de Castries takes aim at regulators

Henri de Castries is a devout Catholic and  believes in miracles , but the chief executive of "http://www.ft.com/topics/organisations/AXA_SA" says it is not the Lord but cold economic realities that are going to convince European regulators to dramatically shift their stance on the insurance industry.

The boss of Europe s second-largest insurer by market capitalisation, warns that the  315bn European investment scheme launched last year to kick-start growth will not receive any backing from him or the industry unless regulation shifts as well.

 The bureaucrats of Europe will have to define sensible capital charges for infrastructure investments 	. 	. 	. 	or nothing will happen [with the scheme]. The ball is in the camp of the European Commission,  he says in an interview with the Financial Times.

The support of Axa and the rest of the European insurance industry is seen as key to the success of the so-called  Juncker Plan , which over three years will provide  21bn in guarantees to raise  315bn in private funds to invest in new projects.

Mr de Castries has been lobbying to adjust the EU s Solvency II capital requirements, which come into effect next year. Insurers say the rules would require them to hold too much capital against investments in areas such as long-term infrastructure projects, discouraging investment.

 On the one hand we are being asked by politicians to invest in infrastructure to help economic growth, but on the other we are being told by regulators that we are going to be penalised for the same investments,  he says.

Speaking from the group s Paris headquarters, a stone s throw from the Elyse Palace, he adds that if capital rules punish infrastructure investment, money will go elsewhere:  If Europe decides not to be attractive, fine, capital will move. 

Mr de Castries was speaking as Axa released its full-year results on Wednesday, reporting a 12 per cent increase in net profit to  5bn buoyed mainly by its life and savings division. Revenues were up 1 per cent to  92bn.

Thanks in part to the  good shape  of the US economy, the  gradual increase in long term rates  there was reason to be positive about 2015, he says, with the group raising its dividend by nearly a fifth compared with last year.

Mr de Castries is sanguine about a potential crisis "http://www.ft.com/indepth/greece-debt-crisis" as well, firstly because Axa does not hold any Greek debt, but more importantly because Europe itself had insulated itself from Greece in recent years.

 If Greece left the eurozone it would very bad for Greece, but I am not sure it would be that bad for the rest of Europe. It could well be a situation where nothing really happens, just a couple of days of volatility perhaps. 

The chief of Axa, a group which has more than  1tn in assets under management, says that Greece needs to undertake  unavoidable  structural reforms, but if they choose not to, it would be  their problem  far more than a problem for the rest of Europe.

Mr de Castries may be relaxed about a Greek exit, but to combat the low interest rates in developed markets   which has squeezed the group which has vast bond holdings   Axa has been eager to boost growth in fast-growing emerging markets.

The company has spent about  5bn since 2010 on acquiring companies in several developing economies, most recently targeting acquisitions in Africa. Late last year the group bought Mansard, Nigeria s fourth largest insurer.

 When Asia started to grow 30 years ago, Axa was too small to be a big player. But now we have the critical size worldwide, now we think Africa will be the emerging continent for the next generation,  he says.

His eyes light up though when he starts talking about the wider shifts happening in the insurance industry around big data, which he says should transform the business in the developed as well as the emerging world.

 It changes everything, it's the equivalent to oil and electricity a century ago and printing five or six centuries ago,  he says.

The insurance industry is increasingly using the large amount of data available to give more targeted insurance policies, for example devices installed in cars to monitor driving habits.

On Tuesday Axa launched a  200m venture capital fund with a presence in San Francisco, New York, London, Paris, Zurich and Berlin to invest in companies that could help it with big data.

Axa has already made investments in groups such as Flyr, a data science company that predicts airfares and Climatesecure, another data company helping to insure financial losses caused by weather anomalies.

 The idea is really to have the means to understand what is going on [in this field].  he says.

He says that if you want to  prosper and survive  in insurance you need to understand how it is going to  redesign your existing business model,  but also make sure that you are ethical in your treatment of the data.

 It s like California in the mid 1850s, we know there is gold in the mountains, we know a lot of people want to access it, and we know that the ethical level of these people are uncertain. We need to behave impeccably.

HP strikes deal to modernise Deutsche Bank data systems; Banks

Deutsche Bank has struck a "multibillion-dollar" deal with Hewlett-Packard to modernise some of its IT systems and outsource part of its data storage as the German lender attempts to reduce its high cost base.

Under the 10-year deal, which will mainly affect Deutsche's investment banking arm and its division providing transaction services, HP will store information and provide platform and hosting services. Deutsche will remain responsible for developing new applications, as well as for data security.

The deal underscores big banks' push to reduce the complexity of IT systems that have become increasingly unwieldy following a phase of rapid, but haphazard, growth during the pre-crisis boom years.

Neither Deutsche nor HP would say how much the deal was worth, or divulge the scale of the expected cost savings. The German bank's most recent annual report shows it spent almost  3.1bn on IT during 2013, 40 per cent more than it did in 2011.

Analysts estimated that the deal would have a moderate impact for Deutsche. Jon Peace, London-based banks analyst at Nomura, said the savings Deutsche would achieve from the IT deal were already included in the bank's existing  4.5bn cost-cutting plan.

"Over 10 years the savings could be $200m to $300m a year . . . about 1 per cent of group costs," said Mr Peace. "On the margins it's useful but it's not something that's transformational."

But Will Rhode, head of capital markets research for Boston Consulting, said harnessing data properly was crucially important for banks. "Partnering with information services firms not only delivers efficiencies, it also provides scale and leverage, particularly in the field of Big Data-oriented customer analytics," he added.

The benefits of the "cloud" services HP is offering Deutsche include increased computing power and the potential to do clever analytics, as well as being able to employ computing power "on demand" instead of maintaining servers at maximum capacity.

Banks have been slow to adopt cloud computing because of stringent regulations, the burden of archaic and fragmented systems, and the high cost of upgrading. Part of the challenge, analysts say, is that financial services companies cannot allow downtime and thus new infrastructure needs to be tested rigorously - which means such projects often take many years. The possibility of a wave of innovations from start-ups that do not have to deal with legacy systems has provided an incentive to banks to modernise, analysts say.

The Property Report
Norway Fund Grabbing Real Estate --- Giant pension fund is hoping to improve its investment returns by taking on more risk

Norway's state-run investment fund is becoming one of the world's biggest landlords at a time when other big commercial-property owners are sounding alarms about high prices.

The $874 billion Government Pension Fund of Norway, the world's largest sovereign-wealth fund, last year purchased $7.6 billion of property globally, more than any other sovereign fund, according to data from real-estate tracker Real Capital Analytics.

The push is part of a broader strategy to improve returns by taking on more risk. The fund, which has generated an annual return of 3.7% since 1998, aims over time to boost its real-estate holdings to 5% from the current 1.3%.

Earlier this month, the fund closed on its purchase of a 45% stake in a 40-story skyscraper at 11 Times Square in Manhattan for $401.9 million, a deal that valued the 1.1 million square foot property at $1,273 a square foot, which is at the high end of the range of prices being paid for Midtown office buildings in recent years.

In January, meanwhile, the fund beat six other bidders in London for Queensberry House, a 75,000-square-foot retail and office building, agreeing to pay GBP 190.6 million ($294.6 million.) The seller, Sorgente Group SpA, had paid GBP 167 million for the property in 2012.

But some experts question the timing of the Norway fund's strategy of bulking up on office buildings, stores, warehouses and other commercial property in Europe and the U.S. Prices have risen so rapidly in the past two years that seasoned investors have begun to move to the sidelines even as Norway piles in.

"Asset prices today are high, and acquisitions are getting dicey," said Steven Roth, chief executive of Vornado Realty Trust, a leading U.S. real-estate investment trust, on an investor call earlier this month. "We are now at the point in the cycle where the easy money has been made, and it seems to me that this is a better time to harvest than to invest."

As a sign of how high values have risen in London, office-building investors in December paid prices that will give them an initial yield of just 4% from the incomes of the properties, according to data from Real Capital Analytics.

That was the lowest level since 2008.

The Norway fund is the main vehicle through which the Norwegian people benefit from the country's position as the world's third-largest gas exporter and the 10th-largest oil exporter. Its assets have more than doubled since 2010, and its current value is equal to about $170,000 per Norwegian citizen.

The fund, which launched in 1990 and received its first cash transfers in 1996, initially invested only in stocks and bonds. But average annual returns have fallen short of the government's long-term return target of 4%. Hoping to boost returns, the government in 2010 allowed the fund to invest up to 5% of its value in real estate.

Norwegian central-bank governor Oystein Olsen in a speech earlier this month said that with long-term government bond yields near zero, Norway's fund return could drop "perhaps below 3%."

The fund also has been hurt by falling global energy prices, which have cut cash transfers from the Norwegian government.

A spokeswoman for Norges Bank Investment Management, which oversees the fund, said it is trying to achieve the "highest possible return with a moderate risk level."

Asked about the timing of the fund's increased appetite for real estate, she said: "We are a long-term investor" and that the fund's strategy is to focus on large global cities like New York and San Francisco, where "the prospects for solid long-term return are good."

The fund has been especially active in the U.S. In 2014, Norway was the second-largest foreign investor in U.S. real estate, after Canada, thanks mainly to acquisitions by its sovereign-wealth fund, according to a report by CBRE Group Inc. Norwegian real-estate investments in the U.S. totaled $4.4 billion in 2014, up 120% from 2013, the report said.

Yet only 1.3% of the fund's portfolio was in real estate as of the third quarter of 2014. That means it will take much more buying to meet the 5% target -- at a time when prices have risen sharply from their recession lows.

In the U.S., values are at record levels, 17% above their precrash high in 2007, according to Green Street.

Fund executives in June said they planned to invest an additional 1% of its value each year in real estate through 2016. Last year, the fund also hired a separate executive group for real estate and plans to add 200 people to its staff of around 400 by 2016.

Some real-estate investors question the fund's strategy of paying top-dollar for properties. While annual income for well-leased top-quality properties typically amounts to between 4% and 4.5% of a property's sale price, Norway has made multiple purchases in which the income is below 4%, a low number in the real-estate sector.

Banks have been slow to adopt cloud computing because of stringent regulation, the burden of archaic and fragmented IT, and the high cost of moving to new systems. Part of the challenge, analysts say, is that financial services companies cannot afford any downtime and new infrastructure needs to be rigorously tested   which means such projects often take many years.

But the possibility of an impending wave of innovation from start-ups, which do not have to deal with legacy IT systems and can build new products from scratch, has given an added incentive to banks to modernise their back-office infrastructure, analysts say.

Shares in Deutsche Bank closed up 0.7 per cent at  29.26 in Frankfurt.

Dark days turn darker for HSBC as profits dive; Bank hit with fresh woes after its reputation is already battered by a tax-evasion scandal at its Swiss private arm

HSBC was supposed to be the big, boring bank that few people worried about. Europe's largest lender by assets came through the financial crisis in better shape than many rivals, without needing a state bailout or a drastic restructuring programme.

However, in recent weeks the mood has darkened at its 45-floor headquarters in London's Canary Wharf. With its public reputation already battered by a tax-evasion scandal at its Swiss private bank , HSBC reported a sharp drop in pre-tax profits yesterday that sent its shares tumbling.

How serious is this for the bank that will this year celebrate the 150th anniversary of its creation in Asia - the region that still generates the vast majority of its profits?

Ian Gordon, an analyst at Investec, said: "For all the recent media furore around potential conduct issues, it is the 'underlying' performance which, we believe, should be the greatest cause of investor concern - right across revenues, costs and impairments."

Stuart Gulliver has in the past few months been forced to abandon both the return on equity and cost-efficiency targets he set as part of his strategic plan for boosting the bank's performance after becoming chief executive in 2011.

In a conference call to discuss the earnings yesterday, Mr Gulliver put most of the blame for the bank's disappointing results squarely on the increased regulatory cost that comes with being a big global bank. Excluding the $3.7bn of fines, legal settlements, UK customer redress, as well as currency movements, HSBC said its adjusted pre-tax profits were broadly flat at $22.8bn.

But Mr Gulliver signalled that even after he sold 77 businesses and cut more than 50,000 jobs, there was more to be done to simplify the group and turn round its performance. He said the bank aimed to cut $1bn of its $41bn of operating expenses each year to offset an expected $1bn rise in annual regulatory and compliance costs.

"We're still on a journey to simplify the firm . . . and I don't rule out that we might make more disposals," he told reporters. "But I don't think the firm is too big to manage. You can see the validity of the business on the revenue side, but the cost of running one of these [big banks] has clearly gone up."

He said the bank had suffered a tough fourth quarter, particularly at its investment bank. But he singled out the US, Latin America and Turkey as underperforming areas that were under scrutiny.

Any business that does not have the potential to earn above its cost of capital will be sold or restructured over the next 12 to 24 months, he told analysts.

"One of the challenges that Stuart Gulliver is wrestling with is the cost of being a global bank is much higher than he expected when he took over," said Ronit Ghose, banking analyst at Citigroup. "This means higher capital requirements and it also means that you are in the potential crosshairs of so many stakeholders."

HSBC lacks the scale to be a dominant force in the US, Mexico and Brazil and it should continue "slimming down" its operations there, Mr Ghose said. "They need to sell or exit their consumer banking in these markets."

HSBC said the extra burden of regulation and the need to upgrade its IT systems to handle "big data" requirements and to protect against cyber crime had pushed its operating costs up 6.1 per cent.

The global banking and markets division, which houses HSBC's investment bank, was its worst-performing division as its profits fell 38 per cent. Retail banking and wealth management profits also fell slightly, while commercial banking and its smaller private banking arm increased their contributions.

The bank's cost-efficiency ratio - a closely watched measure of operating costs against revenues - soared from 59.6 per cent to 67.3 per cent, well above its recently ditched target of the mid-50s by 2016. Meanwhile, it set a new return on equity target of "at least 10 per cent" but this key measure of profitability fell last year from 9.2 per cent to 7.3 per cent.

The bank's common equity tier one capital ratio rose slightly to 11.1 per cent - ahead of minimum regulatory requirements - but it set a new target of 12 per cent to 13 per cent.

Investors are still prepared to give Mr Gulliver time. One top 20 shareholder said: "HSBC is a bank that is struggling in a difficult environment. The fall in the return on equity, which is an important metric, reflects the new world we live in. My view of Gulliver has not changed. He is still a first-rate banker."

Soon after he took over as chief executive in 2011, Mr Gulliver reckoned he would be judged on two key metrics. "How the stock market values this firm has to be a huge part of it," he told the Financial Times at the time. "And also the extent to which we are seen as a moral and decent firm."

The events of the past few days and the 17 per cent fall in the share price since he took the top job mean Mr Gulliver has his work cut out to be judged a success by his own standards.

US probe

Precious metals subpoena adds to lender's burden

US regulators have subpoenaed HSBC in connection with their investigation into precious metals trading, adding to the number of regulatory actions hanging over Europe's biggest bank.

The bank said yesterday in its annual report that the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission had demanded documents from HSBC USA in January related to its gold, silver and other precious metals trading operations. In November, the Department of Justice issued a document request to HSBC Holdings in relation to a criminal antitrust investigation into precious metals, the bank said.

"HSBC is co-operating with the US authorities in their respective investigations," it said.

The US document demands come as the precious metals market has become the latest trading area to be subjected to heavy regulatory scrutiny. The UK Financial Conduct Authority fined Barclays 26m in May after an options trader was found to have manipulated the London gold fix. BaFin, Germany's financial regulator, has also launched a formal probe into the gold market.

The justice department declined to comment. The agency is investigating multiple banks for the possible manipulation of the precious metals market. HSBC is also part of a DoJ probe into price-fixing in the foreign exchange markets.

The century-old London gold fix is being overhauled and will move to an electronic system run by Intercontinental Exchange from March 20, in an effort to boost transparency.

But for now, HSBC is one of the four banks with a seat on the gold-fixing panel, which sets the price twice a day through an auction process.

HSBC, the fixing company and the other participating banks are also facing potential class-action lawsuits that have been consolidated in a New York court. Henry Sanderson

Group seeks to shake off hedge fund image and rebrand as asset manager

Winton Capital Management has appointed City veteran Sir David Walker as its chairman, as the computer-driven company hopes to shake off its image as a hedge fund and rebrand itself as a global investment manager.

The appointment of the Barclays chairman will allow Winton founder David Harding, who is chief executive and chairman, to focus on his CEO role.

Mr Harding told the Financial Times that Sir David brings "experience and gravitas" to Winton.

Sir David is best known for his Walker Report on corporate governance in UK banks, for which he was commissioned in 2009 by the then prime minister Gordon Brown. The report's recommendations have since shaped much of the way the financial services industry is run.

Sir David, the former chairman of Morgan Stanley International, took over as chairman of Barclays in the wake of the UK bank's fine for manipulating Libor interest rates, and has put into practice many of his report's recommendations as part of a clean-up effort at the lender.

He is stepping down from Barclays in April to be replaced by Aviva chairman John McFarlane.

Mr Harding is a founding father of managed futures, a strategy that uses complex computer algorithms to capture trends in global markets. He is the "H" in AHL, a managed futures fund now owned by Man Group.

Since Mr Harding set up Winton in 1997, the business has grown to run almost $30bn, the bulk of which is in trend-following hedge funds. Mr Harding said: "We've been fighting something of a battle in recent years to be appreciated for what Winton is: a global asset manager that uses advanced technology and mathematics."

Now Winton is focusing on developing its business outside of hedge funds. Mr Harding said: "There's a much larger market outside hedge funds. All our mathematical methods are just as applicable to long-only . . . In the long term we would like not to be associated with men with red braces [but rather] a computer-driven, artificial intelligence, systematic approach to improving people's pension fund values."

Last year, the Winton Futures Fund gained 13.87 per cent and Winton's long-only equities strategy rose 7.19 per cent.

Mr Harding and Sir David became acquainted through their alma mater, the University of Cambridge, as Sir David has been chairman of its 800th Anniversary Campaign since 2005.

In Depth: Exchanges, Regulators Call Traders' Bluffing Tactics

By Bradley Hope 
2,193 words
24 February 2015
The Wall Street Journal Europe
WSJE

English
(Copyright (c) 2015, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

Chicago -- One June morning in 2012, a college dropout whom securities traders call "The Russian" logged on to his computer and began trading Brent-crude futures on a London exchange from his skyscraper office here.

Over six hours, Igor Oystacher's computer sent roughly 23,000 commands, including thousands of buy and sell orders, according to correspondence from the exchange to his clearing firm reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. But he canceled many of those orders milliseconds after placing them, the documents show, in what the exchange alleges was part of a trading practice designed to trick other investors into buying and selling at artificially high or low prices.

Traders call the illegal bluffing tactic "spoofing," and they say it has long been used to manipulate prices of anything from stocks to bonds to futures. Exchanges and regulators have only recently begun clamping down.

The 33-year-old Mr. Oystacher referred inquiries to a spokesman for his firm, 3Red Group LLC, who declined to comment for this article. In his clearing firm's correspondence with the exchange, Mr. Oystacher -- co-founder of Chicago-based 3Red and well known in the clubby world of Chicago trading -- is quoted as saying his trading is based on "analytics, statistical modeling and relative value theories."

Mr. Oystacher's trading activities on that day and others have been the focus of investigations by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, or CFTC, and several exchanges into whether he broke securities laws or committed fraud, according to court documents, exchange correspondence and interviews with current and former associates. One exchange, CME Group Inc., in November banned him from trading on that exchange for a month after alleging he engaged in spoofing behavior; he didn't admit or deny any rule violations in the case.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Attorney's Office in Chicago have made inquiries into the trading of 3Red, according to a person familiar with the inquiries. The FBI and U.S. Attorney declined to comment.

The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law outlawed spoofing, but the tactic is still being used to manipulate markets, traders say. "Spoofing is extremely toxic for the markets," says Benjamin Blander, a managing member of Radix Trading LLC in Chicago. "Anything that distorts the accuracy of prices is stealing money away from the correct allocation of resources."

CME, the world's largest futures exchange, put out rule clarifications in August 2014 intended to end spoofing. The second-largest, Intercontinental Exchange Inc., or ICE, followed suit last month.

The CFTC in November said CME should work more on identifying spoofing and said it took too long to bring enforcement actions. CME says it had already taken steps to address issues the CFTC raised, declining to comment further for this article. The CFTC and ICE declined to comment for this article.

The first criminal charges against an alleged spoofer were brought in October 2014 in Chicago. The Securities and Exchange Commission and CFTC have brought several civil spoofing cases since 2012.

Exchanges are wary of rushing investigations into market manipulation because they are among the most serious allegations they can make and are difficult to prove, says Craig Pirrong, a University of Houston finance professor. "They have to go through a huge amount of data and try to infer a trader's intent to manipulate the market."

Spoofing is rapid-fire feinting. A spoofer might dupe other traders into thinking oil prices are falling, say, by offering to sell futures contracts at $45.03 a barrel when the market price is $45.05. After other sellers join in with offers at that lower price, the spoofer quickly pivots, canceling his sell order and instead buying at the $45.03 price he set with the fake bid.

The spoofer, who has now bought at two cents under the true market price, can later sell at a higher price -- perhaps by spoofing again, pretending to place a buy order at $45.04 but selling instead after tricking rivals to follow. Repeated many times, spoofing can produce big profits.

Spoofing can be hard to define. There are many legitimate reasons to cancel orders. A trader might cancel after the market heads in an unexpected direction or when a news flash suggests a different trade is in order. Market-making firms continuously adjust and cancel orders as they monitor supply and demand for a particular security.

And some traders say it can be difficult to distinguish between illegal market manipulation and savvy tactics to conceal the size of an intended trade -- a technique used by traders since financial markets' earliest days.

"There are stories going way back about the guys in the Chicago trading pits trying ways to disguise their trading or show their cards in a certain light," says Matt Simon, an analyst at the market-research firm Tabb Group. "It raises a question now about whether someone is engaging in legitimate market activity or clear market manipulation."

The full extent of spoofing isn't known, but traders say it is evident in how prices move every day in a range of stock, bond and futures markets. Many financial firms have developed software to detect spoofing so their traders don't get duped.

To look for spoofing, authorities typically use statistical analysis to determine if a trader's strategy relies on spoofing and examine emails and other communication for signs of intent to spoof.

Some recent enforcement focus has been on alleged spoofing by high-frequency traders, who rely on superfast computers and trading algorithms to rapidly enter orders.

In the Chicago criminal case that is pending, the U.S. Attorney last year charged Michael Coscia, a New Jersey high-frequency trader, in U.S. District Court with six counts of commodities fraud and six counts of spoofing in 2011. Prosecutors accused him of illegally earning $1.6 million from spoofing in the U.S. and Europe. He denied the charges and filed a motion to dismiss them, arguing that antispoofing laws are vague. The U.S. Attorney and a lawyer for Mr. Coscia declined to comment for this article.

Mr. Coscia separately paid $2.8 million and agreed to a one-year trading ban to settle CFTC allegations in 2013 of spoofing, according to CFTC documents. He didn't admit or deny the charges.

While Mr. Oystacher's company employs high-frequency traders, he primarily entered orders manually on his keyboard, documents show. A review of court documents and exchange correspondence and interviews with more than a dozen current and former associates of Mr. Oystacher's provide a look at his trading style and show how complicated investigations into spoofing can be.

Mr. Oystacher moved to the U.S. from Moscow, according to his Facebook page and people who know him. He entered Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., in 1999 and dropped out after three quarters, a Northwestern spokesman says. Soon after, he started an internship at Gelber Group LLC, a prominent Chicago trading firm that cultivated a laid-back atmosphere where traders often dressed in T-shirts and flip-flops, say people who knew him at the time. Brian Gelber, the firm's founder, declines to comment.

Mr. Oystacher stood out for his quick grasp of market psychology. "He was successful within a year of starting," a former Gelber trader says. "He was putting up numbers it takes people three or four years to get to when they are starting out."

His aggressive trading, often in stock-index futures, drew attention in the trading community, where some dubbed him "The Russian."

"He's been talked about for years," says John Lothian, a former Chicago futures broker who publishes an exchange-industry newsletter.

Within Gelber, he earned nicknames like "Snuggles" and "The Pig," although former colleagues say they aren't sure why. He had down periods: After the 2010 Flash Crash, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell nearly 1,000 points before recovering, he told friends he lost significant money on a series of trades.

He left Gelber in 2010. In 2013, the firm agreed to pay a $750,000 fine to the CFTC over orders in 2009 and 2010 that an unidentified trader entered and canceled, allegedly to affect the price of a stock-index future, a CFTC news release says. Gelber didn't admit or deny the charges in accepting the settlement.

In 2011, Mr. Oystacher and another Gelber trader, Edwin Johnson, started their own firm in temporary space in the old Chicago Board of Trade. They named it 3Red Group after the three red chairs they and another early employee used.

Mr. Oystacher continued to make an outsize mark on futures markets. On one day in 2012, for instance, he traded more than 80,000 E-Mini S&P 500 futures -- a type of contract on the stock index -- with a combined notional value of nearly $6 billion, trading records show. His trading could sway markets, traders say.

Mr. Oystacher's trades began to draw attention from exchanges and investigators. The CME determined that on several dates between December 2010 and July 2011 he entered large bids and offers for silver, gold, copper and crude futures he didn't intend to trade, according to a public CME disciplinary notice. He quickly canceled those orders, placing others on the opposite side of the market, the notice says.

In November 2014, the CME fined him $150,000 and banned him from trading on the exchange during December 2014. Mr. Oystacher didn't admit or deny any rule violations in agreeing to the fine and trading ban, the CME notice says.

A separate investigation into his trading in Brent-crude futures on ICE's European futures exchange on June 19 and 20, 2012 -- including the 23,000 commands -- gives a glimpse into his trading.

Several days later, a market-oversight analyst from the exchange wrote to Mr. Oystacher's clearing firm, Advantage Futures LLC, asking for all documents and communications related to his trades and a "full explanation of the rationale behind the trade activity."

ICE provided an Excel spreadsheet showing a detailed history of instances where Mr. Oystacher entered and quickly canceled a bid or offer while simultaneously placing an opposite order. On June 19, Mr. Oystacher completed 430 such reversals -- each could take a number of commands -- and 167 the next day.

In a letter to ICE Europe, Advantage quoted Mr. Oystacher as saying that "we are clicking in response to what we are seeing," adding: "If we click quicker than most, it is a skill." ICE said in a subsequent decision that it didn't accept the rationale, calling Mr. Oystacher's trades "manipulative behavior" and ordering him to cease "disorderly trading" on the exchange. Advantage declines to comment.

Similar investigations into his trading were opened in 2012 and 2013 by regulators from exchanges such as CBOE Holdings Inc. and what was formerly NYSE Euronext, according to court documents and correspondence from the exchanges viewed by the Journal. Those exchanges decline to comment. It isn't clear whether their investigations have concluded.

A falling-out between 3Red's co-founders led to the ouster of one of them, Mr. Johnson, in August 2013, according to court documents and people familiar with the dispute. Last year, he sued the law firm of Gardiner, Koch, Weisberg and Wrona in Cook County, Ill., circuit court for allegedly helping Mr. Oystacher push him out improperly, among other allegations.

According to the lawsuit, the CFTC began investigating the trading of Mr. Oystacher and 3Red in 2011. Among the exhibits is a 2013 letter from a senior CFTC trial attorney, Jon Kramer, including a subpoena for 3Red. Mr. Kramer declined to comment. The CFTC investigation is active, say people familiar with 3Red.

Mr. Johnson's suit said he became "especially concerned about spoofing" by Mr. Oystacher in June 2013 after numerous regulatory inquiries. The law firm in a statement denies its attorneys acted improperly, saying: "We believe that Johnson's suit is without merit."

In a motion to dismiss the case, Gardiner, Koch, Weisberg and Wrona said 3Red terminated Mr. Johnson for "theft, fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, embezzlement" and that his suit was attempting to "extort funds" from 3Red. Mr. Johnson, in response, denied those claims. His lawyers declined to comment.

The judge in November granted the motion to dismiss, without giving an explanation, and gave permission for Mr. Johnson to file an amended complaint. The suit included a copy of a settlement Mr. Johnson entered with Mr. Oystacher soon after his departure, which granted Mr. Johnson an initial $200,000 and an additional $250,000 to be paid out monthly until August 2015. One stipulation: If regulators fined Mr. Oystacher or 3Red $1 million or more, or if Mr. Oystacher was banned from trading for five months or longer, payments would stop.

Amid the scrutiny, Mr. Oystacher has slowed trading, says someone who speaks with him regularly. "He knows he has a target on his back."

BUSINESS EDUCATION
Recipe ideas blend in with a dose of EMBA

City bankers develop a taste for the food industry, reports Jonathan Moules

The challenge of conjuring up a tantalising meal for dinner party guests when you lack the time to cook and culinary imagination to experiment, is the kind of problem many peopleare lucky enough to have and that the internet has proved adept at solving.

Gousto , an online delivery service created by two former City bankers in London, prepares the exact quantities of ingredients for at least three meals a week for the number of guests the customer wants to entertain.

Zest for business The company was launched in 2012 by Timo Schmidt and James Carter, a German and a Brit who met at Rothschild Bank several years earlier.

Both had harboured ambitions of founding a food business and they hatched a plan when they were living close to the 1,000-year-old Borough Market, recently revived with artisan food suppliers in Southwark in London.

Mr Schmidt recalls that they toyed with several business ideas. "We got massively into food and organised a lot of dinner parties, travelling to Italy to sample meats and Alba for the truffles. We considered opening a store but rents in London are so high."

Launching something where creating and testing meals was a core part of the job seemed a good idea when personal spending money would be tight, at least initially, Mr Schmidt reasoned.

Time poor but affluent In what is a crowded market of online food businesses, Gousto gained traction by targeting time-poor but relatively affluent people. Although Mr Schmidt is reluctant to reveal too many financial details, he says that revenues grew by 500 per cent last year and are now in the millions of pounds.

To date the founders have raised more than $10m in equity backing from senior food industry executives acting as angel investors, private equity firm MMC Ventures and Unilever 's venture capital arm. Skill expansion In the midst of this energetic expansion drive, Mr Schmidt decided to take time away from day-to-day operations to complete an executive MBA at Cambridge's Judge Business School .

"When starting Gousto, I did everything from designing recipes to sourcing food," he says. "But now we have about 70 employees, so it felt like I needed to become a grown-up chief executive."

Given his background in finance, there is not much Mr Schmidt feels his tutors at Judge can teach him about balance sheets, cash flow and analytics.

"The finance book we're reading in class is the one I taught myself at uni," he notes. But the lessons on team management, leading teams, motivating and training people are of much more value, he believes, along with those on brand, communication, procedures, vision and reporting results.

"I'm now spending 50 per cent of my time on employees, and the remaining 50 per cent on customers, suppliers and shareholder communication.

"We have people like the former chief executive of Sky on our board, so being able to communicate vision, strategy and road map matters a lot."

Pace challenge The challenge for the company is to manage the pace of growth and the changes this brings to the way it is run.

Gousto has been doubling its revenues every four weeks, Mr Schmidt notes. "We are running an extremely complex business model, that not just covers tech, data, marketing, product and operations, but actually has a huge supply chain and logistics side," he says.

Again Mr Schmidt sees an advantage in using his formal education to help deal with this. "While the complexity by far exceeds the curriculum of the EMBA, the management science lecturers kindly helped me with the set-up and ideas for my problem," he says.

The next stage will be to develop Gousto's data collection expertise to surprise customers with recipes they might like based on their previous choices.

"I don't plan on selling the business in the future as the upside is way too big," Mr Schmidt says. "In 10 years, there will be an 80bn online grocery market."

HSBC shares drop after full-year profits fall

HSBC has added a sharp fall in annual profits to the list of challenges it faces, as its chairman apologised for a Swiss tax evasion scandal that has left its chief executive facing questions about his personal finances.

Shares in HSBC, Europe's biggest bank by assets, were down nearly 6 per cent in afternoon trading in London on Monday at 569p in reaction to the results.

In a sign of the growing political fallout over the bank's Swiss operations, UK chancellor George Osborne is expected to face questions in parliament on Monday afternoon from Ed Balls, Labour's shadow chancellor, who will ask why HM Revenue & Customs did not take tougher action against HSBC or individuals involved in tax evasion at its Swiss private bank.

The UK-listed bank reported pre-tax profits of $18.7bn last year, down 17 per cent from $22.6bn the previous year and well below consensus analyst expectations.

HSBC blamed the fall on "lower gains from disposals and reclassifications", as well as the impact of $3.7bn in "fines, settlements, UK customer redress and associated provisions".

The bank also cut its return on equity target from 12-15 per cent to "greater than 10 per cent" in the next three to five years, mainly due to higher capital requirements. It said its capital ratio - a measure of balance sheet strength - target was now 12-13 per cent.

HSBC's top executives have come under pressure from shareholders, politicians and business leaders to waive some of their multimillion-pound bonuses, in response to recent allegations that the bank helped clients evade taxes.

Douglas Flint, chairman, said on Monday: "We deeply regret and apologise for the conduct and compliance failures highlighted which were in contravention of our own policies as well as expectations of us."

However, Stuart Gulliver, chief executive, said: "It seems to me that we are holding large corporations to higher standards than the military, the church or civil service - Douglas and I should be aware of everything that is being done within the organisation," said Mr Gulliver. "Can I know what every one of 257,000 people is doing - clearly I can't. If you want to ask the question could it ever happen again - that is not reasonable."

Mr Gulliver been pulled into the tax-evasion scandal after it was claimed that he sheltered millions of dollars from the taxman in a Panamanian company via its Swiss private bank.

He was listed by HSBC as the beneficial owner of Worcester Equities, an anonymous company registered in Panama, which held a balance of $7.6m in 2007, according to the Guardian.

The HSBC chief has UK non-domiciled tax status, allowing him to keep offshore income and capital gains out of the British tax net because he is domiciled for tax purposes in Hong Kong, even though his job is based in London.

HSBC said: "Since being posted to the UK from Hong Kong in 2003, Mr Gulliver has paid full UK tax on the entirety of his worldwide earnings, less a credit for tax paid additionally in Hong Kong (where he is also tax resident) on that part of the same earnings doubly taxed."

Mr Gulliver said he was paid 7.6m for 2014, a slight decrease from the 8m he received the previous year, after his bonus was docked by 1.75m to adjust for the fine over rigging foreign exchange markets and other control failures. He said his pay for the year "is entirely taxed in UK as well as a part of it in Hong Kong".

In a call with media, Mr Gulliver was asked repeatedly about the tax evasion scandal that has engulfed HSBC's Swiss private bank and about his own account at the Swiss unit that was held via a Panamanian company.

He said there was no tax benefit to the Panamanian structure, which was disbanded in 2008 when he joined the bank's main board and his pay started to be disclosed publicly. Instead, he said the structure was designed to avoid his colleagues in Hong Kong and Switzerland finding out how much he earned when he worked for HSBC's investment bank and was for many years its top earner.

Mr Gulliver said there was "a completely everyday explanation" for the structure. He said that in the 1990s the bank's trading system in Hong Kong allowed everyone on it to see the bank accounts of their colleagues, which meant that many staff opened private accounts with the bank's Swiss arm.

"Being in Switzerland protects me from the Hong Kong staff. Being in Panama protects me from the Swiss staff," he said. "There is nothing more complicated than that."

Douglas Flint, chairman, said: "Absolutely nothing Stuart has done is anything other than legal, transparent and compliant. His tax affairs have always been transparent to me and to the board and there is no story here."

Mr Gulliver pointed out that had he not reversed his predecessor's decision to relocate the chief executive role from London to Hong Kong, he would have paid much lower tax on his earnings. "I have paid UK tax on the entirety of my worldwide earnings," he said.

He admitted that allegations of tax evasion linked to HSBC and clients with accounts between 2005 and 2007 were "a source of shame" for him and several of his colleagues. "One of the impacts is on morale inside HSBC," he added.

Mr Flint said the affair was "totally humbling" and conceded "yet again it is a sign that we did not fully understand" what was going on inside the bank. Mr Gulliver said the increase in staff numbers from 136,000 in 1998 to more than 300,000 in 2006 meant the bank "did not have strong enough controls" to police itself.

HSBC, the first big UK lender to report 2014 annual results, missed consensus analyst expectations for pre-tax profits of $21bn. The bank said the extra burden of regulation and the need to upgrade its IT systems to handle "big data" requirements and to protect against cyber crime had pushed its operating costs up 6.1 per cent.

The global banking and markets division, which houses HSBC's investment bank, was its worst-performing division as profits fell 38 per cent. Retail banking and wealth management profits also fell slightly, while commercial banking and its smaller private banking arm increased their contributions.

Since he took over as chief executive in 2011, Mr Gulliver has withdrawn from many businesses and countries that are considered too risky, disposing of or withdrawing from 74 businesses with almost $100bn in risk-weighted assets.

But the cost of complying with the extra demands of regulators has taken its toll. Last year, HSBC abandoned its target to have a cost-income ratio - a closely watched measure of efficiency - in the mid-50s by 2016. Instead it aims for a ratio in the high 50s.

On Monday, HSBC said its cost-efficiency ratio - a measure of costs against revenue - soared from 59.6 per cent to 67.3 per cent, while its return on equity fell from 9.2 per cent to 7.3 per cent. The bank said its capital ratio rose slightly to 10.9 per cent and it increased the dividend to 50 cents.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
'Code Red' makes DBS 'too big to ignore'; FACE TO FACE: SU SHAN TAN

Head of wealth management has turned the Singaporean bank into a success story

Almost five years since Su Shan Tan first joined Singapore's DBS as head of wealth management , the market is at last taking her bank, which is partly owned by Temasek, the city-state's investment agency, seriously.

The main reason is her work integrating the Asian franchise of French bank Socit Gnrale. It added $12.6bn of assets, split evenly between clients in Singapore's Asean neighbourhood and the China, Hong Kong and Taiwan bloc further north.

"My old colleagues never imagined I would be on the acquisition trail, but now they are calling to ask when is the next deal," says the live-wire 47-year-old, who has worked at Morgan Stanley, Citi and ING Barings. "We were previously too small to make a difference, now we are too big to ignore."

Back in 2010, the DBS private banking business lacked scale, but the game has changed. Now she has the new wealth of China, plus the fruits of reforming economies in India and Indonesia , in her sights. "At last we have an Asian bank that has broken into the top 10 of the region," she says, referring to the healthy $102bn of private client funds under her stewardship.

The 200 SocGen staff - about 80 per cent of the previous total - that decided to stay with the thriving DBS brand after the $220m purchase of their business were recently rewarded with a raucous party. This involved French and Singaporean employees in wigs, heels and party dresses dancing together to the 1979 Abba hit "Voulez-Vous".

"None of us Singaporeans speak great French so we were looking for a popular song with a catchy French title to cement our deal," says Ms Tan over Chinese noodles and green tea in the restaurant next door to her office. "We were saying to the SocGen team: 'Join us and you will have a career in a committed bank in a region you like - you will do well with us'."

Yet few private bankers saw the partially state-run DBS as a serious employer until the 2008 crisis hit and its safe status became apparent. Many were also sceptical of Ms Tan's leadership skills. "She was more local celebrity than serious banker," says one consultant. But a market now pricing Asian female talent ahead of underqualified Caucasian men has warmed to the Singapore -raised, Oxford-educated leader, who served in the country's parliament and spends "spare time" sourcing doctors to help her English husband's charitable foundation in rural Cambodia.

"DBS has been such a great success story. Su Shan has hired people who would have previously never dreamt of going there," says Simeon Fowler, chief executive of Fowler Fox, the Hong Kong headhunters. Even in 2010, DBS's pan-regional ambitions were ridiculed by critics.

"When I first started, the service levels left a lot to be desired," Ms Tan says politely. "My boss [DBS chief executive] Piyush [Gupta] called us all in and said we were being sent to Changi."

Initially, they thought it was a joke about punishment for poor performance with a spell in Changi prison, where Ms Tan's former Barings colleague, rogue trader Nick Leeson, languished until 1999. But when the bus arrived to take them to Changi airport, they realised they would be joining Singapore Airlines staff at their renowned training facility.

"They locked us in a room for two days to figure out what DBS staff had to do to improve customer service. We eventually came up with a combination of being respectful, easy to deal with and dependable and called it 'Code Red' for short," she says. "Now we are coming top of all the customer surveys."

Early in 2014, Ms Tan took a call from Singapore Airlines. "Their boss asked me: 'Can we send some crew to you for training?' It has come full circle," she laughs.

This service mentality - offering the wealthiest customers limo pickups, access to top courses in a golf-obsessed region and a S$1m ($753,000) credit card - did not come naturally. Ms Tan started her career at Barings in London in 1989 selling derivatives to pension schemes, sovereign wealth and hedge funds. "It was a wonderful time until Nick Leeson did his thing," she says, recalling the "smart guy" who worked as her options clerk.

"But I learnt some strong lessons and saw first hand how governance should work, the need for separation of front and back-office activities and how fear and greed can destroy an organisation. I now tell my staff: in good times, don't lose your head and in bad times, don't lose heart."

During the next "Asian" crisis of 1998, she learnt not to be overleveraged to volatile currencies. At DBS she has clamped down on excessive sales of opaque, complex structured products, previously common across Asian markets.

She is known for pacing office floors, asking random relationship managers from her 1,000 strong salesforce to either explain what they are selling to clients or enrol into a "non-negotiable" 7.30am product boot camp. "I took a draconian view," she says. "If you want to sell it, you have to understand exactly how the product is structured."

Fast-improving service levels have led staff to brush up on Mandarin to take trading orders from mainland Chinese. "None of us grew up speaking business Chinese, differentiating between put and call options and talking about convertible bonds," she says, remembering her teenage years when children were encouraged to save at the Post Office Savings Bank - now owned by DBS - by its 'Smiley the Squirrel' mascot, offering stickers for every dollar saved.

She recently reinstated the stickers in app form, reflecting the fast-digitising Asian landscape. Her bank's "cognitive computing" partnership with IBM relies on artificial intelligence to give bankers better access to products and investment thinking and may soon include a role for robo-advisers.

She is encouraging her teams to transform their use of technology, keeping up with both Korean banks and Chinese non-banking disrupters. "The likes of Alibaba, Ten Cent and [Chinese search engine provider] Baidu want to eat my lunch. In this world, only the paranoid will survive."

With Big Data , HR Departments Too Often Get Short Shrift; JoAnne Kruse of American Express Global Business Travel on what companies are missing

JoAnne Kruse, chief human resources officer, American Express Global Business Travel:

 The importance of using big data to drive informed decision-making has become socialized across most organizations recently. While finance, marketing and other departments within a company receive customized data and analytics systems, human resources is still left with big data hand-me-downs.

 There is no one-size-fits-all blueprint for big-data infrastructure. Companies invest heavily to customize big-data and analytics tools, often on a department-by-department basis, to ensure the insights inform specific needs and strategies. Unfortunately for human resources, it is often revenue-driving departments that receive customized tools, leaving human resources to make use of infrastructure that simply doesn't fit.

 Human-resource departments generate and collect more data than most other areas of a company, but our attempts to claim big data for our own often get mired in technology infrastructure and analytics tools that were never intended to meet the needs of a modern HR organization.

 For many human-resources departments, it can be challenging to manage large amounts of diverse employee information, typically captured by different systems and providers. But data can play a key role in taking decision-making to a next level in, for example, planning for investments in employee programs, benefit options, and managing information and employee behavior to lower call center support costs.

 One area of promise that could be enabled by more customized tools is performance management. With more sophisticated data analytics, we can model the future success of employees or assess the potential for success of candidates. Rather than performance evaluations occurring once or twice a year, we can continuously integrate data and provide feedback to employees in a much more dynamic way, creating a performance process instead of a performance event.

 Forward-thinking companies are investing in tools that arm their chief human-resources officers with actionable insights, allowing them to invest in more nuanced benefit plans, investment options, recruitment processes and talent-development programs that truly meet the needs of employees."

Heard on the Street
Bank Rules Haunt Big Insurance

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

The biggest U.S. insurance firms may be facing another clash with banking regulation.

The likes of American International Group, Prudential Financial and MetLife scored a win last year when Congress passed a bill allowing the Federal Reserve to craft capital standards tailored for insurers rather than subject them to those designed for the biggest banks. But big insurers are hardly out of the woods. In a recent letter, Financial Stability Board Chairman Mark Carney said global regulators are preparing rules for insurers similar to total-loss absorption capacity requirements proposed for banks last year.

The basic idea is to make the failure of financial firms less costly for taxpayers. The proposal would require banks to have loss-absorbing capacity of 16% to 20% of risk-weighted assets, composed of regulatory capital plus long-term unsecured debt. The latter would have to make up one-third of a bank's loss-absorbing capacity.

Relative to banks, insurance firms tend to have little long-term debt at the holding-company level. MetLife had just $16.2 billion as of Dec. 21, 2014, equal to about 2% of its liabilities. The figure for J.P. Morgan Chase is about 12%. Insurers differ from banks because they aren't taking deposits or making loans. They usually hold big books of low-risk assets whose maturities match the timing of expected policy payouts. Their primary liabilities are to policyholders.

So applying a banklike rule would trigger a big shift in insurers' balance sheets. A requirement for more parent-company debt also could endanger credit ratings, notes Karen Petrou of Federal Financial Analytics. Fortunately, insurance firms likely have time to make their case against these rules. But it should remind investors that regulation still poses unpredictable risks.

Markets
Wall Street Staffing Falls Again; Report finds head count of bankers and traders down 4% last year

Squeezed by new rules and tough markets, Wall Street is taking the ax to its workforce.

The number of investment bankers, traders, salespeople and research analysts at the world's largest banks has fallen 20% globally since its recent peak in 2010, a report by Coalition Ltd., a London research firm, shows.

The latest data come after the firms, 10 of the world's largest, trimmed 4%, or 2,100 employees, in 2014 from a year earlier amid a challenging trading environment on fixed-income desks.

The declines show that a trend on Wall Street is gaining momentum. The biggest banks are making do with fewer numbers on the front lines or those who deal directly with clients and bring in revenue. New rules on capital and risk taking have crimped profit, forcing banks into tough decisions about businesses to exit from and veteran moneymakers to turn loose.

Still, some areas of the financial-services sector are growing. Hiring remains brisk among so-called back-office functions that don't generate revenue, from technology and cybersecurity to legal and compliance divisions that are dealing with new postcrisis rules and enforcement cases.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. has hired 13,000 employees from 2012 through 2014 to beef up controls in areas ranging from compliance to legal to risk. Citigroup Inc. has hired about 10,000 people in regulatory and compliance-related roles, even though its overall employment number has fallen about 20,000 over the past two years, according to recent remarks by Chief Executive Michael Corbat.

Among bankers and traders, however, staffing has been falling for four consecutive years, Coalition said. The big banks face a crossroads on their staffing. Cutting more jobs may begin to limit their ability to generate revenue, said George Kuznetsov, head of research and analytics at Coalition.  There's a certain amount of head count you can cut further, but if you start doing that, you start impacting what you can do," he said.

The research firm noted that there were some 51,600  front-office producers" working for the 10 banks at the end of 2014, down 12,800 from the 64,400 in 2010 after many big banks such as Morgan Stanley and others staffed up following a busy period in bond trading.

 Postcrisis, banks started to realize that keeping up with Joneses just for the sake of it wasn't necessarily the smartest thing to do," said Joseph Leung, managing partner at Aubreck Leung LP, a London-based Wall Street recruiting firm.  We saw banks pulling out of businesses altogether, retreating from regions or having watered down versions of what they previously had."

Many of last year's cuts came as banks decided to retreat from some businesses, many of them in fixed-income, currencies and commodities, or FICC, divisions, where head count dropped 9%. This past year's data drew from head count estimates at Bank of America Corp., Barclays PLC, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Credit Suisse Group AG, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS AG.

Wall Street is notorious for overhiring in good times and reversing course when business weakens.  There's a boom-and-bust cycle, and they have always operated that way," said Charles Geisst, a finance professor at Manhattan College who has written on Wall Street history.

But some say these declines are different, coming as bank executives deal with a long slump in some of their biggest businesses, including FICC trading. The Coalition report shows the banks' FICC trading revenue fell for a second-straight year, dropping 7% in 2014 to $69.4 billion. That market totaled $141.6 billion in 2009.

At one point, most of the big banks sought to compete in each and every market and in every corner of the world. The new rules have forced many banks into picking their spots.

 The vast majority [of the head count reductions] are quite permanent," Mr. Kuznetsov said.  The ambitions are very different now. Most banks don't have the ambition to compete across every product and every region. As a result, you see head count significantly lower."

The cuts represent banks' effort to eke out profits in an environment where that has become more difficult because of regulatory crackdowns on risky assets and heavy borrowing. The pay of investment bankers and traders is a key lever for banks' cost controls, since such employees often make $1 million a year or more, far in excess of the amount an average bank employee makes.

The report didn't factor in employees who work in back-office or support functions. It also doesn't include wealth-management businesses, which have thrived amid the stock-market rebound and baby boomers' need for financial advice.

Firms also are keeping a close eye on the compensation of people who remain at the firm. At Goldman, for example, the average employee received compensation of about $373,000, down from $430,000 in 2010.

Moves made by Wall Street's giants tend to ripple through New York's employment landscape. Data compiled by the New York Department of Labor show that employment in New York City's  investment banking and securities dealing" sector has fallen significantly since before the financial crisis, recording a 20% drop between 2007 and 2014. This has muted the growth of the broader financial-services sector in the last few years, while total private employment in the city has increased more than 8% since 2007, buoyed by hiring in sectors like consulting and food and drinks.

Even if trading markets heat up, experts see subdued hiring.  The Street is beginning to look at its costs and run itself much more like an industrial company," said Brad Hintz, an ex-Wall Street analyst who is now an adjunct finance professor at New York University.  Will these firms be run as tightly as General Electric? Of course not. It is Wall Street," he said.  But I don't see these management teams losing control of their cost base."

Tech
Ten Billion Dollar Ideas You ve Never Heard Of; WSJ s list of most valuable startups includes Sunrun, Adyen and Mogujie

Many members of The Journal's "http://graphics.wsj.com/billion-dollar-club/" are now well-known names, including car-hailing app Uber, messaging-service SnapChat and scrap-booking site Pinterest. But "http://www.wsj.com/articles/meet-the-hottest-tech-startups-1424308076" valued at $1 billion or more are some lesser-known ones from around the globe. Here are 10:

Adyen

Location: Amsterdam

Latest valuation: $1.5 billion (December 2014)

Total equity funding: $500 million

CEO: Peter van der Does

Year founded: 2006

Peter van der Does had grown weary of apologizing for mistakes he wasn't responsible for. His startup Bibit processed credit-card payments on behalf of merchants using the the existing technology of established banks. When problems arose such as double-billing Bibit was the first place merchants called after customers realized the mistake.

So when the Royal Bank of Scotland purchased Bibit in 2004, around the same time European rules changed to allow nonbanks to have relationships with the likes of Visa and MasterCard, he and other Bibit founders teamed up again to build a processing service independent of banks.

Since launching Adyen BV in 2006, the stealthy Amsterdam startup has grown quickly. As fast-growing customers like Facebook Inc., Spotify Ltd. and Airbnb Inc. have expanded operations, Adyen has grown alongside them, processing $25 billion in payments in 2014, with revenue nearly doubling to $185 million last year from $95 million in 2013. Adyen's 3,500 merchants can accept payments online, on mobile devices and at individual points of sale in 187 currencies.

The company has expanded from accepting Visa and MasterCard to incorporating more than 250 payment methods in total, including bitcoin, Apple Pay and Alibaba's Alipay. Along with enabling one-step payments, Adyen provides risk-management services and analytics to merchants. The service is included as part of the same variable fee charged on top of standard credit-card fees and it's intended to help merchants accept more transactions and better understand their customers.

As Adyen works to improve its technology and expand into Asia, it faces plenty of competition, from established players including Chase Paymentech Solutions LLC and First Data Corp. to the ever-growing cluster of startups such as Square Inc., Powa Technologies Ltd. and Klarna AB.

Lizette Chapman

Delivery Hero

Location: Berlin

Latest valuation: $1.9 billion (February 2015)

Total equity funding: $963 million

CEO: Niklas stberg

Year founded: 2011

Like many entrepreneurs in Berlin's booming startup scene, Delivery Hero Holding GmbH's co-founder and chief executive, Niklas stberg, is a foreigner with global ambitions.

Bored with a consulting job in Zurich, Mr. stberg in 2007 launched an online pizza-ordering hub in his native Sweden that quickly became Scandinavia's market leader. In Sweden, customers must find a local restaurant willing to deliver, unlike in the U.S., where pizza delivery is a big business dominated by huge chains.

Mr. stberg's early success made him realize the business model applied to food more generally across Europe, where restaurants are largely local. Thus Delivery Hero was born in 2011 with the help of friends and German venture capital.

Delivery Hero offers an online platform for local restaurants seeking new customers and allows for easy payment, taking an undisclosed cut in the process. After expanding across Europe, the company has pushed globally to Latin America, Asia and Australia. Europe today accounts for 60% of company revenue, down from 95% a year ago, Mr. stberg said. Delivery Hero says it has over 90,000 participating restaurants in 24 countries across five continents, making it the largest food-ordering network in the world.

Mr. stberg says this year the company expects to generate about  150 million ($170 million) in revenue on gross sales of about  1 billion ($1.1 billion) based on the current monthly run rate.

Delivery Hero could eventually face fierce competition from publicly traded food-delivery companies Just Eat Holding Ltd., of London, and U.S.-based Grub-Hub Inc. Just Eat's delivery model is similar to Delivery Hero's but covers fewer markets, while Grub-Hub focuses exclusively on the U.S. A new rival, Foodpanda, is raising funds quickly but concentrating on emerging markets.

Mr. stberg says he is keeping the option to go public open in 2015. And he is coy about entering the U.S. market, something very few European start-ups have tried.

Chase Gummer

DocuSign

Location: San Francisco

Latest valuation: $1.6 billion (March 2014)

Total equity funding: $237 million

CEO: Keith Krach

Year founded: 2003

It's fitting that DocuSign Inc.'s roots are in real estate, an industry drowning in paperwork.

The company's origins date back more than a decade, when founder Tom Gonser started a company to streamline mortgage lending. He spent more than a year honing software that was both easy for nontechnical people to use and secure enough to make corporate executives comfortable.

The startup's software lets people sign documents electronically instead of shuttling paper contracts back and forth, helpful technology for tasks such as opening a brokerage account or buying a new home. Judges in rural Butte County, Calif., use DocuSign to approve warrants remotely without making police leave crime scenes.

But DocuSign sees digital signatures as a gateway to its bigger ambition: becoming a hub for digitizing and automating various interactions between businesses and their customers.

For instance, Salesforce.com Inc., which provides sales tools on the Web, uses DocuSign to fill in contracts with stored client information and to email purchase orders to clients for their electronic signatures. That has saved money for Salesforce and its clients, the company said, and it has cut the average time to complete a service contract from several days to less than an hour in about three-quarters of cases.

DocuSign is taking advantage of dual trends in software: Ever greater amounts of data are stored in remote computers connected to the Internet, and both consumers and businesses increasingly demand services that work seamlessly with one another.

More than 48 million people have used the service at least once to process a digital document, DocuSign says. The company counts more than 130,000 paid customers (individual subscriptions start at $10 a month), including companies such as Microsoft Corp., Google Inc., and SAP SE that, in turn, make DocuSign available for their customers.

Shira Ovide

Honest

Location: Santa Monica, Calif.

Latest valuation: $1 billion (August 2014)

Total equity funding: $122 million

CEO: Brian Lee

Year founded: 2011

Actress Jessica Alba has suffered from allergies since she was young, but it was an allergic reaction to a baby-safe laundry detergent a few years ago that led her to co-found a company that makes nontoxic consumer products like diapers, wipes and creams for delicate skin.

Honest Co. started in 2011, three years after Ms. Alba's first daughter, Honor, was born, and it has expanded to sell cleaning products, vitamins and toothpaste, competing against some of the world's biggest companies, including Procter & Gamble Co. and Kimberly-Clark Corp. Honest joins other brands such as Earth's Best and Seventh Generation that are playing to concerns about the materials used in everyday items.

Honest says its sales rose to $170 million in 2014, up from $60 million in 2013. It sells more than 75% of its products through the Web and is currently building up its store distribution business, with items available in more than 2,500 locations, including Target Corp. stores.

Makers of conventional diapers, including Procter & Gamble, which sells Pampers, and Kimberly-Clark, maker of Huggies, contest the notion that their products pose safety concerns, noting that ingredients used in disposable diapers are subject to rigorous regulatory tests. But Honest says its diapers contain fewer harsh chemicals that could irritate skin than some national brands. Its message has gained traction among parents, who are willing to pay a premium to allay fears of exposing their infants to unnecessary chemicals.

Honest is poised to face fresh competition on diapers. Amazon.com Inc. recently launched Elements, its own line of diapers and baby wipes that boast some of the same claims as Honest, like being free of chlorine and perfume. But in a sign of how difficult it is to crack the space, Amazon pulled the product due to poor reviews and is rethinking how to make them.

Ms. Alba founded the company with three others, including CEO Brian Lee, who helped begin another celebrity studded start-up, ShoeDazzle, an e-commerce fashion site.

Paul Ziobro

InsideSales.com

Location: Provo, Utah

Latest valuation: $1 billion (April 2014)

Total equity funding: $139 million

CEO: Dave Elkington

Year founded: 2004

Dave Elkington became fascinated with how humans learn and know while studying philosophy at the University of Utah. So with less than $20,000 from his mother-in-law, he decided in 2004 to start a company using so-called predictive analytics software to help salespeople understand how they can be the most effective.

His startup, InsideSales.com Inc., has amassed a huge trove of data that is then crunched to reveal sales trends for example, people answer the phone more often when it's snowy, cold or very humid, but they respond to email when it's sunny or less humid. Mr. Elkington has even studied how cycles of the moon affect sales, an idea he got from his father-in-law, a retired internist, who told him that emergency rooms are packed when the moon is full. Deals closed during a new moon, for example, are generally bigger than those when there is a full moon, the data shows.

Mr. Elkington says InsideSales.com now collects from its users more than one billion sales interactions a month. InsideSales.com claims about 2,000 customers, including Microsoft Corp. and Groupon Inc.

The company's big-data prowess has also captured investors  Mr. Elkington told The Journal last year that 25 venture-capital firms offered about 10 term sheets to invest as much as $300 million. He settled on $100 million in April, and he plans to use some of that money this year to nearly double the workforce to about 970 people.

The company also poached top executives from other companies, including Brent Peters, former enterprise chief technology officer at eBay Inc. who is now InsideSales.com's senior vice president of engineering, and Jim Steele, former chief customer officer at Salesforce.com Inc., who left that company after 12 years to take a similar position at InsideSales.com.

Intarcia Therapeutics

Location: Boston

Latest valuation: $1.75 billion (March 2014)

Total equity funding: $598 million

CEO: Kurt Graves

Year founded: 1995

T2D is shorthand for Type 2 diabetes, one of the world's most common and debilitating chronic diseases. Intarcia Therapeutics Inc. CEO Kurt Graves likes an alternate translation:  Time 2 Disrupt," he says, reflecting his view that Intarcia's lead product, ITCA 650, is poised to transform the global diabetes market.

ITCA 650 is a match-stick-sized pump that holds a year's supply of exenatide, a popular diabetes drug already prescribed in twice-daily or once-weekly injections. The pump, implanted in abdominal tissue, continuously delivers minute quantities of the medicine to patients, providing a level dosing that reduces side effects and may improve efficacy over injectable versions.

But the big potential advantage is adherence. Once implanted, the pump provides assurance that a patient will stay on the medicine for up to a year, a major attraction for health insurers. With current pills and injectables, more than half of diabetes patients stop taking their medicines within a year.

Intarcia was originally founded to develop drugs for cancer and infectious diseases but switched to diabetes after a planned initial public offering in 2005 failed to attract investors. Mr. Graves, a former veteran of Novartis AG and Merck & Co. who joined in 2010, has energized the company, which reported upbeat results from its late-stage clinical-trial program last year.

Merck, Novo Nordisk AS, AstraZeneca PLC and Sanofi SA dominate the brand-name diabetes market, but Mr. Graves is undaunted. He plans head-to-head trials against each of their drugs, expecting the adherence issue to win the day.

In November, Mr. Graves negotiated a deal granting most foreign rights to the pump to French drug-maker Servier for $171 million up front plus more than $1 billion in milestones while Intarcia retains full rights in the lucrative U.S. market. The company has plenty of cash to take it to U.S. approval, which could come in late 2016.

Jasper Technologies

Location: Santa Clara, Calif.

Latest valuation: $1.4 billion (April 2014)

Total equity funding: $204 million

CEO: Jahangir Mohammed

Year founded: 2004

The Internet of Things is now a familiar phrase. But no one was using the term when Jahangir Mohammed founded Jasper Technologies Inc., even though the Silicon Valley entrepreneur was predicting that all kinds of everyday devices were going to start exchanging data.

He has gradually been proven right. Companies are using wireless technologies to help monitor soft-drink machines, office copiers, manufacturing tools, jet engines and home-security systems.

Jasper developed a cloud service that customers log into to help manage the various interactions and handle any necessary billing arrangements with cellular carriers.

One customer is Garmin Ltd., the provider of GPS navigation devices and services. The company has offerings for fleet vehicles that rely on cellular connections and Jasper's service, gathering data about how customers use the Garmin hardware and pushing software updates to them, Jasper says. The company also cites relationships with 12 auto makers, which are rapidly adding Internet connections based on the wireless technology called LTE.

Jasper now calls itself  the on switch for the Internet of Things." A range of other companies have similar ideas, developing various kinds of back-end services to help coordinate gadgets. Covisint Corp., for example, has a cloud service it says can carry out tasks like helping to connect Hyundai cars to smartwatches and other mobile devices.

But Macario Namie, Jasper's vice president of marketing, says most such companies focus on particular market segments, like smart homes or industrial applications. He says his company has the broadest set of connections with carriers and companies, translating into 1,900 customers in more than 100 countries.

Mogujie

Location: Hangzhou, China

Latest valuation: $1.0 billion (June 2014)

Total equity funding: $200 million

CEO: Chen Qi

Year founded: 2011

Chen Qi and Yue Xuqiang once worked for Taobao, one of China's largest marketplaces and a unit of e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. Now they're trying to outduel their former employer.

The pair originally started up a business that sold online tools to websites to help monitor their traffic and make money from advertising. When that plan failed, they decided in 2011 to start a social-commerce site similar to the U.S. site Pinterest, another member of the billion-dollar startup club.

Mogujie focuses on women's fashion, allowing users to create a photo collage of clothing, accessories and other fashion merchandise. The company used to drive a large share of ad-referral traffic to Taobao's marketplace.

But Mogujie has since moved to become a formidable competitor instead, housing thousands of online shops on its own site and charging merchants a commission. It is betting that people would prefer to browse through displays of curated items by people they know, and in the process it is hoping to lure merchants from Taobao.

The site now has 85 million registered users and 35 million monthly active users, along with average monthly transaction volume of 300 million yuan ($48 million), making it one of China's largest social-shopping sites. Mogujie, which means  Mushroom Street" in English, says it has found that consumers in the  post-90s" generation a Chinese term for people born in the 1990s are more carefree and less insecure than the generations before them, making them more likely to spend.

But Mogujie will face intense competition from Taobao, which hosts eight million small merchants and 800 million item listings, as well as other websites specializing in women's fashion and social shopping, such as Meilishuo and Koudai.

Sunrun

Location: San Francisco

Latest valuation: $1.3 billion (March 2014)

Total equity funding: $295 million

CEO: Lynn Jurich

Year founded: 2007

In 2006, the year before Sunrun Inc.'s founders launched their business, solar energy powered just 30,000 American homes, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. By the end of 2013, there were about 400,000 homes in the country powered by solar, and Sunrun and its business model are a big reason why.

In the past, few homeowners were willing to pay tens of thousands of dollars for a rooftop solar installation that would pay off in smaller utility bills at some distant date in the future. Sunrun was the first company to cover the cost of the solar system installed on a residential roof, own the system, and handle maintenance. Homeowners pay the company monthly for the electricity the system produces, leading to lower utility bills.

Soon after Sunrun began financing panels, archrival SolarCity Corp. came out with a similar offering and then, in 2012, went public. The two companies, along with competitors such as Vivint Solar Inc. and SunPower Corp., are trying to capture a market that appears to have room to grow--less than 1% of American homes have solar.

Even though the cost of solar panels has dropped in recent years, finding customers and installing the panels is still an expensive endeavor. Utilities, meanwhile, have lobbied against state-government subsidies for their solar competitors. The solar companies also rely on federal incentives that are due to be reduced starting in 2017, which will force companies to fill the gap, according to Edward Fenster, Sunrun's executive chairman and co-founder.

Sunrun has more than 60,000 customers. The company told the Journal in January 2015 that it has $1.4 billion of solar projects on its balance sheet, compared with the $2.4 billion in solar energy systems that SolarCity reported on its balance sheet as of the end of September.

Yello Mobile

Location: Seoul

Latest valuation: $1 billion (December 2014)

Total equity funding: $112 million

CEO: Sang-Hyuk Lee

Year founded: 2012

One of South Korea's hottest mobile startups is actually a hodgepodge of companies.

In early 2013, entrepreneur Sang-Hyuk Lee approached several small local mobile-commerce companies about joining forces. The companies were active in areas Mr. Lee now sees as core businesses: hotel and restaurant recommendations, local services and coupons. He formed Yello Mobile, whose name is a play on  yellow pages," the commercial pages in traditional phonebooks.

Since that initial alliance, Mr. Lee has been cherry-picking promising mobile-app operators through equity swaps, which give Yello Mobile a majority stake in companies that are typically valued under $10 million.

The strategy of hoarding the best apps seems to be paying off. Together, the roughly 70 companies have racked up a cumulative 70 million downloads, with 22 million active monthly users. Yello Mobile estimates that its sales in 2014 rose more than tenfold to about $100 million, and that it was marginally profitable.

The apps include CooCha, which aggregates the cheapest deals for merchandise from 100 different shopping malls and websites. Another service is called Pikicast, and it is a multimedia provider of entertainment content with the aim to outgrow services like YouTube in Korea.

Driving Mr. Lee's urgency is a belief that mobile commerce and marketing are exploding too quickly for any one company to be dominant. Mr. Lee says he has no interest in mobile messaging or mobile gaming, two areas that he believes are already saturated.

Expanding at such a pace is risky, and it makes Yello Mobile potentially vulnerable to a swift downturn in the economy at a time when South Korean officials are warning of exactly that. In the 2014 fourth quarter, South Korea's economy slowed to its most sluggish pace in more than two years, even though officials tried to juice the economy through interest rate cuts and higher government spending.

Corrections & Amplifications

The 73 companies in the WSJ's Billion Dollar Startup Club represent 0.4% of the roughly 16,700 private companies that have raised venture capital since 2011. A Business & Finance article Thursday about the club incorrectly gave the figure as 0.004%.

(WSJE February 20, 2015)

(END)

Europe lacks its very own Facebook, Google or Twitter, but if the volume of new venture capital backing technology startups on the continent is any guide, there could be one in the making.

European venture-capital investment last year reached its highest level since the dot-com boom, on the back of a healthy market for initial public offerings.

Successful technology startups are bursting out of the tech hubs of London, Stockholm and Tel Aviv, among other cities. Innovative young companies from the broader reaches of Europe, the Middle East and Africa are helping fill up The Wall Street Journal's billion-dollar startup club. What's still up for debate is whether Europe's sick economy and its patchwork of regulations can keep cultivating the freewheeling ecosystem that startups need to thrive.

Equity financing for European venture-backed companies reached 7.9 billion euros ($8.9 billion), up from 6.3 billion euros in 2013 -- the biggest amount invested since 2001, when companies secured 10.6 billion euros, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. The number of venture-backed IPOs in the region in 2014 more than tripled to 55, which raised a total of 3.7 billion euros. In 2013, 18 IPOs raised a total of 500 million euros.

Overall, industry watchers expect 2015 to be a banner year for technology M&A and stock flotations in Europe.

Stephen Lowery, a partner at Frog Capital, a U.K. venture-capital firm, said the tech sector in Europe was still maturing.

"U.S. venture capitalists have been raising their ninth, 10th and 11th funds -- that is 30, 40 years of experience.

European VCs are raising their third and fourth rounds. It takes time. There is money in Europe, and the good companies are getting funded," he told the Journal.

"We're going to see a lot of M&A and strategic acquisitions, as well as IPO activity in the European tech sector in 2015," said Adam Kostyal, senior vice president of listing services, Europe, at NASDAQ OMX Group Inc. Mr. Kostyal said that sectors to look at for high growth in Europe are e-commerce, financial technology, streaming content, big data, cybersecurity and advertising-tech companies.

European companies are attracting capital at an earlier stage, he said, especially from American VCs. "There are many fantastic opportunities here in Europe, and U.S. VCs aren't waiting; they're coming here to access them earlier," Mr. Kostyal said.

But there are challenges ahead, including the maze of 28 sets of local regulations among members of the European Union. Despite fitful recoveries from the depths of the European economic crisis, some European economies are dragging the rest of the region.

The U.S. has introduced some innovative tools to help startups grow. The JOBS Act lowers the hurdles for companies to list on an exchange, for instance, allowing smaller companies to file for a possible listing confidentially, and avoid early scrutiny by investors. "European regulators have the ambition to do the same thing as the JOBS Act, but they have to work across so many jurisdictions. Europe is suffering from this now," Mr. Kostyal said.

Amid those opportunities and challenges, WSJD has identified 11 companies to watch this year, based on our reporters' research and reporting. We've avoided many of the bigger or better-known startups -- including those companies that have already listed, been bought out or are heavily tipped to "exit" imminently.

Instead, we've concentrated on a handful of firms still toiling in relative obscurity. We've asked industry experts to handicap their chances of an initial public offering, a buyout or a breakout year in terms of growth or fundraising.

By its nature, our list isn't scientific. But we think it is a useful map of the EMEA tech startup landscape for 2015.

This is who we're looking at in 2015.

1. KnCMiner: Founded in 2013 in Stockholm, KnCMiner makes money from selling bitcoin mining equipment or capacity. The more people mine bitcoin, the harder it is to generate. That means that people need ever faster and more powerful machines. KnCMiner's funding round last September raised $14 million, and the company is getting out of selling bitcoin mining machines entirely, instead leasing power to customers. Customers can come to its website and pay a fee to get a certain amount of computing power for a duration of time. KnCMiner has built a vast data center, which consumes 30 megawatts of power, in northern Sweden, in the Arctic Circle. The company is designing its own new processors and is looking to open more data centers. While the price of bitcoin continues to slide, investors are still bullish about KnCMiner, mostly because the company already has significant traction, bitcoin could rise again and KnCMiner could diversify its operations to other blockchain services down the line.

2. SiSense: SiSense, a business intelligence company from Tel Aviv, secured a $30 million investment in 2014. The company makes big-data analytics software intended to run on regular computers with no additional hardware. Some of its customers include Target, eBay Inc., ESPN, Samsung Electronics and Wix.com. Having grown from a 30 person operation in 2012 to nearly a 90-strong company with offices in New-York, it is now looking to expand again and intends to open new offices in the U.S. and Europe.

-- Amir Mizroch

3. Kano: Riding on growing interest in coding, London-based startup Kano Computing Ltd. has shipped thousands of tool kits that allow users to build a computer and write software easily. While the company nominally aims at the children's market, it is also working with educational, corporate and government institutions. Pearson PLC, the world's largest education company, is using Kano to deliver a new computing curriculum in the U.K. New directions for the company could include adding games to the kits, more advanced coding and even new product classes.

-- Amir Mizroch

4. Klarna: 2015 is the year that Swedish startup Klarna enters the U.S. online payments market. It is spending $100 million to square off against competitors like eBay's PayPal, Amazon.com Inc. and Stripe Inc. Klarna has been a success in Sweden, where it handles some 30% of all online payments. In time, it plans to add about 100 employees in the U.S. The company was valued at $1.4 billion in a funding deal last year with backing from outfits like Sequoia Capital. Klarna says the $300 million it has raised so far will be ample to cover its initial U.S. push, but may seek further funding as it ramps up its U.S. operations.

-- Orr Hirschauge

5. Truecaller. Stockholm-based startup Truecaller, with its namesake caller-ID app, has raised around $60 million in funding and big name backers, including Skype founder Niklas Zennstrom's Atomico Ventures. Mr. Zennstrom has also joined Truecaller as a special adviser. At the beginning of December the app had more than 100 million users, having tripled its user base in three months. Growth in India made up a large part of this, with some 45 million Indian daily users.

6. Fiverr: Israel-based online services marketplace Fiverr International last year raised a Series C round of $30 million from investors to expand into new locations and open sites in languages other than English. The company is in hypergrowth stage, meaning it plans on having a big growth year in 2015, including opening a new office in Chicago. Fiverr is tapping a highly connected, underemployed workforce. Services start at $5. Prices are higher based on factors including the complexity of the task, time delivered and quality. Fiverr takes 20% of every gig purchased.

7. SigFox: Mobile operators are counting on billions of connected objects -- from road signs to your toaster -- to justify their investments in new cellular networks. But French networking startup SigFox is rolling out a cheap, long-range radio technology that could upset those plans. Using license-free radio spectrum and simple radio chips similar to a garage-door opener, the Toulouse-based company says it can send low-bandwidth signals tens, if not hundreds, of miles -- allowing it to cover countries with relatively few antennae. Revenue is still small, at 6 million euros last year. But with clients in sectors spanning shipping, retail and security, and a foothold in 20 countries, investors are paying attention: The company is planning to raise 100 million euros in coming weeks from venture capitalists and strategic investors, says co-founder and CEO Ludovic Le Moan.

-- Sam Schechner

8. Nordeus: Nordeus, a gaming-design company from Serbia, has been the quiet hero on the European gaming scene, ceding the headlines to major players like King, Supercell and Rovio. But to many investors, Nordeus is one to watch. It is expanding its games portfolio into more categories. Its Top Eleven football manager sports game has been a consistent top 10 in the app stores and, while free to play, makes money through in-app purchases [the company doesn't disclose revenue]. The company itself is expanding, with offices in Serbia, Dublin and San Francisco. It is opening a games-development office in London soon. Most important, it is shifting to a mobile-first, cross-platform strategy to take on the giants like King and Supercell. Players are also incentivized to watch in-app video ads.

-- Amir Mizroch

9. Oxbotica: Spun out of Oxford University's Mobile Robotics Group only three months ago, British startup Oxbotica may be one of the few companies in the world to rival Google in driverless cars. The company is working on robotics and autonomous systems, flexible-display technology with applications in "smart" glasses, synthetic retinas and foldable screens. Dr. Graeme Smith, Oxbotica CEO, says his company builds 3-D maps of cities with sensors and cameras through which autonomous systems can navigate their environment. Oxbotica is sitting on some 40 different intellectual property patents from Oxford University to which it has exclusive world-wide license, and it is trying to commercialize those patents. The company is currently talking to car manufacturers, surveying firms, logistics firms, warehouse companies, civil engineering and building firms, and even games companies.

-- Amir Mizroch

10. Withings: Withings was among the first companies to connect personal health to the Internet, with its Wi-Fi-enabled bathroom scale six years ago. Since then, the boutique French tech firm has expanded its lineup of connected devices to include blood-pressure monitors, sleep-quality sensors, fitness trackers and a well-reviewed pair of smartwatches. But the pressure will be on this year as connected health moves from being a Silicon Valley buzzword to a battleground for the likes of Apple Inc., Google and Samsung Electronics Co. Withings doesn't disclose revenue figures, but says it has doubled its staff in the past year to 160, after raising 23.5 million euros in 2013. Next up, according to co-founder and CEO Cedric Hutchings: raising "significant funds to fully take advantage of this opportunity."

-- Sam Schechner

11. Wooga: Wooga has accomplished what few game developers have: serial success. While King Digital Entertainment and Rovio have created megahits such as "Candy Crush Saga" and "Angry Birds," repeating that success has proved elusive. But for the Berlin-based company founded in 2009, there is a method to Wooga's roster of hits -- five in total, including "Diamond Dash," "Pearl's Peril," and "Jelly Splash" -- according to CEO Jens Begemann. The company relies on a "hit filter" and decentralized teams of developers to find what works and what doesn't. Wooga's games are free to play and designed for smartphones and social media like Facebook, with profits being driven by in-app purchases. The company said revenue rose by 30%, and earnings before interest and taxes had quadrupled in 2014.

-- Chase Gummer

12. Lumus: Based in Rehovot, some 12 miles south of Tel Aviv, this company's unassuming offices belie an advanced technology behind many of the wearable display prototypes on the market. The company's see-through head-mounted displays are a step ahead of the competition in resolution and sharpness. Hailing from Israel's defense industries, where similar technologies were used to create visor displays for fighter pilots, the company has an experienced engineering team. Some smart goggles with Lumus displays are intended to hit the enterprise market this year, and some consumer models made by top-tier consumer electronics companies are expected to be announced.

Moda Operandi Brings High End to Digital

By Lizette Chapman

Access to high-end fashion is in vogue.

The traditional way to sell $1,800 designer shoes has been to limit distribution to physical retailers, a process that winnows potential customers to the ultrawealthy who are also within striking distance of a Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman or other luxury store.

But luxury-fashion brands are shedding the concept that they must limit where their goods are sold to retain the waft of exclusivity, and startups are jumping at the chance to sell the wares through websites and mobile applications.

Moda Operandi is one in an elite group of startups that is melding high tech with high fashion to make luxury shopping more convenient for a younger, tech-savvy client base and an emerging jet set in markets world-wide where there are no high-end retailers.

The New York company has raised a $60 million round led by Fidelity Investments to begin what executives say will be a global expansion designed to disrupt the multibillion-dollar industry and begin courting customers for its couture.

"With this investment, we'll actually be going after clients now," said Moda Operandi Chief Executive Deborah Nicodemus.

Co-founded in 2010 by Lauren Santo Domingo, Moda struck early relationships with Alexander Wang and Valentino and has now joined with more than 250 high-end designers for both boutiques and trunk shows.

Once exclusive, in-person affairs, trunk shows enable buyers to preview then purchase items from a designer's collection that would be on sale next season at physical retail stores. Moda put these trunk shows online and allowed the general public to shop.

Moda expanded from trunk shows in 2013 to create online boutiques. By using in-house stylists who melded data from those trunk show purchases and their own fashion savvy, Moda built online shops with shoes, handbags and other accessories to complete each look and make them available for immediate purchase.

Moda isn't alone in using technology to give people access to high-end clothing. Other venture-backed startups including Rent the Runway Inc., which operates a rental service for luxury goods -- a Kotur fringe clutch that retails for $895 can be rented for $125 -- and Vaunte, which operates a high-end online consignment store so fashionistas can buy a Valentino clutch for $1,280 instead of $4,000.

Ms. Nicodemus said her company's model is different than traditional e-commerce sites. Moda makes the entire collection available for pre-purchase within one hour of the show. Customers put down a 50% deposit on items which they receive roughly five months later, around the same time the high-end retail stores receive their shipments.

Melding big data with high fashion has been successful for the company. With little marketing, Moda increased its revenue 70% to more than $50 million in 2014. It reports the average order is around $2,000.

Fidelity portfolio manager Ramin Arani said Moda's profit margins, which are around 58%, are among the reasons the firm led the round.

"Most retailers have 10% to 15% of sales that come from online e-commerce. For luxury, it's . . . somewhere around 1%," Mr. Arani said.

He said that figuring out how to make the experience of purchasing luxury items online has been a tricky proposition because luxury brands differentiate themselves on small details, like the weight of a purse clasp or the silk lining of a pocket, that must be felt to fully appreciate.

"Luxury players are looking for partners who can help them with that and tap what has been heretofore been an untapped vein," Mr. Arani said.

The opportunities and risks are large for Moda. Bain & Co. estimated the 2014 personal luxury good market at 223 billion euros in 2014.

Despite the opportunity to tap into that dynamic, Moda is trying to reach a market that comes with risks, said Barbara Wyckoff, managing director of specialty retail and apparel at CLSA Americas LLC. Agreeing to limited runs in specific sizes with expensive and often hard-to-source fabrics is tricky, especially given the potential losses incurred if items are returned, she said.

"Money, time, execution -- the challenges are huge," she said.

Ms. Nicodemus said Moda works to keep returns low by having its stylists help users find the correct size and have their expectations match the goods. Also, it strives to provide products that the customers have incentive to keep and have tailored, rather than return.

"I'd agree with that concern if the dress was $500, but these dresses are $5,000 and $10,000," Ms. Nicodemus said. "This is not about unit velocity, this is about one-of-a-kind brand luxury."

For that experience, Moda will have to depend on partnerships with brands and continue to maintain and expand relationships. Ms. Nicodemus indicated the pipeline for adding new brands is strong, but she declined to provide further details.

Along with courting customers and honing its strategy to expand its base, Moda will use the new funding to expand into more categories, continue to cement brand partnerships and expand to the physical world.

Moda opened a London showroom as an experiment last year. Moda expected it to do sales of $350,000 during the first quarter; sales exceeded $472,000 during the first week. Moda intends to open other showrooms around the world during the next three years.

Moda also will use the funds to overhaul its website and add richer content such as backstage interviews with designers and create a better mobile app for the iOS and Android operating systems. The startup will continue to invest in its technology and analytics so stylists can even better curate boutiques.

Investors in the Series E round valued Moda at $330 million, a 90% increase from its previous valuation just a year ago. Along with Fidelity, new investor Future Fund, Australia's sovereign-wealth fund, participated with existing investors including New Enterprise Associates.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
Cost cutting is behind pension insourcing trend; VIEWPOINT

Insourcing has emerged as an important strategy for pension funds to reduce costs while maintaining a tight grip on risk and performance across their portfolios. In a recent State Street survey , four out of five pension funds said they intend to increase the proportion of their portfolio that is managed in-house.

The savings achieved by insourcing can be substantial. Another study revealed that pension funds spent, on average, 46 basis points on external management compared with 8 basis points on internal investment capabilities. As well as cost benefits, pension funds also see insourcing as an opportunity to reduce agency risk through increased oversight. The principle is clear: if pension funds can get closer to the underlying assets, they have an opportunity to save money and get a better grip on risk and performance.

Insourcing can deliver significant benefits, but most pension funds will want to use this strategy selectively. Many start by focusing on areas such as government bonds or domestic equities where they typically have extensive in-house expertise.

However, pension funds' investment portfolios are becoming increasingly complex and still need specialist support. State Street's survey shows many pension funds are increasing their allocations to alternatives in a bid to deliver much-needed upside performance. Private equity is a priority, with 60 per cent of survey respondents saying they will increase existing allocations to this asset class. Other alternatives are also attracting more investment from pensions, including hedge funds , property and infrastructure.

Funds need to be clear about where their in-house teams can add value. Most will need to retain a range of external partners to help them leverage more specialist investment strategies. Those that decide to bring some areas of asset management in-house need to plan carefully. Insourcing in today's investment environment requires new skills and capabilities.

Talent is high on the agenda and in demand. To manage a broad range of assets in-house, pension funds will need to attract people with specialist skills. Those set on an ambitious insourcing path may need to increase headcount substantially.

Insourcing demands operational expertise in areas such as risk and compliance management. Attracting talent will require pension funds to design competitive packages. For funds that set up different specialist teams, it is important to maintain consistency and transparency across employment contracts. Otherwise, a generous deal designed to attract new talent may be resented by existing employees.

Technology is another piece in the puzzle. As they insource, funds will need to build a coherent picture of risk and performance across multi-asset portfolios. This requires technology that can provide full-scale integrated risk analytics. This is difficult to achieve using traditional risk software, which is often engineered around a single asset class. It is another reason why insourcing is likely to require an overhaul of operating models and data infrastructures.

As funds use a mix of in-house capability and external asset management of more specialist classes, they are looking for a new relationship with asset managers. Managers will have to be able to work as fully fledged investment partners: understanding funds' investment goals intimately and delivering solutions tailored to their long-term objectives.

As pension funds may also pursue a parallel outsourcing strategy and try to outsource critical operational functions, such as data management, to specialist partners.

The ambition and degree of insourcing will be a strategic decision, more often than not resulting in a mix of internal capabilities and external partners. To make this strategy work, funds will require a new relationship with their external asset managers and smart operating solutions for their in-house plays.

William Slattery is an executive vice-president of State Street Corporation and head of the Global Services business in Europe, the Middle East and Africa

Royal London makes 30 per cent on EDF bond, but it outperforms even further

Bond veteran Eric Holt has admitted he should have held on to a 100-year bond from utility giant EDF Energy for longer, after he missed out on further bumper returns.

The manager of the Royal London Sterling Extra Yield Bond fund bought the bond because he thought it was an anomaly for a company to issue such long-term debt.

He said the fact that the bond had a 6 per cent coupon was "extraordinary" and while he held the security for six months, leading to a 30 per cent gain on his investment, he watched as the price rocketed even further after selling it.

"It was - forgive the tongue-in-cheek expression - a disaster," he said.

"We bought it earlier in the year for 98p, we sold it in August at the highest price they had got to, which was 126p, and so we made 30 per cent on our investment in six months."

However, due to the fall in gilt yields that characterised the second half of 2014, the price of the energy company's bond rise further, to 150p.

"We capitalised and made an attractive return for our investors but we missed out on the shoot-down in gilt yields," said Mr Holt.

In spite of missing out, the manager's long-term record is strong.

Mr Holt's fund ranks third in the IA Strategic Bond sector, delivering 74.7 per cent over five years and 43 per cent over three years, according to data from FE Analytics.

His short-term numbers, though, have fallen relative to his peers.

Mr Holt said funds with a greater sensitivity to the declining gilt yields appeared to have enjoyed a short-term uptick.

The manager said he got "exceptional" gains from Phoenix Life, the insurance business, which was a top-10 holding at 1.8 per cent of the portfolio.

The company's bonds are currently unrated, as is a significant 39.5 per cent of Mr Holt's holdings.

Mr Holt said many companies in the financial sector as a whole, which makes up more than 29 per cent of his portfolio, were paying investors a premium to adjust the terms of their bonds so they meet up-to-date regulatory requirements.

He said: "We are seeing some 'old-fashioned' bonds issued where the company wanted to tweak the terms of the bond and make them better for regulatory purposes."

He said Phoenix solicited investor support for such changes in December, paying a 5 per cent consent instruction fee.

"That was a significant payment to bondholders and enhanced the performance of the fund," he said.

Investors Check In to Japanese Hotels

TOKYO -- Investors are snapping up Japanese hotels at the fastest pace since before the global financial crisis, attracted by high returns and strong growth prospects in a booming tourism sector.

The buying also reflects growing interest in Japan's broader, long-dormant real-estate sector as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's policies have weakened the yen and loosened lending conditions, while also unlocking the nation's potential as a tourist destination.

Investment in Japanese hotels by value last year rose to 297 billion yen ($2.5 billion), the most since 2007, according to Real Capital Analytics Inc., a U.S.-based data and research provider. That is less than half the total seen in 2007, but around nine times the postcrisis low of 32.3 billion yen in 2009.

Among recent deals, U.S. private-equity firm Bain Capital LLC has agreed to buy Japanese hotel operator Oedo-Onsen Holdings, people familiar with the matter said Friday. Oedo-Onsen runs 29 hotels and bathhouses in Japan, and a person familiar with the transaction put the deal's value at 50 billion yen ($421 million).

Japan's tourism is growing rapidly. A record 13.4 million foreign tourists visited the country last year, an increase of nearly a third from a year earlier, the government said last month, following a more-than-two-year plunge in the yen and a relaxation of visa requirements that made it a more affordable and convenient destination. The government has set a target of 20 million visitors a year by 2020, when Tokyo will host the Olympics.

Crucially for the hospitality sector, spending by foreign tourists jumped 40% last year, while the number of visitors from China, who spend more than travelers from other countries, nearly doubled, Japanese tourism officials said.

"Tourism is a huge growth sector in Japan," said Fred Schmidt, founding partner at GreenOak Investment Management K.K. in Tokyo, which purchased the 377-room Renaissance Okinawa Resort and a smaller hotel in June. The two properties cost 12.5 billion yen, according to Real Capital Analytics.

To be sure, Japan is far from a global tourism hot spot. It ranked only 27th world-wide in foreign visitors in 2013, according to the United Nations World Tourism Organization. English isn't as commonly spoken in Tokyo as in other major Asian cities such as Singapore and Hong Kong, and those in the industry say it doesn't offer enough tourist-friendly budget transportation options. And it was only four years ago that an earthquake, tsunami and nuclear meltdown paralyzed the country and shocked people around the world.

Still, many investors see great potential. Hotel properties in Japan offer relatively high returns. In 2013, they generated total returns -- income plus capital gains -- of 8.1%, compared with 7.1% in the U.S. and 6.1% in Singapore, according to Investment Property Databank Ltd. Returns in Japan rose to 10.4% as of June 2014, it said.

Revenue per available room, the industry's main performance metric, grew roughly 10% each year over the past three years in local-currency terms, more than in other markets such as the U.S., the U.K. Australia, and Singapore, according to STR Global data. Japanese hotels don't charge as much as rivals in other major economies. The average daily rate in 2014 was $123, compared with $236 in Singapore and $220 in France, according to STR Global.

The yen's decline against the U.S. dollar since late 2012 -- it has lost around a third of its value -- has also helped attract foreign investors by making properties cheaper in dollar terms. Last year, foreign investment in Japanese hotels totaled 68 billion yen, according to Real Capital Analytics.

Arthur Buser, executive managing director for Asia Pacific at CBRE Group Inc.'s hotels operation, a commercial-real-estate brokerage, said a greater availability of loans from Japanese lenders is also attracting investors. More lenders are also starting to use forward-looking valuation methods, employing expected future cash flows instead of historical cash flows.

Japanese banks are eager to lend money because government bonds, their traditional investments, are offering paltry yields.

Tomohiko Sawayanagi, managing director for Japan at Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. hotels and hospitality group, said the acquisition market has been competitive, with properties often attracting bids from more than 10 investors.

Among the biggest hotel deals last year were Hulic Co.'s acquisition of the 703-room Tokyo Bay Maihama Hotel Club Resort in July, which was 35 billion yen, according to a person familiar with the transaction, and GreenOak's purchase of the Okinawa resort. The asset manager of Hoshino Resorts REIT Inc. bought 24 inns and roadside hotels across the Japanese archipelago in May for 18 billion yen.

Among other recent deals, CDL Hospitality Real Estate Investment Trust, run by Singapore-based M&C REIT Management Ltd., bought two hotels with a total of 254 rooms in Tokyo in December for 5.8 billion yen, its first investments in Japan.

"We would like to expand further in Japan," said Vincent Yeo, chief executive of M&C REIT Management.

Banking on UBS's Payout

The Swiss central bank has given UBS a problem. The private and investment banks made better profits than forecast in 2014, and UBS announced a generous dividend on Tuesday, but it also sneaked in a significant cut to its future profit expectations.

The bank tweaked its targets and now expects to make a more than 15% return on tangible equity in 2016 rather than the same return on plain equity. This might look innocuous, but the change shaves at least one billion Swiss francs ($1.08 billion), or 13%, off expected after-tax profits for 2016, adjusted for restructuring charges and penalties for past bad behavior, using the current equity base.

But having ditched more capital intensive investment-banking businesses than many global rivals and with a regulator that is more advanced in imposing new capital rules than its peers in the eurozone, UBS still should be seen as dependable when it comes to returning capital to shareholders.

The Swiss National Bank's shock change to its currency policy in January was expected to hit profits at UBS and domestic rivals, mainly because most of their costs are in Swiss francs but their revenue is made in U.S. dollars and other currencies. The sharp strengthening of the Swiss franc thus hurts earnings. Analysts already had cut expectations for pretax profits by about 600 million Swiss francs for each of the next two years, according to FactSet.

UBS says the problem is less the currency change and more the simultaneous cut in interest rates to minus-0.75%. Persistently low rates are terrible for revenue from wealth-management assets and lending. Costs can always be cut, as rival Julius Baer Group intends to do, but prevailing investment yields are beyond management's control.

This is a shame for UBS, as its U.S. wealth-management arm in particular is looking better, so much so that the bank boosted the value of the tax discounts it reckons it will be able to use against profits there by almost 500 million francs in the fourth quarter, or 1.2 billion francs for the full year.

This revaluation of deferred-tax assets turned an overall decline in full-year pretax profits versus 2013 into an 11% improvement in the company's bottom line.

On the back of this, UBS doubled its final dividend to 0.50 franc per share, which adds to a 0.25 franc special payout expected following its creation of a holding company late last year. The ordinary dividend may not increase much next year, but with a healthy core capital ratio of more than 13%, UBS should be able to keep paying out more than 50% of earnings per share.

The bank's earnings power has been diminished, but UBS's payouts, with a dividend yield of about 5%, still look reliable. Other European investment banks that trade on a higher yield often do so thanks to lingering doubts about their ability to pay.

New Math, Old

Woes in India

Too bad fixing India's statistics ministry is nowhere on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's list of priorities.

India's official statisticians projected Monday that the economy would expand 7.4% in real terms in the year ending in March. Much faster than previous estimates of below 6%, the forecast is a result of India's recent revision to the way it calculates gross domestic product.

Those revisions raised eyebrows when first unveiled on Jan. 30. They showed growth accelerating during the year ended March 2014 when other indicators suggested a stark deceleration.

Monday's estimates for the current fiscal year also are hard to believe, partly because of the specifics. Government spending apparently rose 32% year over year in real terms in the December quarter. Yet the government's own auditor says the central government spent just 5.1% more last quarter in nominal terms, according to J.P. Morgan. No wonder even India's top policy makers are puzzled. Central bank Gov. Raghuram Rajan last week said it would be "premature to take a strong view" on what the new data imply.

Still, investors can afford to take a few strong views. First, New Delhi's new data at least confirm that the economy is accelerating -- to 7.4% from 6.9% last fiscal year -- something other indicators such as corporate investments also bear out. And though the headline growth rates have changed, the magnitude of the acceleration actually hasn't changed much from what most analysts forecast.

Next, the size of the underlying economy mostly remains the same, keeping key ratios such as the budget deficit as a proportion of nominal GDP constant.

And for all the complaints now, keep in mind that Indian policy makers have always groaned about the quality of data. The earlier GDP data set was hardly perfect, given that it counted producer costs instead of the prices consumers pay for goods. That it typically arrives with a two-month lag, compared with weeks in other economies, eroded its value further.

That is why key policy bodies in India such as the central bank have historically consulted multiple indicators of economic activity. Perhaps the most important lesson for investors, too, in such markets is to resist the temptation of pinning their hopes on one all-encompassing number.

Quad-Play May Not Be All Square

Quad-play is a telecom race that could leave U.K. operators running to stand still.

BT's agreement to buy wireless carrier EE this month to combine mobile services with its existing TV, Internet and fixed-line offerings was heartily welcomed by investors; BT stock is up 16% since the company first announced its interest in a deal.

The move will kick-start quad-play in the U.K., where only about 6% of total households purchase all four services from one provider, according to Strategy Analytics. The theory is that the discounts needed to win subscribers are then offset by the savings from lower customer churn. European operators also have turned to quad-play to win market share and benefit from the exponential growth in data usage.

But so far, the evidence is mixed on whether consumers or operators have more to gain from quad-play.

Virgin Media, which began bundling all four services in the U.K. last year, has seen some benefits.

The rate of departure among customers with quad-play is about 5% annually, or half that of the subscribers who buy packages of three services. But it is too early to tell whether that lower level of churn is sustainable, especially if BT enters the field armed with much bigger discounts.

Quad-play price wars have taken a toll elsewhere. Take Telefonica: In October 2012, the incumbent operator launched fixed-mobile bundling in Spain, now one of Europe's most advanced quad-play markets covering about 60% of total households. In 2013, Telefonica's churn rate slightly increased even as heavy customer discounts hit its revenue. In fact, the average revenue per user in Spain fell 14% in 2013, even though data usage increased 4%.

The U.K. may prove different. Its economy has fared better than Spain since the financial crisis. But one potential setback is that quad-play may increase -- rather than decrease -- the number of competitors. In Britain, four different operators dominate the fixed and mobile markets. But none has a sizable position in both.

BT's bid for EE promises to upend the competitive landscape by merging the U.K.'s leading fixed and mobile by subscribers. Hutchison Whampoa's 3 Group has responded by announcing exclusive talks to acquire O2 from Telefonica, while others are scrambling for alliances. If both deals close, there could be six players remaining, five of which already are positioned to offer quad-play packages.

BT's deal with EE will give it the strongest position across both markets. But subscriber growth in the U.K. telecom sector is expected to be relatively flat. If greater competition results in higher costs to win customers without the benefit of lower churn, quad-play providers could still be left with everything bundled but nothing gained.

Deflation

Symptoms

Transitory

In China

On the long menu of China's economic problems, deflation fears are likely to prove a seasonal special.

Government price data showed the slowest growth in consumer prices in five years, rising 0.8% in January compared with the year before. That is almost half the rate of December's inflation. Producer prices, which have been in deflationary mode for nearly three years, fell 4.3% as raw-materials prices continued to slide.

A deflationary spiral, however, it isn't. January's unusually low reading on consumer prices probably has something to do with China's adherence to the lunar calendar.

The biggest holiday of the year, Lunar New Year, starts in February this year, compared with a late January start in 2014. That means the usual run-up in food prices that comes ahead of celebratory feasts will be later, so the basis of comparison is skewed.

Food prices, which account for as much as half of China's inflation, rose just 1.1% in January, compared with 2.9% in December. That should rebound in February. And there are reasons to think pork prices, a major component of the food basket, which fell more than 5% in January, could turn this year as China's huge pig population shrinks.

Plummeting producer prices spark more alarm among investors, representing a weight on industrial companies suffering from overcapacity. Industrial profit fell nearly 3% in 2014, according to government data.

That said, with the recent uptick in oil prices, producer prices should stop falling as quickly in the months ahead. And solid wage growth belies the notion of an economy stuck in a deflationary rut.

Falling producer prices may in fact marginally benefit more value-added parts of the economy that see profit margins expand thanks to lower input prices. While analyst estimates show shrinking earnings per share in the year just ended for sectors such as energy and chemicals, according to Nomura, autos and retailing companies should expand profits by close to 20%.

From a policy perspective, low inflation probably won't push Beijing to amp up its easing campaign. There is no doubt that China's economy is slowing. Weak prices make sense in that context. But any extreme weakness is likely to prove transitory.

-- Alex Frangos

Overheard

The threat of rising interest rates isn't likely to spark a mortgage boom.

While many real-estate agents and mortgage lenders expect rates to rise later this year, just 45% of consumers expect this to happen, according to the January 2015 National Housing Survey from Fannie Mae. That is down from 48% a month earlier.

The Fannie Mae survey doesn't seem to do a great job at predicting the direction of interest rates. In January 2014, 55% of respondents said rates would rise; they fell. Even so, consumers' interest-rate expectations can affect behavior. With 48% of consumers expecting rates to stay the same or fall, demand for mortgages may reflect a lack of urgency. Many would-be borrowers may feel they can afford to wait to refinance or buy until a later date.

That could keep mortgage-origination volumes in check, making the earnings environment for banks less promising.

Chinese Insurer Pays a Record for Hotel

New York's Baccarat Hotel has yet to check in a single guest, but it is about to become the most highly valued hotel in the U.S. after a Chinese insurer agreed to buy it for more than $230 million.

Sunshine Insurance Group Co. is paying real-estate mogul Barry Sternlicht's firm and a partner more than $2 million a room for the Midtown Manhattan property, according to people familiar with the matter.

One person said the valuation beats the previous record set by the Plaza Hotel, the New York landmark that was sold in 2012 to India's Sahara Group for $2.04 million a room, according to hotel data tracker STR Analytics.

The Baccarat is the latest trophy property to wind up in the hands of Chinese investors in recent months as buyers take advantage of new rules allowing them to invest more easily abroad. Real-estate brokers and analysts said Chinese companies see luxury hotels, especially in major global cities, as long-term investments that can provide steady income in a period of low interest rates. Moreover, some say the properties confer prestige on their owners.

"Chinese insurers are buying for 50 or 100 years, and they are not worried about value going down in markets like New York," said Ryan Meliker, hotel analyst for investment bank MLV & Co. "It's a great place to park money long term."

China's Anbang Insurance Group Co. in October agreed to pay $1.95 billion to Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc. for the famed Waldorf-Astoria on New York's Park Avenue. China property investor Dalian Wanda Group Co. put $900 million last year toward a Chicago skyscraper with a luxury hotel. Chinese investors also have bought hotels in Sydney, Washington and Los Angeles in the past year.

Real-estate broker JLL estimates Chinese companies will spend more than $5 billion on overseas hotel investments this year, up from $920 million last year and $130 million in 2012.

The Chinese government's recent liberalization of rules that had limited corporate investments abroad is helping to fuel the buying, said Gilda Perez-Alvarado, head of the Americas for JLL's global hotel group.

Under the new rules, Chinese firms can invest up to $1 billion without seeking government approval, up from $100 million before last year's changes.

Mr. Sternlicht's Starwood Capital Group LLC built the luxury hotel and high-end condominium project with Tribeca Associates, a New York real-estate developer. The two haven't disclosed how much they spent on the project. Starwood, which acquired French crystal maker Baccarat in 2005, will continue to manage its namesake hotel.

Mr. Sternlicht founded Starwood in 1991, and it has expanded into one of the world's largest real-estate investment firms. He also was chief executive of Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. before leaving the company in 2005.

The opulent 114-room property features 15,000 pieces of crystal stemware and 17 chandeliers from France's Baccarat factory. Minibars are stuffed with treats from Parisian gourmet shop Fauchon, and the property features a spa offering six kinds of facials. Suites are expected to fetch up to $18,000 a night.

The Baccarat is slated to open its doors next month. It is rare for a buyer to commit to a luxury property that has no track record and no guarantee it can get the $900 to $1,000 a night that Starwood plans to charge for standard rooms.

That makes it a more speculative investment than the Plaza Hotel, which has been operating for more than a century.

"This only occurs in very robust market conditions," said Sean Hennessey, chief executive officer of Lodging Advisors, a hotel-consulting firm. Because hotels aren't preleased like office buildings, the risk of filling the guest rooms now falls to the new owner, rather than the developer, he said.

Some brokers said that if the Baccarat can charge what it hopes, the hotel could be valued at more than what Sunshine is paying. Hotels also are the most resistant type of property to inflation because room rates can be reset at any time.

A luxury hotel like the Baccarat should produce annual adjusted operating income of about 3% to 4% of the purchase price, or roughly twice the yield of 10-year U.S. Treasury notes, said Mr. Meliker, the MLV analyst.

There are also strategic reasons for closely held Sunshine to buy before the opening, Mr. Hennessey said. The company gets a new asset in a crucial market without having to wait years to develop a similar property.

This isn't the first wave of foreign buying of trophy U.S. commercial properties. Japanese conglomerates were big buyers during the 1980s, and there has been a steady stream in recent years of petrodollars from Middle Eastern and Asian government funds.

Chinese insurers have been particularly active buying hotels and other real estate overseas. Only about 1% of these insurers' assets are in real estate, said JLL's Ms. Perez-Alvarado, who expects that number to climb closer to the 4% she says is more common among Western insurers.

Sunshine was established in 2005 as a property and casualty insurer, later adding a life-insurance unit and asset-management arm. Its website says the company has more than 130 million customers. In November, Sunshine agreed to pay $380 million for a Sheraton hotel in Sydney.

The Baccarat sale would follow a record-breaking year for the hospitality industry. U.S. hotels had their highest-ever average daily rate of $115 a night and revenue per available room of $74, according to STR. Leisure travel remained robust, while group travel rebounded 4.4% in 2014 after a 0.7% decline the year before.

Scott Berman, head of the hospitality group for PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC, said 2015 looks just as strong. He points to an improving U.S. economy aided by falling oil prices, continued strength in business travel and limited new supply in most cities.

In 2013, foreign buyers invested $229 million in Manhattan hotels, just 12% of the total investment that year. Last year, foreign investors accounted for $1.9 billion, or 58%, of Manhattan's total hotel investment, according to JLL.

The Waldorf Astoria sale alone would match all of last year's foreign hotel investment in Manhattan. Anbang is expected to close its deal to acquire the landmark property sometime during the first quarter, according to people familiar with the matter. The $1.95 billion price tag, or about $1.4 million a room, would be the highest overall price paid for a U.S. hotel. Broker Eastdil Secured advised the sellers on the Baccarat and Waldorf sales.

Moody's Faces More Inquiries On Ratings

Multiple states are probing how Moody's Investors Service graded bonds before the 2008 financial crisis as scrutiny of the second-largest U.S. ratings company increases, according to people familiar with the matter.

The reviews are in early stages and it isn't known yet whether the discussions will lead to any action, these people said. The broad assessment of Moody's business practices includes states other than Connecticut and Mississippi, which previously filed lawsuits against Moody's arguing the firm inflated mortgage-bond ratings to win business.

A Moody's spokesman declined to comment about the potential of other state cases.

Moody's shares jumped 5.1% on Friday as the company reported a 14% rise in fourth-quarter earnings compared with a year earlier, topping analysts' expectations. Revenue in the period ended Dec. 31 rose 13% to $877.5 million.

The interest from multiple states, which hadn't previously been reported, is the latest example of how attention is shifting to Moody's in the wake of a record industry settlement reached this past week with larger rival Standard & Poor's Ratings Services.

S&P agreed to pay $1.5 billion to end more than 20 lawsuits from the Justice Department, various states and the country's largest public pension fund alleging the firm compromised standards.

Investors rely on the bond grades issued by Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch Ratings. Collectively, they issue about 95% of ratings.

In recent months the Justice Department quietly ramped up a separate investigation of Moody's as it met with multiple former executives to discuss how they rated complex securities before the financial crisis, said people familiar with the situation.

It is unclear whether the federal investigation will result in a lawsuit, the people said.

On a fourth-quarter earnings conference call held Friday, Moody's Chief Executive Raymond McDaniel declined to discuss the Justice Department inquiry and told analysts that no new lawsuits against the company had been filed since 2013. The suits under way, which include cases brought by the attorneys general offices of Connecticut and Mississippi and the California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers, are in the early stages, he said.

"There's not a lot of new news on the litigation front," Mr. McDaniel said. A company spokesman added: "We continue to believe the states' and Calpers cases are without merit as to Moody's."

The Moody's Investors Service debt-rating unit reported $565.1 million in revenue for the fourth quarter, an increase of 7%. Meanwhile, its analytics unit, which accounts for about one-third of revenue, rose 23% to $312.4 million.

Moody's also got an earnings boost from paying a lower corporate tax rate of 28.1% in the fourth quarter, compared with 30.6% a year earlier.

New York s Baccarat Hotel Fetches Record Valuation From Chinese Buyer; China s Sunshine Insurance Group to Pay More Than $2 Million Per Room

Some brokers said that if the Baccarat can charge what it hopes, the hotel could be valued at more than what Sunshine is paying. Hotels also are the most resistant type of property to inflation because room rates can be reset at any time.

A luxury hotel like the Baccarat should produce annual adjusted operating income of about 3% to 4% of the purchase price, or roughly twice the yield of 10-year U.S. Treasury notes, said Mr. Meliker, the MLV analyst.

There are also strategic reasons for closely held Sunshine to buy before the opening, Mr. Hennessey said. The company gets a new asset in a crucial market without having to wait years to develop a similar property.

This isn't the first wave of foreign buying of trophy U.S. commercial properties. Japanese conglomerates were big buyers during the 1980s, and there has been a steady stream in recent years of petrodollars from Middle Eastern and Asian government funds.

Chinese insurers have been particularly active buying hotels and other real estate overseas. Only about 1% of these insurers' assets are in real estate, said JLL's Ms. Perez-Alvarado, who expects that number to climb closer to the 4% she says is more common among Western insurers.

Sunshine was established in 2005 as a property and casualty insurer, later adding a life-insurance unit and asset-management arm. Its website says the company has more than 130 million customers. In November, Sunshine agreed to pay $380 million for a Sheraton hotel in Sydney.

The Baccarat sale would follow a record-breaking year for the hospitality industry. U.S. hotels had their highest-ever average daily rate of $115 a night and revenue per available room of $74, according to STR. Leisure travel remained robust, while group travel rebounded 4.4% in 2014 after a 0.7% decline the year before.

Scott Berman, head of the hospitality group for PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC, said 2015 looks just as strong. He points to an improving U.S. economy aided by falling oil prices, continued strength in business travel and limited new supply in most cities.

In 2013, foreign buyers invested $229 million in Manhattan hotels, just 12% of the total investment that year. Last year, foreign investors accounted for $1.9 billion, or 58%, of Manhattan's total hotel investment, according to JLL.

The Waldorf Astoria sale alone would match all of last year's foreign hotel investment in Manhattan. Anbang is expected to close its deal to acquire the landmark property sometime during the first quarter, according to people familiar with the matter. The $1.95 billion price tag, or about $1.4 million a room, would be the highest overall price paid for a U.S. hotel. Broker Eastdil Secured advised the sellers on the Baccarat and Waldorf sales.

Financial companies are using new technologies to create detailed 'proxy' credit profiles of borrowers, raising concerns that the tactics could widen the gap between the rich and poor. By Tracy Alloway

In late 2008, Kevin Johnson returned to his home in Atlanta, Georgia, after a honeymoon abroad to find the financial system imploding and a letter from his credit card company in his postbox.

American Express was cutting his credit limit from $10,800 to $3,800. The reason, according to the letter, was that Mr Johnson had been shopping at stores frequented by people deemed by the credit card company to have a poor repayment history.

For Mr Johnson, who prides himself on being a media and internet entrepreneur, the notion that he would be financially limited because of the supposed behaviour of his fellow shoppers did not sit well at all. At the time, says Mr Johnson, his FICO score - the standard measure of creditworthiness in the US - was about 760, solidly within good credit territory.

"It was a sort of wake-up call," Mr Johnson says. "The financial crisis created a wonderful opportunity for companies to apply some of these insidious algorithms to deny credit to people who are deserving of credit."

Mr Johnson, an African-American, went public with the letter, prompting a debate about whether such credit profiling was fair. Amex abandoned it, and a provision mandating further study of the practice was inserted into the Credit Card Act passed by President Barack Obama in 2009.

Six years later, financial companies have the option of using data-guzzling technologies that make the observation of shopping habits look downright primitive. A plethora of information gathered from social media, digital data brokers and online trails can be used to mathematically determine the creditworthiness of individuals, or to market products specifically targeted to them.

The degree to which such algorithms are utilised by mainstream banks and credit card companies is unclear, as are their inputs, calculations and the resulting scores. While many types of data-driven algorithms have been criticised for opacity and intrusiveness, the use of digital scorecards in finance raises additional issues of fairness. Using such information to make predictions about borrowers can, critics say, become self-fulfilling, hardening the lines between the wealthy and poor by denying credit to those who are already associated with not having access to it.

"You can get in a death spiral simply by making one wrong move, when algorithms amplify a bad data point and cause cascading effects," says Frank Pasquale, a professor of law at University of Maryland and author of a book on algorithms called The Black Box Society .

Proponents of such technology argue that the ability to get a comprehensive view of prospective customers - based on their friends, their employer and even their exercise habits - can ultimately help expand the availability of credit to those who struggle to open bank accounts or obtain fair loans.

"When consumers are spending in a pattern that leads them to lose a little bit of control of their finances, are they able to get back on track and how? That's the kind of data we can get from the big data world," says Alex Sion, president of Moven, which provides debit accounts to customers who want to keep better track of their spending habits.

Both sides agree that new data-centric underwriting methods and algorithmic scoring pose legal questions at a time when the gap between rich and poor has become a hot-button political issue.

"It's just such a big grey area right now," says Galen Buckwalter, the scientist who helped develop the matching engine of dating website eHarmony and who is now at Payoff, an alternative lender. "The genie is out of the bottle, there's no going back in terms of pulling this information or telling companies they can't be analysing click times, even typing patterns and things like that."

The 1935 map of Greater Atlanta in the National Archives comes in shades of blue, yellow and red. The hand-scrawled legend that accompanies it reads "light blue - best, dark blue - still desirable, yellow - definitely declining, red - hazardous".

It is a stark reminder of a dark period in US history, when potential borrowers were classified not by their individual credit characteristics but by the neighbourhoods in which they lived.

The "redlined" neighbourhoods were often poor and dominated by a racial or ethnic group. In the case of Atlanta and other cities in the segregated South, the aim of the practice was often to keep African-Americans from moving into neighbourhoods dominated by whites.

The practice of redlining has since been outlawed with a slew of regulation, including fair lending and equal credit opportunity laws. But the worry is that redlining in the 21st century may not be done overtly with ink and paper but with the information that flows through computers and across the internet.

While US law forbids the discrimination of borrowers based on factors such as gender or race, parsing publicly available information on social networks such as Facebook and Twitter has been shown capable of accurately predicting everything from users' political inclination to ethnicity and sexual orientation.

Chief among critics' concerns is the ability to use new types of data and computerised algorthims to build "proxies" that do not overtly discriminate on the basis of factors such as race or gender, but may use correlated information to build an in-depth profile of a particular customer.

"Now you have data, you can predict anything," says Max Gasner, founder of One Financial, a retail financial services start-up. "You can use your Facebook and Twitter data to tell what race you are, whether you're gay or straight . You can predict a lot of stuff that's illegal to use for lending and you can also more finely discriminate."

Sifting through "clickstream" data or using "web beacons" that allow companies to track the movement of users across the internet can offer valuable clues about a person's identity or socioeconomic status simply by observing how they access and navigate the web. For example, studies from the Pew Research Center and the Federal Reserve found that blacks and Latinos were far more likely to access bank accounts using a mobile phone, giving an indication of racial identity simply by looking at how people browse the web.

"Because big data scores use undisclosed algorithms, it is impossible to analyse the algorithm for potential racial discriminatory impact," the National Consumer Law Center wrote in a recent paper on big data .

In addition to the algorithms themselves, the laws that govern big data's use in lending remain murky.

"When it comes to big data, there is no clear prohibition on using data for underwriting," says Anand Raman, partner at law firm Skadden, Arps. "It can become a fair lending issue, however, if the use of that data results in disproportionate negative outcomes for members of a protected class."

It is this fear of regulatory scrutiny that has left many of the big banks and credit card companies believed to be experimenting with new data reluctant to dive wholeheartedly into the world of non-traditional credit information.

"All the credit card companies have really been both attracted to, and afraid of, social data," said a former data miner at one of the largest credit card companies. Financial groups that do overtly use big data to inform their underwriting may face "headline risk or could be construed as discriminatory", in a manner similar to the fallout caused by Mr Johnson's letter in 2008, he said.

Instead, use of non-traditional information has so far been publicly undertaken mostly by a crop of start-ups that say their goal is to use the smorgasbord of information now available to extend credit in a more efficient way, or to those lacking traditional credit information.

Peer-to-peer lenders that use the internet to directly connect borrowers with lenders are a prominent example; many use social media and other types of non-traditional data to augment their underwriting processes or prevent fraud - for instance, automatically verifying a loan applicant's employment against their LinkedIn profile.

Analysing social networks may allow lenders to guess not only a loan applicant's race and socioeconomic status but also their comparative customer loyalty. Likewise, examining the way applicants click through web pages can give hints about character traits such as impulsiveness. The use of wearable technologies, which can track everything from exercise habits to heart rate, is also opening up an other realm of information for data-hungry lenders.

"If you are an organised, conscientious person who has good habits you'll probably do well in credit," said Andy Wen, vice-president of behavioural sciences at Payoff. "These things tend to correlate and if you can see organised behaviour in one area of life, you would think that would carry over to credit."

Such companies are adamant that using behavioural data will expand credit to those who might otherwise be denied it. Moreover, many say using such information can remove subjectivity from an underwriting process that historically involved being sized up in person by a loan officer at a bricks-and-mortar bank branch.

"If you look at what big data is, it's essentially the use of objective information," says Mr Raman. "One can certainly argue that it's better from a fair-lending risk perspective to use that sort of objective information than to rely on judgment or discretion."

Some say big data and algorithm-driven consumer scoring may find its greatest use in marketing financial products, rather than underwriting them. Nielsen Prizm looks at postcodes to classify customers into categories ranging from "upper crust" to "low-rise living" - a group it describes as a "transient" world of "ethnically diverse" singles and single parents. The use of such precise targeting means that those lumped in with an undesirable group may never get a chance at a certain loan or financial product simply because they may never see them advertised.

The NCLC report found that credit products sold on the basis of non-traditional data-led processes offered annual percentage rates of 134 per cent to 748 per cent - triple-digit figures more typical of payday loans than credit cards.

"These technologies always get billed as, 'we've found a new way to bring people with thin credit histories into the system'," says Mr Pasquale. "I have suspicions about that. My sense is you're just going to see a hardening of existing credit castes."

Mr Sion at Moven says that using information from social networks and other non-traditional data sources may personalise algorithms that otherwise rely on more detached data to judge the behaviour of an individual borrower. "The social data brings it back to the person," he says. "At the end of the day if you're a bad risk, you're a bad risk."

In Atlanta, Mr Johnson says he is ultimately hopeful that new technology can be used to create opportunities for borrowers without exacerbating biases against them.

"There's an upside and there's a downside," Mr Johnson says. "My experience is a very real story of how there is a downside and how, often, a lot of people don't even know there is a downside."

Algorithmic data

New scoring systems in need of legal definition

By the mid-1950s, William Fair and Earl Isaac began selling the first data-driven consumer scoring system to an investment company based in St Louis, Missouri. Their "FICO" scores - an abbreviation of the Fair Isaac Corporation name - would grow in tandem with the powers of computers to become ubiquitous in US lending.

In 1995 Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, the US government's housing finance agencies, endorsed the use of credit scores as part of the mortgage underwriting process, embedding them in the fabric of the American financial system. By 2000, FICO scores were used in more than 75 per cent of home mortgage originations. In 2015, Fair Isaac says its scores are used in more than 90 per cent of lending decisions.

For decades, the scores were shrouded in secrecy and their details largely unknown to the borrowers whose credit they often dictated. It was not until 2004 that the US government required consumer reporting agencies to provide extensive credit score information at customers' request.

In a report commissioned by the World Privacy Forum , Pam Dixon and Bob Gellman argue that new algorithm-driven consumer scores occupy a murky legal position similar to the one occupied by FICO scores in the 1950s.

"Data brokers, merchants, government entities and others can create or use a consumer score without notice to consumers," they wrote. "Laws governing credit scores do not typically extend protection to the new consumer scores."

For many lenderss, gathering non-traditional data is simply an attempt to augment or supplant traditional credit scoring models that still rely largely on historical information, which critics view as an imperfect indicator of creditworthiness. The biggest component of a FICO score is payment history. Such historical measures are considered ripe for disruption by new methodologies.

"The FICO score is creating false positives and false negatives," says Mitch Jacobs, founder of OnDeck, an alternative lender that uses its own data-fuelled system to make small business loans. "A business might have been around for 10 years and have lots of customers and good cash flow but it looks like a bad credit."

Anthem Health Insurer Hit by Big Data  Breach

Anthem Inc., the country's second-biggest health insurer, said hackers broke into a database containing personal information for about 80 million of its customers and employees in what is likely to be the largest data breach disclosed by a health-care company.

Investigators are still determining the extent of the incursion, which was discovered last week, and Anthem said it is likely that "tens of millions" of records were stolen. The health insurer said the breach exposed names, birthdays, addresses and Social Security numbers but doesn't appear to involve medical information or financial details such as credit-card or bank-account numbers, nor are there signs the data are being sold on the black market.

Anthem, which offers Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in California, New York and other states, said it doesn't know precisely how many people may be affected. So far, it appears that the attack detected last week is the only breach of Anthem's systems, and it isn't yet clear how the hackers were able to obtain the identification information needed to access the database said Thomas Miller, the insurer's chief information officer.

The insurer said it would reach out to everyone whose information was stored in the hacked database with a letter and, where possible, email. It is also setting up an informational website and will offer to provide a credit-monitoring service.

Its decision to reveal the attack days after its discovery, even as the investigation is getting under way, may signal a changing attitude among corporate executives about rapid disclosures in the wake of breaches of companies including Target Corp., Home Depot Inc. and Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc.

Anthem detected the breach itself, which puts it in the minority among companies subject to such attacks, and "organizations don't typically provide notification this early on," said David Damato, managing director at FireEye Inc., owner of cybersecurity unit Mandiant, which Anthem has hired to investigate.

When hackers intruded on servers at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. this summer, the incident was reported by media outlets weeks after the bank had learned there was an issue. The bank has said previously that only contact information was compromised and it has seen no fraud associated with the event.

Anthem's Mr. Miller said the company wanted "to share the information as soon as possible." Federal law requires health-care companies to inform consumers and regulators when they suffer a data breach involving personally identifiable information, but they have as many as 60 days after the discovery of an attack to report it.

Anthem, based in Indianapolis and formerly known as WellPoint, covers around 37.5 million people. The hacked database included information for some current and former customers as well as its own employees; it also held medical and financial details, but the insurer said those details don't appear to be included in the data stolen by the hackers.

The Anthem incident could rank among the largest of recent attacks. The J.P. Morgan breach compromised contact information for about 76 million households. Home Depot has said 56 million credit-card accounts were compromised, and 53 million customer email addresses stolen. Target's cyberattack affected 40 million payment cards. Both retailers offered credit monitoring after the fact and banks typically reimburse consumers for fraudulent charges resulting from a data breach.

Daniel Nutkis, chief executive of the Health Information Trust Alliance, a nonprofit that helps health-care companies with computer security, said the largest previously known hacker theft from a health-care company was last year's intrusion at hospital operator Community Health Systems Inc., which involved records on 4.5 million consumers. In that case, the company said it regretted the breach and pointed to a group originating from China for the attack. Much of the sector remains vulnerable, and few have the ability to detect and respond to an attack as Anthem has, he said, though the alliance has already started warning other health-care companies about what happened to the big insurer.

Mr. Damato, of FireEye, said the firm has seen more cyberattacks specifically targeting health-care concerns. Health companies often hold rich stores of consumer data, including sensitive details of people's prescriptions, care and illnesses.

He said the Anthem attack was "sophisticated" and used techniques that appeared to have been customized, rather than broadly available tools, and were "very advanced." Investigators haven't yet concluded who was behind the Anthem breach. Community Health Systems, for one, said it believed its incursion originated in China.

Anthem's Mr. Miller said the first sign of the attack came in the middle of last week, when a systems administrator noticed that a database query was being run using his identifier code although he hadn't initiated it. Anthem quickly determined that an attack had occurred, he said, informed the Federal Bureau of Investigation and hired Mandiant.

Investigators tracked the hacked data to an outside Web-storage service and were able to freeze it there, but it isn't yet clear if the hackers were able to earlier remove it to another location, Mr. Miller said. The Web storage service used by the hackers, which Mr. Miller declined to name, was one that is commonly used by U.S. companies, which may have made the initial data theft harder to detect.

A spokesman for the FBI said the agency is "aware of the Anthem intrusion and is investigating the matter" and praised the insurer for its "initial response in promptly notifying the FBI."

In the wake of the attack, Anthem has reset the passwords of all employees with higher-level access to its data systems, and has blocked all access that involves only one password, Mr. Miller said.

Anthem said it doesn't expect the incident to affect its 2015 financial outlook, "primarily as a result of normal contingency planning and preparation."

Wednesday's Markets
Dow's Gain Fades After ECB Move

The Dow abruptly gave up a 116-point gain to end little changed, after the European Central Bank increased pressure on the new Greek government to come to terms with its creditors.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average finished the session up 6.62 points, or less than 0.1%, to 17673.02.

The blue-chip index found support from stronger-than-expected results at Walt Disney, whose shares advanced $7.18, or 7.6%, to $101.28. Without Disney's gain -- which contributed 46 points to the Dow -- the index would have fallen on the day.

The S&P 500 fell 8.52 points, or 0.4%, to 2041.51, and the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 11.03 points, or 0.2%, to 4716.70.

Overseas early Thursday, Japan's Nikkei was down 1%, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index was up 0.2% and the Shanghai composite was up 0.2%.

For the most part, Wednesday's U.S. session was a quiet one, traders said. Stocks drifted for most of the day, with the Dow up less than 1% at its afternoon peak.

Those gains largely evaporated after the ECB said it would no longer accept Greek public securities as collateral for central-bank loans.

The announcement came as Greece's government seeks to ease conditions on its bailout program. Most investors believe a deal will be reached and a crisis will be averted. But as was the case Wednesday, the talks could produce headlines that jolt the markets.

Wednesday's news "reinforces the uncertainty that was introduced with the Greek elections," said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments, which manages about $45.6 billion. "The overtures from the new Greek government were encouraging in that there would be some kind of resolution, possibly a restructuring of Greek debt . . . now the ECB's comments suggest that it is far from certain."

Also weighing on stocks was a fresh decline in oil prices. U.S. crude-oil futures tumbled $4.60, or 8.7%, to $48.45 a barrel, snapping a four-session streak of gains. Energy stocks fell 1.6%, down the most among the S&P 500 sectors.

Traders said recent swings in the market have been driven by broad bets on baskets of stocks such as exchange-traded funds, rather than individual securities. In the background, investors have been taking their cues from moves in oil prices and currencies, as well as political developments overseas, such as the Greek government's talks with its creditors.

"It seems like there's an inordinate amount of uncertainty in the world," said Michael Fredericks, portfolio manager of the BlackRock Multi-Asset Income Fund, which has $10.2 billion under management. "It's hard to have a lot of conviction."

Corporate earnings also remained a focus for many investors on Wednesday.

With more than half of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported fourth-quarter earnings, profits are on track to rise 3% from the year-earlier quarter, according to FactSet. Analysts had expected earnings growth of 1.1%, the slowest pace of growth since the third quarter of 2012, due to the impact of declining oil prices and a stronger dollar.

On Wednesday, Merck said its sales dropped in the fourth quarter, pressured by a stronger U.S. dollar and patent expirations. Shares of the pharmaceutical company slipped 1.97, or 3.2%, to 59.05.

General Motors said fourth-quarter profit surged 91%, beating analysts' expectations. The company said it plans to boost its dividend starting in the second quarter. Its shares rose 1.85, or 5.4%, to 35.83.

In economic news, private payrolls increased by 213,000 in January, according to a report compiled by payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody'sAnalytics. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected payrolls to increase by 240,000.

Still, the overall employment trend remains positive, investors said.

"The economy is expanding, the private sector is adding jobs, and that's good news" for stocks, said Matthew Kaufler, who oversees about $2 billion in assets as a portfolio manager at Federated Investors.

The euro fell against the dollar, trading at 1.1344 late Wednesday, down from $1.1480 on Tuesday. For the year, the euro has declined 6.2% against the dollar.

European stocks rose, with France's CAC-40 up 0.4% and Germany's DAX 30 gaining 0.2%.

In other markets, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1,263.80 an ounce.

The yield on the 10-year note rose to 1.794%, from 1.781% Tuesday. Yields rise as prices fall.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average abruptly gave up a 116-point gain to end little changed Wednesday after the European Central Bank increased pressure on the new Greek government to come to terms with its creditors.

The Dow added 6.62 points, or less than 0.1%, to close at 17673.02.

The blue-chip index was boosted by stronger-than-expected results at Walt Disney Co., which saw its shares rally 7.6%. The Dow is a price-weighted index which tends to be influenced by pricier components such as Disney.

The S&P 500 fell 8.52 points, or 0.4%, to 2041.51, and the Nasdaq Composite Index lost 11.03 points, or 0.2%, to 4716.70.

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/ecb-suspends-greek-banks-waiver-for-regular-lending-facilities-1423083467". Greek banks will still have access to funds through the ECB's emergency lending program. The announcement comes as "http://www.wsj.com/articles/greek-leaders-meet-with-skeptical-leaders-in-europe-1423043354".

 It reinforces the uncertainty that was introduced with the Greek elections," said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments, which manages about $45.6 billion.  The overtures from the new Greek government were encouraging in that there would be some kind of resolution, possibly a restructuring of Greek debt...now the ECB's comments suggest that it is far from certain," he added.

Traders said stock moves in recent weeks have been driven by bets on indexes rather than on individual stocks. That comes amid an increased focus on moves in oil prices and currencies, as well as political developments overseas, such as the new Greek government's talks with its creditors, which are overshadowing fourth-quarter earnings, they said.

 It seems like there's an inordinate amount of uncertainty in the world," said Michael Fredericks, portfolio manager of the BlackRock Multi-Asset Income Fund, which has $10.2 billion under management.  It's hard to have a lot of conviction."

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-holds-on-to-bulk-of-recent-gains-1423031216", snapping a four-session streak of gains. Energy stocks fell 1.6%, down the most on the S&P 500.

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/dollar-rises-against-euro-ahead-of-u-s-jobs-report-1423079207", trading at $1.1360 versus $1.1480 on Tuesday. For the year, the euro has declined 6.1% against the dollar.

Several companies have noted the broad strength in the U.S. dollar as they report earnings. On Wednesday, Merck & Co. said its sales fell in the fourth quarter, pressured by a stronger U.S. dollar and patent expirations. Shares slipped 3.2%.

Justin Wiggs, a trader at Stifel Nicolaus, noted that companies blamed the weather for weak earnings during 2013's fourth quarter. After the early-year pullback in 2014, stocks continued to grind higher.

 This year, we're explaining them away with currency moves," he said, referring to weak earnings.  The excuse is different, but is it the same game?"

Investors continued to watch international developments, especially in Greece. European stocks rose, with France's CAC 40 up 0.4% and Germany's DAX 30 gaining 0.2%.

 We're in a period where the market is really thrashing around," said Jeff Morris, head of U.S. equities at Standard Life Investments.  It has to do a balancing act between those portions of the U.S. economy showing genuine strength and recovery and international influences," such as global growth concerns, he added.

Back in the U.S., consumer discretionary stocks rose the most on the S&P 500, up 0.7%.

Mr. Fredericks of BlackRock said he's attracted to sectors of the stock market that could benefit from increased consumer spending, such as some retailers and auto companies. But overall, he said he has reduced stock exposure in his fund this year amid increased international headwinds, high U.S. valuations and a slowdown in earnings growth.

Among individual stocks, car maker General Motors Co. said "http://www.wsj.com/articles/gm-posts-higher-than-expected-profit-1423053614". The company said it plans to boost its dividend starting in the second quarter. Shares rose 5.4%.

Staples Inc. agreed to buy Office Depot Inc. for $6.3 billion. Shares of Staples fell 12%, while those of Office Depot added 2.2%.

In economic news, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/adp-report-says-private-businesses-added-213-000-jobs-in-january-1423056391", according to a report compiled by payroll processor Automatic Data Processing Inc. and forecasting firm Moody'sAnalytics. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal had expected payrolls to increase by 240,000.

Still, the overall employment trend remains positive, investors said.

 The economy is expanding, the private sector is adding jobs, and that's good news" for stocks, said Matthew Kaufler, who oversees about $2 billion as a portfolio manager at Federated Investors.  With the economy on firmer footing, inflation expectations subdued, corporations returning capital aggressively to shareholders, those all point to an attractive environment for equities," he added.

The ADP report is often viewed as an indicator for Friday's closely watched jobs report, which is expected to show the economy added 237,000 jobs in January, according to economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal.

In other markets, gold futures rose 0.3% to $1263.80 an ounce. The yield on the 10-year note rose to 1.794%. Yields rise as prices fall.

Imagine if your bank sent you a financial health evaluation every morning, predicting how likely you were to go overdrawn that month; or tracked the stores where you spent money and sent you some discount offers. As lenders start to harness the power of big data, these ideas are close to becoming reality for many consumers.

"Big data is a big opportunity, but we've got to sort a lot of things out along the way," says Greg Baxter, global head of digital strategy at Citigroup.

Banks are held back by concerns over privacy and technical challenges. As an example of a privacy issue, Mr Baxter says banks could use data about people from social media - such as who is in their circle of contacts - to decide whether to grant them a loan.

In the UK, Santander and Lloyds Banking Group are teaming with retailers to offer personalised discounts to customers through their smartphone apps, based on individual spending patterns. They are examining possibilities in areas such as wealth management and corporate banking. Martin Arnold

Insurers' use of big data  will not empower all consumers

Trend for sophisticated tech to assess policy holders' riskiness has a flipside

Like many young British drivers Denise Smith was paying the price for her youth. Considered risky by her insurer, the 27-year-old from the Cornish town of Hayle was paying 700 a year for her car insurance, one of her biggest expenses.

Then she downloaded a "telematics" app on her mobile phone, which allowed the insurer Aviva to monitor her driving habits. Despite now having a bigger car, the technology has cut her insurance bill by 300.

"I've gone up in engine size - and the insurance costs less," she says.

Car insurance is one of the many types of cover being transformed by technological advances. Access to new data is changing the way the industry assesses customers and prices policies - a shift that may benefit some consumers such as Ms Smith, but can hinder others.

Supermarkets with insurance spin-offs are tracking shopping habits, giving premium discounts to customers they deem less risky. Health insurers in the US have begun offering wristbands to show how much policy holders exercise.

The industry is even examining the use of home telematics: fitting sensors in boilers to check whether occupiers keep their homes at a sufficient temperature to prevent burst pipes.

" Access to data is changing a lot - and not only that, but there are the tools available and the technology to exploit it," says Wendy Seago, pricing and analytics director at Aviva.

The reams of statistics the industry can now gather about how consumers behave - and more sophisticated techniques to analyse them - should mean insurers can rely less on crude "rating factors", such as age or marital status.

They are able to make more intelligent assessments of each policy holder's riskiness. "We are increasingly able to remove proxies or guesses which, at times, can be wrong," says Paul Evans , chief executive of Axa UK, the insurer.

Companies with access only to smaller data pools, or those that have inferior analysis techniques, will increasingly find themselves at a disadvantage.

Yet the technological advances should, overall, be positive for the industry - potentially reducing both fraudulent and genuine claims. Insurers are investing heavily to gain an edge.

In Canada, the insurer Allstate is offering policy holders discounts of as much as 25 per cent if they install equipment that controls thermostats and monitors for smoke, carbon monoxide and water leaks.

The biggest global market for telematics is Italy, where the technology has helped insurers tackle relatively high levels of fraud. Almost a third of policies sold by Generali, the country's largest insurer, are telematics-based.

Take-up elsewhere has been more limited, although is growing steadily. Across Europe, insurers sold 4.56m telematics policies last year - up from 1.9m two years previously, according to the consultancy Ptolemus.

The trend could have knock-on social benefits, such as improved health. Medical insurers are starting to monitor exercise habits through wearable devices, giving policy holders a financial incentive to become more active.

The shift is also, to an extent, handing power back to consumers: they are now able to influence the price they pay by changing how they behave.

Previously, customers' perceived riskiness depended largely on their peers. For instance, drivers who live in areas where insurers have received high numbers of claims have historically been hit with more expensive premiums.

Through telematics, responsible motorists should have a chance to demonstrate they do not pose the same risk as their neighbours.

Armed with more data, underwriters may be more willing to write policies for those they have previously shunned.

"This is very powerful," says Mario Greco , chief executive of Generali, which is planning to roll out telematics technology in more markets outside Italy, including Germany this year. "If you want to pay less as a good driver, you have to show you are a good driver."

Yet the big data trend has a flipside. Consumers who present "bad risks" face being charged more or left without any affordable cover.

"For every great risk there's a customer that's going to be a bad risk," says Mr Evans of Axa.

Insurance buyers could be deemed commercially unattractive because of their own behaviour: they drive badly, drink too much or fail to exercise.

More problematically, they could find themselves shunned by insurers because of factors over which they have no control, such as their DNA.

Under a moratorium that expires in 2017, insurers in the UK have agreed not to use predictive genetic test results to price policies. Yet in other areas, there are already signs that more sophisticated use of data is working against some insurance buyers.

Flood cover, for instance, is increasingly unaffordable for some homeowners. Underwriters are combining detailed digital maps with climate data to better assess flood risk.

There are limits to insurers' data mining. Technology costs remain a barrier and consumers can be reluctant to hand over sensitive personal information unless they have clear incentives.

While young drivers such as Ms Smith can shave hundreds of pounds from their car insurance by installing telematics, the typical saving for her middle-aged peers in Britain is estimated to run only into the tens of pounds.

"For them, it's just not compelling enough," says Murray Raisbeck, partner at KPMG.

Across Europe, telematics accounted for only 1.6 per cent of the personal and commercial insurance market last year, the same level as North America, according to Ptolemus. The consultancy estimates the proportions will rise to about 5 per cent in Europe and almost 7 per cent in North America over the next three years.

Even if consumers are receptive to giving insurers more data to lower their premiums, there is only so much the industry can do with it.

"It's allowing us to average less and provide more precision, but there's still lots of averaging," says Mr Evans. "There's lots of factors that you can't model." As Ms Seago of Aviva puts it: "We can never know everything."

Emerging markets

Personality tests can help to assess loan risk

A mini-boom in psychometric testing is improving financial inclusion in emerging markets, providing an alternative for loan applicants who do not have traditional credit records.

Companies such as VisualDNA, a psychometric tester in London, and Entrepreneurial Finance Labs (EFL), a US company, are helping bring banking to the "unbanked".

Schemes are up and running in Peru, India and other countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia.

"We are doing something completely different, that is actually a sensible way to evaluate risk," says Bailey Klinger, chief executive officer of EFL Global.

EFL says lenders using its screening tool have shown up to a 50 per cent reduction in default.

Tests aim to assess applicants' creditworthiness by revealing personality traits with questions that have no obvious right answer.

Insurers warned to use big data  responsibly

The insurance industry risks sparking a regulatory crackdown unless it takes "great care" to ensure its use of personal data does not leave some people without affordable cover, the head of Britain's trade body has warned.

Paul Evans , chairman of the Association of British Insurers, said the sector was locked in a data-gathering arms race, with companies seeking ever more information to help predict whether individual policyholders were likely to put in claims.

Big data techniques include monitoring driver behaviour through vehicle telematics - data recorders in cars - and assessing financial responsibility by scrutinising bank accounts and bill -payments.

Insurance companies insist this analysis allows them to offer some customers better deals and is not aimed at disadvantaging those deemed more likely to claim. But Mr Evans acknowledged that ultimately the trend was likely to mean "higher-risk customers will see higher prices".

"The industry will have to take great care to ensure we're not creating, because of big data, sectors of society that can't buy insurance," said Mr Evans, who also heads Axa UK.

Mr Evans said more individualised policy pricing could be considered fair if "those who are better behaved [such as safer drivers] are no longer subsidising those who are not". The industry should "anticipate regulators" by developing its own code of conduct on how to use data responsibly. "Let's ensure we don't fall into any pitfalls," he said.

The European insurance industry is lobbying against data protection rules being drawn up in Brussels because they would allow policyholders to demand the removal of their information from insurers' databases. Insurance Europe, the trade body, warned that the proposals would make it harder to fight fraud.

Imagine if your bank sent you a financial health-check every morning, predicting how likely you were to go overdrawn that month. Or tracked the stores, cafs and restaurants where you spend money and sent discount offers.

Or if your investment adviser emailed offering to set up a mobile video call whenever your investment portfolio needed adjusting.

These ideas may sound unrealistic to some bank customers who still wait days or even weeks for their cheques to clear. But as lenders start to harness the power of big data they are close to becoming reality for many consumers.

"Big data is a big opportunity, but we've got to sort a lot of things out along the way," says Greg Baxter, global head of digital strategy at Citigroup. "But there are still a lot of 'small data' opportunities that can make a big difference - we're trying to make managing financial health a more integrated part of our client's life, so we're experimenting with providing clients with early warnings of potential cash flow problems in their accounts, for example."

While most banks are enthusiastic about making the most of the data they hold about customers, they are held back by concerns over privacy and the technical challenges stemming from their ageing and complex systems.

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.

< > As an example of an area that raises privacy issues, Mr Baxter says banks could use information available about people on social media - such as who is in their circle of contacts - to decide whether to grant them a loan. "We don't use such data, and believe there is a lot to be understood about the consequences of using that sort of data in making decisions that could have important consequences in people's lives," he says.

Anne MacRae, managing director of financial services at Fujitsu, the IT services provider, says more than a third of banks still buy data on clients from third parties, because it is too hard to extract the same data from their own systems.

"Banks have been very good at rolling out digital services at the front-end, like mobile apps, but they haven't done so well in the back-office, which is still largely paper based for mortgages and loans," she says.

The trend for banks to jump on the big data bandwagon started in the consumer banking space. In the UK, Santander and Lloyds Banking Group are among the lenders teaming up with retailers to offer personalised discounts to customers through their mobile applications based on an individual's spending patterns.

But now they are examining the possibilities in other areas, such as wealth management and corporate banking. "Banks are starting to think of their small business customers and using their data to see real time what is happening to their businesses and where banks can step in to help," says Richard Lumb, head of financial services at Accenture.

FT WEEKEND SUPPLEMENT - MONEY
Reveal fees, discretionary managers urged; INVESTING

Plea for the same transparency as mutual funds

Discretionary fund managers are failing to disclose details of their fees and holdings which ought to be crucial to financial advisers' decision-making, according to a new report.

Discretionary portfolios, in which managers handle client money on investors' behalf - including rebalancing portfolios and making asset allocation decisions - should face the same transparency requirements as mutual funds, according to research by the consultancy The Lang Cat.

Advisers have increasingly recommended the use of discretionary portfolios to clients since the market reforms introduced with the Retail Distribution Review in 2013, which encouraged advisers to focus on financial planning rather than the details of investment strategy. The Lang Cat tried to establish whether advisers were generally choosing suitable products in this area for clients.

"We found an almost total lack of rational behaviour on the part of a number of adviser respondents, and systemic issues on the supply side," said Mark Polson, principal at The Lang Cat.

Nearly half of advisers who recommend discretionary products told The Lang Cat that it was "quite hard" or "very hard" to establish total costs . When The Lang Cat attempted to research this it was able to find so-called total expense ratio (TER) figures for some discretionary managers, but none of the more inclusive ongoing charge (OCF) figures which are now the norm for mutual funds in the UK. Campaigners have criticised even the OCF as not reflecting the full costs of investing.

"I've heard the regulator stand up at conferences and say 'If you do not understand what you are using and how it compares to other products, you should not use it,'" said Mr Polson. "We concluded that advisers' choices cannot be properly data-driven, which they should be."

The Lang Cat said that a full comparison of different discretionary portfolios was "nigh on impossible" but estimated average total annual charges at 2.08 per cent in its report, "Never Mind The Quality, Feel The Width", which was carried out with CWC Research. Other estimates have placed this higher, including a survey by Numis, which suggested some clients might be paying up to 7 per cent.

Advisers allocate an average of 19 per cent of their clients' holdings to discretionary solutions, with some allocating up to 90 per cent, The Lang Cat said. While some of these solutions may offer genuine value, Mr Polson said, other discretionary managers market themselves with "wood-panelled offices" and vague promises of investment "special sauce".

Wealth managers, who run portfolios directly for their own clients but may also offer products to external advisers, say they already disclose most charges in percentage form on "rate cards" to new clients. New European requirements under the second version of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Mifid II) are likely to require disclosure of all costs and charges by discretionary managers from the start of 2017, but companies in this field say that aggregating this information could result in substantial new costs for them.

"The problem for us is getting the information," said John Barrass, deputy chief executive of the Wealth Management Association. He added that competition in his sector - the WMA has some 120 members - helps to keep costs down.

Nick Hungerford, founder of the online wealth manager Nutmeg, said he had spoken to new clients who were unaware they had been charged trading costs by their former wealth manager, although it is standard practice to use client money to pay for the costs of trading. He said that companies failing to disclose these costs were "stuck in the 19th century".

The Lang Cat said the lack of cost disclosure goes in tandem with other problems, such as a lack of holdings information and questions over performance. The consultancy looked at a sample of discretionary portfolios over rolling three-year periods and found that no more than 11 per cent outperformed the FTSE All-Share index at any point, while none outperformed the FTSE 250.

Risk-rated solutions, which are classified according to volatility, have also grown in popularity since RDR, but The Lang Cat raised questions over whether these deliver value for money. It found that portfolios designed to take more risk than average in order to generate higher returns actually failed to outperform the FTSE 100 index.

The Lang Cat and CWC spoke to 45 companies including 38 advice firms and used data from leading discretionary providers via FE Analytics.

Nasdaq head Bob Greifeld criticises SEC market panel

The head of Nasdaq, the US exchanges operator, has criticised the composition of a new panel to advise regulators on reform of US equity markets for omitting exchanges with corporate listings.

Earlier this month the Securities and Exchange Commission announced a 17-person strong advisory committee to explore "the role of exchanges in the current market structure".

While it includes a former senator, academics, and representatives of fund managers, Wall Street brokers and electronic market makers, there was no place for either the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq.

"We were very disappointed not to be included on the committee," said Bob Greifeld, chief executive of Nasdaq, the most popular destination in the US for initial public offerings last year. "It's quite remarkable that there's no one representing issuers. It's a curious make-up of the committee."

The panel was devised by the agency as part of a review announced last year to examine a range of issues that have come to dominate discussions of US equity markets, such as high-frequency trading, conflicts of interest and dark pools.

At its unveiling, Mary Jo White, chair of the SEC, said that "secondary markets exist for investors and public companies, and their interests must be paramount".

Mr Greifeld's comments came as Nasdaq reported an uptick in organic revenue growth in the final quarter of 2014, boosted by increased trading on its cash equities trading market.

Fourth-quarter net revenues to December 31 were down 1 per cent year-on-year to $517m. But on an organic basis, and stripping out the impact of foreign exchange rates, net revenues in the period rose 3 per cent.

Operating income in the period rose 7 per cent to $221m as Nasdaq cut costs by 5 per cent. Net income in the final three months fell from $141m to $87m as it spent more money on strategic initiatives and deals. Another deal, the $225m purchase of Dorsey Wright, a US index provider and analytics group, is due to close on Friday, Mr Greifeld added.

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.

<>He said Nasdaq was better positioned than a year ago to accelerate organic growth and confirmed the group was interested in foreign exchange trading venues. Nasdaq's domestic rival Bats Global Markets on Wednesday agreed to purchase Hotspot, a currency trading unit of KCG Holdings in a deal worth up to $435m. While he admitted he was looking at potential platforms, Mr Greifeld noted: "At certain prices it doesn't make sense."

For the year, Nasdaq reported an increase in turnover from $1.9bn to $2.1bn and an increase in net income from $384m to $413m.

The exchange's standout unit in the fourth quarter was its cash equities business, which reported a $9m increase in trading revenues to $59m from higher trading volume and rising market share. Diluted earnings per share in the period rose from $0.69 to $0.75.

P2P consumer loans given landmark rating

A bundle of peer-to-peer consumer loans has been given a credit rating by Moody's, the first time a major rating agency has evaluated a securitisation deal created by the fast-growing "P2P" lending industry.

Achieving such a credit rating is a major win for the nascent peer-to-peer, or marketplace lending, sector as it seeks to expand by tapping new types of investors.

Data-driven technology and online platforms are used to directly connect borrowers with lenders, extending financing at a lower rate than that offered by traditional lenders while simultaneously generating higher returns for investors.

In recent years, P2P lenders have seen an influx of cash from professional investors including hedge funds and asset managers keen to buy up the P2P loans originated through the platforms. Securitising the loans into saleable bonds allows investors to further boost their returns by applying leverage to the deals.

Securing a credit rating is expected to open up the sector to a broader range of investors such as pension funds and insurers. It also means a new line of business for bankers who are seeking fresh types of assets that can be bundled into securitisations in the aftermath of the housing crash that led to big losses on bundles of subprime mortgages.

The $327m deal, called Consumer Credit Origination Loan Trust 2015-1, was put together by BlackRock Financial Management and involves packaging loans originated through Prosper, the world's second-biggest P2P lender.

Moody's gave the $281m top slice of the deal an investment-grade rating of "Baa3" while the lower $45m portion has been given a speculative-grade rating of "Ba3". The rating agency said that its cumulative net loss expectation for the CCOLT 2015-1 loan pool is 8 per cent.

The deal features a $50m prefunding feature that will see investors essentially buy into the securitisation before the P2P loans have even been originated.

Such prefunding accounts were a hallmark of securitisations sold before the financial crisis. They have made a return in recent years as investors clamour to put their money into anything that might generate higher returns.

The swiftness of the rating may surprise some financial market participants. Many believed rating agencies were taking a cautious approach to evaluating new asset classes in the aftermath of the crisis, which saw them accused of handing out top-tier ratings to undeserving bonds.

Nevertheless, the prospect of a vibrant market for P2P securitisations has attracted interest from Wall Street, where a wide range of financial institutions is salivating over the chance to make money by packaging, selling and providing financing for the deals.

The hedge fund Eaglewood Capital was first to securitise P2P loans with a $53m unrated deal sold in 2013. Last year, SoFi scored a major win for the industry when it received an investment-grade rating from Standard & Poor's for a securitisation of P2P student loans. Jefferies announced last year that it would buy and securitise $500m worth of P2P loans originated through CircleBack Lending.

The FT previously reported that BlackRock was working with Prosper to create the first rated transaction of P2P consumer loans. Santander is believed to be working with Lending Club, the world's biggest P2P lender, on a similar deal.

Ram Ahluwalia, chief executive of PeerIQ, a risk analytics platform for the P2P industry, said such securitisations open the sector to a "broad" pool of investors and capital. "Rated securitisations are a step forward in the maturation of P2P lending into a full-blown asset class," he added.

New platforms vie to take finance to masses; DEMOCRATISING FINANCE; The first of an FT series looks at digital technology's potential to empower as well as concerns over its implementation

There are two popular perceptions of Nigeria. To many, it is the beating heart of Africa's growth story, with GDP expanding by about 7 per cent a year. To others, it is a country in turmoil, with a fragile democratic government desperate to shrug off the mounting atrocities of Boko Haram terrorists.

The rollout of a national ID scheme by President Goodluck Jonathan captures this ambiguity. Electronic chips on the new ID cards store details of the holder's iris and fingerprints, boosting security. But with the backing of MasterCard, these are also payment cards - and a potential harbinger of access to finance for the masses.

"This is digitalisation, democratisation and financial inclusion all rolled into one," says Ann Cairns, who heads MasterCard's international operations.

Once it is fully implemented, the project will allow 100m Nigerians to access financial services. It is just one of countless initiatives around the world being touted as proof that digitalising finance can empower people.

Over the next week, the Financial Times will examine the initiatives that are bringing new sources of finance, new forms of currency and new methods of payment to new customers - and ask the question: is the world genuinely being "democratised", as many of those behind such innovations insist?

Nigeria's ID scheme is a case in point. To its supporters, the project is a slick way to modernise the country, leapfrogging some of the West's traditional ways of doing things in the process. But it has been criticised by human rights and protest groups.

Privacy International, the data protection charity, has raised concerns about the potential abuse of biometric data. Local protest groups have complained about the role of a western financial company - the MasterCard branding on the back of the ID card was akin to the branding of people in the 19th-century slave trade, they said.

Finance companies, from MasterCard to the biggest banks, dispute suggestions of exploitation. But there is no denying that access to digital technology is helping financiers tap lucrative new markets.

"Making access to finance more democratic is not only about social responsibility - it's a business model," says Carlos Lopez-Moctezuma, Mexico-based head of financial inclusion at BBVA.

The Spanish bank operates in Mexico through a network of 30,000 agents - local shops, pharmacies and post offices. Now in an effort to reach a broader spread of customers, improve efficiency and reduce risk, the bank is trying to shift agents away from traditional cash transactions by encouraging them to turn their smartphones into point-of-sale devices.

In another initiative, 2.5m customers now have an integrated mobile phone number and bank account number. "It is about using technology to reach more people but also making life easier by understanding what they want," says Mr Lopez-Moctezuma.

Only a few banks are thinking radically about technology and finance - using big data to analyse customer behaviour, for example, or partnering with peer-to-peer lenders. Many of the biggest advances in bringing financial services to the masses have come from mobile operators and tech companies.

Vodafone's M-Pesa service - a relatively low-tech money-transfer scheme launched in 2007 using mobile phones and on-the-ground agents - dominates in Kenya, Tanzania and beyond. Similar schemes have spread across Latin America.

Vikram Pandit, the former chief executive of Citigroup and now a financial technology investor in a range of whizz-bang start-ups, is full of admiration. He says M-Pesa might be simple in comparison with cutting-edge "fintech", but it is fulfilling a gaping need. "The most fundamental needs of the poor are not 'which stock can I buy?' It's just matching inflows and outflows of their lives and almost all of them come down to payment systems."

Not everyone is so upbeat. Arjan Schutte, another fintech investor and founder of Core Innovation Capital, says: "I'm a bear on the mobile phone. It should be the great democratiser. [But] how old a story is M-Pesa? Come on! In 10 years no one else has been able to leapfrog over the consumer finance infrastructure. There's nothing even close. There's no story to tell at scale other than M-Pesa."

In the West a different form of "democratisation" is taking place, whereby ordinary people who would once have had no access to key parts of the financial-services market can find themselves enfranchised. Online platforms that use "big data" analysis to judge credit risk are widening the pool of people who can borrow money (though it may also allow risk to be so finely assessed that some people will become unfinanceable or uninsurable).

New psychometric testing is doing the same in emerging and developed markets alike.

Mr Pandit believes in the need to "democratise the disparity" between US billionaires who can earn 20 per cent on a big M&A deal and the 2 per cent return available to most Americans. And sure enough, online platforms that give access to "crowdfunded" equity investments are rocketing in popularity.

But it is the broadening and deepening of the crowdfunded debt market that has been one of the most striking trends of recent years. From Shanghai to London to New York peer-to-peer lenders - online platforms that match people looking to invest money with individuals and companies that want to borrow it - are doubling or tripling in size every few months. In a sign of the excitement around the industry, one of the world's biggest, Lending Club, floated with a valuation of more than $5bn.

Samir Desai, chief executive of British P2P lender Funding Circle, says that there are clear benefits for borrowers who might otherwise be unable to find the money they need but also for lenders looking for worthwhile investment opportunities. "In the past it wasn't really possible for individuals to lend to businesses unless they had 100,000 or more available. Now they're on an equal footing with big institutions. That is true democratisation."

Others are less sure. Marshall Wace, a hedge fund group that is backing a P2P venture, thinks the "peer" funding element that has underpinned the sector to date will steadily institutionalise so that big asset managers and banks become the main funders of lending on these platforms.

"There's a romantic idea about peer-to-peer," says Simon Champ, who heads the firm's P2P operation. "But it is not only about democratisation. It's also about the replacement of an outdated, 300-year-old business model, with a new, more efficient one."

Canada s Oxford Properties Buys Paris Office Building; The $227 Million Paris Purchase Is 92 Avenue de France

Canadian real-estate firm Oxford Properties Group has bought a Paris office building for just over  200 million ($227 million), furthering a strategy to expand its London-heavy European portfolio to include the French capital.

Oxford, the real-estate arm of Canadian pension fund OMERS Worldwide Group of Companies, told The Wall Street Journal it purchased 92 Avenue de France from a joint venture between German companies GLL Real Estate and Union Investment Real Estate GmbH.

Oxford made its first Paris acquisition in September. With its second deal the group is almost halfway to its  1 billion, three-year target for the city.

The rest of its  3.6 billion portfolio of European real-estate assets are in London, where it set up an office in late 2008.  If we're going to build a 10 billion Canadian dollar business (in Europe), it would be difficult just to focus on London," said Paul Brundage, senior managing director at Oxford.

London is typically the first destination for global investors looking to establish a foothold in Europe. "http://www.wsj.com/articles/canadian-property-investors-tap-london-1418184434?tesla=y" Oxford jointly developed the Leadenhall Building- popularly called the Cheesegrater- with British Land PLC. And Canadian firm Brookfield Property Partners LP and "http://www.wsj.com/articles/qatar-set-to-gain-control-of-canary-wharf-1422431399?tesla=y" look likely to gain control of the Canary Wharf business district in a 2.6 billion deal.

Paris, or German cities such as Munich or Frankfurt, are often the next targets for international investors when they decide to expand European portfolios.

Over the last year,  London has become more expensive than Paris," said Michel Vauclair, an executive at Oxford. He also noted that rates for long-term debt in euros are more favorable than in sterling.

Global investors have injected $29.3 billion in London real estate in the last 12 months, compared with $13.2 billion into Paris, according to Real Capital Analytics data.

With London's property market booming, it has been challenging to acquire high-quality assets preferred by pension funds, Mr. Brundage said.  Not impossible, but challenging," he said, noting as demand pushes up prices,  it's harder to meet total return expectations" in the U.K. capital.

The recovery in the Paris property market after the financial crisis has lagged behind London. Prime office rents in Paris fell 3.2% in the fourth quarter, and office vacancy rates increased to 5.2%, according to broker Savills.

92 Avenue de France is a 235,000 square foot office located just over a mile from the Gare de Lyon train station. It is entirely leased to Rseau Ferr de France, the state-controlled manager of France's railways.

Corporate News: Mashable, Business Insider Get More Cash

Big money is beginning to wash over the new media landscape.

Both Mashable and Business Insider are expected to announce significant venture capital investments Thursday, building on a recent trend of hefty cash infusions and valuations for the sector's biggest players.

Mashable, a decade-old site focused on technology, entertainment and business news, will receive $17 million in a funding round led by Time Warner Investments, the investment arm of Time Warner Inc. Business Insider, which was founded in 2007, will receive $25 million from a group of investors led by a unit of German media conglomerate Axel Springer SE that also includes Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.

"We firmly believe that journalism has a bright future in the digital space and that the business model will grow," said Andreas Wiele, Axel Springer's president of marketing and classified ad models, who will join Business Insider's board.

In the past six months, venture capitalists have pumped money into online media, including a $50 million investment in BuzzFeed, $500 million investment in Vice Media Inc. and $46.8 million investment in Vox Media. The investments valued BuzzFeed at $850 million, Vice at $2.5 billion and Vox at $380 million. Officials at Mashable, Business Insider, Axel Springer and Time Warner Investments declined to discuss valuations for the new investments.

"What is key to this investment wave is that we have figured out the business model and it is clear we are able to generate revenue in a reliable and predictable way, so [venture capitalists] see we are a real business and we are creating real revenue," said Pete Cashmore, Mashable's founder and chief executive. He said Mashable's revenue grew 45% in 2014.

A person familiar with Business Insider's operations said the site became profitable in the second half of last year and that revenue grew steadily throughout the year.

The media bets rely heavily on business models that are based on new forms of digital advertising, which have yet to fully show they can drive continued revenue growth and provide measurable results for advertisers.

Traffic at both sites has grown steadily in the past year. Business Insider's traffic rose 55% to 35.4 million unique views in December from a year earlier, making it the most-visited business news site in the U.S., according to analytics firm comScore Inc. Mashable's traffic grew 17% in 2014, with 19.2 million unique views in December, comScore said.

Qatar Set to Win Canary Fight

LONDON -- Years of conjecture over the sale of London's skyscraper-studded Canary Wharf business district appear to be over.

The Qatar Investment Authority and Canadian firm Brookfield Property Partners LP are poised to gain control of Canary Wharf's majority shareholder, Songbird Estates PLC, in a GBP 2.6 billion ($3.95 billion) hostile takeover. That would add to Qatar's burgeoning London portfolio and hand Brookfield a belated victory in a takeover battle that dates back a decade.

The path to what would be the U.K.'s biggest real-estate deal was cleared when Songbird, which owns 69% of Canary Wharf Group, said Wednesday that three major shareholders had decided to back the bid. That move promises to settle a standoff between Songbird's board and the bidders, and could result in the company leaving the London Stock Exchange.

Songbird surprised analysts with Wednesday's announcement that the three major shareholders -- U.S. investor Simon Glick, China Investment Corp. and Morgan Stanley -- were ready to accept the bid. Together with QIA, Qatar's sovereign-wealth fund, they own almost 80% of Songbird, and the bidders needed the support of at least one of the three.

If one of the three were to agree, the other two would have faced the prospect of remaining minority interests in a company dominated by QIA, with little likelihood of selling their stake on favorable terms, people familiar with the negotiations said.

With global investors increasingly allocating capital to property, London's real estate is popular because of the country's stable currency, a legal system that tends to side with property owners, and ample liquidity boosted by consistent demand.

Qatar has been a prominent buyer of London's landmarks over the past decade. It bought the London headquarters of HSBC Holdings PLC, Canary Wharf's largest building, for more than GBP 1.1 billion in December. It also owns the Shard, the Harrods department store, Chelsea Barracks, and the 2012 Olympic Village -- as well as a 29% stake in Songbird.

Canadian investors including Brookfield have also been busy in the past 12 months, pouring $1.9 billion into London real estate, about as much as Qatar, according to Real Capital Analytics.

QIA and Brookfield first approached Songbird in November with a bid of 295 pence per share. Songbird responded by publishing an independent valuation that gave the shares a price tag of 381 pence based on the value of Canary Wharf's pipeline of new office and residential developments. The bid was later sweetened.

Songbird shares gained 7.8% Wednesday to trade at 346.50 pence, around one-third higher than where they were before QIA and Brookfield disclosed their approach.

James Carswell, an analyst at Peel Hunt, said the big shareholders have seized a rare opportunity to cash out, because the small pool of publicly available Songbird Estates shares has made them difficult to trade.

Commodities and currencies: the uneven link

It's a common assertion on Wall Street: when the dollar strengthens, commodity prices soften.

The logic makes sense. Most internationally traded commodities are priced in US dollars, as are benchmark futures such as Brent crude oil. So, a rise in the dollar increases the value of the same number of tonnes, barrels or bushels, all else equal.

In the real world, it's not that simple and anyone betting a bullish dollar outlook will uniformly pressure commodities is asking for trouble. Some commodities are more sensitive to the dollar than others.

A case in point is gold. Marketed as a hedge against a depreciating dollar, it has gained nearly 3 per cent in the past year, even as the dollar index rose 17 per cent.

But gold isn't really a commodity, critics will say. It's a store of value, an alternative currency.

The lack of a neat correlation between currencies and raw materials was a recurring theme at the Commodity Markets Council trade group conference in Miami this week.

In agricultural markets, a stronger dollar could keep grain prices under pressure, but not in a formulaic way.

Exports of corn, wheat and soyabeans predominantly come from a few regions: North America, South America and the Black Sea. The costs of farmers outside the US are often borne in local currencies, so the depreciation of the Russian rouble or Brazilian real can increase their incomes.

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.

<>Dan Basse, president of the consultancy AgResource, said that when he called agricultural clients in Russia last week, they were asking for advice on whether to buy an Audi or Mercedes-Benz.

"The Russian farmer, the Brazilian farmer, the Australian and Canadian farmers are all very, very happy. They are looking to expand their seedings in the upcoming year," said Mr Basse.

More seedings should mean even more grain hitting an amply supplied market - a bearish sign. The US Department of Agriculture notes: "As the Russian rouble depreciated significantly over the last several months, wheat was exported at a record pace and domestic prices rose sharply."

Oil and the dollar have at times moved in opposite directions and now is one such time. However, there's "no really clear answer" to questions about the dollar's impact on oil, Lawrence Eagles, BP's head of North American and global crude analytics, told the CMC conference.

Unlike grain, oil is produced by a concentrated global industry, with many costs paid in dollars regardless of where they're incurred. If a foreign producer's oil is worth relatively more in local terms thanks to dollar strength, so are many of its expenses.

"Looking at the dollar as being one of the key drivers of what's happening at the moment is a bit of a misnomer," said Mr Eagles, who formerly served at the International Energy Agency and JPMorgan Chase. "Really, this is not about currencies."

While its effect on commodities is uneven, the outlook for the dollar looks robust. Europe just embarked on an aggressive monetary easing, while traders are jostling over the timing of an expected US interest rate rise.

Asked for his best trade ideas, Joe Nicosia, a senior executive at Louis Dreyfus Commodities, the agricultural trader, recommended selling soyabeans - and the euro.

"There's nowhere for that currency to go but down," he said.

Deal of the Week: Big Bet on 'Class B' Units

Since it was founded 18 months ago, TruAmerica Multifamily, majority-owned by Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America, has spent $1.42 billion buying up apartment buildings throughout the West. Last week, the company closed on its biggest deal yet: the $482 million acquisition of 14 apartment buildings across Southern California.

TruAmerica's voracious buying spree so far includes 7,352 apartments and the firm manages another 8,496 in cities from Seattle to Phoenix and Denver, making it among the largest apartment owners in the West.

But the company's strategy is slightly unorthodox. While most major apartment buyers, especially those backed by deep-pocketed institutional investors, have snapped up so-called Class A, or luxury, properties in prime locations, TruAmerica is gobbling up Class B properties, older buildings with fewer amenities that are located in less-fashionable locations.

The company says its strategy is to buy lower-grade buildings, renovate the units and "reposition" the properties as slightly more modern and higher-end in hopes of charging higher rents. The company estimates it will be able to raise rents an average of 6.4% a year, about 1.4 percentage points higher than it expects average rents to rise in Southern California submarkets.

That approach makes the Class B apartment sector "more attractive because we see there's more room for rent growth," says Bob O'Rourke, senior managing director and head of real-estate investment for Guardian Life, which owns 80% of TruAmerica.

Like most of its previous acquisitions, TruAmerica's newest assets in Southern California were built in the 1980s. The 2,669 units in the region are spread out in lower middle-class neighborhoods, such as San Pedro and Santa Clarita in Los Angeles County, El Cajon in San Diego and Ontario and Riverside in the Inland Empire.

TruAmerica says it will invest approximately $40 million in upgrades, including the installation of new cabinets, flooring and, in some locations, fitness centers and common areas. Those improvements will "make it a more Class A feel," says TruAmerica Chief Executive Robert Hart, who holds a 20% stake in the company. Mr. Hart previously was president of Kennedy-Wilson Holdings Inc.'s multifamily management group.

The company's strategy isn't without risks. While many real-estate assets were hit by the downturn, value-add deals were particularly hard-hit. Buying up cheap properties and then raising rents after upgrades proved especially challenging when paychecks were shrinking and tenants were downsizing.

Although average rents have risen sharply in recent years, some economists, such as Christopher Thornberg of Beacon Economics, say Southern California's future economic growth could be upended by its increasingly unaffordable housing market. Last year in the region, average rents increased by 4.1%, according to CoStar. Average household incomes rose by only 0.74%, according to projections by Moody'sAnalytics.

For its part, TruAmerica believes economic trends are on its side, including declining homeownership rates, an increasing population and a dearth of new-housing construction. "No housing was produced for several years," says Mr. Hart of the fallow time in the wake of the financial crisis.

Even if rent growth does slow, Mr. O'Rourke of Guardian doesn't expect trouble. "Should you hit a speed bump, we believe that on the downside you might not get your yield, but you won't lose your principal."

The seller in TruAmerica's recent deal is JH Real Estate Partners Inc. of Newport Beach, Calif. JH couldn't be reached for comment.

Real Estate
TruAmerica Makes Bet on Upgrading Southern California Apartments; $482 Million Deal for  Class-B  Buildings That Will Be Spruced Up, Priced Higher

Since it was founded 18 months ago, TruAmerica Multifamily, majority-owned by Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America, has spent $1.42 billion buying up apartment buildings throughout the West. Last week, the company closed on its biggest deal yet: the $482 million acquisition of 14 apartment buildings scattered across Southern California.

The buying and selling of multifamily properties has been one of the most active areas in commercial real estate in recent years.

But TruAmerica's buying spree stands out. Not only is the company voracious it has purchased 7,352 apartments and manages another 8,496 in cities from Seattle to Phoenix and Denver, making it among the largest apartment owners in the West but the company's strategy is slightly unorthodox.

Most major apartment buyers, especially those backed by deep-pocketed institutional investors, have snapped up so-called Class-A, or luxury, properties in prime locations, but TruAmerica is gobbling up Class-B properties, older buildings with fewer amenities that are located in less-fashionable locations.

The company's strategy isn't without risks. While many real-estate assets were hit by the downturn, value-add deals were particularly hard-hit. Buying up cheap properties and then raising rents after upgrades proved especially challenging when paychecks were shrinking and tenants were downsizing.

Class-B buildings  exist to fill Class-B demand," says Brian Kerschner, a senior real-estate economist at data firm CoStar Group.  This is a situation where you [could] end up converting many of these buildings and find that Class-A demand isn't there."

Although average rents have risen sharply in recent years, some economists, such as Christopher Thornberg of Beacon Economics, say Southern California's future economic growth could be upended by its increasingly unaffordable housing market. Last year in the region, average rents increased by 4.1%, according to CoStar. Average household incomes rose by only 0.74%, according to projections by Moody'sAnalytics.

For its part, TruAmerica believes broader economic trends are on its side, including declining homeownership rates, an increasing population and a dearth of new-housing construction.  No housing was produced for several years," says Mr. Hart of the fallow time in the wake of the financial crisis.  It's going to be a while until multifamily supply catches up with multifamily demand."

Meanwhile, prices of multifamily properties continue to rise. The average cost of Class B and Class C apartment units rose 17.1% in September compared to a year earlier, according to Reis, a real-estate research firm in New York. And in the Greater Los Angeles area, those same assets rose 31.3% to $207,000 per unit during the same period. That raises the risk that multifamily prices are getting overvalued, says Ryan Severino, a Reis senior economist.

But Arty Maharajh, who reviewed some aspects of TruAmerica's recent purchase, says the company is avoiding some of the overvaluation by buying in bulk. The company is  getting a discount on the number of units [it's] buying," says Mr. Maharajh, a vice president of research at commercial brokerage DTZ who didn't work on the deal. He estimates that TruAmerica paid approximately $180,000 per apartment, a rate that is below the $200,000 to $250,000 average costs per unit across Southern California submarkets.

Even if rent growth does slow, Mr. O'Rourke of Guardian doesn't expect trouble.  Should you hit a speed bump, we believe that on the downside you might not get your yield, but you won't lose your principal. We believe that the multifamily business, even in the down cycle, is a nice hedge against down sides in the market."

Informatica Makes Contact with Potential Buyers; Data-Software Company Working With Investment Bankers at Qatalyst Partners

Informatica Corp. has made contact with potential buyers of the data-software company, amid a flurry of buyouts in the sector.

The Redwood City, Calif., company, which had a market value of about $4.5 billion midday Tuesday, is working with investment bankers at Qatalyst Partners, people familiar with the matter said. Informatica could draw takeover interest from private-equity firms and other software makers, the people said.

While Informatica has been in contact with some potential bidders, there is no formal process to sell itself in place and any discussions are preliminary, one of the people said.

Exploring its sale options would ease pressure the company could face from investors including Elliott Management Corp., which revealed Monday that it owns about 8% of Informatica and sees it as  significantly undervalued". Elliott believes the company is a strong candidate for a private-equity buyout and Informatica should pursue one, a person familiar with the matter said.

Informatica rose 6.8% to $41.04 following Elliott's disclosure Monday. The shares increased another 21 cents to $41.25 in midday trading Tuesday.

Informatica helps companies organize and analyze broad swaths of information, tapping the growing demand for help with managing what's known as big data.

The company moved up the timing of its planned disclosure of fourth-quarter results, which is now expected after the market closes on Tuesday. Informatica had originally been scheduled to report results after the bell on Thursday.

Elliott said it has initiated a dialogue with Informatica's management and board of directors regarding  steps to maximize shareholder value."

Software companies accounted for some of the biggest private-equity buyouts in the fourth quarter of 2014, with Vista Equity Partners acquiring Tibco Software Inc. "http://www.wsj.com/articles/tibco-software-to-be-taken-private-for-nearly-4-billion-1411992122" and Thoma Bravo LLC acquiring Compuware Corp. "http://www.wsj.com/articles/compuware-to-be-acquired-by-thoma-bravo-for-2-5-billion-1409668283". Last month, a team of Thoma Bravo and an arm of the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan agreed to buy Riverbed Technology Inc. for "http://www.wsj.com/articles/riverbed-agrees-to-be-bought-out-by-thoma-bravo-for-3-3-billion-1418652793".

Compuware and Riverbed were both put in play following separate takeover bids for each company by Elliott.

There has already been betting among some analysts and investors that Informatica could be a buyout target. The day Tibco announced its sale in September, Informatica shares popped 5.6%.

Elliott isn't the only Informatica investor who has successfully pushed a company to sell itself in the past; Praesidium Investment Management Co. LLC has a 2.3% stake in Informatica, according to filings. Praesidium publicly pushed for Tibco to find a buyer last year before the company did so.

Activist Hedge Fund Elliott Has Big Stake in Informatica; Elliott Says Informatica s Shares Are  Significantly Undervalued 

Activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. has taken an 8% stake in big-data company Informatica Corp., making it the company's biggest shareholder, as of recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings.

The activist said Informatica's shares are  significantly undervalued," according to a federal filing. It believes that the company should go private, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The stock surged Monday after the disclosure, rising 6.6% to $40.93 in recent trading.

Elliott, a New York hedge fund, has a history of taking stakes in technology companies and pushing them to go private or sell themselves. Among the recent deals it was involved with: the sale of Compuware Corp. for about $2.5 billion in September, and last month's buyout of Riverbed Technology Inc. for about $3.6 billion. In both those cases, Elliott had made offers to buy the companies.

Informatica, Redwood City, Calif., is a software provider that helps companies analyze big data trends. Its market capitalization is about $4.5 billion.

A spokeswoman for the company wasn't immediately able to comment.

Elliott has had discussions with Informatica management, the filing said.

Praesidium Investment Management Company LLC is also has a stake in Informatica, owning 2.3%, according to filings. Praesidium has pushed for another technology company in which it was invested, Tibco Software Inc., to  unlock value," a move that culminated in the company's sale to private-equity firm Vista Equity Partners for more than $4 billion, announced last September.

Cyber criminals target your wealth

When you entrust your money to a fund supermarket, wealth manager or another financial services firm, you hope for healthy returns and minimal investment disasters. But behind the scenes, the companies that handle your money are fighting to keep your assets and data safe from targeted hacks.

"It's one of the things that keeps our members awake at night," says Liz Field, chief executive of the Wealth Management Association.

As long as the internet has existed, companies have been subject to a barrage of hack attempts, many of them indiscriminate: simple malware, sometimes contained in "phishing" emails, seeks openings wherever it can.

But the UK has undergone a rapid rise in targeted attacks, in which criminals try - with a high degree of human involvement - to access specific information or assets. This can range from customer details that will be sold on to enable fraud, to trading information for use on the markets, or material that could embarrass companies if published in a Sony-style hack.

Some 81 per cent of large organisations and 60 per cent of small businesses found their digital defences had been breached in the past year, according to UK government data released in 2014. Financial companies are at the sharp end, not just because of the money they manage but because of the sensitive personal data they hold. The risks have grown as services that initially lagged behind the digital revolution, such as accounts held by fund and pension customers, move fully online.

"The information that the firms we represent have is the information that is of greatest interest to cyber criminals because it's where the money is. They are a focus of attack," says John Barrass, deputy chief executive of the WMA.

Retail banks are among the most high-profile targets of hackers, and face constant assaults, but specialist firms handling investments can also be tempting to the discerning criminal, says Michael Soppitt, a director at Parker Fitzgerald, a financial services management consultancy.

"The average value of an account at an investment management firm is significantly higher than at a retail bank, and high-value customers' information is more saleable," he says.

His company is aware of 13 major breaches at fund management companies over the past year. And he says that hackers have also become more adept at finding weak spots in the many types of companies - technology platforms, advisers, custodian banks - involved in the financial products supply chain.

Data breaches reported to the Information Commissioner by financial advisers, wealth managers and asset managers more than doubled to 31 in the year to the end of June 2014, from 14 a year earlier, according to figures gathered by RPC, a law firm which advises victims of breaches. But Alex Hamer, a partner at RPC, acknowledges that these numbers probably represent a fraction of the real total.

"At the moment there is no compulsory notification regime, so whether a breach is notified will be a commercial decision for the institution concerned," says Mr Hamer.

< > Ernest Hilbert, head of cyber investigations for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at the security firm Kroll, is more blunt. "They are woefully underreported," he says. "The real numbers are probably in the thousands."

Similar questions hang over whether companies are informing customers whose data has been compromised - partly because they may not even have detected the breach, especially if a genuine login is being used.

"Most companies today don't have either the capability to discover a targeted attack or the well-tested response plans to recover from it," says Greg Day, chief technology officer for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at the leading cyber security company FireEye.

Even when an attack is detected, "it can be hard to identify exactly what the impact of a breach has been", says Jonathan Burdett, a director in IT risk and cyber security at PwC.

While the public image of a hacker was once that of a lone nerd or idealist - in Mr Soppitt's words, "a geek in their garage" - companies are now up against organised criminal gangs who trade in various markets for illicit information. Criminals may breach a company's defences and then sell access to others.

"There is a supply chain in the cyber crime world," says Mr Burdett. "User IDs and passwords are sold on the 'dark web', allowing people to procure and trade identities. Those are then used to perpetrate identity fraud and theft, and the proceeds are used in other criminal activities further down the line."

Virtually every targeted attack starts with hackers taking over an account belonging to either a customer or a member of staff, says Mr Hilbert. This can be done through a variety of means: malware hidden in a download, which then records a user's keystrokes; "spear-phishing" emails, which target particular companies or people, using fake identities; spoofed web pages or WiFi hotspots used to harvest logins; or phone calls purporting to be from a bank or other company. In some cases, rogue employees have chosen to share or sell information.

Once inside the system, a hacker may seek routes into other linked companies - say, using a wealth manager to try to access a custodian bank - or they may simply sit inside the system, harvesting information for what can amount to years. A survey by Mandiant, which is owned by FireEye, last year found that breaches took an average of 229 days to be discovered.

In rarer cases, hackers may opt to steal money directly: Kroll has seen 50 cases worldwide of financial losses resulting from accounts being taken over, including at wealth management and fund management firms.

Since no company can be totally impervious to attack, rival groups are engaged in something of an "arms race" on digital security, says David Moffat, group executive at International Financial Data Services (IFDS), which provides administration and technology services to financial firms. "Everyone wants to be more difficult to burgle than the guy next door," he says.

<>Accepting that some breaches will be inevitable, companies are also devoting more resources to disaster recovery, says Mr Day. Where once they might have spent 80 per cent of their budgets on prevention, now it is closer to 30 per cent, with the rest devoted to detecting attacks and mitigating their effects.

In the UK, because of the weaker reporting requirements, we seldom hear about individual hacking cases. In the US, where reporting requirements are much stronger, news reports of data breaches are frequent. This month, Morgan Stanley said that up to 10 per cent of its wealth management clients had their account information stolen by an employee who may have been trying to sell it.

New European regulations, set to take effect in 2017, will introduce much bigger penalties for failing to report data breaches, meaning the public will be much more likely to hear when they occur. It will also move the spotlight on to companies that fail to deal with their vulnerabilities, and those whose weak defences may in turn expose other firms.

"Companies are really going to have to hustle to get this done," says Mr Hilbert.

A series of initiatives is under way to improve digital security in UK financial services. The government launched its Cyber Security Information Partnership (CISP) in 2013 to boost information-sharing among companies. UK and US authorities are planning a mock cyber attack on commercial banks to test their robustness later this year. The Financial Conduct Authority, the City regulator, says it will start to examine companies' technology and digital resilience, and expects them to address cyber security at board level. Industry groups are also setting up their own information-sharing initiatives, including one run by the WMA and another by IFDS.

The technological divide between companies is wide. Firms like BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager which also runs the Aladdin trading platform, have large-scale cyber security operations and ringfence different pools of information to minimise risk. IFDS, whose technology underpins several UK fund shops, runs duplicate data centres and has hired the former chief information officer of the Bank of England, Simon Moorhead, to help keep its information secure. In addition to its digital firewalls, it also trains all its staff in data security. "People are a key part of our defences," says Mr Moorhead.

"We've had much more interest recently from corporate clients wanting to make sure their entire supply chain is protected," he adds.

At the other end of the spectrum, some smaller firms among the UK's network of wealth managers and financial advisers are struggling to get their defences up to date, particularly as they have also been dealing with market changes brought in with the Retail Distribution Review (RDR). "There's often a resourcing issue - some smaller organisations don't have the large budgets for IT, compliance and training," says Mr Hamer.

Overall, the industry remains in a vulnerable phase where awareness of cyber security is rising but day-to-day measures may still be deeply inadequate, according to Mr Day, Mr Hilbert and other experts.

"Many organisations have been caught unawares. Just a decade ago, stealing from an institution would have required a gun," says Mr Soppitt.

"But we are seeing important ideas gaining traction. Companies are recognising that security is an ongoing process, not just a product that you buy. That's an important shift in thinking."

The biggest risk to your data, say specialists, is you. "The most common type of attack that firms experience is where the end customer has accidentally lost or given away their login details," says Mr Burdett, of PwC. Here are three easy steps to improve your digital safety:

Passwords. Weak passwords are key vulnerability. Mr Hilbert, of Kroll, worked with a bank that had 17,000 customers all using the password "Arsenal1".

He says it is vital that consumers use strong passwords - switching to Arsenal2 won't cut it - while ensuring that passwords used for financial accounts are never used elsewhere. About 85 per cent of people currently use the same password for all their accounts, making them much more vulnerable. If you are offered two-step verification on accounts, says Mr Hilbert, always use it.

Software. "Practice good 'digital hygiene' on your own devices - make sure your firewalls are up to date and your browser security is sufficient," says Mr Soppitt, of Parker Fitzgerald.

Awareness. Digital fraud was once largely about "phishing" emails containing malware. But as awareness of these grew, the fraudsters moved on; now it may be inside a more convincing social media link, or a hacking attempt may start with a phone call soliciting personal information.

Don't be afraid to ask companies what measures they have in place to protect you as a customer, says Mr Soppitt.

Global cyber security spending is set to reach $76.9bn ($50bn) in 2015, according to the research firm Gartner - 8.2 per cent above its estimated figure for 2014.

The fight against online crime, which is estimated to cost the global economy more than $400bn a year, has fuelled the rise of companies in fields like secure data storage, identity verification and threat intelligence, as well as the digitally focused divisions of insurers and defence companies.

Polar Capital's Technology Trust has benefited from holdings in Palo Alto Networks, a broad-based US cyber security firm, while the Axa Framlington Global Technology vehicle holds US firm Radware - which specialises in application delivery and network security - among its top 10 holdings. Other major US cyber security firms include Symantec and FireEye, while younger companies in the field are a fast-growing target for venture capital.

Closer to home, UK-listed cyber security firms include NCC, which stores data and spots security flaws for companies, and Accumuli, which provides data analytics and information on threats. Companies such as Corero Network Security, which focuses on fighting distributed "denial of service" attacks, in which hackers overload servers and networks with requests, are among those occupying a specific niche within the industry.

Goldman Sachs has made its first foray into big data in Asia by investing the lion's share of a $56m round of funding for Antuit, a data analytics start-up in Singapore.

The investment by the US bank's private equity arm illustrates Goldman's interest in big data technologies in Asia, and Singapore's emerging role as a hub for a rapidly growing industry that has long been centred on Silicon Valley.

Big data is the capture and analysis of data - whether numbers or social media output such as tweets and Instagram photos - to discern patterns in human behaviour for commercial purposes such as targeted advertising online.

The big data market is dominated by Intel, Qualcomm and Google, but smaller participants are emerging, in many cases with the backing of Silicon Valley investors.

Financial institutions , too, are increasingly looking beyond traditional compliance systems to big data and technology to root out illicit behaviour.

Goldman has already bet on big data in the US. It invested $90m last year in AvePoint, a New Jersey company, and in 2013 poured $100m into Applied Predictive Technologies, a cloud-based "predictive analytics" software company in Virginia.

Antuit, founded less than two years ago, specialises in big data services for companies' supply chains and sales and marketing operations.

It has offices in New York, Seattle, Auckland and Bangalore as well as Singapore.

The funding round includes money from Zodius Capital, an India-based investor in enterprise software and mobile internet companies.

Antuit said the money would be used for "further global expansion through organic growth and acquisitions". Ankur Sahu , co-head of private equity at Goldman in Asia, will join the company's board.

Arijit Sengupta , Antuit chief executive, said: "The rapidly growing $10bn-plus big data services market is ripe to be organised and consolidated under a market leader.

"Goldman Sachs . . . brings us not only capital but also deep expertise around how to grow into such a company and a global network of corporate relationships."

Singapore began promoting itself as Asia's data hub about three years ago, and the government expects data analytics to contribute S$1bn ($750m) to the city-state's economy by the end of 2017.

Goldman Sachs Makes Bet on Big Data  in Asia

HONG KONG -- Goldman Sachs Group Inc . is placing a bet on big data's growth in Asia.

The U.S. investment bank is leading a $56 million investment in Singapore's Antuit Holdings Pte. Ltd. to help it grow and acquire rivals in Asia's rapidly growing data analytics market, according to a person familiar with the situation. Zodius Capital, an existing investor in Antuit, is also participating in the latest fundraising, the person said.

The global market for big data is expanding rapidly as companies like Antuit try to turn data from social media and mobile-phone applications into sales traffic and new customers. Big-data analytics requires complex software that evaluates a web of interconnected pieces of information from a multitude of sources to create a profile of a customer or solve a business problem.

The market is lucrative and still in its early growth. Silicon Valley big-data analytics firm Palantir Technologies , which sells software to the U.S. government and Wall Street, raised a round of funding last week that valued it at $15 billion, making it the third-most valuable company backed by venture capitalists in the world after Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp . and Uber Technologies Inc .

Antuit and its backers are hoping they can seize a piece of the market by building a foothold in Asia. Goldman's funding should help them snatch up smaller competitors and engineering talent before U.S. rivals are able to expand their reach into the region. As part of the deal, Goldman's Asia co-head of private equity, Ankur Sahu, will join the company's board of directors.

Antuit's niche in the big-data market is its ability to link large global clients with inexpensive engineers and data analysts in Asia, particularly India. Based in Singapore with operations in India, the company wants to replicate the success of Asian business-process outsourcing companies in servicing multinational clients by tapping talent in India.

Antuit Chairman and Zodius Capital Chief Executive Neeraj Bhargava was a co-founder of business process outsourcing company WNS (Holdings) Ltd .

The current roster of Antuit clients includes Hyatt Hotels Corp . and Avon Products Inc . Antuit operates offices from New York to Bangalore.

Antuit is a young firm. Zodius Capital helped Antuit get off the ground in 2013 when it funded the $3 million purchase of New York-based analytics firm Marketwell.

COMMENT
Technology has to create more than disruption

Nicolas Brusson, the founder of BlaBlaCar, the French ride-sharing start-up that in June raised $100m to expand across Europe, got the biggest laugh of the week at the DLD technology conference in Munich. Asked about operating in a "single market" with 28 sets of laws and regulations, he replied: "When you start from France, everything looks simple."

DLD is where tech entrepreneurs and venture capitalists from the US and Europe gather to discuss their industry before they shuttle to Davos for the World Economic Forum . In Munich, they chew over the contrasts between the two continents: risk-taking versus safety nets, the free market versus regulations, start-ups versus incumbents.

The notable thing about this year's event, though, was that this no longer felt like the biggest issue. Instead of the main question being whether Europe can get its act together to take on Silicon Valley, it was whether technological progress will swallow us all, no matter where we live and work.

Travis Kalanick , the combative founder of the cab-hailing network Uber, embodied the shift . He turned up in Munich with an emollient speech, carefully crafted by David Plouffe , the former campaign strategist for US President Barack Obama , who heads strategy at Uber. The new Uber pitch is all about co-operation, not confrontation.

Mr Kalanick's claim that Uber can simultaneously create jobs, raise local taxes, save citizens from needing to own cars and reduce carbon emissions was intended not only for European cities. He has to convince a global audience that his platform is progress.

The Uber question is part of a bigger one facing the global economy. More and more people work for virtual platforms instead of companies; work is auctioned to pools of contractors; median wages stagnate while returns on capital rise; some duties of doctors and lawyers may soon be done by machines. Is this what we want?

One notable absentee from Munich was the word "disruption", which has become a mantra of the tech industry in recent years. Venture capitalists have preached that every industry is ripe for disruption of the kind Uber brings to cabs and Amazon brings to retailing.

It has just occurred to them that promising to arrive in town and cause trouble is not the best way to make yourself popular, even if you genuinely believe that creative destruction is good for consumers, and ultimately for society as a whole. Disruption, after all, disrupts people's lives.

As workers, people in advanced industrial economies have not gained a lot from free trade and technological progress. As consumers, they have: Amazon has made buying things cheaper and easier. And in developing economies, workers have seen their wages rise sharply. But the median American and western European employee, no. Nor is the outlook very reassuring for employees in the upper half of the income scale. Artificial intelligence, on which many start-ups are working, could allow machines to do at least some of the work of professionals such as doctors and accountants.

"We ain't seen nothing yet. The amount of turbulence will not decrease. It will go like that," Andrew McAfee , the Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist and co-author of The Second Machine Age , told the DLD audience, pointing at the ceiling.

There is still a gap between US and European attitudes to risk-taking, with all that it implies. One striking moment at DLD was when Axelle Lemaire, the French minister for digital affairs, praised the start-up culture while carefully avoiding admitting that it could mean failure and people being laid off.

But the gap is narrower than it was. The start-up generation in cities such as Stockholm and Berlin has more in common culturally with those in Silicon Valley than with conservative politicians, and many including Mr Brusson of BlaBlaCar have worked there. Europe is spawning its own disrupters.

I share the view of Ben Horowitz, co-founder of Andreessen Horowitz , the Silicon Valley venture capital fund, that technological change is "largely inevitable and impossible to stop". Short of closing borders and halting communications, like North Korea, an economy cannot turn its back on progress.

Still, as Uber is realising, nor can tech companies set up a service platform on which workers and customers interact, bank their money and take no responsibility for the result. An Uber driver who attacks a passenger is not contractually its employee, but the distinction does not matter much to the victim.

Some companies are already taking a gentler approach. One example is Etsy , an online marketplace for craft goods such as pottery and fashion, which is a B Corporation under US law. That means it tries to do good for society as well as reward shareholders.

"If we have a world in which there are drones flying around delivering packages, but no one is talking to each other, that is really sad," Chad Dickerson, Etsy 's chief executive, said in Munich. That is a change from tech companies for which drones replacing drivers is the next frontier of efficiency.

Silicon Valley and the global cities in which start-ups thrive are full of clever people. Their brainpower could be applied to augmenting jobs rather than eliminating them, or to countering the long stagnation of wages. Now that really would be disruptive.

KKR & Co., a New York-based private-equity firm, agreed to buy an online seller of train tickets in the U.K. for between 425 million pounds and 450 million ($681 million), according to people familiar with the situation.

The acquisition marks the latest expansion away from the highly leveraged takeovers of industrial companies that KKR helped pioneer three decades ago.

Trainline said it is the most downloaded travel app in the U.K., has 20.8 million visits each month and about 1.4 billion in annual sales. The acquisition is the latest in a string of European technology investments, including a Swiss online advertising company and a German artificial intelligence software company, led by Philipp Freise, KKR's European head of media and digital investment.

 There's a tremendous opportunity for KKR and others to invest in the digital industry to help companies that are growing fast," Mr. Freise said in an interview.  Trainline was always on my watch list because I knew that there was a big need for the service."

About 90% of U.K. train tickets are still bought in stations and so the company has plenty of scope to grow in its main market, Trainline's chief executive, Clare Gilmartin, said in an interview. The company also plans to expand across Europe and already has licenses to sell tickets for Italian and German train companies.

 They are tackling the cross border opportunities," Mr. Freise said.  When you take a train from the U.K. to continental Europe that should be much smoother."

KKR is buying the company from Exponent, a London-based private-equity firm that bought Trainline for 163 million in 2006 and was preparing to sell shares in the company to the public. Mr. Freise said he started talking to the London-based private-equity firm in December. He expects to hold the investment for five to seven years.

Interana Raises $20 Million to Speed Big Data  Insights; Founders Say Its Technology Can Make Sense of Incoming Information in Seconds

The world of big data has its own version of Shakespeare's Capulets and Montagues: those who believe an emerging technology called Hadoop is a portal to data-driven utopia and those who think Hadoop often is the wrong tool for storing and analyzing floods of information.

The co-founders of Interana are in the latter camp. A husband-and-wife team that joined forces at Caltech, Ann and Bobby Johnson had illustrious careers at Facebook and Intel, respectively, before launching their big-data analytics firm.

The Johnsons unveiled their company last October. This week, they are announcing new $20 million financing that includes two big Hadoop backers: Mike Volpi, a partner at Index Ventures and among the earlier backers Hortonworks, a Hadoop standard-bearer, and Mike Olson, a senior executive at another Hadoop startup called Cloudera.

Interana's pitch, in part, is that it isn't based on Hadoop, which banks, retailers and others use to gather reams of uncategorized data from various digital sources. The technology has been "http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-joys-and-hype-of-software-called-hadoop-1418777627]", which isn't fast enough to react immediately to transactions such as purchases, for example.

Interana says its technology can make sense of incoming information in seconds and let users analyze their business without requiring technicians who know how to work with Hadoop, which is notorious for its complexity. Asana, which sells workplace collaboration and task-management software, said it used Interana to pinpoint hiccups in its service without forcing engineers to spend hours sifting through records of its users' every online interaction.

Interana is based in part on technology developed at Facebook to do tasks like sniffing out quickly why the social network was bogging down and providing easy-to-understand visual graphs to explain the problem, so people who didn't have a Ph.D. in data science could understand the results. Interana, in essence, is a version of the Facebook tool, known as SCUBA, for the broader corporate world.

Both the House of Hadoop and skeptics like Interana share the same essential goal: To transform the data thrown off by every website, road traffic camera or store checkout counter into profitable revelations. How many additional sales could The Gap ring up if it knew that customers planning ski trips were more likely to buy flannel pajamas?

Mike Volpi believes that Hadoop backers and doubters can coexist.  Our general thesis is that the market around business insights is quite large, and there will be multiple technical approaches that will be broadly used even within the same customer accounts," he said.

Voices: Ira Sager, on Factoring Tech Advances in Retirement Planning; Helper robots, for example, may replace health-care workers

Voices is an occasional column that allows wealth managers to address issues of interest to the advisory community. Ira Sager is the managing director of Optimal Wealth Management in Sudbury, Mass.

My grandfather made it to the ripe age of 97. He would have lived longer, but, embarrassed to ask for help, he had a bad fall that he couldn t recover from. I won t have the same problem my grandfather did. By the time I m his age, I won t have to worry about being embarrassed in front of my caretaker my helper will be a robot.

My background is in technology. I have a master s degree in computer science and ran an artificial intelligence research group for six years. Robot assistance in our daily lives is no longer just a science fiction hypothetical. Devices like self-driving cars, exoskeleton suits, and telepresence drones already exist or are in development. Wealth managers need to start considering the impact these and other technologies will have on their clients  lives.

Too often in financial planning, advisers make assumptions about the future based on conditions in the present. But tomorrow will look nothing like today. Retinal implants are already helping the blind to see, scientists are developing artificial intelligence, and doctors treat patients via remotely operated robots.

In about 10 years, you ll be able to get robots that can help in the daily activities in the home. Like any other technology, these devices will start out expensive and quickly drop in price. Home health-care agencies will replace their workers with robots, first remotely operated and then autonomous. Ultimately, people will buy their own robot helpers.

The coming years will bring radical changes to the way older people live, and the cost of medical care for senior citizens will drop significantly.

My firm is building a complex financial model that takes all of this into account, to calculate the cost of retirement in a world transformed by technology. For example, if we have a client who s 65 and ready to retire now, we model the possibility of him buying an exoskeleton suit for about $40,000 in 10 or 15 years, allowing him to stay active and independent.

In the next stage of our client s life, from 80 to 85, robots will be able to help him with the activities of daily living, for about 15% less than the current cost of a home-health service. By the time this client is 85, robots will not only be cheaper but more capable, and the savings will continue to increase.

These future savings, and clients  increasing life expectancy, need to be factored into plans we re making today. Planners may want to set aside money for emerging technologies, and make calculations based on longer life expectancies.

But any financial adviser can help clients prepare for a rapidly changing world by following the news and being ready to adapt to major changes in health care. Technological developments will come in waves that will become glaringly obvious in the next couple of years.

As helper robots become a bigger part of our lives, more and more people will be doing what Grandpa should have done living to be over 100 years old.

Money Managers Plan Private 'Dark Pool' --- Fidelity Investments Leads Charge on Trading Venue to Include BlackRock, Bank of New York Mellon, J.P. Morgan, Others

By Kirsten Grind

(Copyright (c) 2015, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 

Big money managers led by Fidelity Investments are close to launching a private trading venue designed to let them buy and sell large blocks of stock without the involvement of Wall Street firms and high-speed traders, according to people familiar with the matter.

Nine firms including BlackRock Inc., Bank of New York Mellon Corp., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and T. Rowe Price Group Inc., are forming a company that will operate a "dark pool" -- a private trading venue in which activity takes place outside of the public view -- the people said.

The effort is unusual for the fund companies because they are rivals, and typically use similar trading venues at big banks, or public exchanges. They have banded together recently out of a shared desire to reform trading by cutting costs and weeding out high-frequency traders, who often have an unfair advantage, according to critics. The companies also have had trouble buying and selling large orders of stock in other pools, these people said. The new venue will require all trades have a minimum share amount.

The Wall Street Journal last spring reported that the effort by Boston-based Fidelity was under way, but it was in the initial development stages and other companies hadn't yet signed on. The project had tentatively been called "Sakura," the Japanese word for cherry blossom.

Now the partnership between the companies has formalized, with Fidelity taking the largest ownership position in the new company and other fund firms holding smaller stakes, these people said. The company is expected to launch in the coming days, and trading will begin later this year. The companies will each have representatives on the board and will work together on decision making, these people said.

The company that will host the trading venue is now called Luminex Trading & Analytics, which was approved as a broker-dealer by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority on Dec. 26, according to public documents. Michael Cashel, a senior vice president at Fidelity, will be Luminex's interim chief executive, these people said.

The launch of the company faces some hurdles.

The fund firms will be in direct competition with large banks that use their own dark pools and trading algorithms as ways to persuade firms to use them as brokers. UBS AG, Credit Suisse Group AG and Deutsche Bank AG run the largest dark pools in the U.S., according to data from Finra. Other independent operators such as BIDS Holding LP and Liquidnet Holdings Inc. also help facilitate trades between institutional buyers and sellers. About 14.4% of all stock trading took place in dark pools in the first quarter of 2014, according to Tabb Group.

Representatives for UBS, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse declined to comment. Spokesmen for BIDS Holding and Liquidnet couldn't be reached for comment.

Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. recently has approached several of the banks to take over operation of their dark pools, and plans to ask the Securities and Exchange Commission for permission to do so, The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month.

Fund firms are betting on the new venue to be different, particularly because of the widespread commitment from many large asset managers.

The firms involved together manage many trillions of dollars through mutual funds, 401(k) plans and separate accounts for institutional investors, so the new venue has a higher chance of matching orders quickly and easily, these people said.

Also, the new venue would operate almost at cost, allowing fund firms to save on fees at big banks.

Fund firms that wish to join the venue would go through a rigorous process for approval, weeding out high-frequency traders, these people said.

Not all big fund companies have signed on. Absent from the endeavor is Vanguard Group, the country's largest mutual-fund firm with about $3 trillion in assets under management. A Vanguard spokesman declined to comment. Participants of the new venue also don't plan to use it exclusively, according to these people.

The debate over the fairness of trading in U.S. equity markets has been happening for the past several years, in part because of the release last year of the Michael Lewis book "Flash Boys," which said the market is rigged in favor of high-frequency traders, banks and exchanges to the detriment of institutional and retail investors.

At Fidelity, with about $2 trillion of assets under management, the effort to form a new trading venue was pushed in part by Chairman Edward C. "Ned" Johnson III, who stepped down as chief executive of the company last year. His daughter, Abigail "Abby" Johnson, has taken his place. Fidelity created a new division to house the project, the Journal has reported.

The Alibaba Group will this week step up its push into the investment world by launching a stock market index based on its proprietary data.

The launch highlights the potential for technology companies to diversify into asset management as well as the drive towards the use of "big data" - the analysis of large amounts of information from previously inaccessible sources - in investment decisions.

Ant Financial, the parent company of Alibaba's Alipay online payment platform, and Gildata, another company controlled by Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba, are due to unveil the CSI Taojin Big Data 100 index on Wednesday.

The index will weight industries according to the growth in transactions going through Alipay, as well as the price level and the "supply-demand situation". These weightings will then be used to calculate individual stock positions.

Bosera Asset Management, a Shenzhen-based house, said it is launching a passive fund based on the Big Data index.

Alexis He, an analyst at Z-Ben Advisors, a Chinese consultancy, said several other asset managers, including a number of "private", or hedge fund groups, had already spoken to CSI, the index provider, about creating customised products based on the index.

"Big data is certainly coming to the fore," said Ian Smith, investment management partner at KPMG, the professional services firm. "The investment management industry is slightly behind the curve in terms of financial services but this is an illustrative example of how big data can be used to identify investment opportunities. I think that will be a theme that will continue to increase in terms of its importance and prevalence in the industry."

Despite all the hype around big data, there are as yet few examples of its successful use in informing investment decisions. London-based Derwent Capital Markets launched a Twitter-based fund driven by sentiment towards individual stocks, commodities and markets in general, but it closed after just a month.

However, Armando Gonzalez, chief executive of RavenPack, a data analytics company, said it analysed big data for more than 50 financial clients, including many quantitative hedge funds.

He said many such funds run strategies based on data from "trusted sources", such as newswires, newspapers, governments and blogs.

Alex Johnson, associate director at Scorpio Partnership, a wealth management consultancy, added that the concept of Twitter funds was a "bit of a fad", but that the likes of Alipay benefited from having "a more meaningful depth of data".

The Alipay platform processed $9.3bn of transactions on just one day last year, November 11, which was a shopping festival in China.

Mr Johnson added: "I think we are going to see a lot more people taking this leap, but I am not sure about investors' sentiment and how many are going to jump on board. It will come down to marketing."

Swiss Currency Move Shows Risks of Highly Interconnected Financial System; Ripple Effect of Swiss National Bank s Decision Is Reminder of Unexpected Threats

The ripple effect of wild swings in the price of Switzerland s currency is a reminder the next threat to today s highly interconnected financial system could come from an unexpected place.

The sudden decision by the Swiss National Bank on Thursday to remove a cap on the Swiss franc s value posed a threat to the solvency of currency brokers, many of whom sit outside the banking system that has received the brunt of new regulations since the 2008 financial crisis. The market volatility also spilled over into losses at big global banks that trade in currencies as a core part of their business, such as Citigroup, Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and Barclays PLC. Citigroup also provided prime brokerage services to a large U.S. currency broker caught up in the volatility, FXCM, Inc.

Regulatory officials said Friday they didn t see any immediate threats to U.S. financial stability. U.S. agencies were talking among themselves and to market participants as they sought to understand the extent to which big banks, clearing houses that guarantee some currency trades and other market players are exposed to the troubled brokerages or to the currency itself, and how their actions could ripple across the financial system in unexpected ways.

Spokesmen for the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission said their agencies were  monitoring  developments. Staff of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, a group of senior U.S. regulators, were also watching the situation, a person familiar with the matter said Friday. A spokeswoman for the Treasury Department, which chairs the council, declined to comment.

At the Federal Reserve, officials are looking into losses major global banks are taking and likely investigating whether any highly-leveraged hedge funds have found themselves on the wrong side of a trade that could trigger broader consequences. Another area of potential focus is how the various firms that operate the financial plumbing for foreign-exchange and other markets are reacting to events.

The Fed created a new postcrisis Office of Financial Stability Policy and Research in 2010 to investigate weak links in the financial system.

One mitigating factor from a financial stability standpoint is that the Swiss action didn t come amid broader market turmoil.

The events were a  reminder [of] how dependent market stability is on government action and how even one seemingly small move can unsettle everything really quickly,  said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of the policy analysis firm Federal Financial Analytics, Inc.

Regulators say the financial system is stronger thanks to the reforms implemented since 2008, in particular rules that forced the largest, most interconnected banks to maintain far higher levels of capital to absorb unexpected losses.

 Significantly more capital in banks is a good thing and they re likely to be more resilient,  former Federal Reserve Governor Jeremy Stein said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal earlier this week.  There s less worry, I would say, about the banking system being at the center of something. 

But Mr. Stein and others acknowledge that by bulletproofing banks  balance sheets, policy makers may be pushing activity outside the banking system into areas where risks are more difficult to monitor.

In the interview, Mr. Stein pointed to the  very, very rapid growth of issuance of corporate bonds  held by nonbank entities as one area where potential risks should be investigated.

The events of Thursday and Friday put activities by less-heavily regulated exchange brokers on regulators  radar as well. Capital requirements for those firms aren t as high as for banks, meaning they are less able to weather unexpected losses.

Another potential area of concern is that capital rules for foreign-exchange brokers don t currently exist in Europe, where regulators have consistently lagged behind their U.S. counterparts on postcrisis rules.

While European policy makers have floated proposed rules, they would likely revisit them in light of the FXCM tumult, said Bart Chilton, a senior policy adviser at DLA Piper LLP and former CFTC commissioner.

One of the key reforms of the 2010 Dodd-Frank law was to move trading in relatively opaque financial products, like derivatives, onto centralized clearinghouses, which take fees to guarantee trades and force traders to post collateral known as margin. The potential downside: Those clearinghouses have become increasingly important parts of the financial system, meaning that their own actions could have broad ripple effects.

Banks and others have raised concerns with regulators that clearinghouses now pose a new threat to financial stability and have called for actions to beef up their resiliency. The Financial Stability Oversight Council is probing the issue in an effort to evaluate what risks clearinghouses might pose.

Bitcoin s Plunge Bites  Miners ; As Value Falls, Some Pull Plug on Computers Supporting System

A rapid collapse in the value of bitcoin is squeezing some owners of the computers that support the digital currency and raising concerns about its viability.

Bitcoin s value fell 21% to $179.37 late Wednesday, according to news service Coindesk.

The virtual currency, which trades mostly in unregulated overseas markets, has fallen 44% since the start of the year and 85% from the record high of $1,165 it hit in early December 2013. In total, almost $11.3 billion in value has been lost since that peak.

 The people who most believed in the long-term value of bitcoin holdings are the people who got hurt the most,  said Chase Sechrist, a 22-year software developer based in Austin, Texas, who sunk $30,000, or  most of his savings,  into the digital currency, starting  at the top of the summer 2014 hype cycle.  Having lost virtually all of it, Mr. Sechrist says he ll  be out of bitcoin for quite a while,  at least until it is better regulated, though he still strongly believes in the future benefits of its core payments technology.

The price decline is causing turmoil for bitcoin  miners  the independent computer owners who confirm and process transactions in the currency. Miners are compensated with freshly issued bitcoins, which in turn are added to the total supply. As the price of bitcoin falls against the dollar and other traditional currencies, the miners  profits get squeezed.

The financial challenge has been made more acute by increasingly tough competition to earn bitcoin, the result of a 30-fold increase in the computer firepower being deployed by the miners, according to the bitcoin-monitoring company Blockchain.

That expansion in technology has given the network 13,000 times more computing power than that of the world s 500 largest supercomputers combined, according to Bitcoinwatch.com and Top500.org.

To keep up, many miners kept building capacity and adding faster machines, even though the falling price ate into their profitability.

Only now, with the new year bringing steeper price declines, have capitulations begun.

On Monday, London-based CEX.io announced it would temporarily halt a  cloud mining  operation by which it mines bitcoins on behalf of clients who rent out its bitcoin processing power.

In a blog post, it blamed  the recent bitcoin price drop, as well as the upscaling of the mining difficulty. 

And on Tuesday, CoinTerra Inc. said it had been forced to default on a bond payment after being shut out of a Utah data center in which it had run a bitcoin-mining operation that once accounted for around 3% of the total bitcoin network. The facility owner, C7 Data Centers Inc., has sued it for nonpayment of fees.

Such departures have for the first time resulted in declines in the  hash rate,  a metric that measures the total computational power of the mining network. That has led some bitcoin enthusiasts to express anxiety in online trading chat rooms that an acceleration of miner exits might leave the network with insufficient computing and cause problems for the wider bitcoin economy.

The mathematical formula that regulates the supply of the digital currency is designed to adjust for such shifts by changing the difficulty of a mathematical puzzle that miners must solve to earn new bitcoins, thus crimping the amount of bitcoins in circulation.

But because those adjustments have lag time, some speculated that a sharp drop in the hash rate would leave a depleted mining network working overtime.

Bitcoin software developers say such concerns are overblown. The hash rate would have to fall suddenly by around 90% to cause problems, they said, whereas the peak-to-trough decline in the average hash rate has only been around 10% since December.  It takes huge hash rate changes to noticeably change the block time,  said Gregory Maxwell, one of five coders charged with maintaining bitcoin s open-source operational program.

Nonetheless, talk of a mining crisis, which followed a hacking attack last week at Slovenia-based bitcoin exchange Bitstamp, stirred many to sell, says Greg Schvey, a partner at bitcoin market analytics firm TradeBlock. Selling was also amplified in Asian trading hours, where margin calls were triggered on exchanges such as Hong Kong-based Bitfinex, which allow leverage-based trading. Once the price fell below levels at which those traders were required to post more collateral, automated waves of selling ensued. Traders said market patterns suggested that computerized trading machines, or bots, had placed big sell orders deliberately designed to trigger those margin calls.

The good news for mining, however, is that the market  is getting to the point where it finds an economic equilibrium,  said Mr. Schvey, noting that departing mining operators are boosting market share and profits for those who remain.

The Property Report
'Cash Boxes' Losing Allure --- Newly Offered Shares Underperform Established Public Real-Estate Companies

By Alessia Pirolo and Jeannette Neumann

Europe's commercial-property markets turned in a strong performance in 2014, but one group of investors mostly missed the boat: those who bet on so-called cash-box or blank-check companies.

Such companies collect money from investors via initial public offerings before they own any assets. The goal is to use the proceeds from the IPOs to buy real estate -- ideally at low prices.

Five European cash-box companies went public in 2014, raising a collective $5.1 billion, the highest since the financial crisis hit Europe, according to Dealogic. But the new shares underperformed more established public real-estate companies, and new offerings have dried up.

The broad FTSE EPRA/Nareit Developed Europe Index of property companies saw a nearly 26% rise during the year, its best since 2012, as values of commercial property in many parts of the continent and U.K. rose. The five cash-box companies all underperformed the index. One of them -- Lar Espana Real Estate Socimi SA -- was trading about 9% below its IPO price Tuesday.

Green Street Advisors said the pipeline for cash-box IPOs is empty.

"It is pretty clear that the market has turned against cash boxes," said Jamie McDevitt, an analyst at Green Street. "The 2014 returns have been shockingly bad compared to EPRA," the property-company index.

As a rule, cash-box companies don't jump out of the gate like some technology IPOs do. But the new real-estate companies were slower to deploy their capital than investors expected. What's more, by the time they raised capital and started buying real estate, high demand for European property already had begun to drive up prices.

The underperformance is a reminder of the risks of diving into untested real-estate investments -- and the importance of timing, analysts say.

Most cash-box companies are structured as REITs, a decades-old structure in the U.S. but one that is relatively new in countries like Ireland and Spain. Governments tweaked their tax laws to make REITs possible in the hope that they would help attract capital to their countries' property markets.

The volume of European commercial property purchased in 2014, including in the U.K., is expected to have been the highest since the crisis, according to Real Capital Analytics. While a final tally for the year isn't in, during the first three quarters of 2014 more than 138.9 billion euros ($165 million) worth of real estate traded hands, up from 122.6 billion euros in 2013.

This increased demand has driven up prices and pushed down yields; Green Street Advisors said the projected returns of the properties it tracks fell to 5.8% in 2014 from 6.6% at the end of 2013.

Cash-box companies experienced this first hand. For example, a venture including Kennedy Wilson Europe Real Estate PLC -- a U.K. cash-box company -- last year paid 311 million euros for a suburban Dublin office park, 25% more than what the property had been marketed for in fall 2013, according to Green Street. A spokesman for Kennedy Wilson, which went public in February, declined to comment.

"The appetite to give funds to cash-box investors to do with it what they want has diminished," said Juan Manuel de Remedios, a capital-markets partner with law firm White & Case LLP in Madrid. "Yes, there are still opportunities, but the bargains have probably disappeared."

Likewise, Lar Espana, which counts Pacific Investment Management Co., or Pimco, as its largest investor, last March raised 400 million euros with plans to buy Spanish shopping centers outside of major cities like Madrid and Barcelona. The yield on its first acquisition -- 39.5 million euros for two shopping centers in the Spanish towns of Irun and Palencia -- was 8.25%, according to CBRE Group Inc. By July prices had risen. Anecblau, a retail center southwest of Barcelona that Lar Espana bought that month for 80 million euros, had a yield of 6.5%, CBRE said.

Lar Espana Chairman Jose Luis del Valle said he is confident "that the return on these assets will be manifested at the end of 2015, early 2016." Pimco didn't respond to a request for comment.

Executives at Spanish REITs say the interest in new vehicles has cooled because investors are increasingly skeptical that a new cash-box company would be able to generate solid returns in an already crowded field.

"The assets that everyone wants to buy are already fully priced," said Ismael Clemente, executive chairman of Merlin Properties SA, a Spanish REIT that raised 1.25 billion euros in July. Merlin, which was a cash box, went public with an already-inked deal to purchase 880 bank branches from a Spanish lender. This year, he said, "there could be IPOs of companies that already have assets, but the time of cash boxes is gone."

Europe's commercial-property markets turned in a strong performance in 2014, but one group of investors mostly missed the boat: those who bet on so-called cash-box or blank-check companies.

Such companies collect money from investors via initial public offerings before they own any assets. The goal is to use the proceeds from the IPOs to buy real estate ideally, in the case of European property, at low prices.

Five European cash-box companies went public in 2014, raising a collective $5.1 billion, the highest since the financial crisis hit Europe, according to Dealogic. But the new shares underperformed more established public real-estate companies, and new offerings have dried up.

The five cash-box companies all underperformed the index. One of them Lar Espaa Real Estate Socimi SA was trading about 9% below its IPO price on Tuesday.

During the year, one cash-box company that went public, Axia Real Estate Socimi SA of Spain, originally had a goal to raise  400 million, or $473 million at current exchange rates. The company decided to keep the size of the offering to  360 million so that there was more demand than supply and the stock would rise, according to Chony Martn Vicente-Mazariegos, Axia's chief financial officer. Shares, which began trading at  10 each last summer, initially dropped but were at  10.37 on Tuesday.

Quabit Inmobiliaria SA, a Spanish investment company, withdrew its plans to launch a cash-box company that would have been the first real-estate investment trust to focus on Spanish residential properties.

Green Street Advisors said the pipeline for cash-box IPOs is empty.

This year, he said,  there could be IPOs of companies that already have assets, but the time of cash boxes is gone."

In the U.S., after the commercial-real-estate collapse of the early 1990s, initial public offerings of REITs played a critical role in attracting new capital to the market. But almost all IPOs back then were of companies with existing portfolios and long operating track records.

Those types of companies and not cash boxes now have the best chance of going public in Europe as well. Due to disappointing performance,  the market has been more selective," said Massimo Saletti, global co-head of real estate, gaming and lodging at Deutsche Bank AG.

Indeed, Quabit Inmobiliaria, which postponed its plan to take public a cash-box REIT called Bulwin Investments, is assembling a portfolio before making its move in the public market, said Jorge Calvet, vice president of Quabit Inmobiliaria and chairman of Bulwin.  We thought it was better not to pursue an IPO in a trying moment for the market," Mr. Calvet said.

US authorities have saved billions of dollars by mining big data to identify and prosecute healthcare fraud, learning from the playbook corporations are using to disrupt their industries and expand their businesses.

The US Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation and Department of Health and Human Services' office of inspector general have been scouring billing records to identify frauds that are estimated to bleed Medicare, the taxpayer-funded safety net for 54m elderly and disabled Americans, of more than $60bn annually.

Since launching a co-ordinated strike force in 2007 in Miami, the US government has seen the effort pay off. It said it recovered a record $4.3bn in 2013 in fines and restitution and $19.2bn over the past five years. For every dollar spent prosecuting healthcare fraud, the US says it has collected $8.

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.

The initiative - to comb real-time data to catch and then stop fraudsters in the act - is still a new concept within the DoJ's fraud section, which is also responsible for prosecuting foreign bribery, securities fraud and bank fraud.

"The idea of using real-time data to generate fraud cases is unique," said Leslie Caldwell, the chief of the criminal division at the DoJ.

"We've asked our fraud prosecutors to see whether there are similar areas where there are other databases," Ms Caldwell said. "We've asked people to think creatively in terms of information sources that could show us some hotspots in other areas" beyond healthcare, she said. "If there are, we're going to look at them."

The DoJ has increased its focus on doctors, which are critical to Medicare fraud schemes. Clinics or doctors use their identifying numbers to bill for services they often never perform. The doctors pocket a portion of the reimbursements or receive kickbacks for allowing clinics to use their unique Medicare provider number.

In 2013, 36 doctors were charged, up from three in 2007, the year the strike force got off the ground. The DoJ has increased its manpower from seven prosecutors in Miami when it started to 35 nationwide currently investigating frauds.

Dr Farid Fata, an oncologist in Detroit, pleaded guilty last year to a $225m scheme and admitted ordering chemotherapy treatments for patients who did not require it. He could face a decade in prison when sentenced next month.

"The plan is absolutely to keep it going. The strike force every year has been significantly more successful than it was the year before," Ms Caldwell said.

Chinese Developer Appears to Default; Kaisa Group Owed Interest Payments on Offshore Bonds

SHENZHEN, China A Shenzhen real-estate developer with seemingly sound finances likely became one of the first Chinese property companies to default on offshore bonds Thursday, in a development that is raising concerns among global investors

Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. appears to have missed interest payments due on $500 million of debt held by foreign investors, several managers of funds that hold the bonds said. Although the company has a 30-day grace period to pay after the due date, missing the deadline would put Kaisa in technical default, analysts say.

On Thursday evening, a Kaisa representative said he didn't know whether the company had paid. More than two dozen foreign fund companies ranging from BlackRock Inc. to Fidelity Investments and Lion Global Investors owned Kaisa debt in recent months, according to Thomson Reuters, although it isn't clear how many currently hold the debt. BlackRock and Fidelity declined to comment, while a spokesperson for Lion Global, a Singapore-based fund company, said it has sold its holdings.

Several fund managers said that the situation is heightening market fears, making foreign investors wary of Chinese property bonds overall and anxious about whether other seemingly healthy companies in the sector could melt down as well. Kaisa's difficulties, which appear to stem from government intervention in a real-estate company, have added to concern about the risk of investing in Chinese bonds more broadly.

 Within a four-week period, we had this almost collapsing situation in Kaisa's operating profile, which would heighten investors' sensitivity to the sector," said Charles Macgregor, Asia head at the credit-research firm Lucror Analytics.

A default, if confirmed, would be the more shocking because it was so unexpected, investors say. Kaisa was seen as in good financial shape, with a healthy portfolio of commercial and residential projects, strong sales and solid cash flow that had made its bonds popular with investors. Kaisa's net profit in the first half of 2014 the latest figures available rose 30% versus the previous year to 1.33 billion yuan ($214 million), with revenue of 6.79 billion yuan. As of June 30, the 16-year-old company, which is listed on the Hong Kong exchange, had cash of 9.38 billion yuan versus short-term debt of 6 billion yuan.

But during the space of the past few months, the Shenzhen government has blocked approvals of Kaisa developments and property sales in the city, home to some of its major developments actions the company said in a Dec. 21 statement could have  an adverse impact on cash flow." Kaisa's founder and long-time chairman, Kwok Ying Shing, has quit, along with a number of top executives and board members. Neither the government nor Kaisa executives have offered explanations.

On Jan. 1, the developer said it defaulted on a $51.6 million loan from HSBC Holdings PLC, and credit raters Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service have downgraded Kaisa's debt from just below investment grade to ratings that reflect an expected default. Kaisa's bond prices have plunged more than 80% since the end of November, and are now trading at around 33 cents on the dollar. Its stock price has fallen more than 60% to 1.59 Hong Kong dollars over the same period.

Trading in the stock has been halted since Dec. 29.

Many Chinese property companies are heavily indebted, struggling with a weak housing market and difficulties in raising cash to pay back loans. Worries are mounting over the impact of China's economic slowdown and the rising amount of debt among local government-connected financing vehicles, though recent government efforts to ease funding conditions have relieved some concerns. China has $55.7 billion in offshore property debt, according to Dealogic, a data-tracking company.

Kaisa, founded by Mr. Kwok in 1999, seemed to be one of the sector's stronger firms. The company has grown rapidly over the past few years: It employed about 9,500 people as of the middle of last year, up from 2,700 in 2009. In the first 11 months of last year, Kaisa's sales totaled 3.72 billion yuan, double the amount in the same period in 2013.

The company was ranked No. 1 in residential-property sales in Shenzhen during the first half of 2014, according to SZHome.com, an industry website.

Current and former employees say the company emphasizes efficiency and encourages employees to make simple decisions, such as the approval of subcontractors or expenses, within four hours. Industry insiders say that Kaisa has a reputation for finishing large projects within a year, a pace that is faster than the industry average.

In October, however, the Chinese government said a high-ranking Communist Party official who had been associated with Shenzhen's Longgang district, where Kaisa is developing several big projects, had been placed under investigation. State media later said the investigation was related to corruption in real estate. Some Chinese media also reported that Mr. Kwok had been detained or was unreachable, which the company denied.

In late November, Kaisa discovered that some sales and construction had been blocked by the Shenzhen government, the company said in a December statement. Later, it found that other approvals and projects had been blocked as well. Authorities in Longgang notified Kaisa in December that it had suspended processing of approvals and applications for all of the company's construction projects in the district, Kaisa said.

At one of those projects in Longgang the Kaisa City Plaza staff at a sales center containing a grand staircase, marble floors, crystal chandeliers, gold-plated bathroom fixtures and a small projection theater were still showing around prospective buyers on a recent afternoon. As the sound of whirring saws rose from inside the development, employees said Kaisa could finish work on existing structures but could no longer sell property or begin new construction.

Outside the complex, some homeowners had gathered looking for information, with one saying she was nervous about her recent purchase of a three-bedroom apartment there. The homeowners said they had received little information from Kaisa about the state of their properties.

One woman, who asked to be identified only by her surname, Ye, said she had bought property from Kaisa two years ago, and is confident the current problems will be resolved.  Kaisa is well known," she said.  The quality of their housing is good and their locations are good. I'm still coming to look."

Shenzhen real-estate developer Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. likely became one of the first Chinese property companies to default on offshore bonds Thursday. An earlier version of this story incorrectly said it would be the first to do so. In 2009, Chinese property firm Neo-China Land Group Ltd. missed a coupon payment for offshore bonds. [Jan. 12]

If You Need a Car Loan, Try to Be Smart About It

Car buyers are taking out loans more frequently, borrowing more and planning to repay over longer periods. They re also missing payments at the highest level since the recession, according to Moody sAnalytics.

Before doing the same, take a few steps to protect yourself. For one, ask the dealership s financing office to beat the lowest rate you qualify for from other lenders, and avoid borrowing so much that normal depreciation could soon leave the car worth less than the loan balance.

Make a significant down payment, which can offer protection against the car losing value. And if you opt for add-ons that dealers often offer, such as extended warranties, don t add the cost to the loan balance. That also could increase the risk that you will owe more than the car is worth.

Lenders originated nearly 19.2 million car loans and leases in the first nine months of 2014, up 4.7% from the same period a year prior and 64.1% from that period in 2009, during the financial crisis, according to credit-reporting firm Equifax. The borrowing totaled $391.6 billion, up 7% from a year prior and 86.3% from 2009.

Car dealers are arranging many of the loans. Just over 76% of new-car transactions during the first 11 months of 2014 involved loans or leases through dealerships, according to Edmunds.com, which tracks car sales and financing. That figure was 65% in all of 2009.

The average loan amount for a new car in the third quarter of 2014 was $27,799, up 4% from the same period a year prior and up 22% from 2009, according to Experian Automotive, a unit of credit-reporting firm Experian.

Nearly 24% of new-car loans in the quarter had repayment periods of 73 to 84 months, up from 16% just two years earlier.

Car Loans See Rise In Missed Payments

Borrowers who took out auto loans over the past year are missing payments at the highest level since the recession, fueling concerns among regulators, analysts and some in the car industry that practices that helped boost 2014 light-vehicle sales to a near-decade high could backfire.

"It's clear that credit quality is eroding now, and pretty quickly," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sAnalytics.

More than 2.6% of car-loan borrowers who took out loans in the first quarter of last year had missed at least one monthly payment by November, the highest level of early loan trouble since 2008, when such delinquencies rose above 3%, according to an analysis of data performed for The Wall Street Journal by Moody'sAnalytics.

The uptick comes amid an increase in subprime auto loans, raising concerns that car buyers may have taken on more debt than they can handle. For that set of borrowers, defined as consumers with a credit score lower than 620, loan performance also is deteriorating.

More than 8.4% of borrowers with weak credit scores who took out loans in the first quarter of 2014 had missed payments by November, according to the Moody's analysis of Equifax credit-reporting data. That was the highest level since 2008, when early delinquencies for subprime borrowers rose above 9%.

Car lenders say the concerns are overstated. "Auto loans continue to perform well, as they did during the recession," said Bill Himpler, executive vice president of the American Financial Services Association, which represents auto lenders. "Concerns about a spike in delinquencies have not been substantiated by evidence."

Overall auto-loan delinquencies have been running above year-ago levels but remain lower than during the recession. As of the third quarter, 3.4% of borrowers had missed at least one car-loan payment. That was up from 3.2% in the same quarter a year earlier but still below 4.2% in 2009, according to Experian Automotive.

Consumer advocates, meanwhile, say car dealers and finance companies are being overly aggressive with low-income borrowers, pushing them to the limits of what they can afford.

They point to borrowers like Patrina Thomas, 48 years old, from the Syracuse, N.Y., area. She said she was persuaded by a local car dealer to trade in her 2002 Jeep in the summer 2013 in favor of a used 2008 Chrysler Sebring, sold for more than $17,000 and financed with a 20.4% interest rate. Unable to make the $385-a-month payment, the car was repossessed last year.

"Now my credit is ruined," said Ms. Thomas, who still owes more than $7,600 on the car. "I can't buy a house for a while."

Ms. Thomas's auto loan was financed by Chrysler Capital, a joint venture between the auto maker and Santander Consumer USA Holdings, a unit of Banco Santander SA.

A spokeswoman for Santander declined to comment on the case or on the company's delinquency rates.

According to third-quarter 2014 data from Experian, the industry leaders, excluding financing arms of car manufacturers, are Ally Financial Inc., with 7.31% of new-car loans, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. with 5.96%, Capital One Financial Corp. with 4.38%, Wells Fargo & Co. with 3.46% and TD Bank with 2.33%. In the used-car market, the leaders are Wells Fargo at 6.56%, Ally at 4.41% and Capital One at 4.35%.

Ally Financial reported $355 million of its outstanding consumer car loans as nonperforming as of Sept. 30, according to its Securities and Exchange Commission filing. That is up 7.9% from the end of 2013. Its net charge-offs for car loans -- the amount it is writing off as a loss because it doesn't expect to be paid back -- were $341 million for the nine months ended Sept. 30, up 18% from a year earlier.

The increase in losses "is related to growth in the consumer portfolio as well as our strategy to diversify the business and book a more balanced mix of assets," said Gina Proia, a spokeswoman for Ally. "The increase in losses was expected and in line with our expectations. We continue to have a robust underwriting policy and price for risk appropriately."

Of the 15 biggest U.S. auto-lending banks, Santander had the largest percentage of delinquent auto loans in the third quarter, according to SNL Financial. Santander's delinquency rate of 16.7% was followed by Capital One at 6.6%, according to SNL.

In general, the auto-finance sector is one of the fastest-growing lending markets since the financial crisis, with outstanding loan balances hitting $943.8 billion at the end of September, from $809 billion two years earlier, according to the Federal Reserve.

Since such loans have performed well in the past, lenders have been more willing to take risks on auto lending, while staying cautious on home mortgages, analysts say.

Of particular concern are loans in which car dealers push financing at extended terms of six and seven years at relatively high interest rates, even if the borrowers have weak credit and escalated debt-to-income ratios. The longer loan terms keep monthly payments under control and get buyers to purchase more expensive cars.

Low-interest rates and wider credit availability have helped propel the U.S. auto industry's comeback from the recession, driving new-car sales to 16.5 million last year, the highest level since 2006, according to market researcher Autodata Corp.

To keep the momentum going in 2015, industry analysts said car companies and lenders will likely have to push more aggressive finance deals and tap borrowers with weaker credit. Riskier lending tactics already are drawing regulatory scrutiny.

Federal bank regulators observed that lenders were weakening standards and taking on more risks about two years ago, said Darrin Benhart, deputy comptroller of supervision risk management for the Office of Comptroller of Currency, which regulates the largest U.S. banks. "We're putting banks on notice that we have concerns," Mr. Benhart said. "It's definitely an area that warrants some attention."

Several state and federal agencies also are investigating industry practices, particularly for subprime borrowers. The Justice Department last year sent subpoenas to Ally, General Motors Financial Inc. and Santander Consumer USA. The subpoenas ask them to turn over documents related to subprime-lending businesses.

Inhaler developer Vectura was among the biggest small-cap gainers this week, amid growing optimism over its royalty revenue. Shares in the group jumped 16.4 per cent after Novartis said it had sought US regulatory approval for two asthma inhalers that use Vectura licences. If approval is granted, it would trigger an estimated 10m in milestone payments for Vectura as well as a 5 per cent royalty stream on the drugs, which Investec Securities believes could generate peak US annual sales of 500m. Investec estimated that the Novartis drugs now have a 90 per cent chance of making it to market.

Shares in Quindell, the legal claims processor, jumped 80.3 per cent even though investors await updates on potential disposals and an independent review of the company's accounts. Retail shareholders seemed encouraged by stakebuilding by Toscafund, Martin Hughes' hedge fund, and speculation that Jim Sutcliffe, the former Old Mutual chief executive, might become chairman.

Fashion website boohoo.com lost 42 per cent of its value after it issued a profit warning just 10 months on from its flotation. Lumpy sales patterns around Black Friday and heavy discounting by UK rivals were blamed for cutting its sales growth guidance in half.

Shares in Asia Resource Minerals tumbled 43.4 per cent after the coal miner formerly known as Bumi warned that a boardroom coup attempt by former chairman Samin Tan might jeopardise the refinancing of its debt. Chairman Bob Kamandanu later resigned with immediate effect.

Sirius Minerals shares hit after potash project delay

Shares in Sirius Minerals fell this week after the company signalled a likely delay in winning approval for its potash mining project in North Yorkshire, writes James Wilson.

Gaining permission for a mine in a UK national park was never expected to be straightforward. Sirius is having to submit further environmental details to national park planning authorities this month and, while the company remains confident of winning approval, a decision is now unlikely until at least May - later than the company had previously thought. It is also after elections, which could see the make-up of the park's planning committee change.

The miner must also await a decision from another planning authority, where it wants to build port facilities. Broker WH Ireland called the delay a disappointment but a "temporary setback" and said the project seemed to have strong local support. Shares ended the week more than 8 per cent lower.

Petroceltic faces new battle as shareholder targets chief

Senior management at Petroceltic International are under renewed siege from the company's leading investor, which this week requisitioned a general meeting aimed at removing its chief executive, Brian O'Cathain, writes Michael Kavanagh.

The move follows disputes and public spats over the past year with Worldview Capital, a hedge fund run by Angelo Moskov.

Objections from Worldview, which holds 28 per cent of the oil and gas explorer, to the terms of a $100m placing last summer were eventually overcome at the expense of a boardroom cull in July.

That was followed by the successful selldown by Petroceltic of a stake in the Ain Tsila gas project in Algeria - the company's main asset - that led to a modest recovery in its share price.

However, the collapse of an approach valued close to 500m for Petroceltic from Dragon Oil, during the early stages of autumn's oil price collapse, resulted in the company's shares falling from a high of 224p in October to 98.50p by December. Shares now stand up on December's 98.5p 52-week low, at 125p.

WANdisco stock soars on back of British Gas contract

Shares in WANdisco, the Sheffield-to-Silicon Valley technology business, soared 10 per cent on Friday to 525p after British Gas agreed to buy three years' worth of access to the group's flagship "big data" product, writes Sally Davies and Kate Burgess.

The contract for the subscription is worth $750,000 - a small proportion of WANdisco's $5m in the first half of 2014, but a sign that the Aim-quoted company can convince businesses to fork out for software that captures and crunches data in real time to help deliver clever insights.

The last 12 months have been choppy for big data companies, who have struggled to convince C-suite executives to commit money beyond mere proof-of-concept pilots.

WANdisco, whose shares have dived 60 per cent from February highs, makes most of its money by helping people collaborate on files at a distance. But it is pinning its hopes on analytics products that it launched in 2014, and recently signed a deal with Capital One, a big US bank, to provide big data services.

Macquarie in talks to buy 100 aircraft in $4bn Dublin deal

Macquarie is in exclusive talks to buy 100 aircraft from Dublin-based aviation leasing company Awas for more than $4bn, signalling the continued appetite among investors for exposure to Asia's booming aviation market.

The Australian banking group faced fierce competition for the lessor's aircraft, given the difficulty in securing delivery slots from Boeing and Airbus for new jets. Both manufacturers have such hefty backlogs in orders for new and re-engined aircraft, that customers now have to wait several years before taking ownership of their jets.

Macquarie is interested in the newer aircraft owned by Awas, according to a person close to the situation. The group's private equity owner, Terra Firma Capital Partners, is understood to have looked at floating the aircraft lessor last year, but decided instead to take advantage of rising prices for narrow-body jets.

Nevertheless a $4bn price tag was at the lower end of expectations when news of the disposal first emerged last year. The sale also comes just a month after rival lessor, Avolon Holdings, completed its $1.6bn flotation in New York.

Awas is one of the world's top 10 lessors with more than 300 aircraft from both Boeing and Airbus in its fleet. Analysts have speculated that Terra Firma could float the remaining leasing business with at least 200 planes at some stage in the future.

Neither Macquarie nor Terra Firma were available for comment.

The disposal is timed to profit from a leasing boom as companies seek capacity to serve rapidly growing demand for air travel in Asia. More than 50 per cent of the new routes over the next 20 years are expected to connect with the Asia-Pacific region, according to the Airbus Global Market Forecast. Asia will account for almost 32 per cent of global passenger traffic by 2017, from 28 per cent in 2012, according to the International Air Transport Association.

Such strong demand has prompted a flurry of aircraft orders by airlines in the region, and leasing companies such as Awas and BOC Aviation which lease aircraft, often to fast-growing low-cost airlines.

"For the next two decades Asia will require a huge number of aircraft deliveries but a lot of Asian airlines can't [afford to] buy them so that's why there is so much leasing," said Shukor Yusof, founder of Endau Analytics, a Malaysia-based aviation consultancy.

Four months ago BOC Aviation, the aircraft leasing subsidiary of Bank of China, made its biggest single order for aircraft with the purchase of 82 Boeing jets for $8.8bn.

Macquarie AirFinance, the Australian bank's aircraft leasing unit, is set to buy new aircraft as well as some still under order by Awas.

Stocks struggle after US payrolls data

Friday 15:20 GMT. Wall Street is edging back after two days of strong gains and short-term Treasury bond prices are moving higher after new data showed continued improvement in the US jobs market is yet to spark wage inflation.

The Labor Department said a net 252,000 positions were created in December, beating expectations for a 240,000 gain, and the unemployment rate fell from 5.8 to 5.6 per cent.

Average earnings unexpectedly fell 0.2 per cent, meaning that even though the labour market is enjoying its best year since 1999, the Federal Reserve will feel little pressure to increase interest rates quickly in order to address any building wage inflation.

"The December employment report represents the best of all worlds, in that it solidifies the picture of steadily tightening labour market conditions with retreating wage pressures," said Anthony Karydakis, chief economic strategist at Miller Tabak.

"Disappointing as the latter may be in its essence, the bottom line is that today's report alleviates any concerns about a Fed rate hike over, at least, the next three meetings."

But Wall Street could not maintain an early rally, and the S&P 500 has edged back 0.3 per cent to 2,055. In Europe, the FTSE Eurofirst 300 is 0.9 per cent lower.

Both barometers had rallied strongly in the past two days as concerns faded about the eurozone's economy and political cohesion, and traders hoped for more stability in the oil market.

But Brent crude, which this week fell to a five-year low of $49.66 a barrel on fears of oversupply, is down 1.5 per cent on the day to $50.20 and this is again causing some tension.

Meanwhile, because of the decline in US wage growth, traders are experiencing the somewhat unusual sight of bonds rallying alongside equities despite some upbeat economic news.

Analysts do not think the falling cost of labour will shift the expected timing of the Fed's first rate hike significantly from the middle of this year, but it does remove pressure for the monetary guardian to act more aggressively.

Ten-year Treasury yields are down 1 basis point to 2.00 per cent and the more policy-sensitive 2-year yield is off 4bp on the session at 0.57 per cent.

In contrast, the European Central Bank is expected to deliver more stimulus at its meeting later this month in order to ensure the bloc does not endure a prolonged period of deflation.

Ten-year German Bund yields are barely changed at 0.52 per cent and the 2-year yield is off 1bp at minus 0.11 per cent.

Such a wide yield differential in favour of US assets has been lifting the dollar of late and hurting the euro. The dollar index (DXY), which measures the buck against a weighted basket of its peers, closed on Thursday at it highest level since November 2005.

But it is down 0.2 per cent to 92.17 as sterling gains 0.4 per cent to $1.5145 after better than expected UK manufacturing output data. The yen is up 0.5 per cent versus the buck at Y119.00 and the euro is 20 pips higher at $1.1812. Gold is up $9 to $1,218 an ounce.

Data released on Friday in China show that worries about disinflation turning into deflation are not confined to the ECB.

Soft demand and falling commodity costs caused factory-gate prices in China to fall for a 34th consecutive month in December.

"The housing slump has cut demand for iron ore, energy and other commodities," noted analysts at Moody'sAnalytics.

Rising food prices led consumer inflation to tick up to 1.5 per cent, versus a five-year low of 1.4 per cent in November. But Beijing targets consumer prices inflation at 3.5 per cent.

Prashant Newnaha, economist at TD Securities, said food prices would probably be volatile ahead of the Chinese new year but they were unlikely to become an issue this year "as prices of agricultural commodities remain low".

The Shanghai Composite index was twitchy, jumping 3 per cent to a five-year high on speculation of more monetary easing by Beijing, before closing down 0.2 per cent.

The mood across much of the Asian region was pretty chipper, however, with traders buoyed by Wall Street's overnight surge.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 1.6 per cent, led by a jump in energy stocks, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index climbed 0.4 per cent. Japan's Nikkei 225 was restricted to a gain of 0.2 per cent as the firmer yen hobbled some exporters.

A Bitcoin believer on its perils and its potential

Bitcoin is dangerous and people should steer away from using it. This is a bearish opinion held by many traditional investors, but not one you would expect from the man responsible for turning the virtual currency into a commodity worth billions.

Yet, that is the view of Gavin Andresen, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, the closest thing to a central bank for the nascent cryptocurrency. He is considered the leading custodian of the Bitcoin code, the rules and software used to run the cryptocurrency. But far from being a cheerleader, Mr Andresen, is warning ordinary people to avoid bitcoin - for now.

"It actually is dangerous and people should be aware it's like the early internet," he tells the Financial Times. "If you lived through time, you remember lots of press articles came out saying don't give internet companies your credit card details. But the internet grew past that. Bitcoin will be the same way. Over time, I will stop saying to people, 'Don't use it unless you're technically proficient enough to keep your computer secure'."

Concerns about security were heightened on Monday after Bitstamp, Europe's leading bitcoin exchange, suspended its operations following an apparent hack that led to the company losing 19,000 bitcoins, worth about $5m.

These safety issues have led to a steady fall in the price of the cryptocurrency. At its peak, bitcoin was traded for $1,240 on the Mt Gox exchange, the Japanese group that filed for bankruptcy last year after losing about $450m worth of Bitcoin in a cyber attack. According to Coindesk, the bitcoin news site, the price is now about $283.

"Bitstamp is handling the incident well," Mr Andresen says, by being transparent and explaining to customers what happened. "I hope they take the time to publish a complete postmortem on details of the attack, so other exchanges can learn from their mistakes.

"I hope Mt Gox does the same because we still don't know what happened."

Mr Andresen is considered the protg to "Satoshi Nakamoto", the name adopted by the supposed inventor of bitcoin. After collaborating on the project over email, Mr Andresen was given Mr Nakamoto's blessing to become the "core maintainer" of the bitcoin source code, working full time on the project.

While Nakamoto appears to have vanished, Mr Andresen wields huge influence on the development of the currency. He helped to found the Bitcoin Foundation in 2012 and groups from financial regulators to the CIA seek his advice.

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.

<>His knowledge of bitcoin has led to suggestions he may actually be Nakamoto. "I am not Satoshi," he laughs. "Ask any geek. Point them to code written by Satoshi and point them to code written by me. You can tell, they're not the same guy."

His theory is that the inventor is "a young academic type, somewhere in the world. I don't think Japan. Perhaps the British Isles actually because in Satoshi's communications he [used British rather than American spellings]. I think there's an academic thinking about other stuff, sitting on a big pile of Bitcoin."

The one person who Mr Andresen says is definitely not Satoshi Nakamoto is Dorian S. Nakamoto, the Japanese-American engineer that Newsweek named as Bitcoin's inventor last year. Mr Nakamoto, who lives in California, denies any role in Bitcoin.

"He's not the Satoshi I talked to," says Mr Andresen. "I feel sorry for Dorian that so much personal attention got focused on this person. That shows why the actual Satoshi has worked so hard to stay anonymous."

His influence at the Bitcoin Foundation could soon increase, after it emerged Jim Harper, its global policy counsel, was dismissed earlier this month. The move is seen as a shift in focus for the non-profit group away from policy and regulation and back towards developing Bitcoin's core technology.

"It is always hard when an organisation pivots and priorities change," he said. "Effective organisations have a clear mission and focus and there is plenty of work to be done on the technical front to keep the foundation busy."

Though Mr Andresen concedes Bitcoin remains in the early days of its development, he is confident it will mature, noting that more than $300m of venture money had been invested in Bitcoin start-ups in 2014.

Mr Andresen is also at the forefront of efforts to ready the virtual currency for wider use. As it is currently designed, the bitcoin network can process just seven transactions a second. By comparison, Visa is capable of handling close to 50,000 transaction a second at peak times.

Mr Andresen's proposed solution is to increase the size of bitcoin blocks, the files that hold the data that underpins the currency. Their size limits the speed at which the bitcoin network can process transactions. Larger blocks can contain more transactions and, therefore, increase the capacity of the network.

But there are concerns that increasing the block size will put a strain on the network. Bigger blocks packed with more transactions requires transmitting and storing more data. This may also make it difficult for hobbyists to store a full copy of the "blockchain", centralising power in the hands of corporations that can afford expensive servers in big data centres.

The issue is being debated by bitcoin developers. But Mr Andresen says that "we're really close to consensus" to approve his proposal, a move that "in 20 years, would allow us to have enough capacity to handle every single electronic transaction in the world".

While Mr Andresen tries to prepare bitcoin for mass usage, he advises caution to investors. He holds thousands of bitcoins, enough to retire comfortably. But he has been cashing them in slowly, investing in stock market funds instead.

"Bitcoin is wild and crazy investment that I'm diversifying out of all the time," he says. "If bitcoin is wildly successful, I'm still holding on to a good chunk of bitcoin. It could be worth tens of millions of dollars, but it could be worth zero. It doesn't make sense to hold more than that amount. I don't have a desire to be a multi-billionaire. That's not what motivates me, I have no desire to be filthy rich."

Global Finance: Worry Over Chinese Bonds --- Investors Say Kaisa, a Shenzhen Developer, Appears to Default on Offshore Debt

Corrections & Amplifications

Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd., a Shenzhen real-estate developer, last week became one of the first Chinese property companies to default on offshore bonds. A Money & Investing article Friday incorrectly said it would be the first to do so.

(WSJ January 15, 2015)

(END)

SHENZHEN, China -- A Shenzhen real-estate developer with seemingly sound finances likely became the first Chinese property company to default on offshore bonds Thursday, in a development that is raising concerns among global investors.

Kaisa Group Holdings Ltd. appears to have missed interest payments due on $500 million of debt held by foreign investors, several managers of funds that hold the bonds said. Although the company has a 30-day grace period to pay after the due date, missing the deadline would put Kaisa in technical default, analysts say.

On Thursday evening, a Kaisa representative said he didn't know whether the company had paid. More than two dozen foreign fund companies, ranging from BlackRock Inc. to Fidelity Investments and Lion Global Investors, owned Kaisa debt in recent months, according to Thomson Reuters, although it isn't clear how many currently hold the debt. BlackRock and Fidelity declined to comment, while a spokesperson for Lion Global, a Singapore-based fund company, said it has sold its holdings.

Several fund managers said the situation is heightening market fears, making foreign investors wary of Chinese property bonds overall and anxious about whether other seemingly healthy companies in the sector could melt down as well. Kaisa's difficulties, which appear to stem from government intervention in a real-estate company, have added to concern about the risk of investing in Chinese bonds more broadly.

"Within a four-week period, we had this almost collapsing situation in Kaisa's operating profile, which would heighten investors' sensitivity to the sector," said Charles Macgregor, Asia head at the credit-research firm Lucror Analytics.

A default, if confirmed, would be the more shocking because it was so unexpected, investors say. Kaisa was seen as in good financial shape, with a healthy portfolio of commercial and residential projects, strong sales and solid cash flow that had made its bonds popular with investors. Kaisa's net profit in the first half of 2014, the latest figures available, rose 30% from the previous year to 1.33 billion yuan ($214 million), with revenue of 6.79 billion yuan. As of June 30, the 16-year-old company, which is listed on the Hong Kong exchange, had cash of 9.38 billion yuan versus short-term debt of six billion yuan.

But during the space of the past few months, the Shenzhen government has blocked approvals of Kaisa developments and property sales in the city, home to some of its major developments -- actions the company said in a Dec. 21 statement could have "an adverse impact on cash flow." Kaisa's founder and longtime chairman, Kwok Ying Shing, has quit, along with a number of top executives and board members. Neither the government nor Kaisa executives have offered explanations.

On Jan. 1, the developer said it defaulted on a $51.6 million loan from HSBC Holdings PLC, and credit raters Standard & Poor's and Moody's Investors Service have downgraded Kaisa's debt from just below investment grade to ratings that reflect an expected default. Kaisa's bond prices have plunged more than 80% since the end of November and are now trading at around 33 cents on the dollar.

Trading in the stock has been halted since Dec. 29.

Many Chinese property companies are heavily indebted, struggling with a weak housing market and difficulties in raising cash to pay back loans. Worries are mounting over the impact of China's economic slowdown and the rising amount of debt among local government-connected financing vehicles, though recent government efforts to ease funding conditions have relieved some concerns. China has $55.7 billion in offshore property debt, according to Dealogic, a data-tracking company.

Kaisa, founded by Mr. Kwok in 1999, seemed to be one of the sector's stronger firms. The company has grown rapidly over the past few years: It employed about 9,500 people as of the middle of last year, up from 2,700 in 2009. In the first 11 months of last year, Kaisa's sales totaled 3.72 billion yuan, double the amount in the same period in 2013.

The company was ranked No. 1 in residential-property sales in Shenzhen during the first half of 2014, according to SZHome.com, an industry website.

Current and former employees say the company emphasizes efficiency and encourages employees to make simple decisions, such as the approval of subcontractors or expenses, within four hours. Industry insiders say that Kaisa has a reputation for finishing large projects within a year, a pace that is faster than the industry average.

In October, however, the Chinese government said a high-ranking Communist Party official who had been associated with Shenzhen's Longgang district, where Kaisa is developing several big projects, had been placed under investigation. State media later said the investigation was related to corruption in real estate. Some Chinese media also reported that Mr. Kwok had been detained or was unreachable, which the company denied.

In late November, Kaisa discovered that some sales and construction had been blocked by the Shenzhen government, the company said in a December statement. Later, it found that other approvals and projects had been blocked as well. Authorities in Longgang notified Kaisa in December that it had suspended processing of approvals and applications for all of the company's construction projects in the district, Kaisa said.

At one of those projects in Longgang, the Kaisa City Plaza, staff at a sales center containing a grand staircase, marble floors, crystal chandeliers, gold-plated bathroom fixtures and a small projection theater were still showing around prospective buyers on a recent afternoon.

Outside, one buyer said she was nervous about her recent purchase of a three-bedroom apartment there. The homeowners said they had received little information from Kaisa about the state of their properties.

One woman, who asked to be identified only by her surname, Ye, said she had bought property from Kaisa two years ago, and is confident the current problems will be resolved.

"Kaisa is well known," she said. "The quality of their housing is good, and their locations are good. I'm still coming to look."

Tech
Box Moves Ahead With IPO; Delayed Offering Now Values Online-Storage Company at More Than $1.5 Billion

After months of delays, the initial public offering for online storage company Box Inc. is finally a go.

Box said Friday that it plans to register as many as 14.4 million shares, expected to price between $11 and $13 a share, and expects to raise as much as $186.9 million. It began its road show pitching the stock to investors, putting it on track to have its shares trading by the end of January.

The company plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol  BOX. 

The IPO would value Box at more than $1.5 billion. The company said in its filing that it expects to receive about $134.3 million in net proceeds that it plans to use for general purposes.

Bankers typically set a low bar for the initial proposed IPO stock price range, and raise the value as they get a better sense of investor demand.

Box "http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303949704579459733057858894" and "http://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303948104579534260019942516" amid weakening demand for business-software stocks and skepticism stemming from the company s high rate of spending on sales and marketing.

As it prepares to go public, the Los Altos, Calif., company will seek to show investors it has reined in costs without sacrificing too much growth.

Box spent 97 cents on sales and marketing for each dollar of revenue it made in the three months ended Oct. 31, down from a ratio of $1.38 to every dollar of revenue when it first filed for an IPO in March of last year. The company s loss narrowed to $45.4 million in the latest quarter from $51.4 million a year earlier.

Box s slowing growth could weigh on the price investors are willing to pay. Revenue rose 70% to $57 million in the most recent period, after growing 81% in the quarter ended July 31 and more than doubling in the year ended Jan. 31.

Chief Executive Aaron Levie also will need to convince investors his company is selling more than just online storage, a market where prices have plummeted because of increasing competition from tech giants like Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp. Box has developed features to let workers collaborate better and has begun tailoring the service to professionals in different industries, such as media and medicine.

Investor enthusiasm for cloud-software companies remains muted. An index of public cloud-computing stocks, which includes companies such as Salesforce.com Inc. and Workday Inc. and is tracked by Bessemer Venture Partners, fell 12% from a peak in February through mid-December.

At the high end of the initial IPO stock price range, Box would have a valuation of about $1.7 billion, including employee stock options and other outstanding equity.

That was below the $2.4 billion valuation TPG and hedge fund Coatue Management placed on the company "http://www.wsj.com/articles/web-storage-startup-box-raises-150-million-as-it-awaits-ipo-1404756635". In that financing, Box agreed it would be required to issue more shares to TPG in the event it sells IPO shares at a lower price than expected.

Box has raised a total of $543 million from a wide pool of investors including Andreessen Horowitz, Bessemer Venture Partners, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, General Atlantic, Salesforce and SAP Ventures.

Draper Fisher Jurvetson owns the largest stake in Box, with a 21.2% ownership after the offering that would be worth about $276 million at the mid-point of the price range. Mr. Levie owns 4% of the company, worth about $49 million at that price.

Tech IPOs have done better recently. Last month, big-data firm Hortonworks Inc. and New Relic Inc., which were both valued at more than $1 billion, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/hortonworks-new-relic-impress-in-debut-1418403087", likely a relief for the bankers and venture-capital firms that previously invested in the startups at hefty valuations.

Corporate News: Cannabis Firm Backed by Thiel's Fund

In another sign of the marijuana industry's legitimization, a holding company for cannabis-related businesses has attracted an investment from early Facebook Inc. backer Founders Fund, whose co-founder Peter Thiel once blasted Twitter Inc. for what he characterized as its "pot-smoking" management.

The holding company's operator, Privateer Holdings Inc., owns businesses including Leafly, a rating and review site for marijuana dispensaries, and Tilray, a company that Privateer built from the ground up to grow and supply medical cannabis in Canada.

Privateer Chief Executive Brendan Kennedy declined to disclose the size of the latest round of funding, but he said a contribution from Founders Fund puts Privateer's fundraising effort close to its $75 million goal. The company said its existing investors include family offices and high-net-worth individuals.

Mr. Kennedy, a former chief operations officer for Silicon Valley Bank affiliate SVB Analytics, launched the company with former executives from SVB and financial advisory firm de Visscher & Co. in 2011, before Denver, Seattle, Oregon, Alaska and the District of Columbia legalized marijuana.

"Part of what we do is build the companies and brands that people can point to as making the case for lifting prohibition," Mr. Kennedy said.

Despite local and state legalization efforts, the federal government still classifies pot as a Schedule 1 controlled substance alongside heroin, LSD, ecstasy, methaqualone and peyote. As a result, banks are often unwilling to provide services to marijuana producers for fear of prosecution, making capital hard to come by.

Privateer's operations include a facility run by Tilray that spans more than 70,000 square feet in British Columbia and produces cannabis for delivery to medical patients there.

In November, Privateer unveiled its Marley Natural business, a planned line of branded marijuana products including cannabis strains and cannabis- and hemp-infused skin creams and lotions, all with the approval of the late reggae singer Bob Marley's estate.

With Marley Natural, Privateer likely will look toward consumers interested in both recreational and therapeutic use wherever legal, Mr. Kennedy has said. He said Tilray is on a short list of five companies for government-licensed growing operations in Uruguay, which in 2014 became the first country in the world to establish a system regulating the production, sale and consumption of recreational marijuana.

Founders Fund, which raised a $1 billion investment vehicle in early 2014, is the biggest venture-capital player to step into the marijuana space, according to data from Dow Jones VentureSource. The marijuana industry generally hasn't found favor with established venture capitalists.

Groups of individual "angel" investors have previously contributed to the likes of Greenway University Inc., a Denver marijuana occupational training school that closed down in 2011 amid accusations of falsified applications. The smaller Dutchess Capital LLC backs cannabis-enthusiast social network MassRoots Inc. and American Cannabis Co., an advisory and consulting firm for the industry.

By contrast, Founders Fund's name has been connected with much bigger startups, as its portfolio includes home-rental service Airbnb Inc., online music service Spotify AB, and Space Exploration Technologies Corp., the space transport company launched by Elon Musk.

Geoff Lewis, the Founders Fund partner who led the firm's investment, said he first became interested in the cannabis industry about two years ago, after a friend with a serious illness was prescribed marijuana in California. The firm got in touch with Privateer in September 2013 while meeting with "scores and scores of other companies," Mr. Lewis said.

Talks were also continuing with Privateer when Mr. Thiel told CNBC in September that Twitter was "a horribly mismanaged company-- probably a lot of pot-smoking going on there." His remarks drew wide attention online and in the media.

Mr. Thiel wasn't available for comment. Both Messrs. Kennedy and Lewis said the remarks didn't cause any stir between Founders and Privateer during their talks.

U.S. News: Government Plan Trims Cost of Some Mortgages

By Joe Light and Nick Timiraos

The Obama administration plans to reduce mortgage costs for hundreds of thousands of borrowers in a move likely to draw the ire of Republican lawmakers, while signaling the next step in the administration's shift from economic triage to policies promoting home ownership.

The plan to cut Federal Housing Administration insurance premiums on mortgages with low down payments would initially save a typical borrower $1,000 a year on a $200,000 loan.

The FHA program is geared toward borrowers who have little cash for down payments, such as first-time home buyers. The FHA doesn't make loans, but insures lenders in case of default on mortgages with down payments of as little as 3.5%. Borrowers must pay for the insurance.

The FHA, which is overseen by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, required a $1.7 billion bailout in 2013, its first in 79 years, after suffering losses from the financial crisis. Since 2008, the government has increased the annual premium for typical FHA borrowers five times to 1.35%. Under the new policy, the premium will be reduced to 0.85%.

"This action will make home ownership more affordable for over two million Americans in the next three years," said HUD Secretary Julian Castro in a statement. "By bringing our premiums down, we're helping folks lift themselves up so they can open new doors of opportunity."

Republican lawmakers contend the FHA doesn't have enough capital to withstand future housing downturns, adding that there is the potential for taxpayers to take a hit in another housing slump.

"Apparently 2008 was not enough of a wake-up call for this administration," said Rep. Scott Garrett (R., N.J.). "The FHA is basically broke as it is."

Getting a mortgage is too difficult for many Americans, say administration officials.

With a housing recovery under way, albeit in fits and starts, the White House has shifted its focus toward improving access to credit for many families that face tighter mortgage standards and sluggish wage growth.

During the past few years, lenders have said that Justice Department litigation and draconian regulatory penalties have led them to give loans to only pristine borrowers, even if riskier borrowers would qualify for government backing.

The FHA has been pressing to clarify the consequences to lenders for making mistakes on loans it insures.

In another move designed to boost lending, the regulator of mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in October announced the companies would back home loans with down payments of as little as 3%, putting them in competition with the FHA program.

Some economists say the moves will have a limited impact on the housing market, underscoring the administration's challenge of boosting a sector whose growth has slowed in the past year even as the broader economy has accelerated.

For a typical FHA borrower taking out a $200,000 mortgage, the 0.5-percentage-point reduction initially would reduce a mortgage payment by $1,000 a year, depending on how much of the decrease is passed to borrowers, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sAnalytics. "It's helpful, but it's not a game changer for the housing market," he said.

In the first leg of his national economic tour, President Barack Obama on Wednesday spoke at a Ford Motor Co. assembly plant near Detroit, where he highlighted the success of the government's auto-industry bailout and discussed new efforts to promote advanced manufacturing and innovation.

Thursday's speech marked Mr. Obama's return to Phoenix, where he unveiled an ambitious foreclosure policy during the first month of his presidency.

Few housing markets suffered more than Phoenix during the bust, but among the cities most battered, Phoenix was the first to snap back. Prices, off 56% from the peak, rebounded sharply in 2011, trimming that decline by a third. During the past year, the recovery has stalled, with sales sliding and prices flattening out.

In the absence of legislation, an unlikely alliance that includes small banks, civil-rights groups and hedge funds holding shares of Fannie and Freddie have argued in recent months that the administration should recapitalize the firms.

The administration has said it doesn't support that move absent a broader structural overhaul.

The White House "still has a lot of heavy lifting to do to come up with a bill that addresses the problems of the past and doesn't destroy the mortgage-funding market," said Jim Millstein, a former Treasury official in the Obama administration who oversaw the government's takeover of American International Group Inc.

IPOs' Tailored Metrics Raise Flags

Zoe's Kitchen Inc. is serving up profits -- but only after leaving some of its expenses off the menu.

Zoe's, a chain of 125-plus Mediterranean-theme restaurants that went public in April, reported an adjusted profit of $13.2 million for the first nine months of 2014 under its own accounting treatments that strip out a variety of expenses.

Including those expenses, as is required under standard accounting rules, Zoe's reported a loss of $8.4 million.

It is far from an isolated example. Forty companies went public in 2014 reporting losses under traditional accounting rules but showing profits under their own tailor-made measures. That is 18% of all U.S. initial public offerings for the year, according to consulting firm Audit Analytics, the highest level since at least 2009. Of 2014's 10 biggest IPOs, nine used nonstandard earnings measures alongside the official accounting treatment to some degree.

Many companies prefer highlighting their own customized measures, saying they give investors a better picture of the company. That worries some experts, and the Securities and Exchange Commission has written letters to Zoe's and other companies telling them the bespoke figures they use are given too much prominence in regulatory filings and asking for revisions.

Nonstandard metrics give investors "the best measure" of continuing performance, said Jason Morgan, chief financial officer of Zoe's, who added that the SEC's concerns were addressed in the company's case by revising its prospectus.

But as the IPO market heated up last year, observers have raised fears that companies' increased use of these nonstandard measures could confuse or mislead investors at a time when they are forming their first impression of a company.

"I think it's a sign of frothiness" in the IPO market, said Brandon Rees, deputy director of the AFL-CIO's Office of Investment. "Why investors tolerate it, I don't know."

Some say the costs that companies strip out of their nonstandard measures are increasingly things that should be counted in earnings calculations, such as executive bonuses, fees for stock offerings and acquisition expenses.

"I was just astounded at the wide variety of elements that people thought were appropriate to exclude," said Curtis Verschoor, a DePaul University emeritus professor of accountancy. Investors should be aware that a company's nonstandard numbers "are more likely to be slanted rather than balanced," he said.

Companies must still prominently disclose their earnings under generally accepted accounting principles, the standard set of U.S. accounting rules, even if they also spotlight their earnings under "non-GAAP" measures.

"It's knee-jerk to say that's a place where companies put bad stuff," said Mike Guthrie, chief financial officer of TrueCar Inc., an auto-buying-and-selling platform that went public in May.

For the first nine months of 2014, TrueCar had a $38.6 million loss under standard rules but a $6.6 million profit under "adjusted Ebitda" -- earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, modified further to exclude other costs, such as an $803,000 expense to acquire rights to the company's stock symbol.

Mr. Guthrie said it would be more misleading for the companies not to present adjusted measures; the stock-symbol cost, for instance, was a one-time expense that won't affect TrueCar's future results. TrueCar closed Wednesday at $20.94 a share, up 133% from its IPO price of $9.

According to Audit Analytics data, 59% of the companies that filed for an IPO since 2012 have used nonstandard metrics, compared with 48% in 2010 and 2011.

Many go beyond the items that companies most frequently strip out of their preferred measures, such as employee stock compensation and foreign-exchange gains and losses. A PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP survey found 80% of IPO companies that made adjustments to their Ebitda from 2010 to 2013 had at least one adjustment beyond the more-common strip-outs, though PwC said it couldn't comment on individual companies.

The growth in such reporting by IPO companies comes in part because more technology and service-based companies are coming public. Those companies are more likely to use accounting estimates and subjective measures when compared with traditional bricks-and-mortar companies, said Jay Ritter, a University of Florida finance professor who tracks IPOs.

The SEC has expressed concern in the past about companies' non-GAAP metrics, notably with regard to daily-deals company Groupon Inc. Before Groupon's 2011 IPO, the SEC raised questions about its use of "adjusted consolidated segment operating income," a metric that excluded Groupon's marketing costs to land new subscribers. Groupon scaled back its use of the metric in response to the SEC concerns. Groupon couldn't be reached for comment.

In the past two years, the commission has sent comment letters to more than 30 companies, both pre-IPO companies and those already public, criticizing them for giving nonstandard earnings measures "undue prominence" in their securities filings.

Zoe's received such a letter in January 2014.

Zoe's had mentioned its adjusted Ebitda first in the "management's discussion and analysis" section of its prospectus, four pages before providing an earnings table that followed standard accounting rules. The SEC also questioned Zoe's exclusion of some cash expenses from its adjusted Ebitda, such as the costs of opening new restaurants and management and consulting fees.

Zoe's prospectus had been filed under seal with the SEC at the time, and the company revised its filings to address the "undue prominence" criticism before it filed a public prospectus in March, the company's finance chief, Mr. Morgan, said. Whether the expenses should be excluded "came down to an interpretation" of regulations, and the company didn't change its methodology, he added.

Zoe's stock was at $31.55 a share early afternoon on Thursday, more than twice its IPO price of $15.

Gross Fuels New Fund With His Own Money

After Bill Gross abruptly quit Pacific Investment Management Co., the bond-fund giant he co-founded, in September to join a much smaller rival, the big question was how much money would follow him.

His new firm, Janus Capital Group Inc., subsequently disclosed that investors poured about $1.1 billion into Mr. Gross's new fund in October and November. That money was critical, because it helped push the Janus Global Unconstrained Bond fund past $1 billion in assets under management, a key threshold for large investors, according to industry experts. Despite Mr. Gross's status as a star fund manager, some large pension funds and their consultants have said they couldn't consider a fund with less than $1 billion in assets.

But what Janus didn't tell investors was that, in a previously unreported development, a majority of the money came from a single Southern California brokerage office -- the same office where one of Mr. Gross's personal financial advisers works, according to industry executives who have viewed confidential brokerage data.

The Morgan Stanley wealth-management office in La Jolla, Calif., routed more than $700 million to Mr. Gross's Janus fund in October and November, according to people who viewed brokerage-firm fund-asset data from Albridge, a data firm owned by Bank of New York Mellon Corp. The transfers accounted for more than 60% of the money raised by Mr. Gross in the first few months after he left Pimco.

It isn't clear whether the money originated from one investor or one financial adviser, or from more than one, although Mr. Gross acknowledges at least some of the money came from him. While it isn't unusual for a manager to invest in his own fund, industry executives say it is extremely rare for one firm or office to account for such a large percentage of a prominent fund's incoming cash.

A spokesman for Denver-based Janus said the firm doesn't comment on specific fund shareholders and their investments "as a matter of policy and out of respect for the privacy of the firms we serve and their mutual fund investors." The spokesman also wouldn't comment on how much of the fund is made up of Mr. Gross's money. A spokeswoman for Morgan Stanley declined to comment. A spokesman for Albridge said, "Any data generated from Albridge Analytics' system is confidential and public use of the data is neither authorized nor permitted."

After questions from The Wall Street Journal, Janus Capital on Wednesday tweeted a comment attributed to Mr. Gross. The tweet read: "Thanks @KirstenGrind @WSJ for upcoming article - yes I do believe in and invest in Janus Global Unconstrained Bond Fund!"

Janus declined to comment further.

Mr. Gross, 70 years old, is a billionaire who earned more than $200 million a year before he left Pimco, the giant money manager he helped start four decades ago and then abruptly left in September. His departure shocked the investment community and triggered a scrum for tens of billions of dollars, as rivals tried to poach Pimco's clients. Investors pulled $150 billion from Pimco last year, most of it in the months after Mr. Gross's departure. In the latest example, New York City's five pension funds withdrew nearly $5 billion from Pimco, a spokesman for New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer said Wednesday.

Investors in Janus shares have bet his arrival would help the beleaguered money manager -- which has suffered from years of outflows due to poor performance -- attract investors. Janus's stock jumped 43% on Sept. 26, 2014, the day Mr. Gross's hire was announced, the biggest one-day gain in the company's history. Janus shares have pulled back since then but are still up 11% since he took over the fund in early October, and the firm saw more inflows in October across all of its mutual funds than it has in any single month since 2007, according to data tracker Morningstar Inc.

"Obviously, he's off to a great start raising a lot of attention and assets," Dick Weil, Janus's chief executive, recently said of Mr. Gross.

The La Jolla office of Morgan Stanley is in a small, affluent community just north of San Diego and about 80 miles south of Mr. Gross's Janus office in Newport Beach. The La Jolla office is where one of Mr. Gross's own financial advisers, Robert Inbody, works, according to people familiar with his role. Mr. Inbody referred all queries to Morgan Stanley.

Mr. Gross doesn't live in La Jolla, but it isn't unusual for wealthy individuals to have multiple financial advisers in different locations, say brokers.

Albridge provides data from the four largest financial firms selling mutual funds to investors: Bank of America Merrill Lynch, UBS AG, Wells Fargo & Co. and Morgan Stanley. The data, covering the majority of mutual-fund sales, is provided to clients who pay a fee to subscribe.

In October, according to the Albridge data viewed by industry executives, more than $300 million of total investor inflows into Mr. Gross's Janus fund came from the Morgan Stanley office in La Jolla. According to Morningstar, the fund saw a total of about $360 million of inflows that month, meaning 87% of all new money that came into the fund in Mr. Gross's first full month on the job originated from that office. In November, the office contributed about $400 million out of $770 million in total inflows, according to the people who viewed the Albridge data and Morningstar.

When Mr. Gross took over the fund at Janus in early October, it had just $12 million in assets under management following its launch in May 2014, according to Morningstar. The firm was expected to report new asset totals for December on Wednesday. The fund follows a different strategy than Mr. Gross adhered to while running the Total Return fund at Pimco, allowing him to invest in a variety of bonds and other securities. The fund has lost 1.1% since Mr. Gross took over Oct. 6 through Tuesday, ranking it in the 52nd percentile in its category, according to Morningstar.

Janus rivals such as Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc. appear to have taken a much bigger share of the outflows from Pimco's mutual funds, which totaled about $150 billion in 2014, according to Morningstar's most recent data. Vanguard, for example, saw $10.3 billion flow into its Total Bond Market Index fund in October, the fund's highest monthly inflow on record.

Mr. Gross got a boost in November when George Soros's Soros Fund Management made a $500 million investment, although that amount is run through a separate account at Janus that isn't part of Mr. Gross's mutual fund.

Fund managers are required by a Securities and Exchange Commission regulation to report the amount, within a range, that they invest in mutual funds that they manage. Morningstar shows no investment from Mr. Gross in the fund, though it wasn't clear whether that was due to a potential lag in reporting schedules. Janus declined to comment on its regulatory reporting.

When Mr. Gross ran Pimco's flagship Total Return fund, he regularly invested his own money, according to people familiar with the matter. Before he left Pimco, Mr. Gross held an investment of $1 million or more in the Total Return fund, according to Morningstar.

Mr. Inbody of Morgan Stanley is one of the firm's biggest producers in Southern California, according to people familiar with the matter. His LinkedIn profile says he has been a managing director at the firm since 1971.

COMPANIES
Shareholders push for MSCI to sell indices arm; General financial

Leading shareholders at MSCI are urging the company to consider breaking itself up and putting its stock market indices business on the auction block.

The extent of a rift between the company's management and ValueAct, an activist hedge fund that has taken an 8.3 per cent stake, goes beyond the question of whether ValueAct should be given a board seat, according to people familiar with the situation.

MSCI rejected ValueAct's request for boardroom representation because the fund is encouraging the company to split its indices operations from more recently acquired portfolio management software businesses.

People close to the discussions say ValueAct believes the indices business could be attractive to a strategic buyer, since stock exchanges are aggressively pushing into indexing.

This week, Nasdaq paid $225m for Dorsey Wright , a US index provider and analytics group, and last year the London Stock Exchange outbid MSCI for the Russell family of stock indices in a $2.7bn deal . There is more than $9tn benchmarked against MSCI indices globally, the company says.

At least one other major shareholder, a London value investor called Independent Franchise Partners, shares ValueAct's belief that the company would be better broken up, according to people familiar with its thinking.

Independent Franchise has an 8.6 per cent stake in MSCI. A third leading shareholder is backing ValueAct's push for board representation, although it has not yet taken a view on whether the company should be broken up.

"ValueAct have a good record of being constructive board members," the shareholder said. "At MSCI, there are questions on whether a longstanding management is wedded to a strategy that doesn't make sense, and ValueAct are very thoughtful about the questions they ask."

MSCI has already started building up its defences against the break-up calls, hiring public relations specialists and strengthening its team of bankers to include those expert in responding to activist funds.

Jeff Ubben , founder of ValueAct, went public this week with a letter criticising MSCI management for failing to properly consider putting a ValueAct representative on the board and questioning its strategy. In it, he questioned the company's strategy of tightly integrating portfolio analytics and risk analytics software businesses into the core indexing operations

MSCI, led by chairman and chief executive Henry Fernandez , has been promising to increase investment in the software businesses, and to return $1bn in capital to shareholders by 2016.

International Property: European Rentals Get Another Look

With capital flowing into European real estate at levels unseen since before the crash, some investors are taking a fresh look at rental apartments, a sector that has yet to gain traction on most of the Continent.

In the U.S., the so-called multifamily sector is dominated by huge companies such as Equity Residential and AvalonBay Communities Inc., which own hundreds of thousands of units. But in most of Europe, rental-apartment ownership is fragmented. In the U.K. and France, private landlords typically own only a handful of apartments. In Germany and the Netherlands, corporate landlords are relatively small.

That is beginning to change. In the U.K., France and Spain, institutions are accumulating multifamily properties. While the portfolios they have built are still tiny compared to those of the U.S. giants, the fledgling industry in Europe is being powered by demographic changes, strong real-estate sales, opportunities created by the financial downturn and government actions designed to encourage development.

One sign of growth: foreign investment. In London, for example, a venture of Qatari Diar Real Estate Co. and Delancey is converting the former Olympic village into a massive apartment rental project that could eventually have more than 3,000 units. In Spain, Blackstone Group LP has purchased 4,000 units. The firm may decide to expand the portfolio further; it is still studying the sector, according to people familiar with the plans.

Legal changes also are paving the way. In France, a law passed in 2013 introduced tax breaks that are meant to encourage developers and investors to pair up to build new, purpose-built multifamily buildings, said Vincent Mahe, general counsel at Groupe SNI. The company, which manages about 100,000 homes rented out at market prices and 200,000 government-subsidized homes, closed a 515 million euro ($615 million) fund in June to build 5,000 new multifamily units. It expects to increase the fund to 700 million euros by next summer.

Europe has been slow to develop a U.S.-style multifamily sector partly because the rental properties vary greatly on the Continent. European apartments tend to be older and aren't standardized like the huge apartment complexes found in suburbs throughout the U.S.

What is on the market "is, to say the least, variable in quality," said Adam Challis, head of residential research at property broker JLL.

Germany's multifamily sector is the most mature. Its apartment rental market, the biggest in Europe, got its start after World War II, when local governments built hundreds of thousands of units for residents of cities whose urban centers had been ravaged.

In the early part of this century, local governments, short on cash, sold portfolios of formerly public housing to international investors.

In 2014, institutional investors made some big bets in the German multifamily market. Real-estate firm Deutsche Annington Immobilien SE in December agreed to buy rival Gagfah SA for 3.88 billion euros. The deal, pending a broadly expected shareholder approval, would create the largest landlord in the country, with 350,000 homes.

Pension funds and other institutions also are becoming more comfortable owning multifamily property outside their home countries.

Analysts say part of this is because of fundamentals: Populations are shifting into urban centers, and people in some countries are increasingly renting instead of owning.

Investors bought about $23.5 billion of rental apartments in Europe in 2014 as of Dec. 18, compared with $75 billion in the U.S, according to Real Capital Analytics.

With capital flowing into European real estate at levels not seen since before the crash, some investors are taking a fresh look at rental apartments, a sector that has yet to gain traction on most of the Continent.

In the U.S., the so-called multifamily sector is dominated by huge companies such as Equity Residential and AvalonBay Communities Inc., which own hundreds of thousands of units. But in most of Europe, rental-apartment ownership is fragmented. In the U.K. and France, private landlords typically own only a handful of apartments.

It expects to increase the fund to  700 million by next summer.

SNI's fund, which pulled in investments from mostly French life insurers, shows  something is changing in the way French institutions are looking at residential," Mr. Mah said. The Intermediate Housing Fund will aim to offer investors a yield of 3.5% to 4% annually.

Europe has been slow to develop a U.S.-style multifamily sector partly because the rental properties vary greatly on the Continent. European apartments tend to be older and aren't standardized like the huge apartment complexes found in suburbs throughout the U.S.

What is on the market  is, to say the least, variable in quality," said Adam Challis, head of residential research at property broker JLL.  Compared with North America, even the more developed residential markets like Germany and the Netherlands are still largely biased toward historic, [government-subsidized] housing stock than the higher-quality stock you'd find, for instance, in Boston."

Even though some laws are changing, regulatory factors in Europe still can tend to discourage the growth of a multifamily industry. For instance, in countries including Austria, Denmark, Germany and Sweden, it is hard to evict tenants.

 People need places to live, and you'll find governments can regulate that right heavily," said Marcus Cieleback, head of research at German property firm Patrizia, for which multifamily units make up half of its  14 billion under management.

Still, Germany's multifamily sector is the most mature. Its apartment rental market, the biggest in Europe, got its start after World War II, when local governments built hundreds of thousands of units for residents of cities whose urban centers had been ravaged. In the early part of this century, local governments, short on cash, sold portfolios of formerly public housing to international investors.

The deal, pending a broadly expected shareholder approval, would create the largest landlord in the country, with 350,000 homes.

Pension funds and other institutions also are becoming more comfortable owning multifamily property outside their home countries. Analysts say part of this is because of fundamentals: Populations are shifting into urban centers, and people in some countries are increasingly renting instead of owning. Also, multifamily property has a history of stable, long-term income returns.

Investors bought about $23.5 billion of rental apartments in Europe in 2014 as of Dec. 18, compared with $75 billion in the U.S, according to Real Capital Analytics. In 2013, Europe had $30 billion invested, the data show; the average was $17.2 billion annually since 2007.

Meanwhile, the political winds are changing when it comes to the multifamily sector. For example, the government in the Netherlands is concerned that housing associations created in the 19th century to provide subsidized accommodation to the poor but which now own about 33% of all Dutch homes have too much control over the market. The groups are being encouraged to sell off large portfolios to international investors.

In the U.K., local governments concerned about an acute housing shortage are assisting developers more than in the past. Gatehouse Bank PLC, which is building 927 new private rental homes in the north of England, was able to buy land for the development from local governments at a discounted price. The Greater London Authority placed certain restrictions on the sale of land, allowing Realstar Living, a U.K. subsidiary of Canadian residential investor Realstar Group, to buy it for a price that supported a multifamily development.

 You've got strong long-term trends supporting the sector, which we think is going to professionalize further," said Jos Short, executive chairman at U.K. firm Internos Global Investors, which manages $5.6 billion of real estate and is exploring opportunities in the U.K. and the Netherlands.  And you have some interesting return characteristics. You put all that together andyou've got quite a nice strategy."

M Stanley reveals wealth unit data theft; Banks

US lender says employee stole and published client account details online

Morgan Stanley said that up to 10 per cent of its wealth management clients had their account information stolen by an employee who may have been looking to sell it.

The US bank's wealth management arm has about 3.5m clients. An employee "briefly" published to the internet the account names and numbers of about 900 of those clients.

The employee was fired and the incident reported to law enforcement and regulators, the bank said, adding that there was "no evidence of any economic loss to any client". The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been notified.

A person familiar with the matter said the employee was a financial adviser named Galen Marsh, 30, based in New Jersey. The Wall Street Journal first reported his identity.

The person added that the bank believed Mr Marsh was trying to sell the data. However, Mr Marsh denies this.

Robert Gottlieb, a lawyer at Gottlieb & Gordon, who is representing Mr Marsh, said: "This is an employment matter between Mr Marsh and Morgan Stanley. He has acknowledged that he should not have obtained the account information and has been co-operating with Morgan Stanley to protect the firm and its customers. To be clear, Mr Marsh did not sell nor ever intended to sell any account information. He did not post account information online. Nor did he share any information with anyone. Nor use it for any financial gain. He is devastated by what has occurred and is extremely sorry for his conduct."

The data breach is large: Morgan Stanley operates the second- biggest wealth management operation in the US, behind Merrill Lynch, and serves the equivalent of more than one in 100 Americans, who use brokerage accounts to trade stocks and bonds. But it is dwarfed by several big data breaches in 2014, including the 76m households affected by a hacking incident at JPMorgan Chase.

In that incident, which is believed to have been perpetrated by outside computer hackers, JPMorgan disclosed in October that contact details, but no account numbers or social security numbers, were compromised.

The Morgan Stanley theft shows the difficulties financial institutions have in securing their data against internal threats . Companies have made progress in securing the "perimeter" of their computer systems, according to security companies, but have struggled to reduce the opportunities for employees to steal potentially valuable data.

"The data stolen does not include account passwords or social security numbers," the bank said.

The published account information was discovered on December 27.

ValueAct takes swipe at MSCI as activists flex muscles

MSCI, the stock market indexes company, has become an early target for what is expected to be a wave of hedge fund activism in 2015.

Jeff Ubben, founder of the San Francisco-based hedge fund ValueAct, on Monday attacked the company for the way it has been integrating acquisitions and a failure to grow its market share. ValueAct is one of MSCI's largest shareholders, having amassed a stake of 8.3 per cent, but the company refused to accede to the fund's demand to put a representative on the board.

The public scolding is unusual for Mr Ubben, who normally takes a different tack to higher-profile activists such as Carl Icahn and Bill Ackman and prefers to work behind the scenes to makes changes at his investee companies.

Previous successes where ValueAct had a representative on the board include easing the exit of Steve Ballmer from Microsoft and building Valeant Pharmaceuticals into a major acquisition vehicle.

Mr Ubben's letter comes with a graph showing returns from MSCI stock lagging behind peers including McGraw Hill Financial, owner of S&P indexes, and the London Stock Exchange, which owns FTSE, setting the stage for a fight over the direction of the company.

ValueAct is focusing its battle on MSCI's strategy of tightly integrating recent acquisitions, rather than running them as standalone businesses.

"We have challenged management on its 'One MSCI' strategy of centralising management and in some cases bundling licence contracts across the index, portfolio analytics and risk analytics business lines because we have not seen market share gains in any of the businesses," the letter says.

Mr Ubben says he wrote to MSCI's lead director, Rodolphe Vallee, as a "last resort" after the board's nominating committee did not agree to interview potential ValueAct nominees.

The tabular content relating to this article is not available to view. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience caused.

"The way the MSCI board handled our request for a board seat leaves us with serious concerns about the board's independence from management and alignment with shareholders," he wrote.

MSCI shares were up 8.5 per cent last year compared to an 11.4 per cent gain for the S&P 500 of leading US stocks. The company has a market capitalisation of $5.3bn.

MSCI said on Monday night: "MSCI appreciates and values input from its shareholders, and we regularly interact with them and solicit their feedback. We have had extensive interactions with ValueAct since their initial investment in MSCI over two years ago. The MSCI Board has carefully considered ValueAct's views regarding the company, including their ideas on director representation.

"MSCI has delivered significant value to shareholders, including a total shareholder return of 54 per cent over the past two years and 165 per cent since becoming a public company in November 2007."

Activist hedge funds are flexing their muscles as the annual meeting season approaches in the spring, demanding board representation and threatening to take their case directly to a shareholder vote if they are denied.

Activists have outpaced the rest of the hedge fund industry over the past two years and attracted substantial inflows that are allowing them to take larger positions and target larger companies.

Nasdaq buys US index provider for $225m

Nasdaq is pushing further into indexing and the growing market for exchange traded funds with the purchase of Dorsey Wright, a US index provider and analytics group, as part of a strategy to diversify its business.

The exchange expects that the $225m deal, funded with a mix of debt and cash, will help boost growth in the coming years.

"We see ourselves as a major player in the index space," said Adena Friedman, president of global capital access, technology and insights at Nasdaq. "We believe this is a big part of our strategic future."

Many stock exchange indices are close to new highs, but exchange profits from traditional stock trading remain under pressure from competition and a long-term trend that has seen billions of dollars of funds move from active investment management to more passive strategies, such as ETFs.

In response, exchanges have been boosting ties to index providers as licensing of data offers new sources of growth. Last year, the London Stock Exchange bought the Russell family of stock indices in a $2.7bn deal.

Nasdaq's latest acquisition is a bet on so-called smart beta strategies, which offer an alternative to traditional market capitalisation weighted indices by shifting the index weightings based on certain factors.

Founded in 1987, Dorsey Wright specialises in relative strength indices, which recalibrate based on market performance. They include various asset classes and geographies.

The company licenses the indices to ETF providers PowerShares and First Trust, and sells analytics to retail brokers.

"Assets under management tracking indices are growing at 13 per cent overall. Smart beta growing is at 24 per cent," Ms Friedman said. "We want to make sure we continue to build out our presence there. In our opinion, the next phase in index investment will be from straight passive management to smart beta."

The deal will not affect leverage or Nasdaq's capital return plans. It had suspended share repurchases because of rising debt from acquisitions, but after lowering its leverage, resumed buybacks last year, helping to drive a 21 per cent increase in the stock price.

Asked about some of the larger auctions for index assets, such as the Russell deal, Ms Friedman said a combination of factors including pricing meant that one did not meet Nasdaq's return profile.

The Dorsey Wright purchase is "very easy to digest, very easy to integrate," she said.

Nasdaq has $40bn of assets linked to smart beta indices or a 10 per cent share of the market, now primarily in dividend strategies. Dorsey Wright will add about $5bn of licensed ETF assets and Nasdaq hopes to use its reach and relationships to grow that further.

Dorsey Wright is being sold by Falfurrias Capital Partners, a private equity firm.

Tencent launches China's first online-only bank

A keystroke by Chinese premier Li Keqiang marked the launch of China's first online-only bank, reflecting the government's hope that a new crop of privately owned lenders will expand access to finance for credit-starved smaller borrowers.

WeBank, a joint venture led by Chinese gaming and social network group Tencent Holdings, became the first private bank to start operations under a new pilot, after the banking regulator granted licenses to six such institutions last year. Its name comes from WeChat, Tencent's wildly popular instant messaging and social networking app.

An affiliate of ecommerce heavyweight Alibaba has also been cleared to launch an internet-based bank in partnership with Fosun International.

"We will lower costs for and deliver practical benefits to small clients, while forcing traditional financial institutions to accelerate reforms," Mr Li said at an opening ceremony in Shenzhen, according to the official Xinhua news agency. "It's one small step for WeBank, one giant step for financial reform."

Small, privately owned companies have long struggled to obtain loans from state-owned banks, which prefer lending to larger, state-owned groups. Economists say small and medium-sized companies provide about 60 per cent of China's gross domestic product and about 75 per cent of new jobs.

Tencent and Alibaba plan to exploit a Big Data advantage, using troves of user data to evaluate credit risk of small borrowers. With the press of a button on Sunday, Mr Li sent dispatched a Rmb35,000 ($5,600) loan to a truck driver. Analysts expect most loans will be under Rmb1m.

A key challenge for WeBank and other internet lenders will be attracting deposits. WeBank will be China's first online-only bank and will not have any physical branches, the main channel by which traditional banks draw in funds.

But Alibaba and Tencent have already proven their ability to attract funds into deposit-like money-market funds sold online and through their websites and mobile applications. Both have mobile payment services that enable users to store funds in their accounts.

China's banking regulator recently loosened enforcement of the maximum 75 per cent loan-to-deposit ratio, allowing placements by non-bank financial institutions to count as deposits under the calculation. That will ease the burden of compliance for institutions with small retail deposit bases.

China also unveiled a new deposit insurance scheme last year intended to insure all deposits under Rmb500,000. That should make it easier for upstart lenders to compete for funds with state-owned banks widely viewed as carrying a government guarantee.

The online-only format could streamline customer service in an industry where even simple transactions such as exchanging currency often involve lengthy bureaucracy.

Prior to the pilot programme approval of six privately owned bank, Minsheng Bank was China's only privately owned commercial bank.

Nasdaq to Buy Dorsey Wright for $225 Million; Deal to Add to Exchange Operator s Index Portfolio

Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. agreed to acquire index provider and analytics group Dorsey, Wright & Associates LLC for $225 million, as the exchange operator expands its exchange-traded fund and so-called smart-beta indexing segments to diversify its business.

The deal, which will be funded with a combination of cash on hand and debt, will make Nasdaq s global indexes segment one of the largest providers of the fast-growing smart-beta indexes. Unlike traditional market capitalization weighted indexes, smart-beta shifts the index weightings based on certain factors.

 Our index business has been a strong growth area for Nasdaq over the last decade,  President Adena Friedman said.

The deal is expected to add to the company s earnings after closing and shouldn t affect financial leverage or capital return strategy, Nasdaq said.

Nasdaq will now have DWA s 17 exchange-traded funds in addition to its existing 69 smart-beta ETFs. Its global indexes will have nearly $45 billion assets benchmarked to its smart-beta indexes, and more than $105 billion benchmarked to all Nasdaq Indexes. The acquisition should also have opportunities for licensing, since DWA licenses to ETF providers First Trust and PowerShares.

Nasdaq plans to facilitate international expansion of DWA s services beginning in Canada and Europe. It also intends to enhance DWA s web-advisor and modeling tools, as the market moves toward model-based investing.

In 2012, Nasdaq acquired the index business of Mergent, which has since resulted in licensed asset growth of 100%.

This deal is expected to close in the first quarter.

Bank M&A: small is beautiful

This year's bonus letters have barely been printed but merger and acquisition bankers will already be thinking about next year's payouts. And where better to start than their own sector? Pickings have been thin in recent years. In 2007, there were more than 1,000 deals in the global banking sector adding up to more than $443bn, says Dealogic. In 2014, the deal value shrunk to less than $120bn. Europe has been particularly slow - in 2007 it accounted for more than 60 per cent of deals by value. Last year that proportion fell to just 31 per cent.

But the M&A bankers might do well to target Europe in their strategies for 2015. The eurozone's banks now have a common regulator, the European Central Bank. That, combined with the balance sheet review and stress tests completed in October, make the regulatory backdrop firmer. And the banks need to improve their returns - Morgan Stanley expects Europe's banking sector to make a return on tangible equity of just 10.5 per cent in 2015. There's no revenue growth to push that up, so any improvement will have to come from lower costs. Dealmaking is one way to achieve that.

All set for a bumper year of deals then? Don't bank on it. Cross border M&A is likely to be thin. The shadows cast by failed deals from the boom years (ABN Amro, anyone?) are long. Pity the chief who tries to pitch a "transformational" deal to investors who have just finished recapitalising their bank. Spain's Santander, traditionally active in M&A, was quick to quash rumours in November that it might be interested in troubled Italian lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena.

There will be pockets of dealmaking though. In-country consolidation will be one source. It is a must in Italy and is also possible among the smaller German banks. There may also be more deals in Spain, where last year Caixabank bought much of Barclays' local business for  800m. And the UK's challenger banks need scale if they are going to take on the big boys.

Elsewhere, expect infill deals as banks add skills. This month Spain's BBVA bought Madiva Soluciones, a "big data" specialist. Focused, small deals of this sort, which add capital light businesses or specific skills, should please shareholders, even if they won't have advisers reaching for the champagne next December.

Keywords: Maybe Not a Bubble, but Plenty of Risk

Investors have been cautious about technology companies since the first tech bubble, when startups with no revenue and sky-high valuations disappeared almost overnight after markets came to their senses. And if we define "bubble" as a stock-market bubble, tech isn't in one.

That doesn't change the fact that money is pouring into startups, and they are spending it recklessly, whether on perks for high-value employees or record rents for office space in San Francisco and elsewhere.

"There are pockets of exuberance," says Scott Kupor, managing partner at venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz. "There are definitely some [valuations] that cause you to scratch your head and say 'gee, we're not sure how people get to these numbers.'"

What's different in 2014 from the bubble that climaxed in 2000 is how money is getting into these companies. Vast pools of capital -- including institutional investors and sovereign-wealth funds -- are seeking returns amid near-zero interest rates. They have figured out that one way to get them is by funding companies earlier in their life cycles, before they go public. That's the short explanation for the stratospheric valuations of companies like Uber Technologies, whose nominal value is $40 billion.

The way the venture-capital game traditionally works is that limited partners with all the money hand it to venture capitalists, who are supposed to have all the expertise.

Now, everyone considers himself an expert in which tech companies deserve money, and how much. Conventional VCs seek giant payoffs when they exit their investments, to offset losses on most of the companies they fund.

Many startup founders view this investment as necessary to capture markets before their competitors can, as they race for mindshare and real estate on your smartphone's home screen. But that also means these startups are losing money even if they have significant revenue, because they are using their war chest to buy a share of the market. That's how 2014 isn't so different from 2000.

What's different is pretty much everything else: Nearly all of these companies insist that they could make money if they wanted.

This is where I grow skeptical. Every hot tech company I can think of, from "sharing economy" giants such as Uber and Airbnb, to enterprise and financial-tech companies like Hortonworks (big data) and Lending Club (peer-to-peer financing) face threats that could cause them to fall short of current valuations. Those threats include regulation and competition, but the biggest one is the same as it ever was: Whether there are enough people and companies out there willing to buy their stuff.

The bull market is going to turn eventually. Economist Nouriel Roubini, sometimes known as "Dr. Doom," has pegged the unwinding at sometime in 2016. He told Yahoo Finance that tech and social-media stocks are especially stretched.

On the other side are all the investors betting that tech startups are creating lasting value, and that they can survive any downturn.

It isn't that I don't believe all these earnest promoters of transformational tech companies. I agree with social theorist Jeremy Rifkin, who argues that we are in a "third industrial revolution," for which these companies are laying the foundation. It's just that I'm not sure these pre-IPO investors' short- and medium-term interests are aligned with those of the "dumb money" investors who are supposed to take the companies off their hands.

That's why I'd urge caution for anyone looking at these companies, at any stage. It's common these days to talk about whether a startup is in line with its "comparables," in terms of revenue and spending, but that's a measure unhinged from fundamentals in a market that's overheating. When the correction comes -- and it will -- here's what will go first: All the companies whose markets weren't, in retrospect, as big as claimed.

London-based technology start-ups attracted record levels of venture capital in 2014, with investors ploughing $1.4bn into the city's fledgling companies - double the amount raised last year.

The figures point to growing investor confidence that the UK capital's start-ups can compete on the global stage, despite years in which European tech companies have lagged behind Silicon Valley rivals.

The amount raised in London is more than 20 times what it was just four years ago, and accounted for 65 per cent of the UK total, according to data compiled by research group CB Insights for London & Partners, the promotional arm of the mayor's office.

The past year has seen an increasing number of US investors and overseas corporations set up London bases. Google Ventures, the venture capital arm of the technology group, launched a Europe-focused office based in London, while banking group Santander has set up an investment office in the city.

London's tech scene received a boost when several high-profile exits provided investors with strong returns. These included Google's acquisition of artificial intelligence company DeepMind for 400m and the initial public offering of Just Eat, the online food marketplace, on the London Stock Exchange.

It has also been a strong year for London-based financial technology companies, with money transfer businesses including TransferWise , WorldRemit and Azimo attracting large investments from prominent US venture capitalists.

Nonetheless, the London figures are small compared with other technology clusters. Silicon Valley saw more than $22bn in equity financing in 2014, while New York raised $1.7bn in the third quarter alone, more than London did for the whole of 2014.
