Backers of ventures that contribute to the social good often have a strong female contingent

As one of the first investors in Tesla Motors and NEXTracker, which was sold to electronics supplier Flextronics in 2015, Nancy Pfund has a record of spotting a promising trend. But when in early 2000 she saw the potential for investing in companies that combine financial returns with a positive social impact, the investors she was trying to convince were not so sure.

 We were pioneers,  says Ms Pfund, now managing partner of venture capital firm DBL Partners.  The typical reaction to our pitch was a negative one, we got a lot of doors slammed in our face,  she says.  People thought that by introducing something other than an economic driver into your investment decisions you would lose money. 

Today, demand for investments that incorporate environmental, social and governance standards, or impact investing, has grown substantially. In a recent study, Morgan Stanley compared the interest shown in sustainable investing by male and female clients. In 2017, 84 per cent of the women expressed interest, up from78 per cent in 2015; for men the figure was 67 per cent, up from 62 per cent.

Within this investment subcategory there is a relatively high representation of women compared with the broader VC field, says Ms Pfund, whether as managers or investors. At DBL, the two managing partners are one woman and one man; at general partner level, two of the five are women, including Ms Pfund.

As an emerging field of finance, there was an early opportunity for newcomers to make their way as practitioners, says Ms Pfund.  Women have not been as invested in the status quo as men 	. 	. 	. 	This, coupled with impact investing s reach into social and environmental domains, towards which many women gravitate anyway, has allowed the field to grow in a more diverse way from the get-go. 

DBL stands for  double bottom line : the aim is to achieve attractive financial returns for investors, while also delivering social, economic and environmental benefits to the sectors and regions in which they invest. One example is Farmers Business Network in the US, which uses big data to give farmers an insight into their supply chains and enables them to make changes that are both more sustainable and economical. Supporting farmers in this way helps rural Americans thrive on their farms, thus serving a social purpose, while the network has boosted employment.

Laurie Spengler, chief executive of Enclude, a UK-based specialist advisory intermediary in impact investing, says:  It s deeply satisfying to integrate what you care about with what you do professionally. 

An early adopter of impact investing, Ms Spengler was able to use her experience in development finance to move into the field quickly. In addition, as with any new movement, she says, the barriers to entry and career advancement for women are not so embedded.

The gender balance of staff at Enclude is just over 40 per cent female and, like MsPfund, she is struck by the relatively high number of women working in impact investment compared with other areas of investing.  We are intrigued by the role of finance in society and using it as a tool to create better outcomes,  she says.

Rachel Whittaker, a sustainable investment strategist at UBS, started her career as an analyst in an investment bank in 2000, where she was often the only woman in meetings.  When I made the move into sustainable investing it was a major change,  she says.

In the organisations she worked for over the past decade Ms Whittaker has noted the different gender splits in sustainable investment teams compared with traditional teams. Despite this, she sees the same trends as in other sectors, where the number of women drops the higher up the ranks you look.

Role models in the sector are important, says Ms Pfund.  We go out of our way to find women entrepreneurs,  she says.  We want to make the best investments, and if you leave out half the talent pool you re probably not going to do that. 

The firm has a strong deal flow coming from women, she says.  We don t really need to go finding them. They re finding us 	. 	. 	. 	because they know that some of the barriers that have existed have melted away.

Impact investing Backers of ventures that contribute to the social good often have a strong female contingent, writes Amy Bell

Good day. Today we have much more on the spinoff secondary fund that is buying out New Enterprise Associates' stakes in late-stage startups.

We also have more on Blumberg Capital expanding its team, particularly in Israel. And some VCs are targeting Medicare as a growth industry.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

A NewView for NEA: The NEA spinoff fund buying secondary stakes in NEA startups, called NewView, is seeking $1.37 billion for the fund. The fund, which has raised about $700 million so far, will invest in dozens of NEA's growth-stage companies, including 23andMe and Duolingo. Goldman Sachs and Hamilton Lane are among the investors in the fund. WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova has the exclusive.

The GitHub effect: GitLab Inc., which offers tools for software developers, is raising new funding and Iconiq Capital is expected to lead an investment that values the company at $1 billion or more, according to people familiar with the matter. The round was competitive, according to these people, in part because of the hope that GitLab could someday become an acquisition target. Earlier this year, Microsoft Corp. acquired a similar company, GitHub, for $7.5 billion. WSJ Pro's Katie Roof has the exclusive.

Blumberg's hires: San Francisco firm Blumberg Capital is boosting its Tel Aviv presence. Blumberg Capital is announcing six new members on its team, three of whom will help grow its presence in Tel Aviv. Ehud Schneorson, the former commander of Unit 8200, the intelligence unit of the Israel Defense Forces, is joining as a managing director. Also joining as a managing director is Yodfat Harel Buchris, who is also based in Tel Aviv. WSJ Pro's Katie Roof has the exclusive.

Mack's Take: Town Hall Ventures Raises $115 Million for Startups Tackling Underserved Populations

By Heather Mack

Few startups in the past have dared to target the giant insurer that is Medicaid and Medicare. But recently more startups are focusing on Medicaid or Medicare, and more venture capitalists are paying attention.

Town Hall Ventures, a Minnesota-based firm, has just closed on $115 million for its first fund specifically to back companies that help low-income or vulnerable patient populations. It's a rare move in health investing to focus exclusively on this population.

But the firm has expertise: one of the co-founders is Andy Slavitt, the former Medicare chief in the Obama administration.

More in Mack's Take.

Cyber Daily: Aflac's Patching Regime; Add Another 14M to the Breach Tally

Aflac's Weekly Patching Cadence Prioritizes Critical Vulnerabilities

By Jeff Stone

Patching is a basic part of cybersecurity hygiene, but the process is more complicated than it appears. Not patching security vulnerabilities, or doing it badly, can open the way for attacks.

Equifax Inc. revealed a breach in 2017 of data about 147.9 million people that happened, in part, when hackers took advantage of inadequate patching of the company's systems. Fifty-seven percent of companies that reported a data breach in the last two years said they hadn't installed a patch for a known vulnerability, according to an April survey of nearly 3,000 security professionals by the Ponemon Institute and the cloud-computing firm ServiceNow Inc.

Insurer Aflac Inc. takes patching seriously, going so far as to have some of its patching process approved by the board of directors, said DJ Goldsworthy, director of security operations and threat intelligence.

"When everyone knows the board and executives support and expect patching to occur, culture and approaches rapidly shift to support a streamlined process," he said in an email.

Monitoring software inventory. Aflac combs through its hundreds of applications with network-based vulnerability scanners, software that seeks out known vulnerabilities, and other third-party tools that check systems for security holes that need to be patched, said Mr. Goldsworthy. Aflac also has a four-person penetration testing team that uses the latest threat research from cybersecurity vendors and the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team to try to infiltrate the company's systems. They seek vulnerabilities not found in the automated scans, such as application design flaws that could allow hackers to crack Aflac passwords.

Alerts about any potential vulnerabilities are sent to Aflac's security team in real-time via email.

Prioritize patch work. Security employees assign each vulnerability a priority level so the IT team understands the urgency with which they must administer a patch. Critical vulnerabilities, such as the 2014 Shellshock flaw in some widely used open-source software that could have allowed hackers to take control of web servers, must be fixed within seven days, said Mr. Goldsworthy said.

Aflac classifies vulnerabilities that could result in the theft of personal information or business secrets as high-severity. These must be fixed within 30 days, he said. Employees have up to 90 days to fix medium-severity issues, such as outdated encryption, he said.

Aflac resolves 98% of vulnerabilities within its deadlines, said Mr. Goldsworthy.

"It's important from a cultural standpoint for IT to embrace that as something that's inherent to their responsibilities, as opposed to something that security is dumping on them," he said.

Assign humans to oversee the process. Aflac assigns an individual or a team to oversee each patch. The overseer is accountable for delivery of the patch and coordinating the work of others who may need to be involved, said Mr. Goldsworthy.

After employees ensure patches are applied to the system, they oversee application and database teams that conduct tests to assess whether an updated application functions normally, he said.

Liaisons are assessed on their patching execution in performance reviews, he said.

"Security and IT are inexorably related, and its become increasingly important for the people to have those roles to be accountable for technology," he said.

Create a backup plan. It's not always feasible to fix a vulnerability within the prescribed time frame. Aflac this year missed its 30-day deadline to implement a patch for Meltdown and Spectre, flaws in Intel Corp. and other chips that power many computing devices.

Microsoft Corp. released a security upgrade for its systems quickly after Meltdown and Spectre were made public in January. But Aflac was unable to install the patch without it dramatically slowing down the company's systems, Mr. Goldsworthy said.

Microsoft warned at the time that some users of the Windows operating system would experience "significant slowdowns," and "a decrease in system performance" upon installing the patch.

It took roughly 45 days for Microsoft to release a patch Aflac could install without slowing down operations, Mr. Goldsworthy said.

While they waited, Aflac's security team studied the technical details of Meltdown and Spectre to assess how cybercriminals could exploit the bugs, he said. The team determined hackers were most likely to target employees with a phishing attack that directed the victim to a website containing malicious software. The team wrote code to disable malicious attachments in incoming email, said. Mr. Goldsworthy.

"We don't let ourselves off the hook because there's not a patch," he said. "A lot of times you can restrict access and take other steps to at least partially, if not fully, mitigate a vulnerability without a patch."

Hack Dissection: Basic Security Missteps at Government Payment Service

By Catherine Stupp and Jeff Stone

A data breach at Government Payment Service revealed personal information of 14 million customers of the online payment company, security blogger Brian Krebs reported Monday. Names, addresses, phone numbers and the last four digits of credit-card numbers dating back to 2012 were exposed through payment receipts on the website GovPayNow.com. Krebs reported that he informed the company of the breach last Friday. Government Payment Service said in a statement to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity that it changed its system so that users will only be able to view their own payment receipts.

- What was compromised: Information for about 14 million customers, including names, addresses, phone numbers and the last four digits of credit-card numbers, according to Krebs. A spokesman for Government Payment Service could not immediately confirm to WSJ Pro Cybersecurity the number of affected customers or the data that was exposed.

- How it happened: Krebs reported that the company used sequential customer records. He typed different digits into the web address and was able to access customers' payment receipts.

- What Government Payment Service says: A spokesman said in an email that the company "has addressed a potential issue with our online system that allows users to access copies of their receipts, but did not adequately restrict access only to authorized recipients. The company has no indication that any improperly accessed information was used to harm any customer, and receipts do not contain information that can be used to initiate a financial transaction."

The online payment service company is used by local and state governments around the country and was acquired in January by Securus Technologies, a company that provides telecommunications services to prisons. This spring, the New York Times reported that law enforcement authorities had improperly used Securus' systems to track crime suspects. Motherboard later reported about a breach of the company's database.

Jasson Casey, CTO & SVP Engineering at risk management company SecurityScorecard, and Chase Cunningham, principal analyst at Forrester Research Inc., told WSJ Pro Cybersecurity that the latest Government Payment Service breach is an example of basic security mistakes that companies could easily prevent.

Here are edited excerpts from the two separate conversations.

Q: This company has been hacked several times. Haven't they learned anything from the past?

A: Mr. Cunningham: The fact that this company was acquired by somebody else who also had data storage problems is a really good indication they're not focused on protecting data the way they should. It's like at daycare: If  & one [kid] is sick and then your kid gets sick and you get sick and everyone else does.

[In] the acquisition process, [Securus] should have asked [GovPayNet] if they've checked for vulnerabilities, if can they determine the controls based on the data [they're] required to store, do you have penetration testing and red teaming underway.

Mr. Casey: Application security is something that they still have a hard time with... They [the breaches] feel very similar, to be honest. It comes from a similar team, it comes from a similar mindset. I'm not sure what their focus is but it's probably not application security.

Q: Brian Krebs wrote that this kind of data exposure is easy to prevent, for example by encrypting some parts of the URL shown to users during payment. Is it really that easy?

A: Mr. Cunningham: That [encryption] is something that's done all the time. It's just another step in the process of when they were developing this application that they should have done. My guess is they didn't run through any tests that would find something more malicious in nature. A web application tester would have found that issue within 30 minutes.

I've seen people look for web application vulnerabilities by hiring penetration testing firms. People say it's too expensive, but they don't think about the expense of losing brand recognition and being known as a business that doesn't take security seriously.

Organizations need to just get moving and quit screwing around and actually understand you can't only use basic tests. You have to act and think like a malicious actor. If you're not finding problems, you're not doing the test right.

Mr. Casey: Yeah, this is really simple &This is just basic web development in terms of best common practices, to actually use HTTPs, to use secure sessions to actually have a session ID bound to your user. Good practice is to filter a view to where the user that's actually accessing the system is only getting data that is indeed bound for them.

Q: Some of the data that was exposed was from 2012. Six years seems like a long time to store this kind of data.

A: Mr. Cunningham: Obviously, there's a need to have data for some period of time for tracking. But to keep data for six years  & in today's day and age is ridiculous. All the data being stored there is a liability. In a perfect world, you keep the data for a foreseeable amount of time, like 18 months or two years. Then you store it in encrypted long-term storage, or you nuke it entirely.

Q: How easy was it for hackers to access so much data, and did they need to access the system for very long in order to expose so many millions of records?

A: Mr. Cunningham: The fact that Krebs is the one discovering it [is telling]. He's good but it's not like he was using a U.S. National Security Agency exploit. You just had to modify the URL and change a few things and you get all kinds of information. That's web security 101. You could have mandated security controls around URLs and nullified that risk. Ninety-nine percent of these breaches are simple failures, rather than something from a Jason Bourne movie.

Mr. Casey: The exploit actually looks like a fairly basic technique where the URL was basically being used as a way to craft delivery of any information. If you understand that a certain ID was a customer record locator or a payment record locator by manipulating that information and sending it back, you could then get access essentially to data that is not yours, receipts that are not yours. From a software development and security engineering perspective, that's certainly an interesting finding in terms of separation and partitioning of data visibility.

Q: What else strikes you about this hack?

A: Mr. Cunningham: Once they do forensic research, they will find all kinds of other threat activity over the years. Once [they] start digging, they'll find things from years ago, like open doors of data being exposed to the internet, that they didn't know before.

Mr. Casey: There are a lot of other questions that come up in this process that you can't really answer but they're certainly worth posing. If it's this easy to divulge the last six-plus years of receipts for any payment that's been processed through the company, what else is there? What does the inside look like?... There's no reason to do things like sequential IDs. You can do randomization of IDs ... Vulnerabilities aren't really the end all and be all, at the end of the day. It's really about the team and the process behind these companies and whether they have good teams, good processes, follow best common practices. That's a much stronger indicator of a company's posture and hygiene.

72 Hours to Report Your Hack

Global companies are tightening controls to more quickly detect and report data breaches, in part to avoid penalties under a sweeping set of regulations from the European Union. The magic number: 72 hours. The General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect in May, requires firms that collect data about European Union citizens to report a data breach to regulators within 72 hours of discovery. Fast turnaround is a challenge for some companies, writes WSJ Pro Cybersecurity's Jeff Stone.

Quick dialing and prewritten scripts. Companies are rehearsing their breach responses to identify who needs to be involved and what actions may need to be accelerated. Cisco Systems Inc. goes so far as to track how long it takes designated executives to dial in to a conference line to discuss a cybersecurity incident. It can take a few minutes or over an hour, depending on the number of people involved, Mr. Stone reports. If Options Clearing Corp. detects a breach originating outside the company, its crisis-communications team and customer-service group draw from a prewritten script to notify the external firm about the problem via email or phone calls.

How AI Can Help Stop Cyberattacks

Companies are using artificial intelligence in the fight against hackers, sorting through millions of malware files to identify characteristics that can indicate a new attack, writes WSJ Pro Cybersecurity's Adam Janofsky. More than 121.6 million new malware programs were discovered in 2017, according to German research institute AV-Test GmbH. That's about 231 new malware samples every minute. "Trying to analyze that information is impossible for a human," says Mathew Newfield, chief information security officer at Unisys Corp.

Parsing a barrage of alerts. About three years ago, International Business Machines Corp. started training its Watson AI system on cybersecurity, to help security teams manage the influx of threat information. The system combs through alerts, recognizes patterns and determines things such as whether a malware strain is related to previous attacks. Like most AI, the technology took years to develop and encountered bumps along the way. Watson at one point concluded that the word "it" was the name of the most dangerous malware, because it appeared so frequently in malware research, says Koos Lodewijkx, vice president and chief technology officer at IBM Security.

Tracking down enemies. A common struggle for data-breach victims is figuring out who attacked them. Security systems can analyze information on registries and online databases for clues about the infrastructure that criminals use to launch attacks, such as domain names of websites and IP addresses of devices. When hackers leave traces, "you create a behavior footprint that you leave behind that is unique," says Chris Bell, chief executive of Diskin Advanced Technologies. Customers in the aviation, utilities and financial services have used it to spot pending attacks and block IP addresses associated with criminal groups, according to Mr. Bell.

More Cyber News

Facebook sought data from financial companies. As recently as last year, Facebook Inc. pressed financial firms for the ability to use customer data flowing through its Messenger platform for a range of purposes, including advertising, the Journal's AnnaMaria Andriotis and Emily Glazer report. Facebook's negotiating stance with financial firms evolved over the years, ranging from asserting ownership of all data that passes through its servers to, later on, allowing financial firms to restrict its use of the information, WSJ reports. Facebook executives in 2016 told American Express Co. they wanted individualized cardholder spending data that passes through Facebook for a variety of purposes, according to WSJ. A Facebook spokeswoman told the Journal the company has not and does not use consumer financial data to target advertisements.

Mirai botnet authors go undercover. U.S. prosecutors this week asked a judge to sentence three men to work with the Federal Bureau of Investigation as part of a community service sentence for their role in a cybercriminal scheme, according to Wired magazine. Josiah White, Paras Jha and Dalton Norman pleaded guilty last December to creating the malicious software for the Mirai botnet, a network of hacked computers used to knock websites offline in 2016. The three men already have logged more than 1,000 hours of assistance in cybercrime investigations, Wired reported.

Debate over deterrence strategy unfolds. Cybersecurity experts and former prosecutors are divided over whether the U.S. Department of Justice's strategy of indicting hackers unlikely be tried in an American court is effective, CyberScoop reported. The U.S. this month indicted Park Jin Hyok, an accused North Korean hacker, for crimes related to the WannaCry ransomware attacks and other hacking campaigns. Mr. Park would be arrested if he was extradited, or if he was apprehended by another country, the site reported. A former U.S. National Security Agency analyst told CyberScoop the indictment "makes it look like the United States can't even bring people to justice that we charged." But a former federal prosecutor said the complaint reveals precious hacking techniques, forcing nation-state hackers to expend time and effort to develop new attacks, CyberScoop reported.

Cyberattack at U.K. airport. England's Bristol Airport was hit last weekend with a ransomware attack, according to BBC News. The airport pulled arrival and departure screens offline as a precautionary measure, instead using dry-erase boards to communicate information to travelers, the BBC reported. The attack didn't affect any flights or put passenger safety at risk, an airport spokesman told the BBC.

Facebook Sought Users' Financial Data for Years

Facebook Inc. had been haggling with financial firms over its access to users' sensitive financial information for years, well before the social-media company came under fire for its handling of personal data.

As recently as last year, the social-media company pressed financial firms for the ability to use customer data flowing through its Messenger platform for a range of purposes, including advertising, according to people familiar with the matter and documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. Concerned about privacy, several firms negotiated bespoke agreements that limited how Facebook could use any financial data that would pass through its servers.

The negotiations highlight a dilemma facing Facebook as it balances its need for detailed user data to better target advertisements and increase user engagement with concerns about how best to handle users' most sensitive personal information. It is an issue that has taken on new importance following the uproar over Facebook's ties to political analytics firm Cambridge Analytica, which accessed information on as many as 87 million users of the social-media network without their consent.

Facebook has in recent months taken steps to give users more control over data it collects. Earlier this year, the company changed its privacy policy to more clearly spell out how it handles advertising and user data. In April, before the European Union began enforcing its General Data Protection Regulation privacy law, Facebook asked users to review information about different types of advertising.

"Like many online companies, we partner with financial institutions to improve people's commerce experiences, like enabling better customer service, and people opt into these experiences," said Facebook spokeswoman Elisabeth Diana. "We've emphasized to partners that keeping people's information safe and secure is critical to these efforts. That has been and always will be our priority."

She said Facebook hasn't used and doesn't use consumer financial data for so-called ad targeting, or placing ads in front of specific audiences.

Facebook's negotiating stance with financial firms evolved over the years, ranging from asserting ownership of all data that passes through its servers to, later on, allowing financial firms to restrict its use of the information. Several of the deals were negotiated ahead of Facebook's 2017 developer conference, when over a dozen companies in multiple industries, including financial services, launched services on Messenger.

Prior to the launch, Facebook's privacy policy said "we use all of the information we have about you to show you relevant ads."

In conversations with American Express Co. in 2016, Facebook executives said they wanted to use individualized cardholder spending data that passes through Facebook, a person familiar with the matter said. That would have allowed them to use the data for ad targeting, the person said.

AmEx didn't want Facebook to use individualized data for anything besides servicing cardholders who opted into the chatbot, the person said, and instead agreed to provide aggregated transaction data for ads and other purposes.

After Bank of America Corp. reviewed Facebook's terms, it decided it would move its clients who engage in private messaging with the bank on Facebook off of the site so that Facebook wouldn't gain access to their financial data, according to a person familiar with the matter.

When Wells Fargo & Co. launched a chatbot pilot with Facebook in 2017, it informed customers that Facebook would have access to their Messenger conversations with bank representatives, per its data policy. "Customers were cautioned that they should not enter account numbers or other sensitive data in their chatbot conversations," a spokeswoman said. The 5,000-customer pilot ended in April.

PayPal Holdings Inc., which allows users of the payment service to send money through Messenger, negotiated a custom contract that prohibits Facebook from using PayPal customers' data for advertising or any of Facebook's own commercial purposes, the company said.

Western Union Co., which also launched a Messenger-based money-transfer service at the 2017 developer conference, has a custom deal that "reflects our privacy obligations to our customers," said spokeswoman Pia De Lima.

The deals predate a more recent Facebook effort, reported by The Wall Street Journal last month, to form partnerships with big banks to offer a range of customer services through Messenger, including fraud alerts. The company said it wouldn't use any information obtained through those services for ad-targeting purposes.

Banks have been hesitant to give too much control to Facebook.

Investcorp to invest up to $150m in China tech fund

Bahrain-listed group joins global investors chasing fast-growing unicorns

Investcorp, a Bahrain-listed asset manager, will invest in a Chinese state-backed fund with holdings in some of the mainland s fastest-growing technology companies, joining a raft of global investors seeking to capitalise on the prospects for the sector in Asia.

The investment group has agreed to pour as much as $150m into the China Everbright LimitedNew Economy Fund, which is managed by China Everbright, a Hong Kong-listed financial conglomerate that is controlled by the Chinese state.

Investcorp, which is investing in China for the first time since the group was set up in 1982, could add an extra $100m of co-investment in the future in a portfolio of companies that includes Chinese artificial intelligence developer SenseTime and video streaming service iQiyi.

The decision to invest in China is partly  in recognition of the country having the world s highest number of internet users and being home to some of the fastest growing  unicorn  technology companies valued at over $1bn , Investcorp said in a statement to the Financial Times.

An official announcement is expected on Tuesday morning in London.

The Everbright fund has already received an aggregate commitment of $313m from other investors, and has made investments including Wish, a large, unlisted mobile ecommerce platform, and Yixia Technology, a short-form mobile video-sharing platform.

China has experienced a flurry of pre-initial public offering fundraising this year, with several large tech groups raising billions of dollars at high valuations. Ant Financial, the payments arm of Alibaba, for example, raised $10bn at a valuation of $150bn.

Investors from around the world have piled into these groups, drawn by the prospect of cashing out in an expected wave of upcoming IPOs. However, many of China s recent technology and consumer listings, such as ecommerce group Pinduoduo and electric carmaker Nio, have underperformed investor expectations.

In May, SenseTime, one of China s top AI start-ups, launched its second funding round in just two months, bringing in $1.2bn for the year and valuing the company at $4.5bn.

Investors in the Beijing-based group, whose facial recognition software is used by Chinese police, include Alibaba, Fidelity International, Hopu Capital, Silver Lake, Tiger Global, Singapore s state investment fund Temasek and Qualcomm.

Baidu-backed iQiyi, which has been compared with US video streaming company Netflix, filed for an IPO in the US this year and was valued by analysts at $15bn.

The Everbright fund is one of a number of investment vehicles launched this year to focus on technology in China. State-owned China Merchants Group launched the Rmb100bn ($15bn) China New Era Technology Fund, aimed at investing in technology, similar to SoftBank s $100bn Vision Fund.

China Everbright is a sprawling state-owned conglomerate whose holdings span banks, asset management and aircraft leasing, among others. In 2016 it bought a 65 per cent equity stake in Italian-owned media rights company MP & Silva.

Data specialist Enigma reels in investment group cash

Hedge funds and venture capital firms move into analytics businesses they use themselves

Hedge funds, banks and venture capital firms are piling into investments in data companies in the hope of cashing in on a business they are using a lot more themselves.

In recent years, there has been a proliferation of start-ups that trawl through reams of data and sell it to investment groups searching for an edge.

The latest to attract investor interest is Enigma, a New York-based start-up that received funding from sources including quant giant Two Sigma, activist hedge fund Third Point and venture capital firms NEA and Glynn Capital in a $95m capital raising announced on Tuesday.

Enigma collects a huge range of data including the contents of every container ship that arrives in US ports every week, aeroplane registrations, elevator inspection reports in California and data on amusement park rides in Arkansas.

Their clients include banks, who might use the information to decide whether to extend credit or as part of anti-money laundering compliance, insurance companies assessing risks and pharmaceutical companies looking at adverse patient reactions to drugs.

Two Sigma made an investment earlier this month in another data company, Crux Informatics, which cleans and structures data to make it easier to use. Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have already invested in the business.

Despite the interest from hedge fund investors, Enigma chief executive Hicham Oudghiri said the company will not focus on the sector to build its client base because hedge funds tend to want data for one-off investments, rather than providing a steady stream of business.  We re more interested in powering Fortune 500 companies,  he said.

Much of Enigma s data are gathered from Freedom of Information requests or direct inquiries to government agencies and the company is aiming to create one of the biggest single data resources, with multiple ways of analysing the information.

Greg Papadopoulos, a partner at NEA, which also led a previous round of funding for Enigma, said he thinks it could become a multibillion-dollar company. His firm reviews about 20,000 companies a year   a  good fraction  of which are now data companies   and will invest in around 30, he said.

Enigma stood out for the range of data it collects, he said.

 If you look at the way most people look at and use data, it s like using a spellchecker, but if you really want to find out more you should go to the dictionary,  he said.  Enigma has built the dictionary of data.

Good morning. Today's top stories may seem to highlight a distinctly masculine investment thesis, but headlines can be deceiving.

There's no mistaking the target market of startups like Hims and Roman Health Medical, which are raising hefty rounds in the name of men's health. You might have noticed a recent rash of ads for these platforms.

It's also true that NFL players are backing a startup that aims to speed up recovery from severe knee injuries, but they have a history of self-interested investments. And this orthopedics startup could help people off the field as well as on it.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Men's health is the new black: New York-based Roman Health Medical is the latest men's health startup to raise large venture backing. The company has raised $88 million in Series A financing led by FirstMark Capital, with SignalFire, Initialized Capital and General Catalyst participating. Roman Health focuses on online consulting and prescriptions for erectile dysfunction. Its West Coast rival, Hims Inc., also sells ED pills, in addition to skin care and hair-loss products. Launched out of Atomic Ventures, it has raised $97 million from 8VC, CAVU Venture Partners, Founders Fund and Forerunner. WSJ Pro's Heather Mack has more.

UiPath's valuation soars: After years toiling in obscurity, three startups have suddenly hit the jackpot in a corner of the enterprise-software market sprinkled with artificial intelligence. Now they are racing to one-up each other to appear to be the market leader. One of them, UiPath Inc., on Monday was close to finalizing a new funding round at a $3 billion valuation, said a person familiar with the process, six months after a prior round valued it at $1.1 billion. WSJ's Rolfe Winkler has more.

Block and tackle: Pro football players are financing a startup that could help athletes better recover from a devastating form of knee injury. The NFL Players Association, the union for the league's players, is joining a $22.5 million investment in startup Miach Orthopaedics Inc. after funding early research behind the company. The association has invested in a series of efforts related to health and safety, such as the Dementia Discovery Fund, a venture-capital fund investing in dementia treatments. WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley has more.

Chernova's Take: Why LPs Might Cheer a Leaner Kleiner Perkins

The departure of Mary Meeker's team from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers surprised the industry.

Firm divorces are rare. Moreover, it's a contrarian status since most firms are adding more growth and sector funds under one roof.

Still, it may all work out for Kleiner Perkins.

Limited partners have been funding the more-is-better strategies of many venture firms, but many have done so reluctantly.

Many LPs regard the rise of sprawling VC firms as a benefit to GPs, which get to draw larger fees, rather than to the LP base. Managing multiple strategies can be distracting and rife with conflicts of interest, such detractors say.

While other firms get fatter, a Kleiner Perkins that's lean and focused seems an attractive alternative, said one fund-of-funds manager, who added that their firm is looking forward to evaluating a new fund from Kleiner Perkins with Mamoon Hamid as a key investor.

More in Chernova's Take.

Exits

Eventbrite Inc. on Tuesday raised the price range for its planned initial public offering. The event ticketing company now plans to sell 10 million shares at $21 to $23 each. Earlier this month the company said it would price the shares at between $19 and $21 apiece.

Meanwhile, three venture-backed drugmakers on Monday advanced their IPOs by setting estimated prices ranges:

Urovant Sciences Ltd. said it would sell 10 million shares at $14 to $16 a share.

Gritstone Oncology Inc. said it would offer about 6.1 million shares at a price between $13 and $15 a share.

Sutro Biopharma Inc. said it would sell 5 million shares at between $14 and $16 apiece.

A fourth, Entasis Therapeutics Holdings Inc., said Tuesday it would sell about 4.4 million shares at a price between $16 and $18 a share.

Waystar, a revenue cycle management company backed by Bain Capital, agreed to acquire North Bridge Venture Partners-backed Connance Inc., a Waltham, Mass.-based provider of predictive analytics to the health-care sector.

VC Funds

Insurance firm Aflac Inc. said it has increased the size of Aflac Corporate Ventures' Aflac Ventures Fund to $250 million from $100 million. To date, the fund has made eight mostly early-stage investments in Japan and the U.S., ranging from $1 million to $6 million per deal.

Versant Ventures is raising a new fund of up to $500 million, according to a regulatory filing. It would be the seventh fund for the San Francisco-based firm, which invests in early-stage life science, biotechnology and medical-device companies. Versant's previous fund closed at $400 million in early 2017. Founded in 1999, Versant is headed by Managing Directors Bradley Bolzon, Clare Ozawa, Jerel Davis, Thomas Woiwode and Robin Praeger, who also serves as chief financial officer. The firm declined to comment on the filing.

New Money

LendInvest, a London-based online marketplace for property finance, has raised $39.5 million in a Series C debt and equity round. Atomico, GP Bullhound and Tiger Management were the investors.

Blippar Inc., an augmented reality and computer vision technology provider also based in London, has snagged a $37 million funding round led by Candy Ventures and Qualcomm Ventures.

Emplify, a Fishers, Ind.-based employee engagement measurement provider, has picked up a $7.5 million growth investment led by Edison Partners.

More from Edison: Sigstr Inc., an Indianapolis-based marketing platform that inserts advertisements into corporate email signatures, raised $4 million in a round led Edison Partners.

Scythe Inc., an Arlington, Va.-based attack simulation technology provider, has secured an initial funding round of $3 million led by Ron Gula of Gula Tech Adventures. Additional investors included Evolution Equity, Paladin Capital Group, Stony Lonesome Group and SaaS Ventures. Mr. Gula along with Dmitri Alperovitch of CrowdStrike will join the company's board.

ZenLedger, a Seattle-based provider of tax software for cryptocurrency investors, has landed a $1.5 million investment led by Vestigo Ventures. Castle Island Ventures also participated.

Industry News

SpaceX's first paying passenger will be Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa, who is to blast off from earth in 2023, circle the moon and return, Elon Musk announced. WSJ's Andy Pasztor and Anne Steele have more.

Genstar-Backed Drillinginfo Buys Accel-KKR-Backed Oildex; The deal is the latest in a string of deals in the oil and gas software sector.

Two private equity-backed businesses in the oil-and-gas software space have agreed to combine, continuing the spate of deals in the sector so far this year.

Drilling Info Holdings Inc., which gained a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/genstar-buying-majority-stake-in-drilling-info-from-insight-venture-1529435968?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=5"in Genstar Capital earlier this year, acquired Accel-KKR portfolio company Oildex.

Drilling Info Holdings, also known as Drillinginfo, is a software-as-a-service and data analytics provider to the energy industry. In August, Genstar closed a deal to acquire a majority stake in Austin, Texas-based Drillinginfo, with existing investor Insight Venture Partners retaining a minority stake.

Oildex provides software that automates invoices and payments for the oil-and-gas industry. The company had around $55 million in projected revenue for 2018, according to two people familiar with the deal.

Accel-KKR took a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFLBO0020140224ea2oi828r?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=2"in Oildex in 2014. The firm is reaping a return of more than four times its invested capital on the investment, according to a person familiar with the situation. As a result of the most recent deal, Accel-KKR will hold a minority equity stake in Drillinginfo, according to a release by the firm.

Over the course of Accel-KKR's owenrship, Oildex completed three add-on acquisitions, including the procure-to-pay business of Automatic Data Processing Inc. in 2015 and financial and accounting data exchange business of PDS Energy in July 2017. Most recently, it bought Phoenix DAS, a provider of field operations and management software for oilfield suppliers, in September 2017.

The Oildex deal is the latest in a string of private-equity investments in oil-and-gas software providers. Following a rebound in oil prices, the pace of deal-making in the sector has picked up. Most recently, Silver Lake agreed to sell its oil-and-gas software provider Quorum Business Solutions Inc., also known as Quorum Software, to Thoma Bravo.

San Francisco-based Genstar targets investments in the health-care, financial services, software and industrial technology industries. The firm is investing from its $3.3 billion Genstar Capital Partners VIII LP, which closed in 2017.

Accel-KKR, which has offices in Menlo Park, Calif., Atlanta and London, invests in information technology-enabled businesses and software. Earlier this month, it sold a majority stake in digital marketing company "https://www.wsj.com/articles/insight-venture-partners-to-back-marketing-technology-platform-episerver-1536224400?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1" to Insight Venture Partners, in a deal that valued the business at $1.16 billion.

New York-based Insight makes venture-capital, growth-equity and buyout investments across the technology space. It closed its largest investment vehicle to date in July, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/insight-venture-partners-raises-6-3-billion-for-10th-fund-1531952351?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=4&mod=article_inline".

Growth-equity investor Edison Partners led a $4 million financing round for Sigstr Inc., which operates a marketing platform that inserts advertisements into corporate email signatures.

The investment will be used in part to help Sigstr roll out a new product that uses artificial intelligence to analyze employee emails and calendars for information that can be used in sales and marketing efforts, according to a news release.

Sigstr's flagship product enables marketers to run campaigns that place ads in the email signatures of employees. The Indianapolis company works with 400 business-to-business companies, including AT&T Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Yext Inc., according to the release.

Sigstr last year secured $5 million in a Series A funding round that was led by Hyde Park Venture Partners and included participation from Battery Ventures, marketing-technology company HubSpot Inc., Grand Ventures and High Alpha Capital.

Edison invests in financial-technology and health-care information-technology businesses as well as providers of enterprise products and services. The Princeton, N.J., firm targets companies that generate $5 million to $20 million in revenue.

The deal with Sigstr is Edison's second investment in an Indiana company in as many days. The firm on Monday said it led a $7.5 million investment in Emplify, a Fishers, Ind., maker of employee surveys.

WSJ Pro Private Equity last year reported Edison "https://www.wsj.com/articles/edison-partners-seeks-300-million-for-ninth-fund-1509018300?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=4" for a new fund. The firm "https://www.wsj.com/articles/edison-partners-closes-257m-for-eighth-fund-1467804602?mod=article_inline" with $275 million in 2016.

Base10 fundraising is largest for a black-led venture capital fund

San Francisco-based vehicle co-run by Nigeria-born Adeyemi Ajao raises $137m

A venture capital fund co-led by a black investor has raised more than $100m for the first time, in a sign of Silicon Valley s belated efforts to back more minority investors and entrepreneurs.

The new investment vehicle, managed by San Francisco-based Base10 Partners, follows a spate of smaller funds raised by black VCs in the US in recent months   though these have made only a very small dent in the racially skewed nature of start-up investing.

The huge racial gulf in Silicon Valley, both among investors and entrepreneurs, has received relatively little attention amid wider criticism recently of the tech world s significant gender disparities.

Only 4 per cent of US start-up investors are black or Hispanic, according to a study of 1,500 venture capitalists by Richard Kerby, a partner at the firm Equal Ventures. By comparison, about 13 per cent of the US population identify as black, and 16 per cent as Hispanic.

Base10 was co-founded by Adeyemi  Ade  Ajao, a serial entrepreneur and angel investor. He was born in Nigeria and brought up in southern Spain, where his first start-up, a social app called Tuenti, was bought by Telefnica. Like many successful European entrepreneurs he then set his sights on Silicon Valley, taking a place at Stanford University and starting another venture that was sold to business software company Workday.

Base10 said on Monday that it had closed its first fund after raising $137m, a sizeable amount for a so-called seed-stage fund that provides small amounts of capital in the very early stages of a start-up s life.

Mr Ajao, who grew up in a mainly white region, said he had little sensitivity to racial politics when he came to the US, but had since come to understand the significance of his position as a rare black figure in VC.

 I have an obligation to foster that network to make sure others succeed,  he said.  The more the story is told, the more we can create role models. 

Critics of Silicon Valley s start-up system say the lack of diversity among VCs has starved minority entrepreneurs of capital, in turn producing fewer black company founders who can later move into investing   a chicken-and-egg problem that perpetuates the imbalance.

 So much of venture investing at the early stage is about trust and judgment and that means you are likely to invest in people who are more like you,  said Charles Hudson, another black VC who raised a $15m venture fund in late 2016 and has since made 75 investments.

Silicon Valley s start-up world is also driven by a number of overlapping networks, making it hard for outsiders to break in. For instance, about 40 per cent of VCs came from just two universities   Harvard and Stanford   according to Mr Kerby s study.

 If you re plugged into one of these [university] networks, gender and race are still an issue, but you re afforded access others aren t,  said Mr Hudson, who also attended Stanford before taking a job at Google.

Among other black-led VC firms, Los Angeles-based Backstage Capital raised $36m in May, while 645 Ventures, a New York fund with two black partners, completed a $40m fund last year. Late last year, Unilever announced a $100m fund to back minority female entrepreneurs after buying Sundial Brands, a beauty products company whose goods are aimed at women of colour.

Investors such as Arlan Hamilton, founder of Backstage Capital, and Richelieu Dennis, the founder of Sundial Brands and the brains behind Unilever-backed New Voices Fund, aim to invest exclusively in minority-founded businesses. Others, such as Mr Ajao and Mr Hudson, have more general investment criteria, but say they hope their personal backgrounds and investment philosophies will lead them to a wider group of entrepreneurs.

Base10 is aiming to invest in start-ups that develop artificial intelligence and automation for industries in what Mr Ajao calls  the real economy , such as construction and transport.

 By definition, you end up working with people who aren t Silicon Valley,  he said, making it more likely the firm will back founders out of the Valley mainstream. The firm, which has already made 10 investments from its new fund, has yet to back a black entrepreneur, though its company founders include two Hispanics and two women.

Warner Music buys German merchandise retailer EMP for $180m

World s third largest record company seals its largest takeover in five years

Warner Music has acquired EMP Merchandising, the German retailer that sells T-shirts featuring rock bands like Nirvana, in its largest takeover in five years.

Sycamore Partners, the private equity group that has bought struggling retailers like Staples, agreed to sell EMP for $180m, according to people close to the deal.

Warner, the third largest record company and home to artists including Ed Sheeran, has made a string of deals in the past year as music revenues soared and streaming services like Spotify have grown. The company has aimed to diversify its business beyond selling music, as merchandising and touring account for a bigger slice of artists  income in the streaming era.

EMP, founded in 1986 as a mail order music store, sells merchandise from bands including Pink Floyd, Metallica and AC/DC.

As album sales shrink, artists have piled into merchandise as the primary physical purchase for music fans. Merchandise is  a big part of how music has visible and physical impact , said Max Lousada, Warner s chief executive for recorded music.

Previously a smaller part of a musician s income, merchandise sales have surged in recent years, bringing in millions for the biggest stars. In its most recent tour, US rock band Panic! At the Disco made 30 per cent of its profits from merchandise, according to a Rolling Stone report, while Kanye West claims to have sold $780,000 of merchandise at a single New York concert.

Globally, music merchandise revenues grew 9.4 per cent to $3.1bn in 2016, according to the Licensing Industry Merchandisers  Association.

Warner, owned by billionaire Len Blavatnik s Access Industries, has been in dealmaking mode under Mr Lousada, who was promoted to the company s top creative job last year after running the UK business.

A year ago Warner bought Dutch dance label Spinnin  Records for more than $100m. Other deals have looked to broaden the label s scope beyond recorded music. Warner last month bought Uproxx, the pop-culture website, and earlier this year acquired Sodatone, a machine learning start-up, in a bid to use data to find new artists.

Warner made $1.92bn in revenues in the first half of 2018, up 10 per cent from a year ago, amid an industry-wide recovery.

C all me a Luddite, but I have always agreed with former US Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker that the ATM has been the most useful innovation in finance of the past few decades.

So I will watch this week's Senate banking committee hearings on fintech with trepidation. The hearings will be the first chance to dig into the Treasury department's summer report on the sector, which talks approvingly of data sharing among technology companies and big banks to create efficiency, scale and lower consumer prices.

The report puts rather less focus on the systemic risk and predatory pricing that could emerge if the world's largest technology companies and the biggest banks on Wall Street share consumer data. (Just imagine if your Facebook page had a checking account attached. What could go wrong?) Given the deregulatory stance the Trump administration has taken so far, that's no surprise. But it is alarming, nonetheless. The Treasury paper's diagrams of the way platforms and banks might share a consumer's financial information, in order to offer "personalised" products and services, remind me of the complex illustrations of credit default swaps that triggered the 2008 financial crisis. Complexity of that sort always makes me nervous   it leaves so much room for the party with more information to obfuscate.

The blending of platform technologies, big data, artificial intelligence and consumer finance is only the latest and most turbo-charged combination of banking and commerce. Prior iterations, enabled by 1990s financial deregulation, did not end well.

Take Goldman Sachs's experiment with aluminium hoarding, that came to light in 2013. The bank had bought up thousands of tons of aluminium and was moving it between warehouses (which it had also bought) in order to control the release of commodity supply. According to some industry estimates, this added between $3.5bn and $5bn in costs to American shoppers over three years.

The Cornell University professor whose work first sparked serious media interest in the topic, Saule Omarova, will be speaking at the fintech hearings this week. Her latest research raises questions about whether the blending of big tech companies and finance is in the public interest.

"If Amazon can see your bank data and assets, [what is to stop them from] selling you a loan at the maximum price they know you are able to pay?" Professor Omarova asks.

It is a legitimate question, given the history of big banks, and more recently, the manner in which large tech companies use data to reap what many believe are unfair advantages. Amazon uses "dynamic pricing" to profit from public sector contracts, Uber employs "surge pricing" to set rates based on customers' willingness to pay, and Facebook compiles data about users that they have not themselves shared. Google has tracked users even if their privacy settings ought to prevent it.

Some people do not worry about any of this. They feel that it is a fair trade to exchange data for convenient goods and services. But it is impossible to know what is fair in these cases. None of us can see inside the algorithmic black boxes of the largest technology companies. It is one thing for a company to know my vacation shopping patterns or what media I like; it is another for them to access my entire financial history, including my investments.

Many people already lack confidence in making financial transactions and in personal wealth management. Why else would so many of them still be paying above average fees for such services? Imagine how vulnerable some consumers might be if their bank notices that they have $9,000 sitting in a savings account.

How many would respond to a pop-up ad urging them to move their money into a wonderful new higher yielding investment vehicle? Too bad the Trump administration has already gutted the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which looks after retail customers who have disputes with banks. The Treasury's fintech proposals suggest they will have plenty of new issues to dig into.

Data portability   the ability of consumers to share their data with multiple private and public sector institutions   does have some advantages. But the accompanying risks, particularly when it comes to sensitive areas like financial or healthcare data, argue for a cautious approach.

The EU started allowing data sharing among big banks and tech companies earlier this year, but it required very clear opt-in and opt-out provisions to protect consumers.

So far very few European banks have actually used the new data sharing rules to sign deals with the biggest tech companies. That may be because the banks still remember lessons learnt during the financial crisis, about how complexity and opacity in what seem like everyday transactions can blow up wildly (who thought bad debt would ricochet from Iceland to Iowa?). But I doubt it.

Probably they are merely a few paces behind their US counterparts, many of whom are already jumping on the fintech bandwagon with all too much zeal.

Tech
Alibaba's Jack Ma Says Government Should Stick to Governing; His comments come after he announced retirement plans to pursue other interests, and as China increases restrictions on internet companies

SHANGHAI Chinese e-commerce tycoon Jack Ma used a government-sponsored forum to suggest regulators take a lighter touch in dealing with technology companies, saying the market should be allowed to decide how new industries such as artificial intelligence develop.

"I personally think that the government has to do what the government should do, and the companies do what companies should do," Mr. Ma said at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai on Monday, recalling a conversation he said he had last year with U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao about self-driving cars.

"Protecting the backward forces who are crying out loud will be the most important factor in destroying innovation," Mr. Ma said.

Mr. Ma's comments came a week after he announced "https://www.wsj.com/articles/daniel-zhang-to-succeed-jack-ma-as-alibaba-chairman-1536542559?mod=article_inline" in one year as executive chairman of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., the internet giant with businesses in online retailing, cloud computing and mobile payments.

Mr. Ma said he wanted time "https://www.wsj.com/articles/alibabas-jack-ma-to-step-down-as-executive-chairman-1536381356?mod=article_inline", but some observers saw his decision as part of the fallout from China's authoritarian government increasing restrictions on internet companies.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/tencent-foldsem-shutting-another-videogame-as-beijing-cracks-down-1536582807", Tencent Holdings Ltd.'s shares plunged as the government announced its plan to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-videogame-companies-shudder-as-government-tightens-grip-1535690686?mod=article_inline". Ride-hailing firm Didi Chuxing Technology Co. has come under government scrutiny after police said "https://www.wsj.com/articles/didi-halts-carpool-service-again-in-china-after-passenger-killed-1535269890", the second since May.

In January, Alibaba's mobile-payments affiliate Ant Financial Services Group became a target when Chinese internet regulators said the company"https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-swats-jack-mas-ant-over-customer-privacy-1515581339" on the protection of personal data.

Mr. Ma didn't directly refer to any of those events in his speech, which also included his views on how artificial intelligence could transform businesses and society. Mr. Ma urged traditional industries to embrace new technologies and spoke about how sectors such as manufacturing could be transformed through the use of data.

In his speech, Mr. Ma also referenced the recent crackdown on Chinese peer-to-peer lenders, which match small borrowers with ordinary investors. These internet lenders have been blamed for stranding investors when they fail.

Mr. Ma suggested many of those lenders operated illegally under the camouflage of internet-driven financial services. He said the risk with companies that use actual data and artificial intelligence to control risks is low.

Mr. Ma didn't mention Ant Financial by name, but the company has been hit by new rules introduced to regulate the internet-driven financial-services market this year.

The artificial-intelligence forum is a high-profile event, hosted by various government agencies including the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. One of China's top officials, Vice Premier Liu He, also spoke.

Besides Mr. Ma, Tencent Chief Executive Ma Huateng, also known as Pony Ma, and Baidu Inc. Chief Executive Robin Li gave speeches.

Liu Qiangdong, the chairman of e-commerce company JD.com Inc., was originally scheduled to appear but a company spokeswoman said he isn't attending. Mr. Liu, also known as Richard Liu, was arrested by Minneapolis police "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jd-com-founder-gets-back-to-business-in-beijing-days-after-arrest-in-u-s-1536062833" Aug. 31, and then released the next day without bail.

Through his attorneys, Mr. Liu "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-billionaire-arrested-on-sex-misconduct-allegation-unlikely-to-face-charges-lawyer-says-1535974482?mod=article_inline".

Among foreign companies represented at the event, Google has been noticeably present with two senior executives taking the stage: Vice President Jay Yagnik and Fei-Fei Li, the leader of Google Cloud AI who recently announced her plan to step down.

Their speeches come as the Alphabet Inc. unit doubles down on a China expansion strategy. The two didn't touch on Dragonfly, which, according to people familiar with the matter, is a project that includes testing a mobile version of Google's search engine that would "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-considering-censored-search-engine-for-return-to-china-1533157785".

Ms. Li, in speaking about Google's approach to artificial intelligence, said it was vital to consider the ethical implications of artificial intelligence as the technology develops.

According to some industry estimates, this added between $3.5bn and $5bn in costs to American shoppers over three years.

The Cornell University professor whose work first sparked serious media interest in the topic, Saule Omarova, will be speaking at the fintech hearings this week. Her latest research raises questions about whether the blending of big tech companies and finance is in the public interest.

 If Amazon can see your bank data and assets, [what is to stop them from] selling you a loan at the maximum price they know you are able to pay?  Professor Omarova asks.

It is a legitimate question, given the history of big banks, and more recently, the manner in which large tech companies use data to reap what many believe are unfair advantages. Amazon uses  dynamic pricing  to profit from public sector contracts, Uber employs  surge pricing  to set rates based on customers  willingness to pay, and Facebook compiles data about users that they have not themselves shared. Google has tracked users even if their privacy settings ought to prevent it.

Some people do not worry about any of this. They feel that it is a fair trade to exchange data for convenient goods and services. But it is impossible to know what is fair in these cases. None of us can see inside the algorithmic black boxes of the largest technology companies. It is one thing for a company to know my vacation shopping patterns or what media I like; it is another for them to access my entire financial history, including my investments.

Many people already lack confidence in making financial transactions and in personal wealth management. Why else would so many of them still be paying above average fees for such services? Imagine how vulnerable some consumers might be if their bank notices that they have $9,000 sitting in a savings account. How many would respond to a pop-up ad urging them to move their money into a wonderful new higher yielding investment vehicle?

Too bad the Trump administration has already gutted the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which looks after retail customers who have disputes with banks. The Treasury s fintech proposals suggest they will have plenty of new issues to dig into.

Data portability   the ability of consumers to share their data with multiple private and public sector institutions   does have some advantages. But the accompanying risks, particularly when it comes to sensitive areas like financial or healthcare data, argue for a cautious approach.

The EU started allowing data sharing among big banks and tech companies earlier this year, but it required very clear opt-in and opt-out provisions to protect consumers.

So far very few European banks have actually used the new data sharing rules to sign deals with the biggest tech companies. That may be because the banks still remember lessons learnt during the financial crisis, about how complexity and opacity in what seem like everyday transactions can blow up wildly (who thought bad debt would ricochet from Iceland to Iowa?). But I doubt it.

Probably they are merely a few paces behind their US counterparts, many of whom are already jumping on the fintech bandwagon with all too much zeal.

Pot stocks boom as investors eye vast expansion

Equities

As the prospect of a legal marijuana industry across North America looms, retail and professional investors are proving to be enthusiastic buyers as they anticipate explosive growth for the sector.

The excitement around so-called pot stocks has been generated by next month's legalisation of cannabis for recreational use in Canada, as well as by a swath of M&A among cannabis producers and investments by major drinks companies in the growers.

The promise of a vastly expanded market and an aura of legitimacy has drawn cash from big investors across the globe.

Analysts at BDS Analytics estimated that global spending on the drug could hit $32bn by 2022, a sharp rise from the current $9.5bn.

"All the big beverage and tobacco firms are talking about this," said Nikolaas Faes, equity analyst at Bryan, Garnier & Co. "They're all trying to figure out how this is going to hurt their industry."

Canadian medical marijuana producer Canopy Growth Corp, which trades on the Toronto stock exchange under the ticker WEED, is the largest of the handful of companies to have benefited from the investor excitement. Constellation Brands, which makes Corona and Modelo beers, raised its stake in Canopy to 38 per cent with a $4bn investment last month, the largest investment made in the growing industry to date.

Mr Faes said the growth of the marijuana industry could present an opportunity for the big beverage and tobacco companies too.

"What do beer and tobacco and cannabis do? They intoxicate you, they're a social lubricant   they're in the same business."

Jesse Pytlak, equity analyst at Cormark Securities, said the Constellation investment was the main trigger for the recent share price rally, demonstrating a "serious commitment" to the marijuana sector by a Fortune 500 company. Over the past 12 months, shares in Cronos Group have risen more than 400 per cent with Aurora up 210 per cent and Aphria up 190 per cent.

The Constellation deal is not the only driver.

Earlier in the summer, Aurora Cannabis bought rival medical marijuana group MedReleaf in a $2.5bn deal, having already snapped up CanniMed Therapeutics five months previously and invested in the public listing of The Green Organic Dutchman.

Another key factor for the industry is the opening up of the US market. About half of US states allow cannabis to be used for medicinal purposes, while nine places, including California, Colorado, Massachusetts and Washington DC, allow people to use it recreationally.

In July, Canadian producer Tilray became the first cannabis producer to carry out an initial public offering in New York, closing 32 per cent up from its listing price.

"The legalisation in Canada is clearly one factor driving investment but it's more about the US market," said Mr Faes.

Mr Pytlak said investors were now beginning to better understand the regulatory environment in the US, where companies are currently not allowed to transport the drug across state lines.

Nevertheless, food and drink analysts envisage a rapidly maturing market that could see various strains of the plant laced through consumer goods ranging from soap to coffee and sports drinks.

Linda Gilbert, managing director of consumer insights for BDS Analytics, said there were many opportunities for the use of cannabis as a new ingredient in existing food and drinks.

"If we look at the cannabis plant, or hemp or marijuana, there are hundreds of different cannabinoids that could become new flavours or aromas for a beverage," she said.

"The bottom line is that cannabis is not new, people have been consuming cannabis for centuries. What's new is legal cannabis," said Ms Gilbert. "It's very rare for an entirely new category of product to become an investment opportunity."

Within a week of the demise of Lehman Brothers, two companies pounced on the remains. Barclays bought the North American business while Nomura of Japan took the rest. Executives at both groups used similar language about a "once in a generation opportunity" to vault into the global elite. Ten years on, only Barclays could claim to have made the best of it.

The UK bank paid $250m for a net $4bn of trading assets and $1.5bn for Lehman's Manhattan headquarters and two data centres in New Jersey.

Today that HQ building , a handsome 32-storey tower at 745 Seventh Avenue, might fetch $1bn on its own, according to FT estimates using data from Real Capital Analytics. League tables, meanwhile, show Barclays has preserved many of Lehman's historic strengths, especially in fixed income.

It was hardly plain sailing. The business drifted under Antony Jenkins, a well-meaning Brit who did three years as chief executive until 2015. His replacement, Jes Staley, is doubling down on Wall Street. So far this year the bank ranks three and four in US high-yield bonds and leveraged loans, from 14th in 2007. In US equity offerings, Barclays was nowhere before the crisis; it is now sixth.

Nomura wrote smaller cheques: up to $525m for Lehman's Asia-Pacific operations and a nominal $2 for Emea. But it made a pretty awful fist of it, say former employees. Key people such as Christian Meissner were soon gone; others left the minute that two-year guarantees expired.

By mid-2012 the architects of the acquisition were booted out in the wake of an insider-trading scandal and the company seemed all out of ideas. Among the shareholder resolutions that year: a derisive proposal that Nomura install squat toilets in its buildings, to assist employees in "hunkering down on a daily basis".

Today Nomura is still dominant in its home market but remains an also-ran outside it, specialising in niches such as Aussie-dollar bonds. Two years ago it shuttered European equities, Lehman's best calling card outside America. That boosted margins in 2017. So far this year the red ink is still flowing.

Its only top-10 ranking? Asian equities, where it is number 10, the same as in 2007.

Barclays has deep problems of its own. But there is no doubt who integrated its share of the Lehman legacy more adroitly.

iHeartMedia Buys Stuff Media for $55 Million; The radio giant is ramping up its investment in the fast-growing podcasting business

Corrections & Amplifications

Stuff Media produces podcasts including "Stuff You Should Know." An earlier version of this article misstated the show's name as "How Stuff Works." (Sept. 13, 2018)

iHeartMedia Inc. is turning up the volume on its podcasting business.

The biggest U.S. radio broadcaster is acquiring Stuff Media LLC, one of the largest podcasting companies by audience size, the companies said.

The price was $55 million, according to people familiar with the matter. iHeartMedia Chief Executive Bob Pittman declined to comment on the acquisition price.

The deal is a bet on a small but growing medium that has attracted a younger, engaged audience as listeners migrate from traditional broadcast radio to digital platforms.

"Podcast is to talk what streaming is to music," said Mr. Pittman in an interview. "It's very critical to us and very strategic."

As part of the agreement, Stuff Media CEO Conal Byrne will join iHeart and lead its entire podcast division.

The deal is among the largest in the emerging podcasting business. In 2015, E.W. Scripps said it was acquiring Midroll, the podcast-advertising company, for $50 million with an additional $10 million earn-out. In January, Liberated Syndication Inc. purchased the internet-hosting company Pair Networks for $16 million in cash and stock. In May, Pandora acquired AdsWizz, a company that provides ad technology for podcasts and music platforms, for about $145 million.

Last month, public-radio companies "https://www.wsj.com/articles/public-radio-networks-to-merge-1534330920" in a bid to capitalize on podcasts.

Mr. Pittman said the deal was aimed at beefing up iHeartMedia's existing podcasting business, which already has an audience of more than 5.6 million monthly listeners, according to podcasting-analytics firm Podtrac.

The acquisition increases iHeart's lead among a group of publishers in terms of audience, though it still trails No. 1 NPR. iHeart, which already hosts more than 750 original podcasts and carries over 20,000 on its app, is the top commercial podcast publisher.

Stuff Media, which produces more than 25 shows including "Stuff You Should Know," "Atlanta Monster" and "Cabinet of Curiosities," is the fifth-largest podcasting company by audience size, according to Podtrac, with nearly 5.3 million monthly listeners. The privately held company, which doesn't release its finances, last year raised $15 million from Raine Group.

iHeart executives insist the growth in podcasts doesn't come at the expense of radio listening.

"We're in a period of renaissance in audio," says Mr. Pittman. "Our strategy has not been, 'Let's do radio.' It's been, 'Let's be where our listeners are.'"

The company could even lean on its network of more than 850 terrestrial radio stations to attract podcast listeners. Through an initiative it calls "Podcast, Meet Broadcast," iHeart said actress Anna Faris would begin talking about and featuring clips from her podcast, "Anna Faris Is Unqualified," on Top 40 radio this fall. In January, it will air the full episode of the season 2 premiere of "Atlanta Monster."

"This is, to us, a natural extension of conversations that we have 24 hours a day, seven days a week, on more than 800 stations," Mr. Pittman said.

Podcasting is a fast-growing sector among marketers, but it is still dwarfed by other advertising formats. Advertisers spent an estimated $313.9 million on podcast ads in 2017, according to the Interactive Advertising Bureau, an increase of 86% from about $169.1 million a year earlier. Marketers are expected to spend about $69.87 billion on TV advertising in the U.S. in 2018, according to estimates from eMarketer.

This year, spending on traditional radio in the U.S. is projected to reach $14.41 billion, an increase of 0.5% over 2017, according to estimates from eMarketer; ad dollars are increasingly moving online to Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google.

Monthly podcast listenership has more than doubled over the past five years to 73 million, according to estimates from Edison Research, and podcast sponsorship is growing by double digits each year.

Bolstering iHeartMedia's podcast offerings will allow the company to deeply engage with younger users, Mr. Pittman said. He said that podcast listeners are valuable to advertisers because they make a decision to download and stream specific shows and episodes, effectively opting in to the content.

"We're investing in an area that has both great interest to the consumer and has the highest value to the advertiser," Mr. Pittman said.

BOE's Carney: Britain Could Lose 10% of Jobs to Automation; Central bank governor expects widespread automation to boost productivity, but lead to a period of higher unemployment

Around 10% of British jobs could be lost to automation, Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney said Friday, highlighting the potential short-term costs of the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution.

In a speech in Dublin, Mr. Carney said that widespread automation should eventually boost productivity and living standards in the global economy, but would likely mean a period of higher unemployment as more workers are replaced by robots.

Such rapid change also presents a challenge for central bankers, he said, as a period of high unemployment would likely mean weaker spending and inflation.

"If the Fourth Industrial Revolution is similar to past technological revolutions, the overall effect will eventually be labor augmenting, boosting productivity and wages, while creating new jobs to maintain or even increase overall employment," Mr. Carney said, according to a text of his remarks released by the central bank.

"But that is in the long run. In the interim, if it is similar to previous industrial revolutions, it seems likely there will be a period of technological unemployment, dislocation and rising inequality."

Anxiety over the emergence of robotics, artificial intelligence and other advanced technologies that promise to transform the workplace is growing in policy circles as greater swaths of the workforce appear at risk from automation.

In his speech, Mr. Carney stressed the need for new or revamped institutions to cushion the blow for workers displaced by machines. He suggested, for example, the need for a more developed system of further education later in life to equip workers with new skills.

He touched only briefly on the outlook for monetary policy in his remarks, saying that accelerating pay growth is adding to inflationary pressure.

He said annual pay growth is accelerating as dwindling unemployment makes it harder for companies to recruit staff. Annual private-sector pay growth hit 3% in the three months to July.

Domestic inflationary pressures are "at rates consistent with the 2% inflation target," Mr. Carney said.

The governor's remarks suggest the BOE remains broadly on track to gently raise interest rates two or more times over the next few years, provided the U.K.'s exit from the European Union in March goes smoothly.

The BOE in November said British banks are fit enough to withstand a severe economic shock, such as may occur if Britain abruptly exits the EU without an agreement over the terms of its withdrawal. The stress test it put banks through included a sharp fall in house prices and a steep rise in interest rates and inflation.

Banking & Finance: Florence Exposes Billions of 'Cat Bonds' --- Severity of storm is critical to determining how much debt would actually pay out

Roughly $14 billion in outstanding catastrophe bonds have potential exposure to hurricane damage in North or South Carolina, according to reinsurance broker Aon Securities.

But analysts say the severity of the storm will determine how many of the "cat bonds" would actually pay out.

"You have many, many bonds that are exposed to North Carolina and South Carolina, but it would take quite a large event before those bonds are affected," said Bill Dubinsky, head of insurance-linked securities at insurance broker Willis Towers Watson.

Pension funds, endowments and wealthy families have piled billions into cat bonds in recent years as they sought diversification and higher returns.

There are now $30 billion of these securities outstanding, up from roughly $26 billion a year ago, according to Aon.

The bonds allow insurance companies to transfer some of their financial risk to the capital markets and get help paying claims after hurricanes or earthquakes.

The risk to bondholders is that they can lose their principal if certain events occur, such as hurricane winds above a certain speed or damages that exceed a certain dollar threshold.

Some insurance executives warned that cat-bond investors might leave the market following huge losses from hurricanes, wildfires and other catastrophes in 2017. That year, global insured losses from natural disasters and man-made catastrophes totaled a record $144 billion, according to reinsurer Swiss Re.

But investment in cat bonds and other insurance-linked securities has grown in the past year, leaving the insurance and reinsurance sectors with an oversupply of capital. That means there is minimal risk that insurers will run out of money to pay claims, analysts and executives say.

"We're better capitalized than we've ever been," said David Flandro, global head of analytics at JLT Re, a reinsurance broker.

One cat bond that could be triggered by Florence was issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in July to help cover flood losses. Florence is expected to pound the Carolinas with rain and could cause significant flooding.

While homeowners insurance typically covers damage from hurricane winds, homeowners usually have to buy separate flood insurance from FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program.

The FEMA cat bond would cover as much as $500 million of the NFIP's losses for a single event, but only if those losses exceed $5 billion. The NFIP paid nearly $10 billion in claims following hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in 2017.

The cat bond and other reinsurance puts the NFIP in a "better position to manage losses," NFIP Chief Executive David Maurstad said last month.

Another bond focused on the Southeast U.S. was issued by Florida-based Frontline Insurance in June. The bond would cover $350 million in losses from named U.S. storms in the Carolinas, Alabama or Florida.

Frontline didn't respond to requests for comment.

The biggest home insurers by market share in North Carolina include State Farm, North Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co., Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. and Allstate Corp. The top home insurers in South Carolina are State Farm, USAA and Travelers Cos.

Beyond cat bonds, investors such as pension funds could be exposed to losses from Florence through other insurance or reinsurance arrangements. The total market for so-called insurance-linked securities, including cat bonds, stands at roughly $100 billion, according to data provider Artemis.

Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT s daily deals briefing

FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.

Jamie Dimon is finally loosening his grip on JPMorgan. Or so he claims.

Wall Street's longest-serving chief executive in power  13 years and counting   told the Financial Times that he has transitioned from quarterback to  more like the coach .

On the up are investment bank boss Daniel Pinto (pictured on the right) and retail chief Gordon Smith (pictured in the centre), who were named as co-presidents of the bank earlier this year.  He has a lot of external engagements, and he travels a lot,  London-based Pinto told the FT.  So essentially now we share among the three of us. 

Dimon, whose contract runs to 2020, is certainly spending plenty of his time thinking beyond JPMorgan. At a bank-organised event in New York on Wednesday, he lamented America's social and economic woes and prescribed as the remedy negative income taxes, an overhaul of the benefits system, and increased schools and infrastructure spending.

Donald Trump isn t fixing these issues as president. As such, Dimon said he could beat Trump in the next presidential race: I m as tough as he is, I m smarter than he is. I would be fine. He could punch me all he wants, it wouldn t work with me. I d fight right back. 

But minutes later he added 	. 	. 	. 	

 I should not have said it. I m not running for president 	. 	. 	. 	[This] proves I wouldn t make a good politician. I get frustrated because I want all sides to come together to help solve big problems. 

Pinto and Smith might not want to get too used to their new-found freedom just yet.

Takeover Panel centre stage again in 26bn Sky bid battle

One of the joys about cross-border dealmaking into the UK is explaining the peculiarities of the City of London-based Takeover Panel to the uninitiated.

In the simplest terms, the panel is a light-touch regulator independent of the government that oversees public company takeovers. Its mandate is to use its rule book to make sure the playing field is consistent and that shareholders big and small are treated equally.

And to a large extent, the system works rather well despite the fact that the panel has limited enforcement mechanisms. (Its toolkit includes punishments such as   censures  orthe much feared   cold shoulder , the threat of which managesto drive enough fear into the reputation-dependent world of UK advisory that it keeps bankers and lawyers of all stripes on their toes. Here s their website if you want to read more)

The panel, which likes to keep a low profile and operate behind the scenes, has been front and centre however in the 26bn bid battle for control of Sky, the European pay-TV broadcaster, as we have explained in previous articles and editions of DD.

Now, it is set to play an even more crucial role if either US cable group Comcast or Fox, which is being backed by its new owner Walt Disney, do not declare their competing bids for Sky as  best-and-final  by the end of the next week.

As we report:

Comcast has tabled a 14.75-a-share offer for Sky, while Fox, backed by its new owner Disney, bid 14 a share for the 61 per cent it does not own. Neither company has yet said that these offers are their final bids, so shareholders have anticipated improved terms.

 &

Takeover Panel rules stipulate that bids cannot be changed two weeks before the end of a 60-day offer period, with the clock having been set when Fox submitted its formal document in early August. This means September 22 is the last day for Fox and Comcast to revise their bids. If neither company specifies that they have made a best and final bid, an auction process will be triggered under panel rules.

The exact mechanism for an auction process is subject to change if all parties involved can agree upon a framework. But if they don t, one of the longest-running takeover situations in UK history will be decided by a process that includes sealed bids in the coming weeks.

Auctions like this administered by the Takeover Panel are incredibly rare, with the last real high-profile episode taking place in 2008. Read up on that here and more in our story on the Sky situation.

Whatever happens, Sky shareholders must be thrilled. When Sky first agreed to be acquired outright by Fox in December 2016, the offer price valued its shares at 10.75 a piece. Its stock is sitting at 15.45 heading into Thursday in anticipation of the auction.

EV maker Nio and other Chinese IPOs hit a speed bump

People like to call Chinese electric vehicle maker Nio the  Tesla of China . The company demonstrated some similarities to its US peer on Wednesday when investors showed lukewarm interest in Nio s US initial public offering, which priced at the bottom of its range at $6.25 per share. Here s the FT story.

The Tencent-backed group raised just $1bn in the deal, or almost half the targeted $1.8bn, according to bankers. It starts trading on Thursday morning in New York.

Tesla has had a rough month, mainly due to Elon Musk s irresponsible use of Twitter and marijuana.Nio problems, by contrast, are multi-faceted, perhaps with some bearish feelings reverberating from issues connected to the US electric vehicle.

But the main challenge for Nio has been felt across many Chinese tech-related IPOs, where investors seem to have grown cooler and cooler on the big China promises (bottomless market demand, unparalleled technological innovation) and increasingly aware of the risks (slowing economy, building financial turbulence, a glut of tech start-ups).

The company's record is also patchy. Nio has lost a net Rmb10.9bn-plus ($1.6bn) in the past three years and has come under attack from consumers in recent months over a range of problems spanning electricity consumption, missed delivery deadlines and manufacturing defects.

Nio is the first of a handful of Chinese vehicle start-ups to seek to tap the market. There is also a long pipeline of Chinese tech groups that are expected to float either in Hong Kong or New York over the next year. Food services group Meituan-Dianping prices this week too.

The companies, and the investment banks, are hoping this is just a speed bump in the market and not the tail-end of positive sentiment for Chinese IPOs.

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/hurricane-florence-threat-still-catastrophic-forecasters-warn-1536847406?mod=article_inline"roughly $14 billion in outstanding catastrophe bonds with potential exposure to hurricane damage in North or South Carolina, according to reinsurance broker Aon Securities.

But analysts say the severity of the storm will determine how many of the "cat bonds" would actually pay out.

"You have many, many bonds that are exposed to North Carolina and South Carolina, but it would take quite a large event before those bonds are affected," said Bill Dubinsky, head of insurance-linked securities at insurance broker Willis Towers Watson.

Pension funds, endowments and wealthy families have piled billions into cat bonds in recent years as they sought diversification and higher returns.

There are now $30 billion of these securities outstanding, up from roughly $26 billion a year ago, according to Aon.

The bonds allow insurance companies to transfer some of their financial risk to the capital markets and get help paying claims after hurricanes or earthquakes.

The risk to bondholders is that they can lose their principal if certain events occur, such as hurricane winds above a certain speed or damages that exceed a certain dollar threshold.

Some insurance executives warned that cat-bond investors might leave the market following huge losses from hurricanes, wildfires and other catastrophes in 2017. That year, global insured losses from natural disasters and man-made catastrophes totaled a record $144 billion, according to reinsurer Swiss Re.

But "https://www.wsj.com/articles/reinsurers-hit-by-catastrophe-losses-rising-competition-1519049090" and other insurance-linked securities has grown in the past year, leaving the insurance and reinsurance sectors with an oversupply of capital. That means there is minimal risk that insurers will run out of money to pay claims, analysts and executives say.

"We're better capitalized than we've ever been," said David Flandro, global head of analytics at JLT Re, a reinsurance broker.

One cat bond that could be triggered by Florence was issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in July to help "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fema-wants-investors-to-provide-shelter-in-the-next-storm-1522880186". Florence is expected to pound the Carolinas with rain and could cause significant flooding.

While homeowners insurance typically covers damage from hurricane winds, homeowners usually have to buy separate flood insurance from FEMA's National Flood Insurance Program.

The FEMA cat bond would cover as much as $500 million of the NFIP's losses for a single event, but only if those losses exceed $5 billion. The NFIP paid nearly $10 billion in claims following hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in 2017.

The cat bond and other reinsurance puts the NFIP in a "better position to manage losses," NFIP Chief Executive David Maurstad said last month.

Another bond focused on the Southeast U.S. was issued by Florida-based Frontline Insurance in June. The bond would cover $350 million in losses from named U.S. storms in the Carolinas, Alabama or Florida.

Frontline didn't respond to requests for comment.

The biggest home insurers by market share in North Carolina include State Farm, North Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co., Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. and Allstate Corp. The top home insurers in South Carolina are State Farm, USAA and Travelers Cos.

Beyond cat bonds, investors such as pension funds could be exposed to losses from Florence through other insurance or reinsurance arrangements. The total market for so-called insurance-linked securities, including "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-insurance-industry-has-been-turned-upside-down-by-catastrophe-bonds-1470598470?mod=article_inline", stands at roughly $100 billion, according to data provider Artemis.

US
Fewer Households in Hurricane Florence's Path Have Flood Insurance Than in 2013; Coverage rates have fallen over past five years even as coastal development in the Carolinas has increased

Fewer homeowners in North and South Carolina own flood insurance than five years ago, signaling many won't have access to ready cash if they need to rebuild after "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hurricane-florence-could-be-the-storm-of-a-lifetime-1536759584?mod=hp_lead_pos5".

Standard homeowners' insurance policies typically cover much of the damage that can happen to a structure, but they "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-does-your-homeowners-policy-cover-in-disasters-often-not-enough-1533207601?mod=article_inline" and, in some coastal counties, wind damage. Instead, homeowners must buy separate policies to get the excluded coverage. For flood policies, they typically buy from the U.S. government.

As of July 31, the latest figures available, the 134,306 policies in place in North Carolina from the National Flood Insurance Program represented a 3.6% decline from 2013. In South Carolina, ownership was down 1.2%, to 204,342, according to an analysis of government data by The Wall Street Journal.

The declines come despite significant building along the coast in both states over that same period.

"Residents of these states are materially less prepared than they were in the past to deal with the financial consequences associated with major flooding events," said Robert Hartwig, a risk-management and insurance professor at the University of South Carolina's Darla Moore School of Business.

The "https://www.wsj.com/articles/american-homeowners-still-have-a-big-underinsurance-problem-1531922482"and low savings balances across much of the U.S. population will force hundreds of thousands of homeowners to seek federal disaster assistance in the form of grants and loans, he said.

A year after Hurricane Harvey left many Texans in dire financial straits, tens of thousands of uninsured or underinsured residents continue to struggle to repair flooded homes.

Florence is expected to pack a hard punch if it makes landfall as predicted in the Carolinas. Much of the damage is predicted to occur as the hurricane stalls and unleashes heavy rains.

In the port town of Morehead City, N.C., Len Gibbs of insurance and real-estate firm Chalk & Gibbs Inc. said some customers have opted to forgo flood insurance because of the cost, which has been rising in recent years.

"We've seen people who've gotten their mortgages paid off, and even if they are in a high-risk flood zone, they haven't experienced flooding in their neighborhood, so they say, 'I'm not going to pay thousands of dollars for this insurance,' " he said.

In one recent example, the owner of a large, elevated and expensive home in Ocean Isle Beach, N.C., faced a $9,071 annual flood-insurance premium. "They said, 'We'll roll the dice' " at that price, which was up from $5,600 in 2006.

While it is unlikely that living quarters of beach homes elevated on pilings would be flooded, dangerous surge could knock houses off their pilings, Mr. Gibbs said.

Most insurers have excluded flooding damage in their home policies for at least 50 years, yet many homeowners learn they aren't covered only after their property has been ravaged.

People with federally backed home mortgages are required to buy the additional flood coverage if they are in a designated high-risk area, but it is optional for everybody else.

Last year's string of hurricanes including Harvey, Irma and Maria was a wake-up call to many people of the limitations of their homeowners' policies. In the aftermath of those disasters, policy ownership rose 3.6% in North Carolina and 2.8% in South Carolina.

Still, the buying spurt has been relatively muted. Nationally, the number of policies has grown about 3% since last summer to 5.1 million across the 50 states, below the nearly 5.5 million policies held in September 2012.

In North Carolina, one of the 20 coastal counties appears much better prepared. Roughly 60% of estimated housing units in Dare County part of the Outer Banks barrier islands are covered by the government policies, according to the Journal's analysis. In South Carolina, two of the eight coastal counties have coverage rates above a third of the estimated housing units.

Officials with the federal program couldn't be immediately reached.

In comments to the Journal in July, David Maurstad, the program's chief executive, said, "We have a long way to go to meet our goal of closing the insurance gap."

One potential help for some homeowners comes from the private market.

"More and more are coming into the market to try to help with the problem," said Mark Anquillare, chief operating officer of Verisk Analytics. Those selling flood coverage typically offer it as a slice that kicks in above the limits of the federal policies. The government caps coverage at $250,000 for the home and $100,000 for contents.

Prior to Hack, Equifax Feared Chinese Spying

Two years before Equifax Inc. stunned the world with the announcement it had been hacked, the credit-reporting company believed it was the victim of another theft, only this time at the hands of Chinese spies, according to people familiar with the matter.

In the previously undisclosed incident, security officials feared that former employees had removed thousands of pages of proprietary information before leaving and heading to jobs in China. Materials included code for planned new products, HR files and manuals.

Equifax went to the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency. Investigators from the company and the FBI came to view events at Equifax as potentially a huge theft of data-not of consumers' personal data, as happened with the subsequent 2017 hacking of Equifax's files, but of confidential business information.

Equifax security officials briefed the then-chief executive, Richard Smith, at a fall 2015 meeting, spreading high stacks of paper across the length of the boardroom table. The printouts represented what they feared was stolen. Adding to suspicions, the Chinese government had recently asked eight companies to help it build a national credit-reporting system.

At one point, Equifax grew so worried it began building a way to monitor the computer activity of all of its ethnic-Chinese employees, according to people familiar with the investigation. The resource-heavy project, which raised legal concerns internally, was short-lived.

Some investigators believed Equifax's focus on the matter contributed to a delay in its understanding the extent of the 2017 hack of consumers' information, an event that hammered the stock, cost some executives their jobs and damaged the company's reputation.

Ultimately, the investigation undertaken by the FBI stalled. The FBI wanted to pursue a criminal case, believing the theft of trade secrets costs the U.S. hundreds of billions of dollars a year, with China the leading offender, said people familiar with the investigation. Equifax began to worry about legal exposure and how onerous the inquiry could be, said these people, and eventually reduced its cooperation with law enforcement.

That left many of the questions raised by the investigation, both about Equifax and about China, unresolved.

This account of the events at Equifax is based on people familiar with the investigation.

Equifax, in a written statement, said it became aware in 2015 of "efforts by a former employee to obtain company information, and launched an internal investigation into his activities." The company "brought the investigation to the attention of U.S. law enforcement authorities and cooperated with the federal agencies," Equifax said.

"Although this individual had improperly obtained proprietary Equifax information," it said, "the information we determined was accessed was general in nature and not material or harmful to Equifax, consumers or our business clients." Equifax said the company has "no evidence to suggest that consumer data or other personal information was compromised, or that this individual targeted this type of information."

Equifax didn't address in its statement whether it thought other employees were involved. A person familiar with the company's thinking disputed the notion that Equifax reduced its cooperation with law enforcement in a probe it had itself triggered.

Representatives of the FBI and CIA declined to comment. The Chinese Embassy in Washington didn't respond to requests for comment.

One of the former employees Equifax and the FBI investigated was Daniel Zou, who worked in Toronto. The company he joined in China was Ant Financial, a fast-growing financial-technology affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.

Both Ant and Mr. Zou denied any involvement in taking proprietary Equifax data. Alibaba referred questions to Ant.

Ant, based in Hangzhou, China, said it "has never used Equifax code, scripts or algorithms in the development of its own products and services."

Mr. Zou, in a sworn statement provided by his lawyer, said, "I deny that I worked with or consulted with a network of Equifax colleagues to steal Equifax code for Ant Financial or that I provided any such code to Ant Financial."

Interviewed by The Wall Street Journal in Washington, Mr. Zou, a 35-year-old Chinese-born Canadian citizen who graduated from the University of Toronto, repeated his denial and said that learning from the Journal of Equifax's suspicions had been "a nightmare."

Those suspicions arose in 2015, a few months after Mr. Zou left his job as an Equifax product manager to join Ant's new credit-scoring business, which is known as Sesame Credit in English. Ant was among the companies asked by China's central bank to develop credit-scoring services. Sesame launched its service in January 2015, several months before Mr. Zou came aboard.

Equifax's data-loss prevention system, which guards against sensitive information leaving the corporate network, flagged the activities of Mr. Zou, according to people familiar with the investigation. The system alerted that an employee might have taken data off the network, and initially registered it as benign, they said.

Mr. Zou said in his interview that, according to his understanding of how the system works, it would warn the person removing the data on the spot. He said he never received such a warning. Equifax declined to say whether that is how the system works or whether Mr. Zou received a warning.

At the same time, Equifax officials also had suspicions about a different employee, in another city. Equifax's security chief, Susan Mauldin, approached the FBI with a question: What would it look like if we were being targeted by China?

FBI officials told her in one technique, a group makes plans to visit a company's office to pitch a partnership, then at the last minute replaces delegation members with spies. Around this time, a delegation from a Chinese business visited Equifax and swapped out some members at the last minute, fueling Equifax's suspicions.

Company security officials decided to examine Mr. Zou's computer activity. They discovered he had printed out thousands of pages of company information. The material related to the way credit scores are obtained, what different pieces of data mean and how to apply algorithms to assess troves of data, according to the people familiar with the investigation. They said some was information that could help explain products Equifax was working on.

At around the same time they were examining Mr. Zou's systems, investigators discovered what they believed to be a major infiltration campaign. They found that other employees had sent code to their personal email and uploaded it to software-development platforms others could access.

According to the people familiar with the probe, the investigators, by talking to Equifax employees and examining email accounts and LinkedIn messages sent to them, saw indications that recruiters purporting to represent Ant affiliate Alibaba had offered to triple salaries for certain ethnically Chinese Equifax employees-and provided instructions on specific Equifax information they should bring along if they jumped ship.

The investigators saw, as well, that Mr. Zou had searched the Equifax HR system to look up data analytics teams in the U.S. He had printed out contact information for many ethnic-Chinese employees, according to people familiar with the probe. They said some of those employees told colleagues they were later contacted by recruiters who claimed to be working on behalf of Alibaba.

The investigators found notes on Chinese messaging service WeChat in which another group of Equifax employees in North America, using company-issued phones, arranged off-hours meetings to discuss work projects and left Equifax soon after, saying they were going to Ant or Sesame for big raises.

Ant said Mr. Zou is the only former Equifax employee it has hired since it began collecting employment history information in 2011. Ant said Mr. Zou began at its credit-scoring business in May 2015. It listed a five-figure starting salary for Mr. Zou and said he wasn't promised any large bonuses.

Ant said it didn't "directly or indirectly through third-party recruiters" encourage job applicants to steal Equifax information. Ant prohibits employees and recruiters from requesting such activity, the company said, adding that third-party recruiters aren't authorized to make job offers on its behalf.

Ant said it hadn't been contacted by Equifax or any government investigators about such matters. After receiving an inquiry from the Journal about Mr. Zou, Ant said, it investigated his information-technology activities and found no evidence he had ever provided Ant with any Equifax code, scripts or algorithms.

Mr. Zou said he worked in marketing and didn't have access to Equifax code, algorithms and other proprietary information; never took any to Ant; wasn't asked to; and never encouraged others to.

"I deny that I searched an internal Equifax human resources database to recruit Equifax employees to join Ant Financial," Mr. Zou said in the sworn declaration provided by a lawyer. "I further deny that I printed contact information for ethnic-Chinese Equifax employees as part of an effort to recruit such employees to join Ant Financial."

In the Journal interview, Mr. Zou said, "I think [where] this might come from is that during my time at Equifax I had a habit of sending work-related documents to my own email so that I could work at home. If any of those contain [any] of what they call the alleged proprietary information, right after I left Equifax and before I went back to China, I deleted them all. And I did not share that with anybody." If investigators were alarmed by his email practices, Mr. Zou said, "I think that's a huge misunderstanding."

Mr. Zou also said he printed out employee contact information for projects that required him to work with global colleagues. "Equifax Canada did not want to reinvent the wheel from beginning," he said, "so my job was to piggyback the success case" from the company's U.S., U.K. and Latin American regions.

He said he disposed of all the documents before moving to China and joining Ant, and he denied targeting any ethnicity. "If you search a data analytics team, the likelihood is high that you will reach a Chinese employee," he said.

Mr. Zou said he had never been contacted by Equifax or any government authorities about data theft, and learning he was suspected caused him "emotional turmoil."

Although Equifax had gone to the FBI-and although the bureau was eager to pursue the matter-Equifax officials by the middle of 2016 had grown wary of providing more information to federal investigators.

Equifax worried that doing so could trigger requirements under securities law for disclosure of material information, said the people familiar with the investigation. They said Equifax also was concerned that handing over access to its entire network, including international operations, as the FBI had requested, could run afoul of obligations in some countries where Equifax operates.

Around the middle of 2016, Equifax told its internal investigators to comply with any potential subpoenas, but to stop proactively providing information to law enforcement, said the people familiar with the investigation. The person familiar with Equifax who disputed the notion the company directed employees to be uncooperative said: "As the investigation progressed, we did ask that requests for information be passed through our legal office to ensure we were adhering to standard legal protocols."

Equifax continued to monitor certain employees through 2016 and 2017. It eventually confronted several ethnically Chinese employees over activities found in its investigation, according to people familiar with the probe.

FBI officials in Atlanta got the impression from then-CEO Mr. Smith and legal staff that the company didn't believe it generally had information valuable enough to be the target of a major Chinese campaign. Mr. Smith told colleagues even if thieves had taken code, they didn't have Equifax's consumer data, which meant the theft wouldn't pose a competitive threat. Moreover, Equifax didn't see a material impact on current operations because the information that appeared to have been stolen related to products in development, not to existing ones.

The U.S. attorney's office in Atlanta ultimately determined it didn't have evidence the suspected thefts were directed by the Chinese government, a top priority for law enforcement. The prosecutors decided they wouldn't pursue a case against anyone, since Equifax wasn't eager to do so, and since what former employees were suspected of taking was corporate information rather than anything directly affecting U.S. consumers.

The U.S. attorney's office declined to comment.

Then, in September 2017, came blockbuster Equifax news: the disclosure that a hacking of its files had exposed highly sensitive personal data on more than 140 million Americans.

Equifax had learned six months earlier, in March 2017, of a software vulnerability, but waited months to fully check its encrypted traffic to see whether it had been breached. Only in July 2017 did it realize the hack had exposed personal information, including Social Security numbers and dates of birth, of nearly half the U.S. population.

This delay was partially due to Equifax's failure to resolve a dispute between its technology and information-security staffs at a time when top security people were focused on possible infiltration from China, in the opinion of some of the people familiar with the investigation. The person familiar with Equifax's thinking said the hack involved both human error and technological failure, and Equifax was forthcoming about it.

In the weeks following the disclosure of that breach, Mr. Smith resigned, as did Ms. Mauldin and Equifax's chief information officer, David Webb. All couldn't be reached or didn't respond to comment requests.

In January 2018, Chinese officials rolled out a state-backed credit-scoring company and gave Ant Financial an 8% stake.

Mr. Zou has returned to Canada. Ant transferred him from Sesame Credit to its Alipay international business unit in Hangzhou in mid-2017. On June 1 of this year, he moved to Alipay Canada in Vancouver.

Help to Buy scheme likely to be extended beyond 2021, says Barclays

Wednesday 16:30 BST

What s happening

% SSE led the UK utilities sharply lower after a profit warning.

SSE warned that a dry, windless summer and persistently high gas prices reduced adjusted operating profit for the five months of the financial year by 190m, meaning adjusted first-half earnings before tax would be about half the 586m it delivered in the same period in 2017. The higher gas costs meant its energy portfolio management division was expected to lose more than 300m in the full year, compared with market expectations of about break-even.

SSE flagged in July that warm weather had hit first-quarter earnings by about 80m. The latest warning reduced full-year adjusted earnings by about 350m, or earnings a share by 30p, against a consensus of 115.6p, said RBC.  What is not clear at this stage is whether the energy portfolio management losses will continue into future periods. We expect SSE to react very negatively to this unexpected news, with the reiteration of dividend guidance likely to be the only element of support,  said RBC.

% Cigarette makers British American Tobacco and Imperial Brands rallied after the US Food and Drug Administration said it was considering a ban on flavoured ecigarettes.  We see clear signs that youth use of electronic cigarettes has reached an epidemic proportion, and we must adjust certain aspects of our comprehensive strategy to stem this clear and present danger,  the FDA said. It gave the makers of the five top-selling national brands, which includes BAT s Vuse digital vapour pipe, 60 days to come up with a strategy to deter children from taking up vaping.

The top five vaping brands   Vuse, Altria s MarkTenXL, Japan Tobacco s Logic, Imperial Brands  Blu and independently owned Juul   make up 97 per cent of the US market, the FDA said.  We think there is a 65 per cent chance that regulators will force the removal of a material number of these companies  ecigarette products from the US market before the end of calendar year 2018, pending additional regulatory approvals that will likely take years to complete,  said Height Analytics.

 For us, it is Juul that is most at risk of removal,  added Jefferies.  We believe there is a growing body of evidence that a large portion of its sales are coming from youth. This popularity amongst youth is largely a legacy of the marketing practices used in the early days of the company, which was heavily reliant on social media. By contrast, the majors, well aware of their responsibilities, have been very careful right from the start not to do anything which could encourage youth access, and also from the start have put significant actions into place to prevent youth access. 

% Dunelm rallied to the top of the FTSE 250 gainers after full-year results from the homewares retailer matched a pre-close trading update and came with a slightly improved dividend, despite profit before tax falling 6.7 per cent to 102m. New chief executive Nick Wilkinson said the group would slow expansion by about half, reducing the rate of store openings to between three and five a year.

% Galpagos of Belgium led the Stoxx 600 gainers after revealing positive headline results from the maiden late-stage trial of its flagship pipeline drug to treat rheumatoid arthritis. The filgotinib pill met all primary and key secondary endpoints while revealing no new safety concerns. Safety had been a concern for investors after mixed results from peers developing the drug type, known as Jak inhibitors, including two deaths during a trial of AbbVie s rival Upadacitinib treatment.

Berenberg forecast peak sales of $4bn for the drug, which if approved will be marketed by Gilead Sciences in exchange for royalty and milestone payments.  An approval and good competitive position within the class is increasingly within reach,  it said.  Reassuringly, there was a clear dose response, with the high dose demonstrating greater efficacy than the low dose   something that has not been consistently seen with competitor agents. 

Sellside stories

% UBS repeated  sell  advice on RELX, the academic journals publisher, in response to what its analysts saw as a growing threat from open access to research. Its note followed last week s publication of Plan-S, a scheme backed by the European Commission and European Research Council that aims by 2020 to limit publication of papers funded by 11 national research groups to full open access journals.

 We estimate the organisations involved represent 5-10 per cent of global research funding,  said UBS. Fewer articles ending up in subscription journals may force RELX to reduce pricing when it negotiates renewals and was likely to cost market share, added the broker. However, it saw implementation of Plan-S as a challenge, as it  contradicts a principle that until now has been held universally   the freedom of researchers to select the venue for publication. 

% Barclays upgraded Taylor Wimpey from  equal weight  to  overweight  and made the opposite call on Crest Nicholson in a review of the UK housebuilders.

A pullback from late-October highs meant the headwinds facing the housebuilders were largely priced in, said Barclays, which moved from bearish to neutral on the sector. Trading had remained robust, with little or no sign of a slowdown despite the hot weather and the football World Cup, it added. But it cautioned:  For most builders, forecasts are stable at high levels, but evidence suggests that the earnings upgrade cycle has largely run its course for now, amid a more uncertain outlook. 

On Help to Buy, Barclays expected the mortgage subsidy to be extended beyond the sunset date of 2021, arguing:  So pivotal is it to the government s overall housing aims that we expect it to overlook its shortcomings.  Tweaks to the UK scheme were likely to be announced either at the Conservative party conference starting on September 30 or more likely at the Autumn Budget, it said.

On Taylor Wimpey, Barclays said the shares had underperformed peers recently and now offered a  very attractive  11 per cent dividend yield. Bovis Homes, upgraded from  underweight  to  equal weight , was  also a high yielder and where the turnaround story is now well advanced . Crest Nicholson s bias towards the south of England led Barclays to turn cautious.

% Goldman upgraded Royal Bank of Scotland from  neutral  to  buy  with a 345p target.

Competition in the UK mortgage market remained intense, with pricing likely to stay under pressure as HSBC and RBS fought to win market share, said Goldman. But RBS was less affected by the competition because it had a smaller mortgage book than Lloyds Banking Group, as well as a much smaller back book, said the broker.

RBS traded at a 25 per cent discount to Lloyds based on tangible book value, Goldman said.  We believe this discount is unwarranted as we forecast RBS s return on tangible equity to match and even exceed Lloyds  over time. 

% JPMorgan Cazenove downgraded Telefnica from  neutral  to  underweight  in a European telecoms sector review.

 A decade of deflationary pressure and rising capital intensity has left telcos struggling to define their equity story,  said JPMorgan, which criticised the choice by some managements to protect dividends and equity free cash flow yields by loading up with debt.

 We find it a paradox that despite ongoing competitive risks, evasive top-line growth, disruptive capital expenditure cycles, and weak cash conversion, telcos are the most levered sector in Europe. Given a wave of upcoming spectrum auctions, leverage is unlikely to improve even midterm. Secondly, we believe debt and dividend constraints have fostered a defensive mentality that has stifled entrepreneurial thinking. 

Deutsche Telekom s impressive growth meant it could reduce leverage quickly, while Vodafone and Telecom Italia have some flexibility through cost-cutting and disposals, but Telefnica  may be out of options , said JPMorgan. Exposure to emerging market currencies and falling subsidiary valuations were combining with an escalation of competition in Spain, which left Telefnica looking exposed given its  very high  all-in leverage debt ratio of 4.4 times 2019 operating earnings, the broker said.

% In brief: Andritz rated new  overweight  at JPMorgan; Anglo American upgraded to  buy  at HSBC; Bucher cut to  sell  at Berenberg; Capital & Counties upgraded to  neutral  at Exane BNP Paribas; Fiat Chrysler upgraded to  outperform  at Exane; Gestamp raised to  overweight  at JPMorgan; Goals Soccer Centres upgraded to  buy  at Peel Hunt; ING raised to  buy  at Santander; Nexans cut to  neutral  at Credit Suisse; Scout24 rated new  underperform  at Exane; Subsea 7 raised to  buy  and Technip upgraded to  neutral  at Redburn; Strix rated new  buy  at Peel Hunt.

Former PM Blair's son raises $4m for start-up

Technology

A tech start-up co-founded by the 34-year-old son of former UK prime minister Tony Blair has raised $4m in a seed funding round led by Silicon Valley investor Lightspeed Venture Partners.

WhiteHat co-founders Euan Blair and Sophie Adelman started the company two years ago to train and connect apprentices with employers including Google, Facebook, WeWork, Salesforce, Warner Bros and Burberry.

It has remained relatively small, relying on a grant of around 300,000 from Ufi, a charitable trust that supports vocational training, and a 567,211 "capital contribution," which the company said came from "friends and family" including the Blairs.

The new funding from Lightspeed, which is best-known as the first outside investor in messaging app Snapchat, will be used to hire coders and data scientists to develop WhiteHat's machine learning technology, which matches apprentices to jobs.

The investment should boost the credentials of the start-up, which has faced scrutiny because of Mr Blair's highprofile parents, Tony and Cherie Blair. Euan Blair has also invested in property with his mother through a company called Oldbury Residential.

Ms Adelman said WhiteHat met its new investors through her and Euan Blair's personal contacts and had been "put through the wringer" by Lightspeed to demonstrate its financial viability. She said the group was due to move out of its current offices in a building owned by the Blairs to a WeWork co-working space in London. Tony Blair had "no involvement whatsoever in the fundraising" his spokeswoman said.

Village Global, a fund with capital from technology entrepreneurs including Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, also participated in the funding round.

"They brought one idea together in a way that really changes the game," said Nakul Mandan, partner at Lightspeed. "Their model really relies on them delivering value to the companies they are giving apprentices to."

WhiteHat has put 500 apprentices through its training process so far, 65 per cent from minority ethnic backgrounds, 50 per cent who have claimed free school meals and 7 per cent who are refugees or asylum seekers.

Today's Top Stories

Test-tube brain startup: Miniature brains, robotic automation and data science may be the trifecta of tools that reveal new ways to treat neurological disorders. At least, that's the working hypothesis of System1 Biosciences Inc., which has built a business working with what the startup calls brain organoids: tiny, three-dimensional structures grown from stem cells to function as a simplified version of the brain's cortex region. CRV and Pfizer Ventures are backing System1. WSJ Pro's Heather Mack has the exclusive.

China's IPO parade: Shanghai-based electric car maker NIO Inc. priced its U.S. initial public offering near the bottom of its expected price range, placing a $6.42 billion valuation on the company. The offering would yield proceeds of about $1 billion. Investors have included Sequoia Capital, Temasek, Baidu and Tencent. More from WSJ Pro's Katie Roof.

Polychain a one-hit wonder? Olaf Carlson-Wee's Polychain Capital earned investors including Andreessen Horowitz a staggering 2,303% return last year. Now, the 29-year-old Mr. Carlson-Wee must prove he isn't a one-hit wonder. It isn't going well as he straddles the line between crypto kid and crypto king. WSJ's Rob Copeland has more.

Crypto crackdown: Regulators scored a victory in their crackdown on cryptocurrency crimes as a judge ruled that initial coin offerings are subject to U.S. securities-fraud laws. It was the first time a federal court had weighed in on the government's jurisdiction over ICOs in a criminal case, lawyers said. WSJ's Alexander Osipovich has more.

Davis's Take: Cleantech Is Getting Some Action

After a few years in the wilderness of venture investing, cleantech is forcing its way back into the spotlight.

To some global investors, however, it never really went out of style.

This week's Global Climate Summit, convening in San Francisco, provides an occasion to take stock of how much has changed since those days. A lot, as it happens.

While Silicon Valley turned most of its attention to deals outside cleantech, the rest of the world (notably China and Europe) stayed focused on this whole climate business.

Now that the global climate conference has come to Silicon Valley, a good many U.S. venture capitalists have a fresh opportunity to re-engage in this part of the market. Longtime sustainability-focused investors like Westly Group and DBL Partners are taking part in the event.

Twitch founder Kan raises $65m for start-ups' law firm

Technology

Justin Kan, co-founder of live-streaming site Twitch, has raised $65m for his latest venture, Atrium, which is using machine learning to automate legal services   and bring down legal bills   for start-ups.

Andreessen Horowitz is leading the round with partners Marc Andreessen and Andrew Chen joining Atrium's board. Mr Kan, a veteran entrepreneur who served as a partner at Silicon Valley accelerator Y Combinator, co-founded Atrium in 2017 with Augie Rakow, a former partner at Orrick, a tech-focused law firm.

Twitch, which Mr Kan started as the eponymous live-streaming site Justin.tv, was acquired by Amazon for $1bn in 2014. "I have been an involuntary power user of legal services over the years," Mr Kan said in an interview.

After founding several companies and advising many more at Y Combinator, he said he became frustrated with the lack of transparency in legal services, when "opening your legal bill [can be] like playing Russian roulette".

Atrium is one of a new crop of tech companies targeting the legal profession from LegalZoom   which raised $500m in a secondary financing in July   to newer start-ups including Everlaw, Ravn and Logikcull. Last week, Toronto-based Kira Systems, another company using artificial intelligence for contract processing, raised $50m from Insight Venture Partners.

Atrium employs machine-learning techniques to analyse legal documents and automatically extract key data points, a process that might take a human lawyer many billable hours.

Thanks to advances in AI, "that's really something in the last couple of years that's become possible," said Mr Chen. For clients, the benefits are lower costs and more predictable bills. The system has been used in $500m worth of primary financing for start-ups including scooter rentals service Bird and MessageBird, a cloud-based telecoms company. Atrium now has 110 employees and 250 active clients.

"Our eventual goal is, if we prove this works for start-ups, we can apply that to other practice areas," Mr Kan said.

Atrium goes further than most of its competitors by operating as two distinct entities with shared sets of ownership: Atrium LTS, a software company, and Atrium LLP, a new law firm that uses the software company's tools.

Because law firms cannot raise venture capital, Atrium LTS loans funds to Atrium LLP for operations. However, tying the two together has proved controversial, with some lawyers questioning whether such a tie-in could run foul of ethics rules.

A task force set up by the State Bar of California to consider whether regulatory changes or new ethics rules could help to drive down costs for clients and improve access to legal services is due to report by the end of next year.

Startup Uses 'Mini Brains' and Software to Power Drug Research; Partners at CRV, Pfizer Ventures take board seats at System1

Corrections & Amplifications

An earlier version of this article incorrectly spelled the name of University of California San Francisco professor Saul Kato. (Sept. 12, 2018)

Miniature brains, robotic automation and data science may be the trifecta of tools that reveal new ways to treat neurological disorders.

At least, that's the working hypothesis of System1 Biosciences Inc., which has built a business working with what the startup calls brain organoids: tiny, three-dimensional structures grown from stem cells to function as a simplified version of the brain's cortex region.

With $25 million in new funding, the company aims to identify new drug targets of neurological diseases including schizophrenia, autism and epilepsy. The Series A was led by CRV and Pfizer Ventures and brings the company's total raised to date to around $30 million.

San Francisco-based System1 didn't discover how to create brain organoids, but it has built a novel system around scaling production of them, monitoring their growth, and collecting huge amounts of data on the differences between healthy and diseased samples.

By marrying existing lab equipment that analyzes chemical substances and genetics with computer vision and machine learning, the company's system was developed to spot more disease biomarkers than researchers have previously been able to.

"What we are really doing is unlocking the power of the organoid for drug discovery through what we call deep phenotyping, which gives a systems-level description of the disease," said Chief Executive and co-founder Sean Escola.

Dr. Escola, a Columbia University neuroscience professor who founded the company with University of California San Francisco professor Saul Kato, said System1's data analytics can give a richer picture of the underlying biology of disease. This can guide development of new drug compounds, and the system also enables researchers to monitor any changes in the organoid once a new compound is tested.

"By the time you get to the clinic for human testing, you can go in with much more confidence because you were already testing on human tissue," Dr. Escola said.

Founded in January 2017 and seeded with $5 million from angel investors, System1 has spent the past year-and-a-half building out its software, hiring across biology, data science and engineering teams. Initially, it will target epilepsy, schizophrenia and autism. Over time, the company may expand into diseases formed in other parts of the brain.

CRV General Partner George Zachary said System1's work can help address a dearth of drugs for neurological disorders.

"The normal path for drug discovery for brain disorders has been unbelievably long and random about what works and doesn't work," said Mr. Zachary, who will take a board position at System1. "You can't test on people so, being able to work with real living tissue with real neurons of a patient affected by a disease gives an advantage right away."

Pfizer Ventures Partner Margi McLoughlin, who will also join the company's board, said System1 falls within Pfizer's new commitment to neuroscience investments. In June, the pharmaceutical company announced about $150 million, or 25%, of its current $600 million fund would go into neuroscience.

"The complexity of what they are developing is what drew us to System1," Ms. McLoughlin said. "They have the organoids, they have AI and they have data analytics to go after unmet needs in neuroscience."

TPG-Backed Mediware Information Systems Becomes WellSky

TPG-backed health-care software provider Mediware Information Systems Inc. is taking a new name as it sharpens its focus on the post-acute care sector.

The company is rebranding as WellSky to better reflect its range of health-care products and a growth trajectory that has been fueled in part by mergers and acquisitions.

TPG acquired Mediware from Thoma Bravo in February 2017. The company since has acquired five businesses, including Kinnser Software Inc., a home-health and hospice software provider; Fazzi Associates Inc., a provider of coding services in the home-health and hospice sectors; and revenue cycle management software provider MEDTranDirect Inc.

Nehal Raj, a partner at TPG who heads the firm's technology group, said the rebranding comes as the company intensifies its focus on the post-acute software arena, which it says represents a high-growth area of the market.

The new name also helps underscore a leadership transition for the company, which was founded in 1980. The company in July 2017 hired Bill Miller as its CEO. He previously was chief executive of OptumInsight, a unit of UnitedHealth Group Inc. platform Optum.

Mr. Miller said the company has been expanding aggressively, both through deals and organically, as a result of tailwinds in the market.

He said the company ended its 2018 fiscal year on June 30 with $260 million of revenue and $110 million in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Mr. Miller said the company is on target to hit $300 million in revenue for its 2019 fiscal year.

WellSky provides software to more than 10,000 customer sites such as home-health agencies, hospices, rehabilitation facilities, blood banks, hospitals and other health-care providers, according to a news release.

The market for post-acute care has been expanding, according to Mr. Miller. He said market dynamics have been changing dramatically, as payers place greater emphasis on the consistency of care, as well as the aging population and the increasing number of people obtaining care outside the hospital setting.

With the name change, the company also is dedicating $50 million to "beefing up capabilities around analytics," including the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning in different areas of care, Mr. Miller added.

TPG, of Fort Worth, Texas, manages investment platforms in private equity, growth capital, venture capital, real estate, credit and public equity. The deal to acquire the former Mediware was done out of the firm's "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tpg-collects-10-5-billion-for-latest-fund-1462810713?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=4", which closed on $10.5 billion in 2016.

The rebranding comes a few days after TPG led an $80 million minority-stake investment in software developer "https://www.wsj.com/articles/tpg-leads-80-million-investment-in-governance-software-provider-sonatype-1536347981?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1"

Good morning, and welcome back to your new and improved newsletter.

In today's edition, we examine the rise of black investors leading their own venture firms. We also have an exclusive on the relocation of Mithril Capital, the firm led by Peter Thiel and Ajay Royan, plus a look at another batch of venture-backed companies moving to Wall Street.

A brief word about our breakfast briefing in San Francisco on Sept. 25: I'm pleased to announce that Trae Vassallo, co-founding partner of venture firm Defy, will join our panel on the disruption of the VC model, along with Bart Stephens of Blockchain Capital and Chris Farmer of SignalFire. More information.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Higher profile: For an industry whose investors are rarely people from under-represented backgrounds, a small but growing group of minorities suddenly are in a position to write checks for startups in Silicon Valley and beyond. Earlier this year Richard Kerby, a black investor, co-founded Equal Ventures, a seed-stage firm, after previously working at Venrock as a vice president and IVP as an associate. "Sometimes the easier path is to start your own fund," said Mr. Kerby, one of several black VCs who have started firms recently. Others include Charles Hudson of Precursor Ventures (formerly of SoftTech VC), Base10 Partners' Adeyemi Ajai (an entrepreneur and investor) and Ulu Ventures' Miriam Rivera. More from WSJ Pro's Katie Roof.

Peer-to-peer lender turns to the public: Funding Circle Holdings Ltd. Monday confirmed that it plans to go ahead with an initial public offering on the London Stock Exchange, and it expects to announce the indicative price range and issue its prospectus in the coming weeks. According to recent reports, the company is aiming for a valuation of up to 2 billion. That would make it potentially London's largest fintech IPO since payment processor Worldpay was valued at 4.8 billion in 2015. Venture investors have put at least $373 million behind Funding Circle, including a $100 million Series F round announced in early 2017. More from WSJ's Ian Walker.

Robotic retail: Standard Cognition, the artificial-intelligence startup we featured in August, opened a brick-and-mortar store Friday in San Francisco that shows off its automated checkout technology. After downloading the app and linking it to a credit card, shoppers can walk in, grab groceries and leave without stopping at a cashier kiosk. Using its cameras in the ceiling, the system automatically detects what people picked up and it charges them. But it's off to a slow start: On day one, the store only admitted one customer at a time to enter. The startup beat Amazon into San Francisco, though the e-commerce titan is planning to own its own store in town. Revisit the August story by WSJ Pro's Tomio Geron.

Davis's Take: Mithril Capital Moves Its Money, and Its Headquarters

By Alexander Davis

Mithril Capital, the late-stage firm co-founded in San Francisco by Ajay Royan and Peter Thiel, is pulling up stakes to start a new home--in Texas, WSJ Pro has learned.

This is a firm that makes its moves with deliberation, especially about what companies it wants to bankroll. Since it was founded in 2012, the firm in some years has only made a couple of investments and now has 31 companies in its portfolio.

So it was noteworthy when news came that Mr. Royan was joining the board of Singapore-based GreyOrange as a part of a $140 million Series C investment in the maker of robotic systems for warehouses. The company fits what Mr. Royan calls "archetype of the hidden champion."

Mithril's investing thesis hasn't changed. As for the future home of his firm, Mr. Royan laments that Silicon Valley no longer has the bold, experimental thinking that made it "one giant incubator." The idea that there are so many incubators springing up within the region, he says, is a sad commentary on what remains.

So he has settled on Austin as his firm's new home, for its lower costs and a thriving culture of creativity and tech innovation. If all goes well, he'll even uncover a hidden champion or two.

How to pick a successful stockpicker

Serious horseracing fans make a careful study of runners and riders  form before placing a bet. Recent form, sadly, provides little guide to finding a successful fund manager as yesterday s winners turn all too frequently into today s also-rans.

Understanding why some managers consistently produce alpha   market-beating returns   requires a different approach, according to Rick Di Mascio, a former chief investment officer at the British Coal pension fund.

He describes historic performance records as  blunt and misleading  measures to evaluate whether an equity fund manager is a skilled stockpicker or not.

Inalytics, a consultancy founded by Mr Di Mascio in 1998, analyses every single trade carried out by its clients, forensically examining 400 portfolios each month.

This database, which covers about 40 active managers, has registered about 290 basis points of outperformance annually (after fees), compared with the respective portfolios  benchmarks over the past five years. About four in 10 of this group of managers consistently outperform their benchmark by 400 basis points or more a year, net of fees.

 I am strongly of the opinion that skill does exist in active management. There is an elite that do a fantastic job. In sports like tennis the average player is mediocre at best, but what about those that compete at Wimbledon? Just because the average fund manager loses money, net of fees, does not mean that there is no skill across the industry,  says Mr Di Mascio.

Inalytics  process focuses on three building blocks. The first is evaluating the contribution of research in helping to identify and add winners as measured by the impact and performance of  first buys , when new picks are added to a portfolio.

Another is analysing  sizing decisions , as large high conviction positions are the main drivers of outperformance in equity portfolios.

The final block is examining the timing and effectiveness of buying and selling decisions. The latter can be particularly problematic due to the human reluctance to admit defeat on an idea that has failed.

Combining these three scores shows that even highly skilled managers deliver alpha in just 57 per cent of the months examined.

 The margin between success and failure is very small,  says Mr Di Mascio.

He adds that asset owners or investors increasingly want managers that can deploy skill in high conviction, highly concentrated portfolios holding as few as 15 stocks in a global equity portfolio.

 It has taken 10 years for this approach to become an accepted norm. This is the response required of active managers to the rise of passives. It is how the Darwinian forces are playing out,  he says.

Some leading hedge fund managers, the most dynamic traders globally, employ in-house teams to analyse their trading strategies in a similar fashion to Inalytics.

 We really analyse the skills of the investment teams, looking at the equity research, the monetisation of their ideas, the timing of their positions: are they too early, too aggressive,  says Gerald Beeson, chief operating officer of Citadel, the $36bn Chicago-based hedge fund manager.

The increasing availability of low-cost smart beta strategies that provide exposure to known sources of higher returns, such as smaller companies or low volatility stocks, has increased the pressure on hedge fund managers to demonstrate that they can deliver true alpha   genuine skill in picking winners.

Teun Johnston, the chief executive of Man GLG, the discretionary arm, says having the correct data to evaluate the performance of portfolio managers is vital.

 Where appropriate, we want to isolate security selection skills,  he says, adding that Man Group is  investing heavily  to help its portfolio managers marry their expertise in stockpicking with quantitative techniques, for example, to improve sizing decisions.

The Church Commissioners, the steward of the Church of England s 8.3bn investment portfolio, uses Inalytics  services along with a suite of other tools to assess external money managers.

 A successful manager selection process can add value for an asset owner. Track records are poor indicators of future performance, but a trade-by-trade analysis helps us to understand if a portfolio manager s decisions are consistent with their investment philosophy and processes,  says Tom Joy, director of investments for the Church Commissioners.

Many pension schemes still decide to pick asset managers from a so-called  beauty parade  organised by an investment consultant.

 This is not a process that is likely to lead to success as it depends who performs well on the day,  says Mr Joy.

Vanguard, the world s second largest fund house, has a long history of hiring third-party providers to run active equity strategies, which it oversees via a dedicated manager research team.

Matt Piro, head of product in Europe for Vanguard, says data about individual portfolio managers, teams and entire organisations are being scrutinised in ways that were near impossible even as recently as five years ago, helping to inform more nuanced views.

 There can be fundamental differences in the way that different portfolio managers think about holding periods. Portfolio managers also tend to think differently about sizing decisions. So it is important to customise each assessment to identify what makes that portfolio manager special,  says Mr Piro.

Malcolm Smith, head of international equities at JPMorgan Asset Management, says that the best fund managers all share the same qualities   self-awareness, a drive to constantly learn, including from their mistakes, and an appetite to improve   which can be enhanced with the help of modern portfolio analysis techniques.

 We now have high quality data to help us understand what provides the edge and how we can make improvements. Do we focus on our forecasting skills, breadth of research, portfolio construction or other process issues,  says Mr Smith, who leads a 149-strong team responsible for $130bn in client assets.

Demands for greater transparency and more portfolio-level data have increased from clients. This has in turn encouraged the development of a more structured analysis of the drivers of portfolio returns for JPMorgan AM.

 We want to make sure that where we do deliver alpha that we have a high degree of confidence that we can continue to achieve that outperformance and also to improve in the future,  says Mr Smith.

A stark warning for investors who still look at past performance

Star fund managers that can deliver consistently superior investment returns are a rare species. Managers that work hard to gain prominence as skilled stockpickers often find their reputation in tatters when previously successful trading strategies no longer prove effective.

Even the very best can struggle.

Warren Buffett, who is widely regarded as the world s most successful investor, has experienced multiple periods of underperformance over his long decades as chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.

S&P Global, the indices and analytics provider, regularly publishes a  persistence scorecard  that examines the ability of managers to deliver market-beating returns over multiple periods.

The report provides a stark warning for any investor that thinks they will be able to identify a winning manager from their historic performance record.

S&P examined the performance of 1,455 US active equity funds over the five years since March 2013. Fewer than one in five funds that started in the best-performing quartile in March 2013 remained in the top group five years later.

More than a quarter (25.8 per cent) of the best performers in March 2013 dropped into the worst-performing group over the same period. Similar trends were found when the funds were divided into size categories and over one and three-year time periods.

Mark Wiseman:  If you're unwilling to evolve you're likely to get eaten 

About two decades ago Mark Wiseman had two landlines installed at his house in Toronto, and the BlackRock executive is still paying for them despite their utter disuse. The money management industry is similar, he argues.

 The erosion of the telephone landline has been far, far, far slower than anybody predicted a decade ago,  the gregarious, bespectacled Canadian points out. But like the old landline, the old way of investing is slowly but surely becoming obsolete, he predicts.

 If you re a traditional portfolio manager it s a challenging time because there s so much change happening around you,  Mr Wiseman says.  If you re unwilling to evolve you re likely going to get eaten alive. 

The hockey-loving Canadian has a good vantage point to judge. Two years ago he stepped down as chief executive of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, one of the biggest and most sophisticated pension schemes in the world, to take a position as BlackRock s senior managing director. He is global head of active equities, chairman of BlackRock Alternative Investors, and commands a prized slot on the asset manager s global executive committee.

His first job was to shake up the $304bnactive equities unit   essentially all the stock investing that does not fall under the aegis of Mark Wiedman, global head of the iShares exchange-traded fund empire. A round of previous restructurings had failed to turn around the long-disappointing stockpicking business, leading to the hiring of Mr Wiseman in 2016 and to another restructuring he oversaw last year.

The latest reorganisation, given the internal code name  Project Monarch , involved a cull of traditional mutual fund managers, shifting billions of dollars to BlackRock s San Francisco-based quantitative investment arm Systematic Active Equities, and attempting to reinvigorate the broader unit with SAE s knowhow.

The move amounted to a big bet that many investors will eventually ditch their old-school landlines   in other words, traditional human stockpickers that pore through corporate reports and economic data   for what he argues is the smartphone equivalent of investing: more sophisticated, computer-aided, big data-powered strategies.

This restructuring is now largely complete and sets up BlackRock as a more able competitor in an industry that will continue to see mounting pressures, Mr Wiseman argues. Money is already gushing out from expensive fund managers that in practice do little more than track an index, and the Ontario native predicts that the next phase will be outflows from asset managers that simply tap into one of the common investment  factors  identified by academics over the years   like value, momentum or growth   which can also be easily replicated by a cheap ETF.

 It s just the next innovation,  he says.  The same way that we learned that being an index-hugger you won t have a long career, the next step is that if you re just a factor-hugger you also won t have a long career as you can be replaced by a low-cost alternative. 

If Mr Wiseman does succeed in turning around BlackRock s equities unit it would put the former Fulbright scholar in a good position to be a contender to succeed the company s founder Larry Fink as chief executive.

Abruptly relinquishing the top job at the CPPIB surprised some observers, but it was seen as Mr Wiseman switching from being a big fish in a small pond to a smaller fish in a bigger pond   indeed the biggest pond in the asset management industry. While Mr Fink shows little sign of slowing down, he is now 65 and analysts say the poaching of Mr Wiseman shows that he was keen to inject some external competition into the mix of who might succeed him.

Although Mr Wiseman has only worked at BlackRock for two years his links to it are deeper than his tenure suggests. While at the CPPIB he had worked closely with Mr Fink on the advisory board of Focusing Capital on the Long Term   a think-tank set up by the BlackRock founder aimed at encouraging a longer time horizon among corporate executives and investors   and Mr Wiseman s wife Marcia Moffat had a year earlier been hired to lead BlackRock s Canadian business.

Mr Wiseman insists, with a studied nonchalance that brings to mind Jim Hacker s  I have no ambitions in that direction  in Yes Minister, that he is happy with what he describes as a  great job  and is not looking for another one.  I ve been a CEO, I know all that goes with it; I m in no rush to do it again,  he says.

Instead, he is now focused on ramping up BlackRock s investment capabilities in  private markets , given his chairmanship of BlackRock Alternative Investors and his longstanding interest in the field (he initially joined CPPIB in 2005 as senior vice-president for private investments).

Private markets, broadly speaking, are anything that are not traded on an exchange, such as real estate, infrastructure, direct loans or shares in non-public companies. Given how the private debt market has exploded in size and the public equities universe is now shrinking due to sluggish listings and vast buyback programmes, this is a huge opportunity for BlackRock, Mr Wiseman argues. But he laments the publicly listed company s declining importance.

 We should pay close attention to it,  he says.  The joint stock company is a fantastic innovation 	. 	. 	. 	but when public markets become too complicated, too regulated, too expensive, too intermediated, too volatile 	. 	. 	. 	what happens to that source of efficient financing to fuel economic growth? Have we got, or are we getting to a point, where the public company is no longer able to do that? 

The mounting complexity of markets is another topic on Mr Wiseman s mind. BlackRock s increasing emphasis on computer-powered, systematic strategies and enhancing traditional fund managers with their tools is very much part of the investment industry s broader zeitgeist. But there are a number of analysts, fund managers and even regulators that fret that the speed and complexity of modern algorithmic markets have made them more fragile.

Mr Wiseman argues that leverage is still the ultimate poison for the financial system, and remained contained by post-crisis regulations. But he concedes that  operational  dangers are on the rise, using his cars   a modern, high-tech Audi and a vintage 1965 Mustang   as a metaphor to explain his view.

When he opens the hood of the Mustang he can figure out how it works, and with the help of some YouTube videos fix most things that break. But he admits he recently struggled to even pop the hood of his Audi when the oil needed changing.

 My Audi never breaks down, but when it does, I m calling roadside assistance. There s no way I m going to figure out how to fix that thing,  he admits.  It s not just that markets are becoming more complex. It s their interconnectedness, the reliance on servers and data, and the potential for some unrelated entity in the ecosystem to simply break down   either through malicious action or simply by accident   that we should pay attention to.

Welcome to a new, mobile-friendly look for your WSJ Pro Venture Capital newsletter. We hope it's familiar but also fresh. What hasn't changed is our commitment to bringing you an information-packed daily briefing that gives you a competitive advantage.

In today's edition: Venture investors have shaken off the quiet of summer's doldrums and are picking up the deal-flow pace. We have an exclusive report on early-stage investor Boldstart's newest fund. Plus, Saudi Arabia has dreams of becoming a player in venture investing, and PageDuty has joined the Billion Dollar Startup Club.

And now on to the news...

Today's Top Stories

Boldstart starts fresh: New York-based firm Boldstart is in the market to raise $75 million for a new fund, according to a person familiar with the matter. The firm, founded by Ed Sims and Eliot Durbin in 2010, raised $47 million for its previous fund in 2015. Boldstart's strategy centers on providing seed capital to technical founders often at a point when they have an idea but no product yet. The firm then uses relationships with corporations to help the startup sign customer deals. WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova has the exclusive.

Saudis plot fund strategy: Saudi Arabia's national oil company wants to get in on the mega-fund game. Better known as Aramco, the company is considering a $1 billion VC fund to invest in international technology companies, WSJ reports, as the kingdom deepens efforts to diversify its economy. Investments would complement the oil titan's operations, and the company may plant a flag in Silicon Valley or elsewhere in the U.S. to generate deals. WSJ's Rory Jones & Summer Said have the exclusive.

PagerDuty joins the club: PagerDuty Inc., which oversees enterprises' digital operations, said it has closed a $90 million financing round that valued the company at $1.3 billion. T. Rowe Price led the Series D, with participation from existing investors including Accel, Andreessen Horowitz and Bessemer Venture Partners. The company, headed by CEO Jennifer Tejada, said it has raised a total of $173 million. More from WSJ Pro's Katie Roof.

Gormley's Take: Gluing Medical Data Together

By Brian Gormley

Startups are vying to be the glue that brings electronic medical record systems together.

Digitized patient-data use is widespread thanks to a 2009 law that employed financial rewards and penalties to spur adoption. Part of the vision was that electronic records would enable easy exchange of health information.

Progress has been made in getting various digital systems to communicate, but work remains to be done. Startups like Bridge Connector and Sansoro Health are working with venture capitalists to close the gaps that remain in this digital divide of the health-care sector. More in Gormley's Take.

VC Funds

Oversubscribed Oberland: Oberland Capital Management said it has raised $800 million for a new fund focused on health-care royalties and debt. The final closing of Oberland Capital Healthcare II LP came in ahead of the fund's $650 million target and is nearly double the size of Oberland's first institutional fund, which wrapped up with $425 million in 2015.

Grayscale Investments LLC, a unit of Digital Currency Group, has launched its eighth single-asset token fund, this one focused solely on ZEN, a privacy-focused token based on the Horizen platform (formerly known as ZenCash). The fund has started with $6.3 million, which was seeded by DCG. In the first six months of 2018, Grayscale overall raised close to $250 million across its funds, which also include a diversified token fund, the company said. DCG, which owns and invests in blockchain startups, is itself backed by Social Capital, RRE Ventures and others.

MissionOG, a Philadelphia-based venture firm investing in enterprise startups, has raised about $61 million toward a $100 million fund, according to a regulatory filing.

Exits

Meituan advances listing: Meituan Dianping on Friday launched its much-anticipated initial public offering, which values the online retail services firm at close to $55 billion. The company expects to list in Hong Kong on Sept. 20, it said.

Shazam deal clears hurdle: Apple Inc. received the European Union's approval Thursday to acquire Shazam Entertainment Ltd., allowing the technology giant to close one of its most prominent deals in years. Shazam's backers included Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, Institutional Venture Partners, DN Capital and Acacia Capital Partners.

New Money

GreyOrange, a Singapore-based robotics company used by Flipkart and others in supply-chain work, raised a $140 million Series C round, led by Mithril Capital in what the company called the largest industrial-robotics funding deal. Mithril's Ajay Royan will join GreyOrange's board.

MasterClass, a San Francisco-based online education service, has gathered $80 million in Series D funding. IVP led the round, and was joined by New Enterprise Associates, Javelin Ventures, Advancit Capital, Atomico and Evolution Media. Roseanne Wincek of IVP will join the company's board.

Twentyeight-Seven Therapeutics, a Cambridge, Mass.-based startup focused on modulating non-coding RNA biology to develop treatments for cancer and other diseases, has closed a $65 million Series A round. MPM Capital and Novartis Venture Fund co-led the financing, and were joined by investors including Johnson & Johnson Innovation   JJDC Inc. and Vertex Ventures HC. Carolyn Ng of Vertex, Michal Silverberg of Novartis, along with Luke Evnin and Briggs Morrison from MPM, will join the company's board.

BUYOUTS

Argonaut Private Equity, Tulsa, Okla.

Argonaut Private Equity held the first closing of its latest fund at more than $230 million. The firm didn't disclose a target amount for Argonaut Private Equity IV LP in a news release announcing the initial close. Argonaut said it expects additional commitments from several limited partners. The fund's predecessor closed at $600 million in 2016. Argonaut invests in energy-services, industrial and manufacturing businesses.

Carlyle Group LP, Washington

Carlyle Group LP collected $18.5 billion for its newest U.S. buyout fund. The final tally for Carlyle Partners VII LP exceeded the fund's $15 billion goal.

One Year After Equifax Breach: Criminal Charges, New State Laws and Lost Chances; One year after credit reporting firm Equifax Inc. announced a major data breach, security and policy experts said it has largely been a missed opportunity.

In the world of cybersecurity, a crisis can be a great motivator. But one year after credit reporting firm Equifax Inc. announced a major data breach, security and policy experts said it has largely been a missed opportunity.

There has been modest progress: A handful of states have passed tougher data breach notification laws and some corporate boards and executives have reexamined their cybersecurity budgets and potential risks. But the push for systemic changes in the way businesses handle data has faded, said Steven Weber, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Information.

"Anyone who was expecting there to be a big dramatic change is going to be disappointed," said Dr. Weber, who also serves as the faculty director for UC Berkeley's Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity.

On September 7, 2017, Equifax said hackers compromised the information of about 143 million U.S. consumers. The company, which collects and sells data on hundreds of millions of consumers and businesses worldwide, revised that number to 145.5 million in October and to 147.9 million in March 2018. The breach was particularly significant because of the type of data Equifax collects -- names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, credit card numbers, phone numbers and email addresses were involved in the breach.

The company and several of its leaders suffered consequences. Chief Executive Officer Richard Smith, Chief Information Officer David Webb and Chief Security Officer Susan Mauldin stepped down following the incident. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice filed charges against Jun Ying, a former chief information officer, and Sudhakar Reddy Bonthu, a former software development manager, for insider trading related to the data breach.

A spokeswoman for Equifax said in an email that the firm has increased its security and technology budget by more than $200 million this year and hired a new chief information security officer, Jamil Farshchi, and chief technology officer, Bryson Koehler.

"In the past year we have undertaken a host of security, operational, and technological improvements, including hardening our data security perimeter to dramatically improve detection and response rates, and strengthening our data security protocols and controls," she said in the statement.

But politicians also pushed for bigger changes in the way companies handle consumer data.

Congress called on Mr. Smith to testify about the incident and explain what went wrong. Lawmakers introduced legislation that would, among other things, establish mandatory penalties for breaches of consumer data, require compensation of consumers and create an Office of Cybersecurity that would annually inspect credit reporting firms. The bills have not passed.

"I actually think we can make a difference here &," Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) told "https://www.marketplace.org/2018/02/28/tech/sen-elizabeth-warren-equifax-may-actually-make-money-breach?mod=djemCybersecruityPro&tpl=cy" in February 2018, describing how the breach affected both Republicans and Democrats. "It is now up to the federal government to put some rules in place so this doesn't happen again."

Those efforts have largely fizzled out, cybersecurity experts said.

"Do you remember all those great hearings? I testified, and Congress critters on both sides of the aisle asked very angry questions and demanded answers, and nothing happened," said Bruce Schneier, a fellow and lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society.

States Hold Equifax Accountable

States and companies have made more changes than federal bodies.

In March, Alabama and South Dakota passed data breach notification laws, becoming the last two states to do so. Under South Dakota's law, companies must notify consumers of a breach within 60 days of discovering one or face fines of up to $10,000 per day per violation. Alabama's bill has a 45 day notification requirement, and allows for fines of up to $5,000 per day.

Other states, including Arizona, Colorado, Louisiana and Oregon, have amended their laws to include provisions about credit freezes, expand the definition of personal information and shorten the time to notify victims.

"In the absence of federal legislation and federal initiative, states are becoming the incubators for these laws," said David Stauss, a partner at the law firm Ballard Spahr LLP.

State regulators have also been eager to hold Equifax accountable for the breach.

Massachusetts' attorney general "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-says-data-breach-possibly-affected-100-000-canadian-consumers-1505834728?mod=djemCybersecruityPro&tpl=cy" for allegedly violating the state's consumer protection and data privacy laws, and several other state attorneys general pushed the company to explain why it took so long to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/states-push-equifax-to-explain-why-it-took-6-weeks-to-disclose-hack-1509196933?mod=djemCybersecruityPro&tpl=cy".

In June, eight state regulators, including those from Texas, California and New York, issued a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/equifax-ordered-by-eight-states-to-beef-up-cybersecurity-1530131194?mod=djemCIO_h&mod=djemCybersecruityPro&tpl=cy&mod=djemCybersecruityPro&tpl=cy" requiring Equifax to strengthen its cybersecurity defenses and create an annual internal audit program.

The company also faces hundreds of ongoing lawsuits filed by consumers, small businesses, financial institutions and cities.

Trying to Avoid the Same Fate

Corporate boards and executives have reexamined how they handle cybersecurity, hoping that they won't become the next Equifax.

Doug Clare, vice president of cybersecurity at the data analytics and credit scoring company Fair Isaac Corp., commonly referred to as FICO, said there was a "mad dash" to make sure the organization didn't have the same Apache Struts software vulnerability that led to Equifax's breach.

"There was definitely a big scramble & people wanted to make sure they understood their whole network," he said.

Less than a week after the Equifax breach was announced, credit reporting firm TransUnion Corp.'s chief financial officer said at a financial industry conference that the firm uses some of the same software as Equifax, and "made certain that all of the versions of this software are up-to-date with the current patches," The Wall Street Journal "https://www.wsj.com/articles/transunion-ramps-up-response-to-handle-equifax-data-breach-fallout-1505245009?mod=djemCybersecruityPro&tpl=cy".

Corporate boards have also eyed more long-term changes, said Dr. Weber, who advises several boards in the financial and insurance industries.

The Securities and Exchange Commission in February issued updated guidance asking companies for more detailed descriptions of how boards oversee cyber risk. The agency said it expects companies to disclose details such as how they determine the severity of incidents and how senior executives and directors communicate about cybersecurity.

"Cybersecurity has risen to the top of the board's agenda," said Dr. Weber, adding that many of his clients have increased the time they spend with CISOs and have inquired whether they're spending their budget on the right tools.

At Express Scripts Holding Co., a large shareholder -- the New York State Common Retirement Fund -- proposed shortly after the Equifax breach that the pharmacy benefits company reveal more information about how it manages cyber risk.

Express Scripts tried to prevent the proposal from going to shareholders but was overruled by the SEC. The proposal failed in a shareholder vote.

Equifax itself has also made a number of notable changes in the way it handles cybersecurity. Mr. Farshchi, the company's new CISO, told WSJ Pro Cybersecurity in April that he planned to create a so-called "https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-equifax-ciso-integrations-physical-and-cyber-security-in-post-breach-overhaul-1524774047?mod=djemCybersecruityPro&tpl=cy" with 30 to 40 employees to improve breach response times.

Mr. Clare at Fair Isaac says there are also signs that the Equifax incident prompted companies to pay more attention to the third parties with whom they work.

Equifax supplies financial and personal data, credit scoring and services to a large number of other companies, he noted. "One good thing that's come out of it is that organizations are paying more attention to their supply chain security," he said, adding that FICO has seen an uptick in financial and health care firms subscribing to its third-party risk assessment tools.

"Before Equifax, this was a nascent space," said Mr. Clare. "Equifax opened a lot of people's eyes."

One Year After Equifax Breach: Criminal Charges, New State Laws and Lost Chances

By Adam Janofsky

In the world of cybersecurity, a crisis can be a great motivator. But one year after credit reporting firm Equifax Inc. announced a major data breach, security and policy experts said it has largely been a missed opportunity.

There has been modest progress: A handful of states have passed tougher data breach notification laws and some corporate boards and executives have reexamined their cybersecurity budgets and potential risks. But the push for systemic changes in the way businesses handle data has faded, said Steven Weber, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Information.

"Anyone who was expecting there to be a big dramatic change is going to be disappointed," said Dr. Weber, who also serves as the faculty director for UC Berkeley's Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity.

On September 7, 2017, Equifax said hackers compromised the information of about 143 million U.S. consumers. The company, which collects and sells data on hundreds of millions of consumers and businesses worldwide, revised that number to 145.5 million in October and to 147.9 million in March 2018. The breach was particularly significant because of the type of data Equifax collects -- names, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, credit card numbers, phone numbers and email addresses were involved in the breach.

The company and several of its leaders suffered consequences. Chief Executive Officer Richard Smith, Chief Information Officer David Webb and Chief Security Officer Susan Mauldin stepped down following the incident. Additionally, the U.S. Department of Justice filed charges against Jun Ying, a former chief information officer, and Sudhakar Reddy Bonthu, a former software development manager, for insider trading related to the data breach.

A spokeswoman for Equifax said in an email that the firm has increased its security and technology budget by more than $200 million this year and hired a new chief information security officer, Jamil Farshchi, and chief technology officer, Bryson Koehler.

"In the past year we have undertaken a host of security, operational, and technological improvements, including hardening our data security perimeter to dramatically improve detection and response rates, and strengthening our data security protocols and controls," she said in the statement.

But politicians also pushed for bigger changes in the way companies handle consumer data.

Congress called on Mr. Smith to testify about the incident and explain what went wrong. Lawmakers introduced legislation that would, among other things, establish mandatory penalties for breaches of consumer data, require compensation of consumers and create an Office of Cybersecurity that would annually inspect credit reporting firms. The bills have not passed.

"I actually think we can make a difference here &," Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) told Marketplace in February 2018, describing how the breach affected both Republicans and Democrats. "It is now up to the federal government to put some rules in place so this doesn't happen again."

Those efforts have largely fizzled out, cybersecurity experts said.

"Do you remember all those great hearings? I testified, and Congress critters on both sides of the aisle asked very angry questions and demanded answers, and nothing happened," said Bruce Schneier, a fellow and lecturer at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society.

States Hold Equifax Accountable

States and companies have made more changes than federal bodies.

In March, Alabama and South Dakota passed data breach notification laws, becoming the last two states to do so. Under South Dakota's law, companies must notify consumers of a breach within 60 days of discovering one or face fines of up to $10,000 per day per violation. Alabama's bill has a 45 day notification requirement, and allows for fines of up to $5,000 per day.

Other states, including Arizona, Colorado, Louisiana and Oregon, have amended their laws to include provisions about credit freezes, expand the definition of personal information and shorten the time to notify victims.

"In the absence of federal legislation and federal initiative, states are becoming the incubators for these laws," said David Stauss, a partner at the law firm Ballard Spahr LLP.

State regulators have also been eager to hold Equifax accountable for the breach.

Massachusetts' attorney general sued Equifax for allegedly violating the state's consumer protection and data privacy laws, and several other state attorneys general pushed the company to explain why it took so long to report the breach.

In June, eight state regulators, including those from Texas, California and New York, issued a consent order requiring Equifax to strengthen its cybersecurity defenses and create an annual internal audit program.

The company also faces hundreds of ongoing lawsuits filed by consumers, small businesses, financial institutions and cities.

Trying to Avoid the Same Fate

Corporate boards and executives have reexamined how they handle cybersecurity, hoping that they won't become the next Equifax.

Doug Clare, vice president of cybersecurity at the data analytics and credit scoring company Fair Isaac Corp., commonly referred to as FICO, said there was a "mad dash" to make sure the organization didn't have the same Apache Struts software vulnerability that led to Equifax's breach.

"There was definitely a big scramble & people wanted to make sure they understood their whole network," he said.

Less than a week after the Equifax breach was announced, credit reporting firm TransUnion Corp.'s chief financial officer said at a financial industry conference that the firm uses some of the same software as Equifax, and "made certain that all of the versions of this software are up-to-date with the current patches," The Wall Street Journal reported.

Corporate boards have also eyed more long-term changes, said Dr. Weber, who advises several boards in the financial and insurance industries.

The Securities and Exchange Commission in February issued updated guidance asking companies for more detailed descriptions of how boards oversee cyber risk. The agency said it expects companies to disclose details such as how they determine the severity of incidents and how senior executives and directors communicate about cybersecurity.

"Cybersecurity has risen to the top of the board's agenda," said Dr. Weber, adding that many of his clients have increased the time they spend with CISOs and have inquired whether they're spending their budget on the right tools.

At Express Scripts Holding Co., a large shareholder -- the New York State Common Retirement Fund -- proposed shortly after the Equifax breach that the pharmacy benefits company reveal more information about how it manages cyber risk.

Express Scripts tried to prevent the proposal from going to shareholders but was overruled by the SEC. The proposal failed in a shareholder vote.

Equifax itself has also made a number of notable changes in the way it handles cybersecurity. Mr. Farshchi, the company's new CISO, told WSJ Pro Cybersecurity in April that he planned to create a so-called fusion center with 30 to 40 employees to improve breach response times. He also plans to bolster the roles of business information security officers throughout the firm, who will help promote security in day-to-day operations.

Mr. Clare at Fair Isaac says there are also signs that the Equifax incident prompted companies to pay more attention to the third parties with whom they work.

Equifax supplies financial and personal data, credit scoring and services to a large number of other companies, he noted. "One good thing that's come out of it is that organizations are paying more attention to their supply chain security," he said, adding that FICO has seen an uptick in financial and health care firms subscribing to its third-party risk assessment tools.

Federal CISO Calls For More Cyber-Savvy C-Suites

By Catherine Stupp

WASHINGTON -- Educating corporate leaders will be a crucial component of the federal government's new "cybersecurity moonshot" program, a Trump administration initiative that aims to raise awareness and coordinate a nationwide response to cyber challenges.

"It's about making sure that people at the C-Suite understand what cybersecurity is really about and have the level of sophistication," Grant Schneider, the federal chief information security officer, said during a panel discussion at the Billington Cybersecurity Summit here Thursday.

"If our CEOs can only go to our CIOs or CISOs and say,  are we secure yet?', either the CISO is going to say,  no' and get fired right then, or they're going to say  yes' and get fired whenever an incident happens," Mr. Schneider said.

"We need a far more sophisticated conversation where our leadership at the C-Suite are asking questions about what steps we are taking and what is our level of insecurity," he added.

Mr. Schneider was named federal government CISO in July and also serves as senior director for cybersecurity on the National Security Council. He was the federal government's acting CISO before his appointment this summer.

Cybersecurity as a Selling Point

The federal government announced its cybersecurity moonshot program in February and tasked the president's advisory group, known as the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee, to identify a "whole-of-nation" cybersecurity strategy to include steps related to education as well as better cooperation between industry and government. The group of 19 executives from telecoms and technology companies is expected to present its strategy to the president in November.

A growing number of companies now sees cybersecurity as a business opportunity, Mr. Schneider said. "We're starting to see technology companies who aren't necessarily cybersecurity companies tout their security level."

Gregory Touhill, who preceded Mr. Schneider as federal CISO, said the moonshot program needs to spell out a role for industry cooperation.

"We had the race to the moon, we had the mission statement that the president [Kennedy] put out where the goal was to take a person to the moon and return them safely. We had a discrete objective. What's our objective here with the cyber moonshot?" Mr. Touhill said in an interview with WSJ Pro Cybersecurity. He left the government CISO position last year.

Companies Can Lead the Way to Better Security

"The government doesn't manufacture anything except for policies and laws, so industry is going to have to manufacture the capabilities that lead to a successful cyber moonshot," he added.

The program should outline better developed cybersecurity education programs and prioritize cooperation with like-minded nations to hold other countries accountable if they sponsor cyber attacks, said Mr. Schneider and Jeanette Manfra, the assistant secretary for cybersecurity and communications at the Department of Homeland Security, speaking on the conference panel.

"If we're still hoping and praying users will just stop clicking on links as our solution, then I think we've failed," Ms. Manfra said. Corporations and government officials should have a more advanced understanding of cybersecurity within the next 10 years, she said.

Both Mr. Schneider and Ms. Manfra acknowledged that the moonshot analogy, which refers to the U.S. government's drive to develop space exploration in the 1960s, isn't directly comparable to the more incremental cybersecurity goals that corporations and government agencies must set to protect against growing cyber threats.

"There isn't going to be an instant where we say we've achieved success in cybersecurity. We're not blasting anyone into cyberspace. It's a different set of challenges," Mr. Schneider said.

U.S. Indicts Suspected North Korean Hacker for Sony, Other Attacks

The U.S. unveiled charges Thursday against a North Korean operative in connection with a series of cyber attacks, including the 2014 Sony Pictures hack and a global ransomware attack that infected hundreds of thousands of computers last year, the Journal's Aruna Viswanatha and Dustin Volz report.

A hand in many crimes. The U.S. Department of Justice accused Park Jin Hyok of committing a series of cybercrimes at the North Korean government's direction between 2014 through this year. Along with his alleged role in the Sony breach, Mr. Park allegedly was involved in last year's WannaCry ransomware attack, which infected more than 300,000 computers in more than 150 countries. Prosecutors say Mr. Park also played a part in 2016 theft of $81 million from Bangladesh's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the largest ever cybertheft from a financial institution.

Details about Pyongyang's hacker army. Roughly 7,000 hackers and support staffers work at the direction of the North Korean government, the Journal reports. Mr. Park had been living in China and working for Chosun Expo, a North Korean front company affiliated with a government hacking organization, according to WSJ. The Justice Department gathered evidence against Mr. Park by executing about 100 search warrants to access more than 1,000 email and social media accounts.

U.S. approach remains constant. The Justice Department previously has identified by name suspected hackers from China, Russia and Iran. Most of those defendants remain overseas but officials have said the so-called name-and-shame strategy is meant to expose hackers and discourage future attacks. The Department of Treasury also enacted financial sanctions on Mr. Park and Chosun Expo as punishment for their alleged cyber activities.

********************************

More Cyber News

Botnet relies on Latvian routers. Cybersecurity researchers from the Chinese firm Netlab 360 have determined that hackers have compromised thousands of internet routers manufactured by the Latvian company MikroTik, Ars Technica reported. The attack exploits a vulnerability in the routers revealed when WikiLeaks published a trove of Central Intelligence Agency hacking tools. MikroTik in April released a patch for the problem but Netlab 360 said 370,000 connected devices still are vulnerable, according to Ars Technica.

Cybersecurity bills move forward. The U.S. House of Representatives passed two bills this week that would give the Department of Homeland Security more cybersecurity authority, CyberScoop reported. The Securing the Homeland Security Supply Chain Act of 2018 would authorize the DHS secretary to stop from contracting with DHS technology vendors that could pose a risk, according to CyberScoop. Another bill would codify into law the DHS' existing Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation program, which governs how the department detects security threats on federal networks, according to CyberScoop.

Browser extension compromised. The file-sharing site Mega.nz is warning that hackers took control of its browser extension for Alphabet Inc.'s Google Chrome and directed usernames and passwords to a server in Ukraine, according to KrebsOnSecurity. The breach occurred after cybercriminals hacked someone with legitimate rights to alter the extension code, KrebsOnSecurity reported.

A hack targets U.K. festival. A hacker accessed the badges of attendees of Electromagnetic Field, a U.K. technology festival held from Aug. 31 through Sept. 2 for researchers and scientists, Vice Motherboard reported. The electronic badges, which could also function as smartphones, were tricked into revealing device information through a so-called international mobile subscriber identity-catcher, Vice Motherboard reported. The tool mimics signals put out by cell phone towers.

Can Private Equity Hedge Its Bets With Asia Deals?

Many private-equity investors cite the heightened risks associated with investing in Asia as reason to avoid the region. But when it comes to margin improvement, Asia offers more opportunities than many firms acknowledge, according to one data provider.

A recent analysis of global private equity-backed deals by analytics company Cepres GmbH found that revenue growth and margin improvement yielded more value on a percentage basis among private-equity deals in Asia than they did with deals in the U.S. and Europe.

Daniel Schmidt, chief executive of Cepres, said there is a greater supply of undermanaged companies in Asia that could benefit financially from private-equity investment. In contrast, many companies in the U.S. and Europe have been sponsor-backed and, thus, already have realized initial growth and cost savings. He added Asian companies tend to be less heavily levered than their U.S. and European peers, which could help them better withstand an economic downturn.

Plenty of private-equity firms see opportunities to capitalize on these dynamics.

Funds focused on emerging Asian countries drove much of the growth among emerging markets fundraising during the first half of the year, according to data from the Emerging Markets Private Equity Association. Funds focused on the region collected $28 billion through June 30, up from $22 billion during the first half of 2017, Empea data show. Excluding emerging Asia, however, overall emerging markets fundraising declined to $3.7 billion during the first half from $7 billion in the year-earlier period, according to Empea.

Despite the opportunities, Asia isn't the easiest market for Western private-equity firms to invest in. Every region has its own culture, language and other barriers these firms face. Currency volatility also presents challenges for firms with dollar- or euro-denominated funds.

But for firms that can successfully manage these challenges, the growth profile of Asian companies could one day offer a hedge against uncertain economic times.

China's state investors face higher barriers to US tech

Critics say new powers to block deals on security grounds will hinder sector

It took Massachusetts-based Nantero nearly two decades to bring its carbon nanotube memory chips to the market. And when it did, Chinese state investors were quick to grab a small slice of the start-up.

In a $30m funding round in April, the privately held company took in capital from China's largest semiconductor maker, SMIC, and the China Integrated Circuit Fund, a $15bn state investor tasked with helping China's chip industry outpace the US over the next decade. The investment in Nantero was part of a record flow of Chinese venture capital into US technology, an important source of funding for the sector this year.

But national security researchers fear such deals also are being used by staterun Chinese companies to gain access to some of the world's most valuable earlystage technologies   a linchpin issue in the escalating trade and technology war between the US and China.

The Foreign Investment Risk Review Modernisation Act, which took effect in August, pushes back against that perceived threat by empowering the US government to scrutinise and block even small minority foreign investments into sensitive technologies. "The government is concerned that the minority stakes are a backdoor to the technology," said Aaron Cutler, a partner at law firm Hogan Lovells in Washington and a former senior staffer at the US House of Representatives.

The changes reflect a vast expansion in powers of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, the body responsible for reviewing inbound investments for national security threats. Critics have said the changes will curb the healthy flow of capital into the US tech sector.

In the past, Cfius reviewed only inbound acquisitions in which control of companies changed hands. The new rules give it authority to screen any deal involving "critical technologies", such as biotech, artificial intelligence and semiconductors.

In doing so, the definition of national security has been broadened to cover the US's greater interests in remaining competitive in these fields against rivals such as China, which is seeking to supplant America as a world leader in many high-tech areas by 2025.

Lawmakers are concerned that small venture investments might open a window through which Chinese companies can acquire valuable technologies, through board appointments, contact with management and other privileges commonly awarded to investors.

"Even without access to any proprietary [intellectual property], Chinese venture investors can use this leverage to promote technology transfer, for example, by encouraging a start-up to establish a subsidiary or joint venture in China where knowhow is likely to diffuse to Chinese employees and partners," said Adam Lysenko, a senior analyst at research house Rhodium Group. Greg Schmergel, Nantero's cofounder and chief executive, said the Chinese infusion was "a no-stringsattached financial investment that does not grant any access to IP or technology".

The deal is one of hundreds of similar transactions in recent years. Chinese venture capital investment in the US between January and May this year hit $2.4bn and is on track to double the record set last year, according to Rhodium Group. State-backed venture capital investment, while still just a quarter of total investment, is also on track to double.

The new regulations are not expected to be retroactive and the Nantero deal has closed, but it is an example of what an emboldened Cfius will be hunting for.

Nantero's fundraising caught the attention of national security researchers largely because the groups the company now counts as investors are those seeking to beat the US on semiconductor technologies over the coming decade.

When Nantero set up a wholly owned foreign company in China in September last year, it chose a sprawling complex that is home to many of the country's top semiconductor start-ups. That development area is a project of Beijing E-Town, a state-run company that has invested heavily in semiconductor assets around the world.

Notably, in its corporate registration in China, Nantero stated that the scope of its business includes "technology transfer"   a primary target of the new Cfius legislation. Nantero said this was a boilerplate phrase added to the registration document.

Months after the China office was established, investors connected to E-Town joined Nantero's fundraising, just as the company's technology was going commercial following 18 years of development.

Those Chinese investors were Shanghai-based China Fortune-Tech Capital and the $15bn China Integrated Circuit Fund.

Fortune-Tech is controlled by flagship state-owned semiconductor maker SMIC, while the IC fund is controlled by China's Ministry of Industry and IT.

Both are connected to E-Town through investments and are part of a state strategy to wean China off reliance on foreign-made chips.

SMIC, E-Town and the $15bn semiconductor fund have not been accused of any wrongdoing. None of the three responded to requests for comment on the matter.

Some experts say the new US law is unnecessary. "Start-ups have strong incentives to protect their technology, even to the point of denying it to their venture capital investors," said John Reynolds, a partner specialising in economic sanctions and national security at law firm Davis Polk.

But regardless of the intentions of Chinese investors, future ventures are expected to face much higher barriers in the US.

"Essentially, an investment will be deemed to be passive only if the investor can prove that it does not result in any exploitable privileged access," said Shawn Cooley, an antitrust lawyer at Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer and a former director at the US Department of Homeland Security.

Deals that once connected state investors such as SMIC to top US tech such as Nantero are expected to become a thing of the past.

Corrections & Amplifications

FTV Capital's investment in Strata Fund Solutions LLC is the firm's ninth deal from FTV V LP. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the investment was the firm's fifth deal from the fund.

FTV Capital has struck its latest investment in a place that's close to home for many private investors.

The growth-equity firm backed Strata Fund Solutions LLC, a fund administrator for alternative asset managers and organizations such as endowments and foundations.

Private-markets adviser StepStone Group also backed Strata as part of the deal.

The investment has provided Strata with its first outside institutional capital, said Jared Broadbent, a co-founder and managing partner of the company.

Brad Bernstein, a managing partner at FTV, said several tailwinds are driving the firm to invest in providers of fund-administration services.

"We saw growth in the market and an inflow of assets and capital toward these managers," said Mr. Bernstein. "There is also incremental demand from greater compliance requirements."

The increasing size of the alternative asset industry may also be a driving factor. There were $8.42 trillion of alternative fund assets under administration globally as of the end of 2017, according to a survey published by analytics firm eVestment, compared with $7.64 trillion recorded in the previous year's survey.

The deal is FTV's ninth investment from FTV V LP, an $850 million fund that closed in 2016.

The deal isn't FTV's first investment in a provider of fund administration technology and services. The firm, which has offices in New York and San Francisco, exited Apex Fund Services last year through a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/genstar-recapitalizing-fund-administrator-apex-buying-equinoxe-1494346920?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=2" by Genstar Capital, after a roughly six-year investment period. It also made a minority equity investment last year in "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftv-backs-financial-software-maker-1484049602?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1", a maker of financial software for hedge funds and traditional asset managers.

FTV recently "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftv-capital-invests-54-5-million-in-a-lign-1531772214?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1" a $54.5 million growth-equity investment in A-Lign, which provides cybersecurity and compliance services. The firm also this year has backed companies that include "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sunlight-financial-secures-50-million-from-ftv-capital-1528314625?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=2", which offers residential-solar financing; and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ftv-capital-invests-35-million-in-tango-card-1526986800?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1", a provider of digital gift cards and other rewards for business incentive programs.

Metro Money: Wanted: Workers With Autism

By Anne Kadet

Alexis Prendergast, a 25-year-old Brooklyn woman who has autism spectrum disorder, is the first to admit there are skills she hasn't mastered. "Mostly it's social stuff. I miss some cues," she says. Her wiring also lends unusual strengths, like an ability to focus for long stretches on tasks requiring great attention to detail. Happily, she found an employer looking for someone just like her.

Daivergent, a Manhattan tech startup, provides autistic contractors to clients seeking high accuracy and speed on tasks including data entry and online research. Most people find these jobs tedious and tiring; they get sloppy after an hour, says co-founder and chief executive officer Byran Dai. But Daivergent's autistic workers "can do it for the day, can do it for the week, can do it month after month," he says.

Mr. Dai, who launched his company in February with $50,000 in savings and $100,000 in funding from the Entrepreneurs Roundtable Accelerator, manages a team of four autistic employees at his headquarters and a pool of some 200 contractors around the country who work from home.

In a project Mr. Dai describes as typical, workers digitally labeled items such as doors and windows in blueprints for a company making construction cost-estimate software. The tagged images are used to train an artificial-intelligence system to recognize such objects on its own.

Daivergent's remote workers are paid by the project. They might earn a set amount for tagging a certain number of images, for example. Pay typically works out to $12 to $20 an hour, Mr. Dai says. Employees and contractors can choose their own schedules, and most work between five and 30 hours a week. Daivergent offers no benefits but plans to do so in the future.

For Mr. Dai, who is 28 and grew up in New York City before studying data science and epidemiology at Harvard University and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, the motivation to start Daivergent was personal. His 19-year-old brother, Brandon, is on the autism spectrum. Four years ago, before their mother died of cancer-related complications, she asked Mr. Dai to look after him.

People on the spectrum often struggle with job interviews and navigating the social aspects of work. An estimated 50% to 75% of people on the autism spectrum experience long-term periods of unemployment. "I want him to have a meaningful life," Mr. Dai says of his brother.

Autistic workers can face other challenges in the workforce once employed. Many people with autism think very literally and may struggle with ambiguity. So Mr. Dai developed his own digital work platform to accommodate Daivergent's workers. It breaks projects into small chunks so workers can easily track their own progress, and the system relies heavily on video instruction.

Employees such as Leon Campbell, a Bronx 23-year-old who recently graduated from Hunter College, say they appreciate this structure. "I was afraid my first job would be overwhelming and give me more stress than even school did," he says. "But this is simpler."

Mr. Dai consulted with employment-services experts at the Arc New York, an advocacy group, while developing the work platform. To refine it further, Daivergent is also consulting with a licensed clinical social worker specializing in young adults on the autism spectrum.

Because the spectrum includes such a range of conditions, Mr. Dai says he doesn't require any specific diagnosis to hire. He typically recruits from organizations that provide support services to people on the spectrum.

Some small outfits already employ workers on the spectrum for remote work, says Dave Kearon, director of adult services for advocacy organization Autism Speaks, but Daivergent stands out for the training it provides. "He's offering not just technical skills but social and communication skills-training."

The Points Guy, a website for consumers aiming to maximize their travel rewards, retained Daivergent to help build the database behind its new app. "It's super complicated, and it's tedious work," says director of product management Alon Hartuv. "But they provided the goods."

Funding Circle s IPO, LendInvest 150m boost, Wonga s woes

A clutch of hopeful start-ups lined up this weekto pitch to one of the toughest audiences around   insurance underwriters and brokers.

The twenty companies were aiming to get intoLloyd s Lab, the latest stab at innovation from Lloyd s of London, the 330-year old insurance market.

After the pitches, the insurers and brokers voted on which ones will get into the Lab, a ten week project during which the start-ups will have the chance to work with people at Lloyd s to develop new products and services.

There might even be some investment at the end of it from either Lloyd s itself or the companies that operate there.

Inga Beale, chief executive of Lloyd s, said:  The essence is not for Lloyd s corporation to end up owning these businesses. We may invest or the [insurers] may invest 	. 	. 	. 	 about access to the market and access to the expertise. 

The 10successful start-ups includedLayr, an artificial intelligence insurance buying platform;CargoSnap, a mobile transportation inspection app;DropIn, a video inspection platform;Insurercore, a digital-based risk appetite directory;BelMead Tech, a blockchain-based claims support platform;Parsyl, a claims system that uses data and predictive analytics;Geollect, creators of proprietary intelligence software for businesses;ZASTI, an AI technology platform;Qnity, a digital design-your own insurance service;iCede, a cloud-based platform for insurers to arrange cross-border cover.

The Lab has been in the works since November last year, and has been developed by Lloyd s along with Boston Consulting Group and L Marks, which specialises in connecting start-ups to established companies.

It has been given a chunk of space on the fourth floor of Lloyd s Richard Rogers-designed London HQ. That s now been turned into a WeWork-esque office, where the underwriters and start-ups can learn to speak each others  languages over a strong cup of coffee.

There will be a lot to learn. The insurers and brokers working at Lloyd s of London do not have a great reputation when it comes to enthusiastically adopting new technology. A marketwide effort to automate some of the existing paper based processes initially met with stiff resistance, and only really took off when Lloyd s decided to force insurers to use the new system.

Ms Beale thinks that the Lab will enthuse the market.  This isn t about removing jobs, it s about changing jobs,  she said.  People will be able to pop in [to the lab] and the idea is that you get people excited. 

The start-ups see plenty of potential at Lloyd s, which insurers everything from ships and buildings to cyber risks and sports events. The early years of insurtech tended to focus on consumer insurance, but lately commercial and specialist cover has attracted interest from innovators and VCs. The Lab had 200 applications from 36 countries.

One of those that gained access to the Lab isDropIn, a Los Angeles-based venture which uses video technology to enable insurers to see the properties they are insuring without having to physically send their own people there.

Gilad Shai, a DropIn advisory board member, says that he hopes the Lab will enable his company to take its offering  to the next level  by working with several companies who insure the same properties.  It is all about developing a service that will meet the needs of Lloyd s,  he said.

Lloyd s sees the Lab as a long-term commitment. After the first 10-week project there will be three more, giving a much wider range of start-ups access to Lloyd s underwriters and brokers.

Ms Beale hopes that the Lab will be able to give some sort of coherence to the innovation efforts being made by the various underwriters and brokers at Lloyd s.  The challenge is to piece it all together so that the market doesn t become chaotic,  she said.

Further fintech fascination

Funding Circle s IPO.Funding Circle is not one to be put off by events outside its control. The peer to peer lender has announced plans to raise 300m in an IPO which could value the company at 1.5bn. Bears will have plenty to say   shares in US listed peers Lending Club and OnDeck have fallen since their IPOs and UK regulators are proposing to make it more difficult for many retail investorsto invest in peer to peer loans. But Anders Povlsen, a businessman and investor, has agreed to back the IPO and valuations of European fintech companies have been rising.

Brick by brickNomura, the Japanese bank, and Magnetar, the US fixed income investor, have committed to invest 150m throughLendInvest, the British peer-to-peer lender to property developers. The duo join a number of existing institutional investors in the platform, including Citigroup and the Merseyside Pension Fund and take the total capital available for loans to about 1bn. Since its launch five years ago, LendInvest has funded more than 1.5bn of loans for small-scale property development projects across the UK.

South Korean start-ups.Fintechs in South Korea should start sharpening their pitching skills. The government has announced that it is to start investing a $9bn fund designed to boost start-ups in areas including fintech, artificial intelligence and drone technology. South Korea s Financial Services Commission and the Ministry of SMEs and Startups will give out $2.8bn this year and $3.3bn in each of the next two years.

Wonga s woes.Payday lender Wonga used technology to push a well-worn business model   high interest loans to people who might struggle to get credit elsewhere. The tech was not enough to save it from an old fashioned collapse though. The company called in the administrators late last week after a surge in compensation claims from disgruntled customers.

Fintech views in the FT Banking podcast

Bits and bobs

Zurich calling.Lloyd s of London is not the only insurance organisation trying to attract start-ups. Last week Zurich launched an  Innovation World Championship  in which start-ups will compete against each other for the right to offer their services to Zurich s customers. The Swiss group is looking for companies with established businesses in areas such as mobility, smart homes and buildings, and financial planning.

Robo-advice reversal.As one Swiss company looks to advance in technology-enabled financial planning, another is beating a retreat. UBS said that week that it was closing its UK robo-advice service less than two years after launch, having concluded that the near term potential of the scheme was limited. Unlike some rival services, UBS s SmartWealth offered a mix of passive and active investment funds, which pushed its costs up.

Singapore/Dubai tie-up.The Monetary Authority of Singapore and the Dubai Financial Services Authority have signed an agreement that allows them to refer fintech companies to each other and share information about financial innovation,reports The Straits Times. They will also work on joint projects in areas such as digital payments, blockchain and big data.

Wealth Management (A Special Report): --- Year-by-Year College Education in Credit Scores: How students can use their four years at school to build a good credit rating -- and to put themselves in a better position postgraduation

Establishing a credit history and building a good credit score can be a bit of a Catch-22 for young adults.

Take two of my daughters. Just as one was wrapping up her freshman year of college, she applied for a credit card and was denied because she has student loans (even though no payments are due until after she graduates). Her older sister, who was about to graduate without any student loans, was denied because she had no credit record at all.

It used to be that card applications were thrust into the hands of college students during freshman orientation. But it became harder for young adults to get a card following passage of the Credit CARD Act of 2009, which requires those under age 21 to have a cosigner or proof of independent income.

So what is a young adult to do? Here are some steps to consider, year by year, to help students begin building a strong credit profile.

Freshman Year

Parents can start by adding their college freshman as an authorized user on one of their credit cards -- but should do so only if they have good credit scores themselves, says Nancy Bistritz-Balkan, vice president of consumer education and advocacy at credit-reporting firm Equifax Inc. If they don't, it could hurt the student right out of the gate. A good parental score is in the high 600s or above, says Ethan Dornhelm, vice president of scores and analytics at FICO, which created the credit-scoring model most lenders see.

Another good early option is a secured credit card, says Bruce McClary, vice president of communications at the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, a nonprofit in Washington, D.C. No credit check is required since the card is funded by depositing cash. The consumer essentially spends his or her own money and replenishes it each month by paying the bill.

At age 18, students can begin requesting free credit reports each year from the big three credit-reporting companies, Experian PLC, TransUnion and Equifax via annualcreditreport.com. This allows them to check for fraudulent activity and begin to understand how their profile is built. The reports won't include a FICO score, however. Students may be able to get that free through their bank or by using Discover Credit Scorecard, an online tool. Free scores also are available through financial apps such as Mint and Credit Karma, but they use a model known as VantageScore 3.0, which can vary from the FICO score.

Sophomore Year

Some students have a car by now, subsidized by parents. Parents may be making the car payments, while the child covers gas and insurance costs. One way to help the student start building a credit history is to flip that arrangement: Have the student cosign the auto loan and make the payments, while the parents cover insurance and other costs. One caveat: The debt associated with that loan could hurt a child on future credit applications.

Experts say paying utility, cellphone and subscription bills on time, as well as responsible debit-card use, won't bolster a student's credit history. But students who live off campus and make reliable monthly rent payments can use services such as Rental Kharma or ClearNow to have those payments reported to credit bureaus, says Jeff Richardson, vice president of marketing for VantageScore Solutions. Many of these services require landlords to be registered and charge monthly fees.

For the first solo, unsecured credit application, a gas or retail credit card is a good way to go, says Mrs. Bistritz-Balkan. The amounts approved are often low, so even a part-time job can provide enough income to qualify. Use it regularly but never let your balance grow to more than 30% of the available credit line. And pay it off in full each month.

Junior Year

If they can swing it, students may want to begin making small payments on student debt -- even if they anticipate taking out more loans for the final two years of college. The lender will report payments to credit agencies, even for amounts much smaller than the full payments due after graduation. If students make the payments with an automatic debit plan, they may qualify for a small interest-rate reduction. Students should first research whether there are drawbacks to making payments before the loan is due, as might be the case for those entering fields that include loan-forgiveness plans.

In the case of my younger child, while her student loans initially led to a denial, she was ultimately able to be approved for a student credit card (with a $500 limit) because when she appealed she was able to demonstrate that her remaining college fund was worth more than the loans that had sunk her. So students may want to apply for credit before the full four years of student loans have been issued, and while college savings can still be leveraged.

Students who have had a secured credit card for a year or two with a perfect payment history should be able to graduate to an unsecured one now. They should compare deals from various card issuers, including their current lender.

Senior Year

Students who still don't have a credit card of any kind should consider applying for a student card before graduation. These have relatively low credit lines, but less stringent underwriting so they aren't as dependent on income.

Those who have had a student card for a while with a stellar record should ask their lender for more favorable terms, such as lower rates and lower -- or no -- annual fees.

"If you've have several years of no missed payments and your balances are relatively low, then there's no reason your FICO score wouldn't be in the high 600s or above. . .a pretty solid score that could qualify you for mainstream credit," says Mr. Dornhelm.

The robots are retreating but will have their revenge

Ted Dimon still turned up for work at JPMorgan in Manhattan until shortly before he died two years ago at 85.

Starting in 1953, Mr Dimon had worked as a broker at a variety of leading Wall Street institutions, managing investment portfolios. That longevity is impressive in any career, particularly one whose success is influenced heavily by moody markets. It was also accomplished despite technological change.

Throughout his life Mr Dimon dealt with a raft of new electronic tools. They did not "disrupt" him. He chose which to adopt and which to ignore. He used a computer, for example, but insisted it displayed an old-style ticker tape.

Towards the end of his career came the rise of digital platforms, including "robo-advisers" that cut out humans like Mr Dimon in favour of algorithms. It is unlikely he was too troubled.

The robo-advisers accumulated more hype than assets. The largest, Betterment, announced last year that it had surpassed $10bn of assets under management, which sounds impressive until you recall that Bank of America's wealth arm is 300 times bigger.

This week came a sign of robot retreat: UBS said it was scrapping an electronic-investment platform. That should be no surprise. As another elder statesman of finance, Paul Volcker, likes to say, the last useful innovation in the sector was the cash machine.

Yet, as The Terminator teaches us, the rise of machines can be insidious. One day you are tinkering with artificial intelligence; the next you are in a fight to the death with shape-shifting genocidal androids.

One factor obscuring the upheaval is monetary policy. Goldman Sachs dived into consumer banking two years ago, with a sleek online product, "Marcus", that outshines the established banks and is about to launch in the UK. Crucially, it offers much higher rates on current accounts: 1.85 per cent in the US compared with a paltry 0.01 per cent at Bank of America.

After inflation, though, customers are still making a slightly negative return on their cash and Goldman is not vacuuming as many deposits as it otherwise might. As policymakers continue to hike rates, that will change. More people will shop around for a low-cost solution paying real returns and the suction should be significant.

Generational change will also play a role. A few years ago one bank chief executive, with a big wealth management business, told me that he was not worried what young people wanted: they didn't have any money.

Yet the oldest millennials are now in their mid-30s. Not all of them spend their entire salary on avocado toast. Some have real assets to invest. They have got in the habit of using low-cost, no-frills platforms and are less likely to be as willing as their parents to pay large fees to human advisers.

Traditional institutions are wrestling with the innovator's dilemma: throw everything at satisfying the demand for easy, low-cost technology or try to defend a high-margin business that has proven profitable for decades.

Ted Dimon's son has made his choice. Jamie, chief executive at JPMorgan, this week revealed You Invest, a new service that offers free trading and stock research   both of which used to cost a fortune. The younger Mr Dimon has likened the effort to Amazon Prime, where a single fee comes with an ever-increasing array of services.

Nobody starting as a broker today will be doing the same job in 2081.

SEOUL Brisk demand for memory chips drove South Korea's exports to strong growth for the second straight month in August despite headwinds from global trade tensions.

Overseas shipments in August rose 8.7% from a year earlier to $51.20 billion, following a 6.2% gain in the preceding month, according to preliminary data from the trade ministry Saturday. The latest reading missed the median market forecast for a 9.8% increase.

Imports in August gained 9.2% from a year earlier to $44.30 billion, following a revised 16.4% increase in the previous month. The latest reading beat the median market forecast for an 8.6% increase.

The trade surplus stood at $6.90 billion in August, little changed from a revised $6.91 billion a month earlier but well below the median forecast of $7.27 billion.

The data slightly weaker than expected but still solid came as new smartphone releases and rising business investment in artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things have recently driven up demand for semiconductors and other electronics parts.

South Korean tech giant, Samsung Electronics Co., in August launched a new flagship Galaxy Note 9 smartphone and separately announced a $22 billion investment plan to nurture new growth engines including AI.

Meanwhile, U.S.-China trade friction continues to weigh on global trade and South Korea's export-led economy, which depends heavily on the world's two biggest economies for trade.

Risk taking in US commercial property market runs hot

Investors accept smaller premium for taking on risk in bonds backed by commercial mortgages

Investors are stomaching the lowest premium in more than a decade for taking on more risk in the US commercial property market, as a humming American economy encourages money managers to reach for higher returns.

The difference between the return on the safest slices of commercial mortgage-backed securities   a pool of mortgages bundled into a bond   and the riskier slices has dropped to its lowest level since the build-up to the financial crisis, according to data from Trepp, a data analytics company.

A combination of an expanding US economy and the ongoing hunt for yield is driving investors  willingness to assume more exposure to potential losses without greater compensation. For some it is another sign that a nearly decade-old credit cycle maybe approaching a turning point.

 As you get toward the latter innings of the credit cycle, people have money they need to put to work and they take on more risk for less return,  said Alan Todd, a CMBS analyst at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

CMBS bundle pools of mortgages on commercial buildings such as offices and malls into a single bond, with the interest paid by the mortgage repayments of borrowers. The debt is sliced into tranches, with higher returns offered to those prepared to absorb potential losses on the underlying mortgages first.

Demand has waned for senior, or  triple-A , tranches of new CMBS deals, while it has remained for riskier, or  triple-B minus , slices, narrowing the gap between the two to the lowest level since May 2007, according to Trepp.

As the Federal Reserve has tightened monetary policy, higher quality fixed-rate investments such as the triple-A tranches of CMBS have fallen in price, prompting investors to seek out floating-rate assets like company loans, or take more credit risk to boost returns.

 You are probably not getting paid for the risk you are taking and that definitely concerns us,  said Dushyant Mehra, co-chief investment officer at Hildene.  We are cautious about this environment. 

There has also been a deluge of supply in the CMBS market, with $49bn of new issuance between January and July, topping the $45bn sold in the same period in 2017.

It has contributed to the credit premium between triple-A rated tranches and triple-B minus tranches   which sit one rating above junk   shrinking to 2.1 per cent in August from 2.2 per cent in July and below its previous post-crisis low of 2.3 per cent touched in July 2014, according to the Trepp data. While it marks the lowest premium for investing in the lower tranches of CMBS securities since May 2007, it is still far from pre-crisis lows of 67 basis points hit at the beginning of that year.

 It is something everyone frets over,  Gunter Seeger, a portfolio manager at fund manager PineBridge, said of the evaporating premium investors are demanding.  You are always concerned that the pendulum swings too far but the reach for yield is still there. 

Concerns over the presence of mortgages tied to retail buildings in CMBS have also abated, pushing prices higher for lower-rated tranches. Given the strength of the US economy, many investors remain sanguine about the risk of an imminent drop in prices for US corporate debt. But others point out that the robust appetite for risk echoes the period before the financial crisis, raising concern over the scale of the fallout when the economy slows down.

Aflac Wants to Tempt Hackers into Opening the Wrong Door

By Jeff Stone

Insurer Aflac Inc. nearly three years ago began inserting into its corporate network digital tripwires to trick hackers into revealing their presence inside the company's systems.

Cybercriminals who click on links disguised as employee credentials or sensitive human resources data in fact are raising a red flag for the security team. Many thousands, perhaps millions, of so-called honeypots now exist in Aflac's remote desktop software, in file-transfer tools, near sensitive databases and on employee machines, said DJ Goldsworthy, director of security operations and threat intelligence.

Aflac uses this deceptive technology as a last line of defense against hackers and rogue insiders who sneak around the company's other security protocols, said Mr. Goldsworthy.

"Think about your house: If you had some precious jewelry you wanted to protect, deception would be like having multiple doors that lead to nowhere," he said. "And behind every door there are multiple safes, where if you touch the wrong safe it alerts the police to your presence. To steal the jewelry, thieves would have to know which safe to open without getting caught."

Honeypots can consist of compact bits of code, and can be implemented throughout an organization with automation tools.

Mr. Goldsworthy in an interview with WSJ Pro Cybersecurity explained why the security team has used honeypots as a failsafe technique. Here are edited excerpts:

Q: How do you use honeypots?

A: We're conducting weekly scans with a standard vulnerability scanner. We have a tool that has an inventory of all our applications in our system, and it lets us know if any vulnerabilities are identified in our environment in real-time. We're doing state and dynamic code analysis for all the code we write. We're also using penetration testing constantly, and have four individuals slated for our red team who are doing manual testing all the time.

And then we have this [honeypot] strategy to compensate for anything that's not resolved by any of those controls. Say we did a really bad job patching, and someone uses one of those holes to get in and move around the network. They would bump into one of our decoys...and alert us to their presence. It's to reduce the risk of any residual vulnerabilities.

Q: How often do hackers actually trigger these alerts and what do you learn?

A: Not often. We've had some penetration testers be detected and we learned they can't tell if they're interacting with a fake system, so they spend a lot of time trying to get into that. That gives us more time to respond, and we get a good forensic view that tells us all their techniques, tactics and procedures.

We've also been able to identify third parties trying to access things they really had no legitimate business use for. One example was a developer attempting to get access to something that didn't exist. We looked at the restrictions on their account and made sure they only had the access required for code development. Then we worked with the vendor to reiterate the security elements of our agreement, and I think they gave that person a warning.

There was no evidence to indicate the person was after something with malicious intent, but it was serious enough to be a concern.

What Businesses Can Learn From NIST's Advice for Securing Medical Devices

By Adam Janofsky

As organizations across industries confront the risks introduced by the Internet of Things, one government agency is sounding the alarm on a connected device that has potentially deadly consequences.

The National Institute of Standards and Technology's National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence has spent more than two years studying threats posed by wireless infusion pumps, which are widely used by healthcare organizations to deliver fluid to patients in a controlled manner. The agency last week offered a number of suggestions for securing these devices against threats such as denial-of-service attacks that can stop a pump from functioning.

Although the guidance covers a specific device, many of the recommendations apply to connected equipment that may be unrelated to health care, said NCCE deputy director Tim McBride. These measures, such as installing firewalls to limit a device's access to the rest of a corporate network and block it from the internet, can help prevent malware infections, data loss and misuse of IoT devices, he said.

Divide your network. NIST recommends a multilayered approach for protecting infusion pumps and other connected devices, but one of the most critical measures is splitting an organization's network into smaller and more manageable parts that aren't integrated.

In the guidance, NIST describes what it calls a zone-based security approach, which involves using different local networks for designated purposes. In this scenario, a hospital's system might be divided into a dozen networks, each protected by different safeguards depending on the sensitivity of the information and devices they contain.

For example, a guest network that allows visitors and patients to access the internet might need fewer security controls than a database server that contains personal health information regulated by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. For infusion pumps, there might be a biomedical engineering zone that contains pump-management servers, a medical device zone that contains the infusion pump system itself, and a remote access server for external vendor support.

NIST recommends that a medical device zone use firewalls and other security controls to block access to the internet and other parts of the network, which would help prevent hackers from compromising the devices.

"We found that a lot of health care and hospital networks are rather flat, so by segmenting the network like this we can eliminate [wireless infusion pumps] from being a big security problem," said Mr. McBride.

Fatal consequences. Wireless infusion pumps and connected medical devices in general are similar technologically to many IoT devices in other industries, such as smart refrigerators and connected sensors, said Sue Wang, a cybersecurity engineer at the non-profit Mitre Corp. These devices often have limited computing power, weak default passcodes and can be challenging to patch, she said.

But unlike many other IoT devices, infusion pumps face cyberthreats that can be fatal. For example, NIST's report highlights malware infections that can cause changes to prescribed dosages, denial-of-service attacks that interfere with the pump's functioning and targeted attacks that can lead to unauthorized access to patient health information.

The guidance was published about two weeks after security researchers at Black Hat USA 2018 in Las Vegas demonstrated how to take over an insulin pump using radio signals. The researchers, speaking to thousands of cybersecurity professionals, used what they described as a cheap radio device to instruct a pump to withhold a dose of insulin.

"Whatever the remote programmer can do, we can do that," said Jonathan Butts, founder of QED Secure Solutions, referring to the programming devices health care professionals use to monitor and adjust the devices.

NIST, a division of the U.S. Department of Commerce, publishes a cybersecurity framework that is widely used by government agencies and private companies. The framework describes best practices for securing data, such as how to encrypt sensitive information and install critical updates.

Kids Are Getting Hit in Identity Fraud Schemes

New legislation to take effect Sept. 21 will give parents the ability to check and freeze credit files in their children's names at no cost, the Journal reports. The law is part of a broader banking law that legislators passed in response to a data breach at credit reporting company Equifax Inc. last year.

ID theft via stolen Social Security numbers. One in 50 credit applications that were filed last year under new Social Security numbers were connected to false identities, according to an estimate from ID Analytics, an identity-fraud prevention unit of Symantec Corp. About 147.9 million U.S. consumers' data was exposed in the Equifax breach, including Social Security numbers.

Children targeted by fraudsters. Experts say children are increasingly becoming victims of identity theft because they have clean credit histories and parents rarely check their files. Children usually do not have credit files unless their parents or criminals have opened them in their names. But ID Analytics recommends that parents should create credit files for their children, since the credit-reporting system recognizes the first person to claim an identity as that person.

Big Number: 25%

Air Canada confirms breach. Air Canada said in an email to customers that a breach of its mobile app may affect 20,000 people, TechCrunch reported Wednesday. Cybercriminals may have accessed customer names, passport numbers, passport country of issuance and other personal information, the airline said. It wasn't clear whether hackers breached Air Canada's systems, or reused username and password credentials stolen from other sites to access Air Canada's app, according to TechCrunch.

Old protocol renders new phones vulnerable. Cybersecurity researchers told Wired magazine they found a new way to bypass security mechanisms and unlock screens on Android phones. The technique uses Attention, or AT, commands, a 1980s-era protocol companies used to instruct phones to dial or hang up a call, according to Wired. AT commands now are used for SMS testing and functions, such as activating a camera. Numerous phone manufacturers leave AT commands open to anyone with a USB port, meaning attackers could inject malicious commands through a USB cable, Wired reported.

Iranian propaganda campaign larger than reported. An Iranian influence operation involved a large number of anonymous websites and social media accounts in 11 languages, according to Reuters. Facebook Inc. last week said it removed pages that were spreading messages from Iranian state media, but a Reuters analysis identified 10 more websites and social media accounts on Facebook's Instagram, Twitter Inc., and Alphabet Inc.'s YouTube. "The Iranian operation relied on quantity, not quality, but it stayed undetected for years," Ben Nimmo, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab, told Reuters.

Ransomware techniques evolve. Cybercriminals are threatening to use fake negative reviews and complaints on social media about CheapAir.com if the flight comparison website doesn't pay a ransom, Vice Motherboard reported. CheapAir's chief executive told Motherboard the company will not pay the extortionists' demand of 1.5 bitcoin, or about $10,500. Ransomware attackers typically use malicious software to encrypt an organization's sensitive files, saying the materials will be unlocked only after the firm pays up.

U.S. News: Now Even Children Face ID Theft

WASHINGTON -- Parents have a new item to add to their financial to-do list: check their child's credit history.

A new federal law going into effect in September will make it easier for families to combat the growing problem of identity fraud of minors, allowing them to make inquiries about credit files in their child's name and freeze a file at no cost.

Data-security experts say children are increasingly targeted by thieves who steal their Social Security numbers to create fake or "synthetic" identities, then open credit cards, take out loans or apply for public assistance. One credit-reporting company, Experian, estimates such identity theft will affect one in four children before they become an adult.

The ability to check children's credit reports is part of a broader banking law that also allowed unlimited, free credit freezes for adults, a response to a massive data breach at Equifax Inc. last September.

Criminals see the clean credit histories of children as particularly attractive, in part because parents rarely check on them. That often allows theft to go unnoticed for years, until the victims reach college age and start applying for credit cards and student loans. Also, a 2011 change in how the government assigns Social Security numbers to babies and new immigrants made it easier to steal numbers without being discovered, experts said.

Young children don't have credit files unless parents or guardians open them -- or someone committing fraud did.

Last year, the Federal Trade Commission received 14,000 complaints involving identity theft targeting people 19 and younger, about 3.7% of complaints for all age groups. But experts say those numbers may understate the problem because parents are often unaware of children being targeted.

"We have found children are increasingly victims of identity theft," said Suzanne Barber, director of the Center for Identity at the University of Texas at Austin. "If I were going to patchwork an identity, whose would I want to use? I'd probably use the identity that is checked least often."

Al Pascual, an analyst specializing in fraud and security at Javelin Strategy & Research, said a child's personal information is more valuable on the dark web than an adult's, with a full set of personal information known as "fullz" -- name, date of birth, address and Social Security number -- "going for 10 times, 20 times more" than an adult file, which typically fetches $5 per person.

ID Analytics, an identity-fraud prevention unit of Symantec Corp., estimates 2.2% -- or one in every 50 -- of credit applications filed under newly issued Social Security numbers carried fake identities last year, up from 1.2% in 2013. Many of those numbers are believed to belong to young children.

Once a child's personal information is stolen, cleaning up the aftermath can be difficult.

Jill Carlon, a Peoria, Ariz., mother of three, said she spent seven years fixing her daughter's credit file after receiving a call in 2011 about a new J.C. Penney Co. credit card opened using her then 7-year-old daughter's Social Security number. More accounts followed, including at Dillards Inc., Macy's Inc. and Fry's Electronics Inc. Then collection notices came from a local hotel.

"As a mother, I am supposed to be there to protect her and do everything I can," said Ms. Carlon, a 46-year-old nurse. "It was out of my control."

Ms. Carlon tried to close the accounts, but was turned away because the name on the accounts didn't match her daughter's, Avery. She called banks, credit-reporting companies, the police and lawyers, then turned to politicians for help.

The Carlons changed their daughter's first and middle names in an attempt to get her a new Social Security number. Finally, earlier this year, she was issued a new number.

Once the provision in the new law goes into effect Sept. 21, parents should contact the three main credit-reporting companies -- Experian, Equifax and TransUnion -- to check on their children's credit files, experts say. Most young children shouldn't have credit files, though some experts recommend parents create a file for their child, then freeze it.

Ken Meiser, chief compliance officer at ID Analytics, says the credit-reporting system is built on the idea that the first person to claim an identity is that person. "It makes sense for a parent to make sure that they have created that file and protected it," he said.

Chief executive and financier in tit-for-tat allegations over company s bankruptcy

A veteran corporate financier who previously worked for Blackstone has been accused of orchestrating the fraudulent bankruptcy of a company he had bought so that he could repurchase it on the cheap.

Chinh Chu, who established his investment firm CC Capital after a 25-year stint working on multibillion-dollar private equity deals for Blackstone, bought US healthcare software company Constellation Healthcare Technologies last year. At the time Constellation was listed on London s Aim.

Within months of the acquisition, Constellation s founding chief executive Paul Parmar had departed, Mr Chu claimed he had been subject to a  complex fraud  and both the US Securities and Exchange Commission and the US Department of Justice had launched actions against Mr Parmar.

Constellation filed for bankruptcy in March, claiming that some of the businesses it had purchased while Mr Parmar was in charge were fictitious. Investors and banks such as Bank of America Merrill Lynch, who financed the takeover have allegedly been left with uncollectable debts.

Mr Parmar s attorneys openly admit that there were irregularities at the time that Constellation was de-listed from Aim, but claim that Mr Chu had full access to the real information and went ahead with the transaction regardless.

Mr Parmar claims that Mr Chu let Constellation slide into bankruptcy and then rigged the subsequent auction of assets to his benefit.

His legal team is trying to get the charges against him dropped, claiming that Mr Chu made false representations to the authorities in a  brazen move  to stop Mr Parmar  derailing this elaborate plan  to repurchase Constellation after bankruptcy proceedings, according to court documents.

 It is utterly implausible that such a highly sophisticated investor could spend $7m on due diligence and then make an investment decision based on a few inaccurate statements made very early in the process by defendant Parmar, rather than the mountains of data that were subsequently provided,  said court documents filed by Mr Parmar s legal team.

CC Capital said:  We deny the false and outrageous allegations from Mr Parmar, who stands accused by the US Department of Justice and the US Securities and Exchange Commission of perpetrating a brazen and elaborate fraud involving false statements, fictitious documents and sham companies. We will continue to co-operate fully with the law enforcement agencies that are investigating his extensive fraud. 

The court documents refer to a series of questions that were originally raised by the FT s Alphaville finance blog before the takeover about a string of supposed bolt-on acquisitions made by Constellation before its go-private discussions with CC Capital had been made public.

 While such an article would normally cause a deal like this to be derailed or, at a minimum, be delayed to perform additional due diligence, BofA requested none and Chinh Chu incredibly had the opposite reaction, demanding to immediately close the deal,  state the documents submitted by Mr Parmar s legal team.

In the court filings, Mr Parmar insisted that Mr Chu was aware the bolt-on acquisitions identified by FT Alphaville were in fact empty corporate shells, despite Constellation having raised scores of millions of pounds via Aim share placements to buy them.

FBI agents arrested Mr Parmar in May along with two of his former colleagues, Sotirios  Sam  Zaharis and Ravi Chivukula, and charged the men with securities fraud. The SEC has launched a parallel civil action.

Mr Chu targeted Constellation as his first post-Blackstone deal, worth $309m.

Associates of Mr Chu say he is mortified that the transaction has collapsed amid a welter of legal claims, but point to the fact that he is still pursuing other deals, with CC Capital recently leading a $6.9bn move to take data analytics firm Dun & Bradstreet private.

Insurance Vision Fund injects $100m with a view to tapping expertise for investments

SoftBank's Vision Fund is to make a $100m investment to expand the technology business of Chinese online insurer ZhongAn.

The $100bn investment fund, which has shaken up technology investing over the past three years, will own a majority stake in the business, with plans to use ZhongAn's technology in a number of its investments, such as Uber and its rival Didi Chuxing.

ZhongAn, which will also invest $100m in the joint venture, was launched in 2013 by China's Ant Financial, Tencent and Ping An Insurance. It attracted early attention by offering unusual products such as a policy to cover customers who got alcohol poisoning during the World Cup. More recently, it has diversified into technology. with a large business focused on blockchain, artificial intelligence and other developments.

It has started a project that uses blockchain to track farm-raised chickens.

The tech business employs more than 1,500 engineers and technicians   more than half of ZhongAn's total staff. Until now, its operations have been limited mainly to business within China.

One aim of the SoftBank deal is to export ZhongAn tech to overseas insurance companies, financial technology groups and healthcare operators.

But the first focus would be on how other companies that the Vision Fund has invested in can use ZhongAn technology, said Francis Tang, the company's chief financial officer. "They use their network; we use our technology," Mr Tang said. "The natural [strategy] was to go to SoftBank's portfolio. Working on that will help us take the company global."

The Vision Fund, which has backers including Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Apple and Qualcomm, has invested tens of billions of dollars in companies such as WeWork, Paytm and Uber. SoftBank was also a cornerstone investor in ZhongAn's $1.5bn IPO in 2017.

ZhongAn provided insurance to more than 300m customers in the first half of 2018. Its insurance premium income during that time increased by 107 per cent to Rmb5.2bn ($761m) compared with the same period last year, it said yesterday in its interim report.

It is lossmaking, however, and its margins remain thin: its most recent premium contribution was just Rmb17 per person. In the first six months of the year, net losses expanded by more than 130 per cent to Rmb666.8m. Part of the losses derive from fees ZhongAn pays to other internet companies for allowing it to offer insurance to their customers.

Quartz Launches Paid Cryptocurrency Newsletter; Newsletter will cost $15 per month, or $150 annually

Quartz is the latest media company attempting to cash in on the growing enthusiasm for cryptocurrency.

The online business-news startup is launching "https://qz.com/private-key/", a newsletter that aims to guide its subscribers through the often turbulent markets for virtual currencies such as bitcoin and Ethereum.

For $15 a month or $150 a year, readers will have access to a twice-weekly newsletter that summarizes and analyzes the rapidly shifting world of cryptocurrencies and the decentralized accounting technology that supports them. The newsletter is the first paid product that Quartz has released since it was "https://www.wsj.com/articles/quartz-to-be-bought-by-japans-uzabase-for-as-much-as-110-million-1530512254" by the Japanese financial intelligence and media firm business intelligence firm Uzabase.

A paid cryptocurrency newsletter hits multiple sweet spots for Quartz, which was an early adopter of both free newsletters and coverage of bitcoin, said Kevin Delaney, the co-president and editor in chief of Quartz. The company gauged reader interest in the product before it launched and managed to sign up about 50 paying customers weeks in advance, Mr. Delaney said.

In an interview, Mr. Delaney said the heightened interest in virtual currency opened up a niche for Quartz because many potential consumers don't have the information they need to make informed decisions.

"Despite surging interest in them, cryptocurrencies remain opaque to most potential investors. It's surprisingly difficult to find clear and useful information on the web," Mr. Delaney said. "Quartz Private Key is stepping into that void with analysis of new coins, regulations, emerging uses of blockchain, and other information that's essential to being a smart cryptocurrency investor."

Quartz Private Key will face competition from other newsletters that focus on cryptocurrency. Anthony Pompliano, a founding partner at the asset management firm Morgan Creek Digital, writes "https://offthechain.substack.com/" called "Off the Chain" that provides daily analysis of cryptocurrency markets.

Mr. Pompliano says the newsletter, which costs $30 a month, has already attracted "thousands" of subscribers. CoinDesk, a news site that specializes in digital currencies, also offers a mix of daily and weekly newsletters. And many major news organizations, from Bloomberg to The Wall Street Journal, write regularly about the world of cryptocurrencies.

Uzabase bought Quartz for between $75 million and $110 million, according to The Wall Street Journal. Uzabase said the acquisition was driven, in part, by the potential of working with Quartz to build a paid subscription business.

The deal was structured with a so-called earn-out, with the final acquisition price determined by Quartz hitting revenue goals. A company spokesperson said Quartz was still on track to meet its projected revenue goal of $35 million to $38 million for 2018. Last year, Quartz booked $28 million in revenue but wasn't profitable.

Like many media companies, Quartz is turning to subscriptions as the market for digital advertising becomes increasingly competitive. As major tech firms, including Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Facebook Inc., tighten their grip on new digital spending, media outlets are looking for alternate revenue sources.

Quartz' U.S. readership has held steady over the past two years, according to data from web analytics firm comScore. In 2017, Quartz attracted about 11.87 million average monthly U.S. visitors; so far this year, Quartz has averaged about 11.67 million monthly U.S. visitors, according to comScore.

For Quartz, paid products have been a long time coming. In 2017, the company acquired Intelligentsia.ai, an artificial intelligence research firm, and explored the creation of a paid research business before shelving the idea. Quartz also ran a high-end paid events business before canceling its flagship conference last year.

Colorado Law Tightens Timeframe for Data Breach Reporting

By Adam Janofsky

Businesses seeking to comply with the 50 state data breach laws on the books should take note of a strict Colorado consumer data privacy act that goes into effect September 1.

The new law has the tightest reporting deadline of any state breach notification act, giving companies 30 days to provide notice of a breach involving personal information belonging to Colorado residents, according to David Stauss, a Denver-based partner at the law firm Ballard Spahr LLP. Most states have 45 or 60 day reporting requirements, and many allow for exceptions.

The Colorado law is the latest in a push among state regulators for stronger cybersecurity and privacy laws, attorneys say. Alabama and South Dakota passed data breach notification laws in March, becoming the last two states to do so. States also are expected to consider data privacy legislation to restrict and oversee data-collection practices following the lead of California, which passed a wide-reaching bill in June.

Colorado also expanded the definition of personal information to include biometric data, driver's license numbers, passwords and other items. In other state laws, personal information is often limited to a first name or initial and last name in combination with an identifier, such as a Social Security number.

What companies must do: Given the shorter time frame for reporting a breach, businesses should examine their internal response plans, taking stock of how often they conduct penetration tests and audit their systems for vulnerabilities, said Cynthia Larose, an attorney specializing in privacy matters with Mintz Levin in Boston.

"They're going to need to be able to demonstrate to regulators that they've got a solid incident response plan and that they can implement it--and it's not just something you can grab off the internet," she said.

The recent push for stricter data breach laws, including the ones in Alabama and South Dakota, has largely been motivated by the breach Equifax Inc. reported in September 2017 that compromised the personal information of 147.9 million U.S. consumers, according to Pam Greenberg, a policy researcher with the National Conference of State Legislatures.

In May, Vermont enacted a law that was the first of its kind, specifically regulating data brokers who buy and sell personal information. That law requires data brokers to register annually with the state attorney general and disclose their practices for collection, storage and sale of personal information, said Ms. Larose. The report must also include the number of data breaches during the prior year, and the total number of consumers affected.

The GDPR effect: Although U.S. laws are getting stricter, they're still lenient compared to the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May. That law requires firms to disclose breaches within 72 hours, and companies that fail to comply with GDPR could face fines as large as 4% of their global annual revenue or  20 million, whichever is higher.

It's likely that states will start passing stricter data privacy laws in 2019, following the lead of California, which passed a broad data-privacy bill in June that requires businesses to delete certain data upon request, among other mandates, said Ms. Larose. Technology firms, fearful of this push, are working with policy makers to shape potential federal regulation that would pre-empt state laws, The Wall Street Journal reported.

"Tech companies believe that if other states follow the California model... it's going to be a complete disaster," said Mr. Stauss. "I think what you'll see is tech companies changing their tune and preferring federal regulation, because one law is better than 50."

China Has an Advantage with Big Data

China's "more totalitarian regime" gives the government freedom to access citizens' data with less regard for privacy compared to other countries, Tadashi Maeda, the governor of the state-owned Japan Bank for International Cooperation told WSJ's Peter Landers in an interview. Data protection laws make it difficult for other governments including Japan's to collect and analyze their citizens' data.

International data rules? Mr. Maeda said in the interview that the U.S., European countries and Japan should agree on joint rules for data use to counter China's growing strength in the area. The national strategy "Made in China 2025" may give Chinese companies an advantage over competitors as they use their access to troves of personal data like online chats to develop artificial intelligence.

China's tech stocks take a hit. Last week, China and the U.S. raised new tariffs totaling $16 billion on one another's goods, in the latest development in the two countries' ongoing trade disagreements. The Trump administration has argued that China uses its industrial strategy to fund high-tech companies and give them an unfair advantage over competitors. The Journal's Akane Otani and Steven Russolillo report that trade negotiations, possible regulation and slowed down growth have caused Chinese technology stocks to fall this year.

More Cyber News

Big Tech lobbies for data collection bill. Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Microsoft Corp. and other technology companies have lobbied the Trump administration for a federal law to give companies wide leeway over how firms collect and share user data, according to the New York Times. Such a law would overrule the new California state law that gives people the ability to know what information companies collect about them, the Times reported. David Redl, head of a Commerce Department division that oversees privacy efforts, said in July the Trump administration's "commitment to prosperity will be our guide," the Times reported.

Facebook bans Myanmar military pages. Facebook Inc. on Monday said it will remove the page belonging to the commander-in-chief of the armed forces in Myanmar, along with accounts of other military officials, to prevent the spread of "hate and misinformation," according to Reuters. Facebook said dozens of accounts "used seemingly independent news and opinion pages to covertly push the messages of the Myanmar military," Reuters reports. The move came hours after United Nations investigators said Myanmar's military was responsible for mass killings and rapes of Muslim Rohingya, Reuters said.

PG&E exposed confidential information. San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. was identified Friday as the large utility that authorities had fined in May for losing control of a database with confidential information about its system and leaving it exposed on the internet for 70 days, the Journal's Rebecca Smith reports. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission until last week had declined to identify the utility it fined $2.7 million this year for a 2016 breach, WSJ's Ms. Smith reports. Roughly 30,000 records about PG&E's cyber assets were exposed to the web without password protection at a time when authorities have said Russian hackers were trying to breach U.S. energy firms.

Russian hackers targeted clergy. The same Russian hackers who sought to meddle in the U.S. election also targeted a leader of the Eastern Orthodox Christian Church, the Associated Press reported Monday. Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I says he has the exclusive power to separate Ukrainian and Russian religious denominations, and grant the ecclesiastic independence long sought by Ukrainians, according to the AP. The decision, which could come as soon as next month, could drastically erode the power of church leaders in Moscow, the AP said. Cybersecurity researchers from Secureworks Inc. provided the AP with evidence that hackers attempted to break into email accounts belonging to the patriarch's aides.

Japanese Official Says China Has a High-Tech Edge: Totalitarianism; Democracies need to counter China by establishing common rules for data use, government banker says

TOKYO A top Japanese government banker said China's industrial strategy is "very dangerous" for democracies because totalitarian nations can ignore their citizens' privacy and get an edge in new technologies.

"A country like China, a more totalitarian regime, will perform better than the democratic countries," said Tadashi Maeda, governor of the state-owned Japan Bank for International Cooperation, in an interview. "We have a lot of problems gathering big data because of the privacy issue. China doesn't have such an issue. So obviously they have some advantage."

The Trump administration, sometimes with backing from Japan and Europe, has taken on Beijing over its "Made in China 2025" plan, which seeks to boost Chinese industry in high-tech areas. Washington says the initiative is packed with subsidies for Chinese high-tech firms that would give them an unfair advantage in global competition. It has placed tariffs on $50 billion in Chinese goods, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-u-s-fire-off-new-tariffs-in-middle-of-trade-talks-1535018365".

China has said its plan is in line with World Trade Organization rules and "http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-04/04/c_137088566.htm".

Mr. Maeda said he feared Made in China 2025 would allow Chinese companies to get an edge in artificial intelligence and other new technologies that rely on processing large amounts of data such as billions of online chats. Already the Chinese government is building one of the world's most sophisticated security systems based on big data, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-tech-giants-have-a-second-job-helping-the-government-see-everything-1512056284".

"I think it is very dangerous," Mr. Maeda said. Democracies including the U.S., European nations and Japan need to counter the Chinese effort by establishing common rules for data use, he said.

A representative of China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, asked about Mr. Maeda's comments, said Tuesday: "China's development achievements in the field of artificial intelligence and big data are obvious to all, and China is willing to share its development fruits with all countries. Others should not wear 'colored glasses.'"

Under Mr. Maeda, who took the top job in June, JBIC is branching out from its traditional business of making loans for big infrastructure projects abroad. His priority in the bank's three-year plan, announced this summer, is to help Japanese companies get better access to overseas technologies for the "fourth industrial revolution," in which traditional manufacturers will use new kinds of data to run their businesses more efficiently.

He said JBIC was ready to take equity stakes in overseas companies doing business with Japan, focusing on data-driven areas such as "smart houses" that monitor the health condition of the elderly.

J.C. Penney: Buying and Chasing

J.C. Penney posted disappointing fiscal 2018 second-quarter sales and adjusted Ebitda and lowered its forecast for the year. With no CEO at the helm (former CEO Marvin Ellison abruptly departed in May), the department store retailer appears to have lost its way. Although "hiring a new CEO is a top priority," we expect the company to remain adrift until an experienced merchandiser can be brought in to right the ship and steer it to better execution along with sales and adjusted Ebitda growth. With this year's holiday season not far off, it is unlikely a new CEO can make his mark on the company before the second half of next year at the earliest. Moody's and S&P seem to agree, both lowering JCP's senior unsecured notes rating one notch to Caa2/CCC+.

About the Author

Evan Mann has 28 years of experience as a credit analyst with Gimme Credit High Yield, Delaware Investments, Banc America Securities, Dillon Read and Lord Abbett. He earned his B.A. from Washington University and his M.B.A. from Hofstra University.

Same-store sales for May and July were ahead of the company's fiscal 2018 guidance but offset by a soft June. This quarter, JCP changed its inventory management strategy from "buying to store capacity" to "buying and chasing" based on actual sell-through results. This necessitated taking markdowns to clear excessive inventory beyond seasonal product or fashion misses with further actions to right-size continuing into the second half as inventory liquidation will remain a drag on this year's operating performance.

Total revenue for the second quarter ended Aug. 4 fell 8% to $2.8 billion because of last year's store closings, lower credit card income, and a meager 0.3% increase in same-store sales. The adjusted Ebitda margin decreased 290 basis points from higher markdowns and pricing actions to clear slow-moving and excess inventory as well as selling, general and administrative deleveraging related to lower sales. Reflecting the declines in sales and margin, fiscal second-quarter adjusted Ebitda dropped 48% to $105 million, short of the $193 million consensus estimate. For the last 12 months, adjusted Ebitda of $789 million translated to leverage of 5.3x and rent adjusted leverage of 5.9x, deterioration from 4.4x and 5.0x, respectively, in fiscal 2017.

J.C. Penney ended the quarter with $2.2 billion of liquidity. For the first half, free cash flow (cash flow from operations less net capital spending) swung $245 million to a $235 million shortfall mostly because of lower earnings and increased working capital usage. Inventory was up 1% on a same-store basis in a quarter with flat same-store sales, supporting the company's argument that it needs to reduce inventory further. The retailer looks for third-quarter same-store sales to be slightly negative with gross margin pressure continuing from the decision to right-size inventory, partly offset by sales gains for higher-margin women's apparel, leveraging of private label and sourcing, and better pricing analytics. The consensus estimate calls for third-quarter Ebitda of $40 million, down from $108 million in the year-ago period. For fiscal 2018, J.C. Penney expects same-store sales to be flat (from flat to up 2%), margin declines related to inventory reductions and selling, general and administrative deleveraging, adjusted Ebitda of around $700 million, free cash flow flat to up slightly, and year-end liquidity of at least $2.2 billion.

Based on our updated model, we look for leverage to rise to 5.9x (6.3x rent adjusted) at year end. Since our last report on May 23, the 5.875% senior notes due 2023 have widened 140 basis points to 8.6%. With credit metrics expected to deteriorate over the near term and no replacement CEO, we maintain an underperform rating.

It Was Meant to Be the Better Bitcoin. It's Down Nearly 90%; With faster transactions and lower fees, cryptocurrency Bitcoin Cash was conceived as a way to make bitcoin a mainstream payment tool

The bear market in cryptocurrencies has "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cryptocurrency-market-plumbs-new-depths-in-2018-1534241274" who bought bitcoin at the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/for-bitcoin-a-year-like-no-other-1514721601" last year. But losses have been even more brutal for those who invested in once-promising "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-cash-litecoin-ether-oh-my-whats-with-all-the-bitcoin-clones-1514037600".

Consider Bitcoin Cash, an "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoins-civil-war-what-you-need-to-know-1501508664" that launched on August 1, 2017, which moves independently of bitcoin itself. While

"https://www.wsj.com/articles/is-bitcoin-back-cryptocurrency-crosses-8-000-for-first-time-in-two-months-1532433493" 67% from its record intraday high of $20,089 in December, Bitcoin Cash is down a crushing 88% from its peak of $4,355.62, according to CoinMarketCap.com. Friday evening, it traded at around $533.

Hundreds of other coins have also "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoins-hype-vanishes-just-like-that-were-in-the-boring-phase-1523534400", but the underperformance of Bitcoin Cash is notable because it touches on a bigger theme: whether virtual currencies can really become a means of payment that would supplant traditional money.

Supporters of Bitcoin Cash conceived it as a way to fix problems that they believed were impeding bitcoin from becoming a mainstream payment tool, akin to PayPal or Visa.

Boosters including Roger Ver, a prominent crypto investor often called Bitcoin Jesus argued that the original bitcoin network had become too slow and that users were paying overly hefty fees for sending each other bitcoins. This faction contended that bitcoin's clunkiness was causing people to treat it as a store of value, like gold, and not as a practical way to buy Big Macs or cappuccinos.

There is still a lively debate over whether bitcoin is any good as a medium of exchange. Many bitcoin holders view it as a hedge against the collapse of government-backed currencies, but don't often use it to pay for things.

After waging an unsuccessful campaign to change bitcoin from within, the rebels broke off and created Bitcoin Cash, in a so-called fork that bitterly split the virtual-currency community. The underlying technology of the new cryptocurrency was almost identical to that of bitcoin, except for tweaks aimed at speeding up transactions and lowering fees.

One year later, some research suggests the breakaway coin hasn't lived up to its promises. A study of activity by major cryptocurrency payment processors which help businesses accept payments in crypto found that just $3.8 million worth of payments were made in Bitcoin Cash in May. That is down from $10.5 million in March, according to Chainalysis, an analytics firm that carried out the study.

Backers of Bitcoin Cash note that payments in bitcoin are also down if not quite as sharply and that their preferred cryptocurrency is cheaper to use.

"Despite the decline in price, all the exciting innovation is happening in [Bitcoin Cash]," Mike Komaransky, an adviser to the Bitcoin Cash Association, a group that promotes the use of the cryptocurrency, said in an email. Mr. Ver, another adviser to the group, didn't respond to a request for comment.

There are many reasons why bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies haven't taken off as a form of payment, including their volatility and uncertain regulatory status, which has kept many businesses from embracing them.

Bitcoin Cash is still the fourth-most valuable cryptocurrency by market capitalization, but its value relative to bitcoin has sagged, suggesting that investors who once bet on it may have shifted back to the original. One unit of Bitcoin Cash is now worth about 8% of one bitcoin, down from 18% in early May, CoinMarketCap.com data shows.

For the average investor, the technical distinctions between the two may not be that important. Instead, the market seems to be favoring the one with the stronger brand, according to Martin Garcia, a managing director at Genesis Global Trading Inc., a digital-currency trading firm.

"Bitcoin is expressing itself as the more dominant token," he said.

Lending Club founder secures $500m valuation for new venture

Upgrade mostly arranges online loans for consumers to pay down credit card debt

Renaud Laplanche, the fintech pioneer who built Lending Club into America s biggest provider of unsecured consumer loans, has achieved a $500m valuation for his follow-up venture, Upgrade.

Like Lending Club, Upgrade is in the business of arranging loans over the web, bypassing brick-and-mortar banks by connecting needy borrowers with yield-hungry investors. In almost a year and a half of operation the San Francisco-based company has supplied more than $1bn of loans to consumers, mostly to pay down revolving debt held on credit cards.

On Thursday, Upgrade announced that it had secured $62m in a third round of equity funding from existing investors. The cash values the company at about $500m on a pre-money basis, according to a person familiar with the deal.

Mr Laplanche said the new capital would support continued investments in products, analytics and compliance in offices in San Francisco, Phoenix, Montreal and Chicago.

In May 2016 the French-born executive was forced out of Lending Club, the company he founded, after governance glitches that prompted many of the company s big institutional customers to put their buying programmes on hold. Lending Club has since recovered some of its poise but still expects to lose more than $100m this year, as still-elevated costs offset rises in revenues.

At Upgrade, Mr Laplanche is counting on a fixed-rate loan being more appealing to consumers than the variable cost of credit-card debt, at a time when rising base rates are putting a squeeze on habitual borrowers. Total balances on credit cards held by US consumers stood at $829bn at the end of June, according to New York Federal Reserve data, not far from the pre-crisis peak of $870bn.

Upgrade s latest funding round was led by CreditEase FinTech Investment Fund, a Chinese fund which has backed several lending platforms including Funding Circle, Lenda and Figure, the new venture from Mike Cagney, the former chief executive of SoFi. This is the first time CreditEase has led a round in the US.

 We believe Upgrade will grow into a mainstream consumer credit brand that is dedicated to helping consumers better understand their credit and encourages responsible credit behaviour and we are excited to be part of the journey,  said Anju Patwardhan, managing director at CreditEase, who is joining the Upgrade board.

India's Flipkart buys speech recognition software start-up

Technology

Indian ecommerce group Flipkart has sought to steal a march over rival Amazon by acquiring a start-up that turns local languages from speech to text, as industry attention turns to lowerincome people not yet shopping online.

Flipkart said yesterday that it had agreed the takeover of Bangalore-based Liv.ai, which has developed artificial intelligence-driven software enabling smartphone users to dictate text in 10 indigenous tongues, from Hindi to Malayalam.

Flipkart, which was itself bought by Walmart this year in a $16bn deal, did not reveal the value of the acquisition, although local reports put it at about $40m.

The purchase reflects a growing consensus among ecommerce executives that strong growth will require a broadening of the market beyond Englishspeaking, relatively prosperous Indians who already do some shopping online.

Kalyan Krishnamurthy, Flipkart chief executive, said that "the next wave of growth of internet users" was coming from beyond India's biggest cities. He added that most of these new users want to access online services in vernacular languages   which most would never have written using a keyboard.

"Given the complexities in typing on vernacular keyboards, voice will become a preferred interface for new shoppers," he said.

A joint report this month by Bain & Company, Google and Omidyar Network found that only 40 per cent of India's 390m internet users made any transactions online, with this group skewed overwhelmingly towards higher-income people.

Analysts say this is partly a reflection of the fact that Indian ecommerce offerings have failed to keep up with a shift in the country's online demographics beyond the fluent English speakers who were first to get online.

KPMG estimates that in 2011, there were 68m Indian web users who were comfortable using English, against 42m who preferred using a local language. By 2016, the latter group outnumbered English speakers 234m to 175m. And in 2021, KPMG forecast, there would be 536m local language speakers online, against 199m English speakers.

Like Amazon India, Flipkart's interface is currently available only in English. It did not reveal when it would announce services in Indian languages.

Other Indian companies, however, have already rolled out local language offerings. Quikr, an online classified advertisement service, is available in seven Indian languages. Dailyhunt's mobile app offers 100,000 articles a day in 14 languages licensed from domestic news outlets, and claims to have had more than 150m app downloads.

The Bain-led report estimated that a push for new internet users could unlock $50bn of sales for the Indian ecommerce industry   more than double the sector's total revenue last year of about $20bn.

Part of this potential growth, it added, would come from winning back customers who abandoned ecommerce after their first transaction. While about 160m Indians were currently shopping online, the report estimated, more than 50m had tried and then abandoned ecommerce, typically because they were not satisfied with the online experience or perceived a wider range of options in offline retail.

Barclays has poached one of Goldman Sachs' top electronic trading engineers as the firm continues to overhaul and "digitalise" its markets business.

Justin Brickwood, a 22-year veteran of the Wall Street bank, will have the task of integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning into the Barclays' trading platforms, the group said yesterday.

He starts next month as head of markets innovation in London.

Investment bank boss Tim Throsby has pledged to revive the bank's electronic trading systems and blames years of underinvestment in technology for a steady loss in equities market share.

The bank hopes AI will increase revenue, cut costs, reduce compliance and misconduct risks and keep new etrading competitors at arm's length.

Monzo to join unicorn club, Amazon insurance ambitions, Netflixification of trading

Visa is fond of boasting  wherever you are, there s a Visa card to suit you . But customers of US supermarket chain Kroger last week discovered there are limits to that claim.

Kroger s Foods Co. subsidiary has made good on its threat to stop accepting Visa credit cards, the culmination of a dispute over the interchange chargesretailers pay to card networks for each transaction they process. The grocer has threatened toexpand the banto its other stores if they can t reach an agreement soon.

For most companies, a fight with America s largest supermarket chain would be a worry. The banknocked sharesin Visa and its peers when it was announced late last month, amid worries that other frustrated companies could follow Kroger s lead in trying to fight high processing charges. But the drops are barely blips in the context of the groups  recent growth.

Shares in Visa have risen almost 40 per cent over the past twelvemonths, while Mastercard has jumped more than 50 per cent. Even as challengers like Alipay, Apple Pay and PayPal encroach on their markets, investors have been drawn to the incumbent payment giants who they still believe will benefit from astructural shiftaway from cash and toward digital payments.

But are investors overly optimistic about the prospects for legacy payments giants? As the Kroger conflict shows, Visa and Mastercard s customers   both the merchants that take payments and the banks that issue cards   are agitating for lower costs.

Regulators, meanwhile, are creating the conditions for challengers to flourish. The EU s Second Payment Services Directive   PSD2   makes it easier for third parties to initiate payments directly from customers  bank accounts, bypassing the card companies  networks.

Mark Nelsen, Visa's senior vice-president and head of risk and authentication products, said change is nothing new.  The way you pay has been changing fairly significantly already,  he told the FT.  In my mind there s been a constant drum of innovation happening and PSD2 is designed to accelerate that. 

But while companies such asSweden s Trustly  which specialises in account to account payments that bypass the card networks   have built a foothold in a few markets, Mr Nelsen said established groups  scalewould make them hard to beat. Visa itself works with 46mmerchants globally.

 That connectivity is hard to replicate,  Mr Nelsensaid, adding that Visa wasn t taking the competition  lightly  and was doing  everything we can  to make sure Visa remains a top payments choice.

Recent experience in China highlights the potential for customer habits to quickly change, with state-backed bank card network China UnionPay losing ground in its home market to mobile-driven services Alipay and WeChat Pay.

Zilvinas Bareisis, an analyst specialising in consumer payments at Celent, the consultancy, said the new Chinese groups offered  a completely unique and really interesting consumer value proposition   they're not payments apps, it s more like a lifestyle app with payments capability ingrained in that   that s when you start shifting behaviours  & that s one thing we have been missing in the western world. 

Still, he was sceptical that Visa and Mastercard s dominance would end any time soon, given the groups  investments in improving services and customers  ingrained behaviours.

Both companies have stepped up their investments in new tech and partnered with other fintech groups, with Mastercard s 700mpurchase of Vocalinkmarking one of the most visible responses to the potential changes in the market. Vocalink powers systems such as the UK s Faster Payments scheme for consumer bank transfers, giving Mastercard a stake even in transactions that bypass its card network.

If all else fails, Mr Bareisis added, the card networks  healthy profit margins give them the option to drop prices to squeeze out competitors if they come under sustained pressure   the two companies both reported operating margins of over 50 per cent in the three months to June 30.

That means that, in the long term, the complaints of companies like Kroger could fade   but for now Visa is still holding most of the cards.

Further fintech fascination

Unicorn Alert

UK digital bank Monzo is set to join the unicorn clubwhen it closes a $150m fundraising that values the firm at $1.5bn. The new valuation   which comfortably meets the unicorn definitionof privately held start-ups worth at least $1bn   is more than four times the $356m Monzo was valued at when it last sold stock in November, according to an exclusive story in the FT. Nice work if you can get it.

Amazon's Ambitions

With its treasure trove of consumer spending and lifestyledata, and a captive audience of hundreds of millions, Amazon's forays into fintech are alwaysworth watching. The tech giant'slatest wheeze, according to Reuters, is aUK insuranceprice comparison website. Amazon has already spoken to several insurers about the project, but talks are at an early stage.

Netflixification of Trading

Yes it's a real thing. Switzerland's UBS is developing a new algorithm that suggests future trades based on past ones, using similar underlying concepts to the ones that Netflix uses to encourage House of Cards watchers to peruse Designated Survivor. A good sales person calls his or her client and goes over what they think will be interesting for the day,  saidGiuseppe Nuti, who heads up data science in UBS s FX, rates and credit Strategic Development Lab. We are trying to automate that. It means the job of a sales person, which in many ways has remained immune to the technology revolution, will probably change.

Air Canada and a group of financial institutions have clinched a C$2.35bn ($1.8bn) deal to acquire the Aeroplan rewards business from data analytics company Aimia, more than a decade after the loyalty programme was spun off by Canada s flag carrier.

The airline and its banking partners   Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Visa Canada   will pay Aimia C$450m in cash for the Aeroplan business and assume frequent-flyer points worth about C$1.9bn.

The agreement ends a contentious takeover battle that saw Aimia reject an earlier offer from Air Canada, which included a cash payment of C$250m and the assumption of roughly C$2bn of loyalty points.

Calin Rovinescu, the chief executive of Air Canada, said the deal would safeguard the miles of  millions of Canadians  who had used the Aeroplan programme. Air Canada is shifting to a new frequent flyer programme in 2020, a move that had weighed heavily on Aimia shares.

 Aeroplan members can continue to earn and redeem with confidence,  he said.  This transaction, if completed, should produce the best outcome for all stakeholders. 

The deal remains subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals. Aimia said that Mittleman Brothers LLC, the company s largest shareholder, had agreed to support the transaction and would vote in favour of it.

Mittleman Brothers added that the deal would provide Aimia with more than C$1bn in cash and what it characterised as a  significant  tax loss that it could use to reduce its tax burden in the future.

 We appreciate the board s efforts in pushing for a vastly improved valuation from the initial C$250m offered, a conditional figure that would have likely been decimated by adjustments,  the investment group said in a statement.

Aimia shares climbed 10 per cent on the news to C$4.23, while Air Canada shares advanced 7 per cent to C$26.35.

Battle with Tencent for market share in China has erased profitability

A blockbuster listing of Ant Financial, the fast-growing electronic payment affiliate of China s leading tech group Alibaba, has again been put on the back burner as it continues to burn cash and come under pressure from Beijing s crackdown on non-traditional financial institutions.

Ant was valued at $150bn in its last private fundraising in June, a round that bankers said paved the way for an initial public offering as early as this year.

Since then, however, the battle for China market share with the payments arm of rival Tencent has erased profitability and yet again bumped IPO plans further into the future. Two people familiar with the process said a listing was unlikely before the end of 2019, with one saying it was  years  away.

Ant Financial reported a loss in the first three months of the year, according to Alibaba s last earnings announcement. Alibaba will report second-quarter results on Thursday.

This year has already featured a string of listings by unprofitable but fast-growing Chinese start-ups and more are hoping to follow suit next year   including ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing, the second biggest private tech group after Uber, which it chased out of China in 2016.

Ant is also under pressure from Beijing s efforts to tighten control of non-traditional financial groups, whose rapid rise in recent years has encroached on the turf of state-owned banks.

 There are so many challenges to the business model of Ant and other non-banks,  said one analyst who requested anonymity.  I am not surprised that they once more are postponing their IPO. 

The decision to delay Ant s listing was made several months ago, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter. Since then, the business environment has continued to deteriorate while liquidity in China has tightened. Bankers also said that Ant, backed by deep-pocketed Alibaba, did not need to raise cash.

Ant said it had never had a timetable for listing, and played down the regulatory threats to its business.  A regulated and orderly market is good for players like us and we view compliance as a prerequisite to doing business,  said a spokesperson.  We have proactively engaged the regulators and they have been supportive of our efforts to promote financial inclusion. 

Despite its instance there was no timeframe for an IPO, investors in Ant s last funding round said they were told a public offering would follow later this year or next.

The crackdown on financial innovation by Chinese regulators has had a big impact on listed internet consumer lenders, whose share prices dropped more than 50 per cent from November to mid-July, according to a report from UBS.

 In the recent credit downgrade, delinquency rates have almost doubled,  UBS added. In the first half of 2018, about 600 peer-to-peer lenders closed, it calculated.

Ant is far from the only non-bank affected by the changing regulatory environment. Non-banks that began life as P2P lenders, such as Lufax and Dianrong, are delaying their plans to list as they scramble to diversify away from that line of business

 It isn t just Ant Financial, it is everyone,  says the head of one Chinese private equity firm.  Beijing is tightening financial regulation because they think the innovation has gone too far. It will take at least all of next year for these companies to recover. 

Ant and Tencent have both argued they differ from most non-banks because their use of big data gives them credit scoring superior to that of the banks. They also argued banks remained unwilling to do consumer lending beyond mortgages.

Ant s listing plans were originally put on ice last year, at which time it was valued at $60bn. Bankers and lawyers blamed the need to secure regulatory approval and to focus on building the business.

In February this year Alibaba restructured its relationship with Ant, jettisoning a profit-sharing arrangement in favour of a direct equity stake of 33 per cent. It followed that up with the $10bn funding round in June, which valued the group at $150bn.

Lu returns home to tap China's technological talent

Corporate person in the news Lu Qi China head, Y Combinator

Sam Altman, the founder of Y Combinator, the leading Silicon Valley start-up incubator, first met Lu Qi in 2005 when the Chinese-born technologist was at Yahoo   and Mr Altman was still a teenager.

This week, Mr Altman announced that he had hired Mr Lu to establish a beachhead in China for Y Combinator and help identify start-ups on the mainland to nurture and invest in.

"He will be perfectly aligned with founders of young companies," Mr Altman said, pointing to Mr Lu's approach to negotiation and dealing with young companies.

"He told me that his grandfather always said, 'never wipe the table clean. Always leave something for the other side.' Qi understands you need to put founders first. And he will build a brilliant company in China."

Mr Lu has never founded his own company, but he has had a brilliant career spearheading breakthroughs in artificial intelligence on both sides of the Pacific. After leaving Yahoo, he spent three years at Microsoft in Seattle   where Satya Nadella, chief executive, used to work for him.

His rise was also seen at home as evidence that a Chinese could make it in the best US companies.

When Mr Lu left to become chief operating officer at Baidu, one of China's leading internet companies, and moved to Beijing in 2017, many of his compatriots took it as confirmation of the ascendancy of their tech industry.

"China has a structural advantage in artificial intelligence development and commercialisation. Only China has the US combination of talent, risk capital, technology and the market," Mr Lu said last year.

When he left Baidu this year, it triggered a debate on Chinese social media. His departure seemed to imply shortcomings at one of China's homegrown giants and questions were raised about which other mainland company he might join instead, with Tencent a seemingly strong possibility.

Instead, he has chosen to take advantage of his links between both worlds to tap into the next generation of Chinese entrepreneurialism.

Mr Lu, 56, is one of the first of a generation of technologists who combine the best of both worlds. He dreamt of becoming a philosopher, then after touring a shipbuilding factory as a student, he decided that working there seemed a "most glamorous job. But only 3 per cent of students at the time made it to that type of school. I didn't weigh enough to meet their minimum requirement."

When he asked his parents if he should study maths or computer science instead, they advised him that the former would lead to a teaching career, but that technology might get him a job at a radio factory. The latter was more appealing.

He ended up studying computer science at the elite Fudan University in Shanghai, before going on to earn a PhD at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.

Mr Lu joined Yahoo, where he became head of search before joining Microsoft in 2013. His responsibilities there included running Bing, the company's search engine, and overseeing Office.

One of his projects involved working with his engineering team on a "backward-brain bicycle", which worked in the opposite to conventional bikes   if you wanted to turn left, you would have to turn right.

The team believed that the muscle memory required to learn how to adapt to the new bike might generate insights into how algorithms behave. Unfortunately though, Mr Lu broke a hip while on the bike and left Microsoft in part because the injury required several operations to repair.

Neither Mr Lu's arrival at Baidu nor his departure came as a surprise. Robin Li, chief executive of Baidu, is steeped in AI and has a long history of finding the best Chinese talent abroad and luring that talent back home.

But, although Mr Li gave Mr Lu responsibility for the company's initiatives in artificial intelligence and autonomous driving, he never provided the resources he needed to fulfil those responsibilities, according to people with knowledge of the matter both inside Baidu and outside.

At Y Combinator, Mr Lu will continue to bounce between both sides of the Pacific, spending half of his time in China and half in the US.

"I view myself as a piece of software," he said. "Tomorrow's version has to be better than today's. I don't want tomorrow to be the same as today." Henny Sender

The Woman Who Has a Plan for Wall Street to Help Cure Blindness; Karen Petrou spent years trying to hide her blindness. Now she has come up with a plan to get private investors to bankroll a cure.

By Christina Rexrode

Karen Petrou, an influential adviser to bankers and regulators, has made a career of deciphering complicated financial regulations. Now she's trying to decode another type of puzzle.

The conundrum: Matching medical researchers who need money with investors who have it. A bill outlining her strategy, which would include a government guarantee, was introduced in the House of Representatives last month.

Her goal, to cure blindness, is lofty, and her crusade is personal. Though Ms. Petrou, who runs policy-analysis firm Federal Financial Analytics Inc., consumes dense regulatory tomes faster than perhaps anyone in Washington, it has been years since she could see.

Ms. Petrou, 65, is unsentimental about finance, where the sharp contours of profit trump the squishy metrics of doing good. But she also believes that pension funds, insurers and others will invest in her so-called Eye Bonds if they can make money doing it. The plan, which she designed with her husband and business partner, Basil, envisions a five-year pilot that would finance up to $1 billion in loans for organizations doing early-stage research on blindness.

"In the scheme of Wall Street, it's lunch money anyway," Ms. Petrou said. "And maybe it appeals to what's left of their heartstrings."

Under their proposal, labs and others would get a stamp of approval for projects deemed promising by the National Eye Institute, a designation that could help them line up loans.

The lenders would sell the loans to an Eye Bond Trust administered by financial institutions that would package and sell the loans to investors she envisions 10-year bonds. Investors would be repaid both the principal and interest when the bonds mature, and if a lab's project turned into a commercial success, the investors could get equity. A government guarantee would partially protect investors if the labs couldn't repay.

Ms. Petrou grew up in a liberal-leaning home in Westchester County, to an artist mother and book-publisher father. As a child, she once challenged the rabbi teaching her Sunday school class to "an intellectual disputation," said her mother, Blanche Dolmatch. As a teenager, she donned a Colonial dress and mobcap to give tours of Philipsburg Manor in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y.

"She was always good at making speeches and instructing on things, and blowing off intellectual steam," Mrs. Dolmatch said.

In high school, Ms. Petrou was diagnosed with retinitis pigmentosa, a disorder that causes gradual vision loss. "We just kind of staggered out of the place," Mrs. Dolmatch recalled.

Within a few years, acquaintances complained that Ms. Petrou didn't say hi when she passed them. Her peripheral vision was failing.

At the same time, she was working on a doctorate in political science at the University of California, Berkeley. But she took a job in banking, figuring it would offer more opportunities for women than academia.

For a while, it did, and Ms. Petrou rose through the ranks in political analysis and public affairs at San Francisco-based BankAmerica Corp. When she was 32, the CEO told her he wasn't comfortable promoting a young woman to senior vice president, according to Ms. Petrou. She left soon after.

Since then, she has built out her firm and gained a reputation for knowing the minutiae of esoteric regulations and their big-picture repercussions. Both banks and regulators hire her to provide a nonpartisan analysis of the potential effects of new policies. "I'm not coming up with loopholes," Ms. Petrou said.

Rodgin Cohen, senior chairman of Sullivan & Cromwell LLP, met Ms. Petrou in the early 1990s when they worked on the merger of Mellon Bank Corp. and Dreyfus Corp., a controversial proposal at the time because it combined a bank and a mutual-fund business.

"She gave a very broad-based view of everything that was going on how the regulators would work, how Congress would react, and how the media would react," Mr. Cohen said. "It was typical of her approach and forthrightness."

Along the way, Ms. Petrou's sight continued to deteriorate. She lost her reading vision six months after starting her firm. Wary of being pitied or stereotyped, she would tell people she couldn't see a menu because she had lost a contact lens.

Today, she is almost completely blind, though many of her clients don't know until her German shepherd guide dog, Zuni, trundles into their boardroom. She ingests volumes of ponderous regulatory documents by listening to screen-reading software at 400 words a minute, pausing to type her analysis for clients.

"If you are going to challenge Karen on a fact, you better be right," said Pete Mills, who worked for Ms. Petrou and is now head of residential public policy for the Mortgage Bankers Association. "You can't get anything by her."

In recent years, Ms. Petrou has "https://economicequality.blog/" about the widening gap between rich and poor, including her belief that postcrisis government policy has exacerbated the problem. In a lecture to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York this year, she scolded central bankers for years of ultralow interest rates. Her take: The policy has boosted the stock market, which benefits investors, but harmed families trying to set aside savings.

With Eye Bonds, the Petrous aren't looking to reinvent themselves but to be heard on a different issue. They believe the obstacle to curing blindness isn't a lack of science but a lack of funding. Though it is early days for Eye Bonds, they hope their structure or something similar could be applied to other diseases.

"People always say, 'Why is this for blindness?'" Ms. Petrou said. "And I say, 'Well, I'm blind, so let's start with that.'"

DE Shaw taps academic to set up new machine learning  group

DE Shaw, the $50bn quantitative hedge fund founded above a Marxist bookshop, has hired a prominent academic in the field of artificial intelligence to set up a new research group dedicated to machine learning   one of the hottest subjects in finance.

The New York hedge fund group founded by David Shaw in 1988 is one of the best-known and respected members of the rapidly swelling  quant  industry, which uses computers and complex algorithms to trawl through financial markets in search for profitable patterns to mine.

DE Shaw has long used artificial intelligence techniques such as  machine learning  to trade, but the new independent unit led by Pedro Domingos   a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Washington   will have a wider-ranging research brief.

 This new, independent venture reflects the importance we attach to gaining fresh perspectives and insights as technology evolves,  Eric Wepsic, a DE Shaw managing director who oversees the hedge fund s quantitative trading and investments, said in a statement.  It also provides us with an opportunity to bring in some of the brightest lights in the field and allow them to set their own research agenda. 

Machine learning, which in simple terms consists of algorithms that can learn and develop over time as they are fed new data, is a popular tool to find patterns in enormous digital data sets, often dubbed  Big Data .

These can range from microsecond-level data of stock market trading to the blizzard of daily credit card purchases, satellite images of industrial sites or social media chatter. The world s annual data generation is now roughly doubling annually, and the overall size will reach 44 zettabytes (or trillions of gigabytes) by 2020, according to a study by International Data Corporation.

While only 17 per cent of investors surveyed by Greenwich Associates are currently using some form of AI, 56 per cent plan to integrate it into their investment process, and 40 per cent expect to ramp up spending in the area.

Insured Against Cyber Theft? Maybe Not

By Kim S. Nash

First there was cyber crime, then cyber insurance. Now come court battles over which crimes and hacker tactics insurance will cover.

Cyber insurance can be purchased as an add-on to risk and other business coverage or as a standalone policy. Security officers and finance and legal executives who negotiate with insurance companies must understand that cyber-specific coverage is an immature sector compared to other forms of insurance, says Adam Ziffer, a principal in McKool Smith's insurance recovery litigation practice.

Cyber criminals can change methods quickly, leaving insurers and customers uncertain as to what situations are covered, he says. Much of this is getting sorted out in court, he says. "There's a disconnect between what policies cover and how frauds occur."

A 2013 suit filed by seafood company Aqua Star against Travelers Casualty and Surety Company of America is instructive. A hacker used email to trick an Aqua Star employee to wire hundreds of thousands of dollars to foreign bank accounts. Travelers denied the claim saying damages from "authorized" transactions were not covered. That is, the employee had the appropriate credentials to wire funds; it was no matter that the transaction happened because a criminal faked email messages. In 2016, a U.S. district court in Washington ruled for the insurer.

A similar case last year in New York involving fraudulent email sent to an employee at clinical trials firm Medidata Solutions Inc. went the opposite way, with Federal Insurance Co. covering damages.

Disputes are likely to increase because there is no settled law yet, Mr. Ziffer said in an interview with WSJ Pro Cybersecurity. After relevant verdicts, insurers sometimes rewrite policy language to reflect a judge's opinion and tighten holes, he said. Here are edited excerpts of the conversation.

Q: Skeptical people will say that insurance companies deny claims often because they don't want to pay.

A: That may be true but the court is supposed to take an ambiguous policy and identify the reasonable expectations of the policy holder. You hope that common sense plays a role.

Q: What are the standard clauses to watch out for?

A: This industry is somewhat immature. What you're seeing in these disputes is insurance companies have not been able to anticipate all the types of fraud they can expect. Same with policyholders. There's a disconnect between how these frauds occur and what the policies cover.

Q: What can companies do?

A: You can try to have some type of choice among a couple policies and evaluate which is providing you with the broadest coverage. A lot of time, policyholders are focused more on premium than the language.

Q: Cyber insurance is relatively young. Is every case now a test case?

A: That's right. What happens is, when insurance companies get a bad decision, they have the ability to change language in the policy that they sell the next year. If you presume their goal is to restrict coverage, they will try to win cases and when they don't, they can change the language in policies. We've seen some policies become more restrictive in language in response to court decisions.

Q: Is cyber insurance very lucrative for insurance companies, compared to other forms of business insurance?

A: I don't know. I do know that they're selling it like crazy. Everybody's concerned about cyber risk. This is one of the only tools to manage it. The insurance industry typically makes money on the insurance it sells. There's a lot of it being sold. These losses [from cyber crime] are very, very difficult to recover from the perpetrators. So insurance becomes the only way to see relief.

Firms Battle Privacy Concerns, Compliance With Double-Digit Increase In Security Budgets

By Adam Janofsky

Privacy concerns, skills shortages and new regulations are pushing companies to spend more on cybersecurity tools and services, according to new research from Gartner Inc.

Global spending on cybersecurity will reach $114 billion in 2018, a 12.4% increase from last year, according to the report released Wednesday by the research firm. Privacy concerns will drive at least 10% of that demand through 2019, the report found.

Companies are expected to increase their spending on privacy tools such as identity and access management and data loss prevention to comply with new laws like the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May, according to Gartner research director Siddharth Deshpande.

Data Worries Push Spending Higher: The cost of complying with these laws would be a fraction of the penalties for violations. For example, companies that fail to comply with GDPR could face fines up to  20 million ($22.7 million) or 4% of their annual revenue. About 60% of companies said they would spend at least $1 million on GDPR compliance, and 12% said they would spend more than $10 million, according to a survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP in the fall of 2017.

Spending on data security and privacy tools may also increase as companies including Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc. come under increased scrutiny by lawmakers, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulators for how they handle customer data and deal with cyber threats.

In a November earnings call, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said his company would double security staff by the end of 2018 and develop artificial intelligence technologies to better detect cyberattacks. Law enforcement officials and cybersecurity specialists have said the platform was used to spread misinformation during the 2016 presidential election.

"I am dead serious about this & I've directed our teams to invest so much in security on top of the other investments we're making that it will significantly impact our profitability going forward," Mr. Zuckerberg said on the earnings call, The Wall Street Journal reported at the time.

Cybersecurity executives at M&T Bank Corp., Fair Isaac Corp. and U.S. Bancorp have said boards and senior management have been willing to pad cybersecurity budgets with the hope that it will help them avoid a major incident like the one Equifax Inc. revealed in September 2017, in which sensitive data about 147.9 million consumers was compromised.

 Something has gone horribly wrong': "The very first time I was introduced to our CEO, he asked me one question," said Jason Witty, executive vice president and chief information security officer at U.S. Bank, a unit of U.S. Bancorp, at a June cybersecurity summit in New York. "He looked me dead in the eye and said,  Are we spending enough on information security?'"

Mr. Witty responded that the bank was spending at an acceptable level, and added that CEOs, CFOs and CIOs should be asking this question regularly to make sure there is an adequate security budget.

"If you're going to the board and asking for funding, something has gone horribly wrong," he said.

*********************************

White House Scraps Cyberattack Planning Policy

President Trump has reversed an Obama-era memorandum dictating how and when the U.S. government can deploy cyberweapons against its adversaries, the Journal's Dustin Volz reports.

Loosening restrictions. "The change was described as an  offensive step forward' by an administration official briefed on the decision, one intended to help support military operations, deter foreign election influence and thwart intellectual property theft by meeting such threats with more forceful responses." Mr. Volz reports.

What happens next? Former Obama officials said the framework was designed to help the government consider all possible outcomes before launching a cyberattack. "I am sympathetic to trying to make our cyber capabilities more nimble in their use," said Joshua Geltzer, who was senior director of counterterrorism at the National Security Council until March of last year. "On the other hand, there were some very real and hard legal questions associated with cyber about what operations the government would take that still have not been resolved."

*********************************

Quotable

"I believe Trump's presidency will be as defined by cybersecurity as much as George W. Bush's presidency was defined by terrorism."

-- Tag Cyber CEO Ed Amoroso, speaking Wednesday at Security Summit New York, organized by the Information Security Media Group

FBI investigates cyberattack on California Democrat. U.S. law enforcement is probing a series of cyberattacks against Hans Keirstead, a Democrat who ran in a primary for Rep. Dana Rohrabacher's (R.,Calif.) congressional seat, Rolling Stone magazine reports. Mr. Rohrabacher, a 15-term incumbent, is one of Capitol Hill's most outspoken backers of Moscow, according to Rolling Stone. The attack began in August 2017 with a successful phishing attempt. "It is clear from speaking with campaign professionals around the country that the sustained attacks the Keirstead for Congress campaign faced were not unique but have become the new normal for political campaigns in 2018," Mr. Keirstead's former campaign manager told Rolling Stone.

Mortgage Probe Gathers Steam

Owners of an apartment complex near Pittsburgh, who wanted to take out a mortgage on the buildings, allegedly made vacant units look occupied by turning on radios, placing shoes and mats outside doors and in one instance having a woman tell inspectors her boyfriend was asleep inside.

The owners obtained a $45.8 million loan, which was wrapped into mortgage securities and sold to investors.

Practices such as these -- which were alleged in a federal search-warrant application -- have sparked one of the largest mortgage-fraud investigations since the financial crisis. It focuses on whether income from commercial properties was falsified, a move that would enable owners to get larger mortgages and take out cash or expand their businesses faster.

Still in its early stages, the investigation has so far yielded a fraud-conspiracy indictment against four real-estate executives in upstate New York. Loans that some or all of them were involved with totaled about $170 million, the indictment alleges.

Investigators have sought mortgage data on dozens of other apartment buildings, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal and interviews with people familiar with the probe. Investigators have looked at student housing and self-storage facilities in addition to apartment complexes.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the U.S. attorney in the Western District of New York in Buffalo and the Federal Housing Finance Agency's Inspector General are all working on the probe.

Lax and fraudulent lending on single-family homes played a role in the mid-2000s housing bubble. The 2010 Dodd-Frank financial overhaul required home borrowers to document their income, and home lenders to verify it.

The rule doesn't apply to multifamily housing. Lenders in that market generally don't examine every lease to check income. Neither do Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored firms that buy and securitize loans. Credit-rating firms generally don't review loans for fraud.

"All the systems will work fine as long as people are being honest," said Sam Berns, senior vice president at NorthMarq Capital LLC, a firm licensed to sell multifamily mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. If borrowers or their mortgage brokers choose, they can easily submit and certify false numbers, he said. "It's a fault and a failure within the system."

One owner of properties investigators reviewed is Robert C. Morgan, the founder of a suburban Rochester, N.Y.-based apartment development company. After a 1991 shooting at his family's seafood store left him wheelchair-bound, he turned his full attention to real estate and built a business of more than 140 properties across 14 states, according to its website.

It was at a Morgan property near Pittsburgh called Rochester Village that a May 22 indictment in federal court in Buffalo alleged the faking of occupancy via radios playing in vacant units.

In addition, an executive anticipating an inspection of one building asked a property manager to have employees park their cars in its garage, according to the search-warrant application.

Deutsche Bank AG had just backed out of a deal to finance the property, suspecting occupancy was misrepresented, according to the document. The owner then obtained a loan via Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC, which sold the loan to Freddie Mac.

Deutsche Bank and Berkadia declined to comment.

In another instance, a mortgage broker allegedly created a fake $1.4 million loan on a Morgan complex near Rochester, N.Y., called Avon Commons, the indictment alleged, after which Mr. Morgan's firm refinanced the fake loan with a real one for $6.3 million. The loan was from Arbor Realty Trust, which sold it to Freddie Mac, the indictment said.

Arbor didn't comment on the investigation but said it is "committed to strengthening and improving our policies."

The indictment leveled fraud-conspiracy charges against Todd and Kevin Morgan, a son and a nephew, respectively, of Robert C. Morgan. It also charged their mortgage brokers, Frank Giacobbe and Patrick Ogiony of Aurora Capital Advisors LLC, a Buffalo firm the indictment said Mr. Giacobbe owned.

All pleaded not guilty. Mr. Giacobbe had no comment. Lawyers for Mr. Ogiony and Kevin Morgan didn't respond to requests for comment. Todd Morgan's lawyer said his client maintains he is innocent.

The indictment didn't charge Robert Morgan or his firm, until June called Morgan Management LLC. It has changed its name to Grand Atlas Property Management, and Mr. Morgan has no ownership or employment at the firm, according to a lawyer for Grand Atlas. The lawyer also said Kevin and Todd Morgan are no longer employees.

Robert Morgan and Grand Atlas declined to comment on the investigation.

About $1.2 billion of Morgan loans currently back Freddie Mac-issued mortgage securities and $350 million back Fannie Mae securities, according to a Journal analysis of Thomson Reuters loan data.

Fannie Mae, in a training course on its website, says, "Multifamily mortgage fraud continues to be a problem nationwide." The firm said that statement "does not mean to suggest that these issues routinely appear in Fannie Mae loans" or with its lenders.

Freddie Mac said it doesn't rely just on information submitted by borrowers but also uses third-party data and analytics. It said all Morgan loans packaged into its securities remain current.

Borrowers can stay current even on loans that are large relative to a property's earning power if they need to pay only the interest for several years. Mortgages with full or partial interest-only repayment periods made up about 75% of multifamily loans bought by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac last year, according to data from Trepp LLC, a commercial-mortgage tracker.

FBI agents have reviewed deals involving several upstate New York developers with ties to Robert Morgan and to Mr. Giacobbe. One of them, according to documents reviewed by the Journal, is Prime Group Holdings, a Saratoga Springs-based owner of self-storage facilities founded by Robert J. Moser. Prime has worked with Mr. Giacobbe. Mr. Moser said that he and Robert Morgan "enjoyed a very successful business relationship for many years."

Until last year, a Moser biography that was on the websites of both Mr. Moser's and Mr. Morgan's companies said the two men had together acquired a $4 billion commercial real-estate portfolio. In an email, Mr. Moser said only some of the deals involved Mr. Morgan. He said he stopped doing business with Mr. Morgan ahead of the FBI probe.

Asked about Mr. Moser's account, Mr. Morgan replied that it wasn't correct, but declined to elaborate.

Mr. Moser hasn't been accused of any wrongdoing. He said his attorneys asked the Justice Department whether his transactions were being reviewed and were "told just the opposite."

Barbara Burns, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney pursuing the probe, said that, in general, "that is a question that we would decline to answer."

Investigators also have examined properties owned by Thomas Masaschi of DHD Ventures and Brett Fitzpatrick of Somerset Companies, both of whom have sometimes invested with Mr. Morgan and worked with Mr. Giacobbe, according to documents and people familiar with their deals. Another developer whose properties have been scrutinized, Matthew Cherry of Glendale Development, used to work at Mr. Giacobbe's Aurora Capital Advisors.

Like Mr. Moser, the three men haven't been accused of wrongdoing, and it is possible investigators are interested not in the property owners but in other parties involved.

Mr. Cherry said, "We do not believe Glendale is involved in the matter," and "I have not been associated with Aurora in more than 5 years." Mr. Fitzpatrick declined to comment. Mr. Masaschi didn't respond to requests for comment.

Delinquencies on multifamily-housing loans have been minimal. Still, investors can take a hit if properties produce less than expected. That appears likely in one deal that caught the interest of federal investigators: Monarch 815, a 176-unit student-housing complex near East Tennessee State University, which was developed by Mr. Masaschi's firm.

When the firm obtained a $31.9 million mortgage on it in 2015, financial information provided to lenders suggested the complex could have net income of about $2.7 million annually, according to Trepp. It earned only $804,266 in 2017, Trepp data show.

The loan, packaged into securities, is in foreclosure, according to Trepp. Mr. Masaschi, a managing partner at his firm, didn't respond to written questions.

Two Morgan-linked mortgages totaling $45 million were transferred to a special servicer for handling, according to disclosures the servicer filed last month. It said they face "imminent default."

Once-Hot Lithium Attracts Bears

One of the hottest investments of 2017 is now a big short.

Investors have reaped gains this year from short bets on companies that produce lithium -- a commodity used in the batteries that power electric vehicles and smartphones.

Lithium prices soared last year on expectations that growth in demand would lead to a shortage in supply.

But so far in 2018, stocks of lithium companies have tumbled after Morgan Stanley raised concerns that producers will ramp up output too quickly.

Investors who had short bets have been rewarded by the slump. Short bets against eight of the most actively traded lithium companies already have generated more than $550 million in profits this year, according to an analysis by financial technology and analytics firm S3 Partners based on stock prices through Monday.

"It's been a home run trade -- there's no question about it," said Chris Berry, founder of House Mountain Partners LLC, a New York-based adviser to battery-metals companies and investors.

Bullish projections for consumption made lithium and cobalt two of the market's darlings last year, but sentiment quickly turned after Morgan Stanley called for oversupply in lithium in February.

Now, analysts say prices of materials for batteries have plunged in China, which dominates the battery market. Worries have intensified that changes to China's electric-vehicle subsidy policies will lead to lower demand.

The Global X Lithium and Battery Tech ETF -- a popular ETF that allows investors to bet on the industry -- is down 19% so far in 2018. That is a reversal from its 59% rally last year.

Some of the largest producers in the world including Chilean firm Sociedad Quimica & Minera De Chile SA and U.S. firm Albemarle have tumbled more than 25%. Small lithium companies have fared even worse, in some cases shedding up to 70%.

Some companies and investors remain bullish on the lithium market: SoftBank Group Corp. and Tesla Inc. are among the large technology and auto companies that have recently done deals to secure lithium supply.

That hasn't dented the bearish outlook of some investors and traders. They are betting losses in the lithium market will continue.

Short positions make up more than 18% of outstanding shares of Albemarle and Australian firms Galaxy Resources Ltd. and Orocobre Ltd., according to data from IHS Markit. That is up from an average of 7.5% at the start of the year.

"There's a disconnect there for sure, and the question now is, 'What changes the sentiment?' " Mr. Berry said.

Banks Will Lose Patrons' Trust Via Facebook

Facebook is asking large U.S. banks for their customers' detailed transaction information ("Facebook Asks Banks for Customer Data," page one, Aug. 7). That may seem like a win-win. But there's a catch. In the financial industry, trust between a client and his or her provider is of primary importance. You can't sell a customer's banking data in the same way you sell his or her internet surfing behavior.

We believe it is now or never to define the principles on the use of customer data. The World Economic Forum, working with the finance industry, believes the principles should be: Customers control their data, not the companies collecting them. If banks want to share them with social media or others, they should attain customer consent. And, to make consent meaningful, companies need to provide clear and accessible information; consent as a "tick-of-the-box" is meaningless. Finally, companies should allow customers to access, download, transfer and permit third parties to manage data about them.

In all of this, the line between customer and company ownership of data is who generates them. Personal info and credit-card transactions should be owned by customers. Insights derived from them by big data and proprietary technology should be owned by the financial-service provider.

The EU's General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act are part of a necessary start. It's now time for other legislators, including Congress, to put their chips on the table. If not now, it will soon be too late.

Nielsen Should Get a Break From the Market; TV ratings firm has struggled as a public company but a breakup won't solve its problems

For ratings and data giant Nielsen Holdings , life in the public markets has proven difficult. A return to private-equity ownership makes sense, but the company shouldn't be broken up.

Activist hedge fund Elliott Management"https://www.wsj.com/articles/activist-elliott-management-to-push-nielsen-holdings-to-sell-1534131900" it has taken an 8.4% stake in Nielsen, worth around $660 million, and will encourage the company to look at strategic options including a sale. Private-equity buyers, stuffed with cash and eager to put it to work, have expressed interest, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.

Nielsen has two segments a near-monopoly media and television rating business, which it calls its "watch" business, and a business that tracks purchases of groceries and other consumer goods, called "buy."

This latter business has been the weak spot. In July Nielsen "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nielsen-ceo-to-leave-at-end-of-year-1532603179" saw revenue decline by 5.4% from a year earlier in the second quarter in constant currency terms. Nielsen also "https://www.wsj.com/articles/nielsen-ceo-to-leave-at-end-of-year-1532603179", and that it is examining options for the "buy" business that might include a sale. In response, shares fell 25% in a single day.

Nielsen blamed disruption in the consumer-goods industry. Makers of packaged food and household products like tissues and cleansers are being hit by rapid shifts in consumer tastes and rising e-commerce alternatives to traditional retail. Elliott however believes Nielsen is also losing market share to smaller data provider IRI , due in part to underinvestment in data automation and analytics, according to a person familiar with the matter.

The truth is likely somewhere in between. Companies from Campbell Soup to Kimberly Clark are under pressure to cut costs, though at the same time they need market data more than ever to make accurate judgments about consumer trends. For many companies, this may mean they are simply ordering fewer categories of data, or opting for less frequent updates.

Nielsen's data is still the gold standard for the industry, and is far more international than IRI 's.

The next question is if it makes sense to hive off the "buy" business. One reason to keep them together is they have the same clients. To plan advertising campaigns, clients like Coca-Cola need to know not only what media is being watched, but also what products are selling and to whom. A breakup of the company would cause these natural synergies to be lost.

In addition, the "buy" business may not fetch a great valuation on its own. Private-equity buyers will be attracted to the steady cash generation of the lucrative ratings business.

Nielsen was owned by a consortium of private-equity firms, including Blackstone, Carlyle and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts , from 2006 to 2011. They had a mixed track record, adding debt and posting no annual operating profits until 2010, but also growing revenue by 31% over four years.

After listing in 2011, shares initially fared well but have fallen nearly 40% over the past 12 months. Until its rally this week on news of the Elliott stake, Nielsen shares were below the initial public offering price of $23.

Putting Nielsen in private hands would give the company some breathing room, but any deal should keep watch and buy together.

China's flourishing biotech start-ups look to be 'true innovators'

INSIDE BUSINESS ASIA

H an Yusheng, a Chinese entrepreneur with a background in biology, established Burning Rock to promote the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer, especially lung cancer, using next-generation sequencing-based diagnostics in 2014 with the help of venture capital firms including Sequoia Capital China.

Mr Han was an early mover in what has become among the hottest areas in venture capital: biotech. Last year, such start-ups, broadly defined, raised almost $40bn, while their financiers invested almost $12bn in the sector, according to data from McKinsey. While venture capital inflows into other tech sectors have slowed, $32bn has been raised and $7.8bn invested in biotech in the first half of the year, suggesting 2018 will break last year's record, the investment bank China Renaissance in Beijing calculates. International private equity firms such as General Atlantic and Warburg Pincus have also become big investors in the sector.

There are good reasons for the continued enthusiasm for mainland biotech. Many scientists believe the next generation of medical breakthroughs will come from what Kenneth Oye, director of the Program on Emerging technologies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, refers to as the blurring of the line between information technology and biotechnology.

Still, "the key question is whether Chinese start-ups can make the transition from being fast followers to true innovators," says Kevin Xie, co-founder of China Renaissance and head of its life science division, which tracks 200 biotech mainland start-ups. Mr Han says: "The gap is large with the US in basic research. But there is so much talent and opportunity in China. In life sciences, we can catch up. The technological gap with the US is disappearing."

Today, it is accepted wisdom that early detection and treatment for diseases such as cancer will come from applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to the personal health data of large numbers of people   and China has more such data with fewer constraints on access to it than any other country.

China does not have the same level of concern China is gradually building an eco-system modelled on the US. Among the prerequisites are government incentives and funding, appropriate regulation, human capital, vibrant venture capital, links between university research labs and the private sector, and adequate reimbursement for innovation, according to Ben Shobert, the founder of Rubicon Strategy Group and a healthcare expert at the National Bureau of Asian Research.

with regards to privacy as the US Moreover, Chinese regulators "are moving in a better direction," says Mr Han. This is in contrast to over a decade ago when the then head of the Chinese equivalent of the Federal Drug Administration, Zheng Xiaoyu, was executed for corruption. China is also improving its protection of intellectual property rights.

There is also a darker side to Chinese life sciences, however. China does not have the same level of concern over privacy as the US. If US regulators consider (as they do) that financial data jeopardises national security, the need to protect medical data on US citizens is even more critical.

In addition, there are far fewer constraints on human trials and the current scandal over vaccines in China is merely the latest in a series of such scandals.

These are among the reasons why the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (Cfius) is increasingly targeting life sciences in its scrutiny of Chinese money going to the US. Indeed, such initiatives remain one of the biggest clouds on the horizon for innovation in the life sciences.

There are few sectors where the US and China are as closely intertwined as in life sciences. Cross border research and development deals involving Chinese biotech companies have risen by 70 per cent since 2012, according to Mr Shobert. Licensing is one key area of co-operation.

The pipeline was once just one way, with companies such as Pfizer and Celgene licensing drugs to Chinese companies such as Fosun Pharma. But in the past year China was the recipient of drugs in 27 cases, but in four others, mainland companies such as Wuxi Biologics and BeiGene licensed their products to companies including Celgene, data from McKinsey show. Moreover, many US pharma firms, including Eli Lilly, have venture arms in China that provide both funding and scientists to mainland start-ups.

Sadly, Cfius and politics mean more clouds over prevention and early detection of disease.

Hackers Target Medical Data as Health Care Industry Is Slow to Change

By Adam Janofsky

Cybercriminals increasingly are targeting health-care organizations because they hold data that's particularly valuable, often have weak cybersecurity measures in place and are slow to change, according to cybersecurity specialists.

Additionally, the organizations that are most at-risk are the ones that have been breached in the past, a new study finds.

Health-care organizations are struggling with a surge in attacks because regulations and financial constraints make them slow to respond to cyber threats, said George Gray, chief technology officer at Ivenix Inc., a medical device manufacturer.

About 3.14 million patient records were breached in 142 separate incidents between April and June, according to a recent examination of data breaches by Protenus Inc., a health-care compliance analytics firm. That's almost three times larger than the number of patient records compromised in the first quarter of 2018, when 1.13 million records were affected, the study found.

Department of Health and Human Services data from July suggests that trend is continuing, with 31 incidents placing about 860,000 patient records at risk during that month, according to Jim DeGraw, a partner at Ropes & Gray LLP and co-leader of its Digital Health Initiative.

In July, Laboratory Corp. of America, one of the world's largest commercial lab-testing companies, took portions of its network offline after it was hit by ransomware, according to The Wall Street Journal. Hackers reportedly demanded $6,000 in bitcoin to unlock each encrypted machine, and a person familiar with the matter told the Journal LabCorp opted to replace affected devices instead of paying the ransom.

"This is a bad time for [health-care cybersecurity]. Anyone who doesn't think so hasn't looked at the statistics," said Alan Brill, senior managing director at risk-consulting firm Kroll Inc.

Repeat victims. Nearly 30% of violations involved repeat victims, the Protenus study found. The study, which was released late last week, relied on data from HHS, press reports and proprietary nonpublic data from Protenus' platform.

Such a significant percentage of health-care companies getting hit more than once is surprising because, in most industries, a breach generally leads to changes that improve security and prevent future incidents, said Mr. DeGraw. These changes may include hiring a new chief information security officer, conducting an internal security audit, purchasing more cybersecurity tools and training employees how to spot attacks.

If a health-care organization is breached, it might signal to other hackers that the organization is vulnerable, Mr. Brill said. Additionally, these organizations' data security programs are often underfunded and understaffed, he said.

Need for encryption. Health-care companies often don't back up and encrypt files, which makes them particularly vulnerable to attacks such as ransomware, which involves locking up data and demanding payment to release them, said Mr. Gray.

Businesses that hold sensitive patient data can protect themselves by encrypting their devices and data, regularly backing up their systems and training and monitoring their staff, said Mr. Brill. These three measures would reduce the risk of the most common cyber threats these organizations face: stolen devices, ransomware and insider threats.

The biggest reason why hackers target health-care organizations is because patient records are significantly more valuable than other types of data, said Mr. DeGraw. Patient records might include payment information and personal details, such as Social Security numbers, in addition to medical data, he said.

"Health care is the most expensive place to be sitting, and we're seeing in the medical space a lot of large breaches with a lot of records compromised," said Mr. DeGraw.

Backups are crucial. Mr. Brill said boards and senior management should ensure that their organizations have a regular system of backing-up data, which allows them to recover from ransomware incidents like the one at LabCorp.

"It's hard to recover if you don't have good backup, and because you don't have good backup you're more likely to be targeted because you'll have to pay to get into operation again," he said.

Aetna Security Chief Wants to Automate Red-Team Attack Tests to Save Money, Time

By Jeff Stone

Businesses that hire outside ethical hackers to simulate weeks-long attacks on their companies can uncover security vulnerabilities that full-time staffers missed. Known as red teaming, these exercises can yield lessons on issues ranging from physical security weaknesses to identifying the executives who are most susceptible to phishing attacks.

Health-care provider Aetna Inc. each quarter conducts such exercises, with red team outsiders working with the company's own "blue team" cybersecurity specialists, said Jim Routh, Aetna's chief security officer. The tests typically last for one week, Mr. Routh said. The tests, he said, also help Aetna's team practice responding to attacks.

"Incident response is more important as a component of enterprise resilience because incidents are becoming more common, and the threat landscape is changing," he said.

Aetna now is exploring ways to automate these exercises and reduce the number of people involved. Instead of having 10 people spend a week trying to infiltrate Aetna's environment, for example, he'd hire fewer and use software tools to focus on Aetna's highest-risk areas. He hopes that the exercises will become simpler to do more often, helping the health-care provider more quickly defend against the latest threats, he told WSJ Pro Cybersecurity.

Here are edited excerpts from that conversation.

Q: How do these security tests work now?

A: We might simulate a phishing attack on a privileged user, then [simulate] a lateral movement using something like Cobalt Strike or Mimikatz, which are commercial hacking tools. Then we set up IT assets in our environment, and do a phishing attack on our internal user.

Q: Why would it be helpful to automate those processes?

A: We can do this more frequently. We want to make this part of our normal environment, where we use these tests daily or monthly. It will give us an opportunity to practice our incident response process across the enterprise, and that's a way everybody can learn.

Q: How do you see savings from automation?

A: It might be somewhere around 10 people on the red team now. The blue team could have as many as 20 people involved on the inside doing the incident response. There's also a handful of IT folks involved in setting up the test effectively. If you multiply all of that by a week, it gets pretty expensive. We've done a couple recent automated exercises where there were one [or two] people involved part time to set it up. Once the incident takes hold, there's then six or seven people involved in the response. The more you can go through these scenarios without a huge amount of labor, there's an economic savings and you can run through these scenarios more frequently. From our standpoint, it's a way of improving the effectiveness of incident response.

WHOIS Scares: Will GDPR Lead to Inadvertent Uptick in Cyber Crime?

By Catherine Stupp

Law enforcement authorities and cybersecurity researchers have warned for months that domain name registrars might start to withhold data from the WHOIS system, which identifies registered domain name users, in order to comply with European Union privacy rules.

The General Data Protection Regulation has been in effect for just under three months, and already there are signs that website registrars are sharing less data, Caleb Barlow, IBM's vice president for threat intelligence, told WSJ Pro Cybersecurity.

He predicts an uptick in cyber attacks because criminals will realize that their data is no longer public, and that it could therefore be harder for companies and law enforcement authorities to investigate breaches.

"Now, a bad guy gets access to a system, gets access to data, does what they'll do, realizes they've been caught but then also realizes they've probably got a couple of weeks or a month or two before they get shut off because the responders can't move that quickly," he added.

"What's happening on actual breach responses in Europe is they're being significantly slowed down because of these extra steps we have to take," Barlow said.

Companies may soon find it more difficult to monitor their networks and infrastructure if they no longer have access to security and personal data that was previously available in public WHOIS databases.

"Winter is coming," he warned.

ICANN, the non-profit organization that manages the domain name system, currently is tangled up in a legal fight after a German registrar announced that it would sell domain names without collecting personal WHOIS data from users. ICANN requires registrars to collect data identifying domain name users. The German registrar EPAG challenged that requirement and said it would be a violation of the GDPR.

"It may be some time before we're able to do that but we do believe that at some point, we will be able to quantify either breaches that occurred and say, hey this could've been avoided had it not been for GDPR, or be able to quantify the overall increase in volume," he said.

China biotech looks to make leap from  fast followers 

Developing eco-system and access to health data should be a boon to development

Han Yusheng, a Chinese entrepreneur with a background in biology, established Burning Rock to promote the early diagnosis and treatment of cancer, especially lung cancer, using next-generation sequencing-based diagnostics in 2014 with the help of venture capital firms including Sequoia Capital China.

Mr Han was an early mover in what has become among the hottest areas in venture capital: biotech. Last year, such start-ups, broadly defined, raised almost $40bn while their financiers invested almost $12bn in the sector, according to data from McKinsey. And while venture inflows into other tech sectors have slowed, $32bn has already been raised and $7.8bn invested in biotech in the first half of the year, suggesting 2018 will break last year s record, Beijing-based investment bank China Renaissance calculates. International private equity firms such as General Atlantic and Warburg Pincus have also become big investors in the sector.

There are good reasons for the continued enthusiasm for mainland biotech. Many scientists believe the next generation of medical breakthroughs will come from what Kenneth Oye, director of the programme on emerging technologies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, refers to as the blurring of the line between information technology and biotechnology.

Still,  the key question going forward is whether Chinese start-ups can make the transition from being fast followers to true innovators,  says Kevin Xie, co-founder of China Renaissance and head of its life science division, which tracks 200 biotech mainland start-ups.  Money may not be a constraint but money by itself can t create true innovation. 

 The gap is still large with the USA in basic research,  Burning Rock s Mr Han concedes.  But there is so much talent and opportunity in China. In life sciences, we can catch up. The technological gap with the US is disappearing. 

Today, it is accepted wisdom that early detection and treatment for diseases such as cancer will come from applying artificial intelligence and machine learning to the personal health data of large numbers of people   and China has more such data with fewer constraints on access to it than any other country.

China is gradually building an eco-system modelled on the US. Among the prerequisites are government incentives and funding, appropriate regulation, human capital, vibrant venture capital, links between university research labs and the private sector, and adequate reimbursement for innovation, according to Ben Shobert, the founder of Rubicon Strategy Group and a healthcare expert at the National Bureau of Asian Research.

Moreover, Chinese regulators  are moving in a better direction,  says Mr Han. This is in contrast to over a decade ago when the then head of the Chinese equivalent of the Federal Drug Administration, Zheng Xiaoyu, was executed for corruption. China is also improving its protection of intellectual property rights.

There is also a darker side to Chinese life sciences, however. China does not have the same level of concern over privacy as the US. If US regulators consider (as they do) that financial data jeopardises national security, the need to protect medical data on US citizens is even more critical. In addition, there are far fewer constraints on human trials. Moreover, the current scandal over vaccines is merely the latest in a series of such scandals.

These are among the reasons the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US is increasingly targeting life sciences in its scrutiny of Chinese money going to the US. Indeed, such initiatives remain one of the biggest clouds on the horizon for innovation in the life sciences.

To date, there are few sectors where the US and China are as closely intertwined as in life sciences. Cross border R&D deals involving Chinese biotech companies have increased by 70 per cent since 2012, according to Mr Shobert. Licensing is one key area of co-operation. The pipeline was once just one way, with companies like Pfizer and Celgene licensing drugs to Chinese companies such as Fosun Pharma. But that is changing. In the past year China was the recipient of drugs in 27 cases, but in four others, mainland companies such as Wuxi Biologics and BeiGene licensed their products to companies including Celgene, data from McKinsey show. Moreover, many US pharma firms, including Eli Lilly, have venture arms in China that provide both funding and scientists to mainland start-ups.

Sadly, Cfius and politics mean more clouds over prevention and early detection of disease.

The limits of leapfrogging

The rapid spread of smartphones, mobile money and solar power has raised hopes that Africa could leap ahead in its development. But grassroots use of new technology cannot take the place of good governance. By David Pilling

Kotiogo Ng'usilo vividly remembers the first time he saw a car. It was the 1950s and Mr Ng'usilo, a hunter-gatherer from the Ogiek tribe in Kenya's Mau forest, thought it was a "moving house".

These days, at 86, though he still tries to preserve a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, foraging for honey and secretly bagging the odd hyrax, he has moved with the times. He wears western clothes, buys food at the market and, like his younger relatives, uses a mobile phone. His story about the old days   which he recounts over sacred honey beer   is interrupted by incessant chirruping, not from birds but handsets bringing news to the forest from the city.

The rapid spread of mobile technology in the developing world   especially in Africa, which has lagged behind most of Asia and Latin America in closing the income gap with the west   has given rise to the theory of "leapfrogging". This has it that, in the words of a World Bank study, countries can make "a quick jump in economic development" by harnessing technological innovation.

Some see in the power of technology an almost miraculous potential to solve problems that many governments, particularly in Africa, have failed properly to address; poor health, poor schools, lack of roads, lack of electricity and lack of jobs. Last week Alibaba founder Jack Ma announced a $10m "Netpreneur" prize for young African tech entrepreneurs who, Mr Ma said, were "paving the way for a better future".

Ban Ki-moon, the former UN secretary-general who will sit on the prize's board, articulated the optimism that technology can help poor countries catch up, or even overtake, their richer peers. "With the rapid development of the global digital economy and the availability of technology," he said, "the next century belongs to Africa."

The term "leapfrogging" is often applied to Africa, though it is also used to describe a path supposedly being charted by India, which is said to have skipped straight to a technology-driven economic model without the intensive manufacturing phase that spurred growth in Japan, South Korea and China. As in Africa, India's tech entrepreneurs are said to be succeeding where the government has failed. The author Gurcharan Das has said India grows at night "when the government sleeps".

The spread of mobile and digital technology is seen as the key to leapfrogging. According to Miles Morland, a veteran investor in Africa, Nigeria in 2001 had 100,000 working landlines for a population then around 140m. When in that year, MTN, a South African telecoms company, bid $285m for a mobile operating licence, it estimated that no more than 15m Nigerians would ever own a mobile phone. Today, the country has 162m subscribers, according to Jumia, an online retailer.

In sub-Saharan Africa as a whole, GSMA Intelligence estimates there were 444m unique mobile subscribers in 2017, a penetration rate of 44 per cent. That compares with a global average of 66 per cent, though in countries like South Africa and Nigeria, where nearly nine in 10 people subscribe, mobile phones are as common as in the US, according to Pew Research.

Although mobile phone sales have slowed, many of the 50 countries in sub-Saharan Africa are expected gradually to close the gap on the rest of the world as handsets become more affordable. In Ethiopia, Transsion Holdings, a Chinese company, is already manufacturing handsets costing as little as $10 in an industrial park outside Addis Ababa.

"Access to mobile phones is now virtually ubiquitous," says Precious Lunga, a Zimbabwean neuroscientist who founded Baobab Circle, a health tech company that uses artificial intelligence to give consultations to patients in Kenya and Zimbabwe. "There are places where there's still no running water, but you can stream a video," she says.

Mobile money The spread of smartphones, which count for a third of all handsets in Africa, opens up the transformative possibilities of mobile technology still further, say technology advocates.

In teeming cities such as Lagos in Nigeria or Dar es Salaam in Tanzania, both among the fastest growing in the world, a slice of the urban elite is using ride-hailing apps such as Uber and Taxify and ordering takeaway food and goods online. In Ivory Coast, Standard Chartered has launched its first digitalonly retail bank, saying it will use the west African country as a testing ground for digital services worldwide.

Even more important for the leapfrogging argument is the impact that mobile technology is having on the countryside, where six of every 10 Africans live. Starting in Kenya, with the 2007 launch of Mpesa   Safaricom's mobile money transfer and payment service   much of Africa is experiencing a revolution in financial inclusion. Tens of millions of previously unbanked people like Mr Ng'usilo can now transfer money to relatives or pay for goods by pressing a few buttons on their phone.

"The mobile handset in the hands of an ordinary African has become the symbol of leapfrogging," Calestous Juma, the Kenya-born former chair of the innovation for economic development executive programme at Harvard's Kennedy School, wrote shortly before he died last year. "The mobile revolution has given hope to Africans that they too can be dynamic and innovative players in the global economy." The spread of mobile money   now used by an estimated 690m people, of which half are African, according to GSMA   forms the digital backbone for a host of other services. In cities and towns, small businesses can advertise online and collect payments by phone. In the countryside, there has been a rapid spread of pay-as-you go solar-generated power in which customers buy electricity with mobile money for as little as 50 cents a day and panels are deactivated remotely if payments stop.

Going off-grid In the village of Sahabevava in northeast Madagascar, several hours down a bone-jolting road to the nearest town and far from the nearest electricity grid, Lydia Soa, a farmer, is the proud owner of a solar panel. It produces enough power to light her home   good for when the children do homework   power a boombox and, of course, recharge her mobile phone.

Africa accounts for 16 per cent of the world's population but has only 2.8 per cent of its power generation capacity, according to the World Bank. Only 37 per cent of people in sub-Saharan Africa have access to electricity, leaving some 600m in the dark.

However, according to an industry report, 73m households, mostly in African countries, had access to off-grid solar power by 2017. This rapid spread, which has enabled remote parts of Africa to jump from having no electricity straight to green power, is the quintessence of the leapfrogging argument. If technology can leapfrog landlines, banking and electricity grids, say enthusiasts, surely it can impact all industries and all areas of life.

Keun Lee, professor of economics at Seoul National University, has studied how technological advances can jumpstart development. In the late 1990s, he says, South Korea's Samsung used the shift to digital television technology to overtake Sony, its Japanese rival, which had dominated the analogue market with its Trinitron range of TVs.

"When a new technology or paradigm emerges, everyone starts on the same line, so latecomers are not behind," he says. "Forerunners are the last to switch to new technologies," he adds.

Mr Lee, who advises the Rwandan government on its ambitions to make the tiny central African country a digital hub, says technological shifts give the likes of India, Brazil and some African economies the chance to skip ahead. "African countries used to use kerosene as a source for lighting, but they can bypass grid-based electricity and go straight to solar-based electricity."

Few would dispute that, either by piggybacking off technologies developed in the west or through their own innovations such as mobile money, countries in Africa and elsewhere can compress development. Britain took 150 years or more, via an industrial revolution that harnessed water, wind and steam power, to move from an agricultural to an advanced economy. Japan achieved the same transition more quickly and countries such as Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and China have taken just a couple of generations to leap from poverty to middle- or high-income status. The leapfroggers' definition of technology tends to focus on the digital revolution and the power of "shiny new apps", in Ms Lunga's phrase, to transform society. However, Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University, says the greatest gains in productivity were made not through the internet and mobile phones, but in technologies that we now take for granted: indoor plumbing, roads and steam power.

If Mr Gordon is right, then skipping over those developments and moving straight to what a World Economic Forum conference held in Rwanda in 2016 called the fourth industrial revolution would see Africa miss out on the most significant gains in productivity   and therefore growth. Indeed, for all the hype about leapfrogging, Africa's growth rates, particularly in per capita terms, have rarely reached the sustained double-digit levels that transformed lives in north-east Asia. Bill Gates says lots of the technology that is changing lives in Africa was developed in the past. Yet now it can be adopted in some of the remotest places on earth. "By the time what I call 'technology' gets out to the village, the community healthcare worker is doing a simple injection, or you're swallowing the pill or planting the seed," he says.

Mr Gates, whose Bill &Melinda Gates Foundation contributes billions of dollars to spreading such advances, says the relative ease of dissemination allows countries to catch up faster, particularly in health.

Some leapfrogging claims smack of "solutionism", the idea that technology can fix even the most intractable of problems. Africa, according to sceptics, demonstrates the limitations of technological solutions in the absence of good government and basic infrastructure.

Developments in agriculture and health show both the potential and the shortcoming of technology.

Take farming, which employs more than half of Africa's adult population. Across the continent, tech-based solutions are addressing a crisis of low productivity. In Ghana, Cocoa Link delivers information to farmers via text message, dispensing practical advice and market prices. In Kenya, Twiga Foods, an online marketplace, uses technology to disintermediate thousands of wholesalers and ensure a transparent market for farmers. Grant Brooke, Twiga's chief executive, says the greater certainty provided by mobile-based technology can help farmers raise yields.

Yet flashy apps cannot hide a basic truth. African farming yields are stuck in the 19th century. The majority of farms have no irrigation, no government help with seed or fertiliser, no access to market and hazy ownership rights. Farmers do not bother to grow crops that, in the absence of refrigeration, would rot before they reach the consumer. Only 44 per cent of rural Kenyans and 32 per cent of Ethiopians live within 2km of an all-season road, a metric that former prime minister Meles Zenawi considered more critical than GDP in determining development.

Health is another example. Around the continent, technologists are seeking to solve a basic problem: lack of decent, affordable public healthcare. Babyl Health Rwanda, the subsidiary of Babylon, a UK creator of a "doctor in your pocket" app, offers online consultations to villagers who live miles from the nearest clinic. Ms Lunga, whose Baobab Circle offers tele-consultations to hypertension and diabetes patients, argues that technology can fill a gap.

"There are not enough doctors, there are not enough nurses," she says. "That's when you need AI to leapfrog that."

Yet, as with agriculture, innovations in healthcare smack of patching up failed systems. Many African governments are too poor, too badly organised or too busy lining their own pockets to provide decent healthcare for their people. If there is leapfrogging in health, it is when Africa's wealthy skip over dilapidated systems to get treatment abroad. "No one can suggest that great technology is in any way a substitute for good governance," says Mr Gates. "I certainly don't think giving everyone computers helps their malaria or solves the problem of the teacher not being there or not having a schoolroom."

Calestous Juma, the professor who was passionate about the power of technology to transform African lives, argued that leapfrogging cannot overcome bad leadership. He warned of "a faulty narrative that assumes Africa can leap into the service economy without first building a manufacturing base".

Although it was right to see "technological innovation as an essential driver of economic growth, and as the key to moving beyond the vagaries of commodity exports", innovation depended on industrial development to build infrastructure and capacity. "That", he wrote, "cannot be leapfrogged".
