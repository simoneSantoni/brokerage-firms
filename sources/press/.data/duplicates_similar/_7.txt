Shares in Experian climbed as much as 3 per cent this morning as the credit checker racked up some decent growth in North America in the third quarter, although currency moves wiped out the group s overall sales growth, highlighting the heavy impact the greenback s rally is having on dollar earnings.

Total revenue fell 3 per cent in the three months to December, but stripping out currency moves it rose 6 per cent. Including the impact of currency moves, sales dropped in every region except North America, but without currency moves, sales rose in every region.

In Latin America, sales rose 6 per cent ignoring currency moves, whereas reported sales fell 29 per cent, underscoring the drag exerted by the decline in emerging market currencies.

The group rather darkly explained its success in Brazil:

In Brazil, we benefited from growth across both consumer and business information, including an increasing contribution from delinquency notifications linked to higher volumes of non-performing loans.

In October the company "http://on.ft.com/1NWO79J" at one of its US servers, affecting T-Mobile.

Brian Cassin, chief executive, said:

Growth was balanced, with all four regions contributing within our targeted mid-single digit range. Strategically, we divested a number of smaller assets to further focus the portfolio and we are expanding rapidly in the key areas of Credit Services and Decision Analytics. In North America Consumer Services, we continue to see underlying improvement in trends and benefited in the quarter from one-off revenue for on-boarding of a new affinity client.

Looking ahead, our guidance for the full year is unchanged. While foreign exchange will be a headwind, at constant currency we expect organic revenue growth in the mid-single digit range, to deliver stable margins and to see further progress in Benchmark earnings per share.

Property Report: Builders Bet on Booming Rents

After six years of rising apartment rents in U.S. cities, investors from all corners of the real-estate industry are piling into new projects in a bet that the boom still has a long way to run.

Over the next three years, developers are expected to build almost one million apartments in the U.S., more than the nearly 900,000 constructed over the previous three, according to researcher Axiometrics Inc.

In 2014, multifamily rental construction reached 328,000 units, its highest in nearly 30 years, according to an analysis of U.S. Census data by Jed Kolko, a senior fellow at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation at the University of California, Berkeley.

The main lure for investors: rising rents. Average rents nationwide rose 4.6% in 2015, the biggest gain since before the recession, according to real-estate researcher Reis Inc. Rents have increased by more than 20% since the beginning of 2010. Most economists expect 2016 to be another strong year. The average monthly U.S. apartment rent now stands at nearly $1,180, up from about $1,125 a year ago, according to Reis.

"I sound to myself like a broken record because I've been saying the same thing for quite a few years now," said Mark Obrinsky, chief economist at the National Multifamily Housing Council. "Demand remains high for apartments."

Sales of U.S. multifamily apartment properties clocked in at a record $138.7 billion in 2015, up just over 30% from a year earlier, according to JLL, a commercial-real-estate-services firm. Last year, 4,915 multifamily projects were sold, up from 4,570 in 2014.

But some real-estate analysts worry that most of the new construction has been aimed at the top 20% of the market. In all, 82% of the units built from 2012 to 2014 in 54 major U.S. metropolitan areas are classified as luxury developments, according to CoStar Group Inc.

"What concerns me is not so much the volume of construction but that there's an intense focus on building the same thing: luxury properties in urban locations," said Jay Parsons, director of analytics for MPF Research, a division of RealPage Inc., who has been advising clients to look more at vibrant suburban markets.

The shift toward luxury is putting renters near the limit of what they can afford.

In downtown Los Angeles, new one-bedroom properties are commanding rents in the range of $3,000 a month. According to CoStar, a tenant would need a gross income of $128,000 to afford one of those units, four times the median household income in the area of just over $29,000 a year.

In Boston's trendy Leather District, renters would need to make nearly $142,000 to afford average rents for newly built one-bedroom apartments of more than $3,500 a month, according to CoStar. The median income in the area is closer to $60,000.

Despite the affordability issues, apartments are drawing interest from a broad swath of real-estate companies, including home builders that haven't traditionally built multifamily housing. Toll Brothers Inc., primarily a single-family home builder, has 7,400 apartment units planned or under development, and company executives say that could double over the next couple of years.

"All these trends supporting apartment demand are going to be with us for the foreseeable future," said Charles Elliott, managing director of Toll Brothers Apartment Living.

Major office landlords, such as Mack-Cali Realty Corp. also are focusing more on apartments. The company, which was solely an office landlord before 2010, through acquisition and development has amassed 7,000 units and plans by 2019 to more than double that to 15,000 units.

"Most people forming households today are not buying," said Michael DeMarco, president of Mack-Cali.

Urban markets are especially hot. The number of apartments completed in 30 major downtown city centers hit more than 54,000 for 2015, according to an estimate by Axiometrics, a 20-year high.

Toby Bozzuto, president and chief executive of the Bozzuto Group, a Washington-area builder, said he has seen an influx in the past few years of newcomers that once specialized only in office or retail but now are dabbling in apartments. He remains bullish on the apartment market, but has concerns that investors are piling on and driving up land prices beyond what rents can support.

Los Angeles-based Jamison, one of the city's largest office landlords, is taking its first plunge into residential property. For two decades the company specialized in owning no-frills office buildings in the Koreatown neighborhood. Now its Jamison Properties LP unit is diving headlong into apartments, with 27 projects under development or in the planning stages.

About a third of the new units are conversions of the company's existing buildings, while the rest are new construction, including Jamison's most ambitious project, two 35-story towers in downtown Los Angeles with 648 luxury units.

Jaime Lee, CEO of Jamison Realty Inc., expects the market will start to slow in the next few years, so Jamison is breaking ground on some projects as soon as possible.

"People are working against the clock right now," she said. "We're coming to market as quickly as we can."

Some signs of strain are beginning to emerge. The vacancy rate for downtown apartment buildings in U.S. cities jumped to 6.1% in the third quarter of 2015 from 4.4% in the first quarter of 2013, according to Reis. During the same period, the suburban vacancy rate fell to 4.1% from 4.4% -- suggesting some renters are leaving high-price inner-city areas and moving farther out. New projects in the third quarter were 49% unleased upon completion, according to CoStar Group Inc., up from 29% in the third quarter of 2014.

"With all the new product being created skewed to luxury . . . we're building lots of rental product but it doesn't necessarily match up with what the demand really is," said New York-based appraiser Jonathan Miller.

U.S. News: Financial Crisis Still Splits Parties

The 2016 campaign is offering ample evidence for why Washington, eight years after the financial crisis, remains so divided on how to regulate Wall Street: Republicans and Democrats still have wildly different interpretations about what caused the bust.

GOP candidates fault government policies and low interest rates for fueling the housing bubble that preceded the crisis. They strongly support easing financial regulations passed in the aftermath, singling out the 2010 Dodd-Frank rules signed into law by President Barack Obama.

Democrats say the crisis was fueled by private-sector and regulatory failures, not government policy. But they are divided over the need to break up big banks and the role of a 1999 law signed by President Bill Clinton that repealed parts of the Glass-Steagall Act, a New Deal-era statute that separated commercial and investment banking. The fight has put front-runner Hillary Clinton on the defensive by highlighting broader concerns over her willingness to stand up to the financial lobby.

Economists say many of the proposals floated by candidates fall short, to the degree that they turn on oversimplifications of what drove the bust. "In this kind of environment, you want a short, punchy message to be effective," said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who is president of a conservative think tank and advised Sen. John McCain during his GOP presidential run in 2008. Such catchphrases, he said, don't always translate into good policy.

In debates, GOP candidates have blamed the crisis partly on the Federal Reserve , which they say maintained low rates for too long, and on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the government-backed mortgage-finance firms that effectively set lending standards for much of the housing market.

They also say the crisis response did too little to address large banks and saddled small banks that didn't play major roles in the crisis with a punitive compliance burden.

In a November debate, businesswoman Carly Fiorina said the law provided a "great example of how socialism starts," because the government, having created a problem by overpromoting homeownership, then stepped in to solve it.

Critics of Dodd-Frank say a bigger problem is that the law doesn't do enough to solve the problem of firms being too complex. They are also wary because the law assumes a lack of regulation -- rather than the unwillingness to use regulatory powers that existed -- is what drove the crisis.

"Republicans have legitimate criticisms, but you have to propose some sensible alternatives" to Dodd-Frank, such as improving the mechanism for how failing banks are liquidated, said Mr. Holtz-Eakin, whom GOP lawmakers appointed to a congressional panel investigating the crisis. "I don't see how you can say, 'We'll just get rid of Dodd-Frank.' " An additional hurdle, he said, is that Democrats have reflexively resisted even technical changes to the bill "regardless of the merit."

Fannie and Freddie used their lobbying clout to resist tougher capital standards before the boom, but the loans they backed still performed better than mortgages packaged into securities by Wall Street firms.

From 2003 to 2006, the period in which the housing bubble inflated most dramatically, the share of loans backed by Fannie and Freddie fell from more than half to around a third, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a newsletter. Crisis-era loans packaged into securities by Fannie and Freddie have experienced realized loss rates of around 3%, compared with 23% for those packaged into securities by Wall Street, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.

For Mrs. Clinton, restoring Glass-Steagall wouldn't do enough to oversee large insurers and hedge funds. "I just don't think it would get the job done," she said at a Democratic debate in November.

Critics of Wall Street deregulation say her answer undersold the role global banks had in extending credit to lightly regulated nonbank firms that fueled the housing bubble. "I knew when you merge large insurance companies and investment banks and commercial banks, it was not going to be good," said White House hopeful and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who as a House member voted against the 1999 Glass-Steagall repeal.

Small energy groups covered in red ink; Oil & gas

Survey of Aim-listed oil companies highlights impact of oil price plunge

Nine out of 10 small London-listed oil and gas companies are making losses, according to new data highlighting the full impact of the plunging crude price on junior energy groups.

A survey of 104 exploration and production companies listed on the London Stock Exchange's Aim market by Company Watch, a research firm, found that 42 per cent were in its "warning area" at the end of last year.

This means that the groups are 50 times more likely to suffer financial distress than a typical company, according to Company Watch. It highlights how energy groups' efforts to cut costs to cope with the oil price rout have not been universally successful.

Company Watch found the combined market value of the 104 companies had dropped by 40 per cent in the past year. Ninety per cent were making pre-tax losses in their most recent accounts, but the overall performance was better than in 2014 partly because costs have been cut significantly.

Ewan Mitchell, head of analytics at Company Watch, said: "Smaller oil and gas companies on Aim will remain under severe pressure because fundraising in this environment will be testing, and many will have already cut costs to the bone last year with little room for more this year. "

The energy industry has been hit hard over the past 18 months, as the price of Brent crude has slumped from $115 a barrel to below $40 - the lowest level in more than a decade.

Smaller oil and gas companies have fared particularly badly, with many having taken on large amounts of debt as they aggressively pushed for new finds while the oil price was still high.

The Company Watch data show that the 104 companies' combined gross debt has remained stubbornly high, at 2bn at the time of these groups' last accounts - a similar level to the same time in 2014.

The data also highlight the broader stresses being placed on North Sea operators listed outside of the UK. Iona Energy, the UK subsidiary of a Canadian listed company, last week announced it had called in administrators to help dismantle its operations.

Iona had hoped to sell an interest in its Orlando field, to the east of Shetland, but a prospective buyer pulled out, leaving the company with little option but to begin insolvency procedures.

Atlantic Petroleum, a Faroese company listed in Denmark and Iceland, which owns 19 North Sea production licences, is also struggling, having missed a debt repayment in December.

PA Resources, an explorer listed in Sweden that focuses on the North Sea and Africa, announced last year that it would liquidate its assets after failing to secure funding.

I have recently returned from Blackbox, a tech accelerator course in Palo Alto, California, where start-ups can learn from venture capitalists, established founders and others about the way Silicon Valley operates. There isn't a better place to take a magical mystery tour of the future of digital. This small city of 65,000 people is the heart of the Valley, where Facebook, Google and Apple all started out.

The two-week residential programme, sponsored by Google for Entrepreneurs, is a hot ticket. I was the only British founder among a group of 19 gathered from all over the world. Depending on our mood, the atmosphere either resembled a Coke advert or a UN conclave from Uganda and Uruguay, Bangalore and Berlin. My first conversation was with a founder from the West Bank who had teamed up with a younger man from Tel Aviv. They almost always sat together chatting, one seeking the perfect line to explain his complex platform, the other receiving help with his business plan. The Palestinian quietly admitted that such closeness would be harder back on home territory.

Just four days into our stay, a young radicalised Muslim couple killed 14 people in another part of California; a few days later, Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump was calling for the US to ban all Muslims from coming into the country. By my calculations, such a law would have excluded just under a third of our group, including two charming young Pakistanis who, still in their early twenties, had come up with a watch to help people afflicted by tremors to analyse their condition - Trequant is a potentially life-changing device that could help up to 6m sufferers in the US alone. Among our group, neither the attack nor Trump ever came up in conversation.

Just over two years ago, Aileen Lee, a US investor, coined the term "unicorn" to describe tech companies valued at more than $1bn before their initial public offering. At last count there were 144 of these, topped by Uber at $51bn.

This is how everyone wants to make it big now. The people at Google might talk about getting your product right, building it slowly, but there's more than a whiff of the gold rush about Silicon Valley these days. People speak of a bubble that's about to burst; others simply point out that most of the big, problem-solving ideas have been done.

Keith Teare, co-founder of the website TechCrunch and now heading an investment and consultancy business, told us that unicorn-hunting is a reality, albeit a rather unpalatable one. The chances of such huge success are pitifully low, so investment is increasingly hard to come by. "You're trying to move investors from fear to greed. If you can't ignite their greed then you won't get a cheque. Risk only affects the price they'll pay."

Mike Maples, a venture capitalist who told us he made 500 times his seed investment in Twitter, laid out some harsh statistics for our group: "Ninety-seven per cent of the wealth created in Silicon Valley was made by 10 companies. Do you really want to sacrifice five years of your life for the scraps of three per cent? I love founders and want them to do well, but it's a very tough job."

Maples was charismatic, with a low boredom threshold. I told him he reminded me of an old-style record company A&R man, only searching for talent in the digital new world. It was an assessment he seemed to agree with: "I always said I wanted to be to tech like Berry Gordy was to Motown."

My start-up, Welldoing.org, helps people find the most suitable therapist for their needs. There are more than 1,000 different modes of therapy; people can be overwhelmed by the choice and simply give up. I'm aware that this subject is not at the forefront for the A+ programmers of Silicon Valley - currently preoccupied by AI (artificial intelligence), robotics, the Internet of Things and virtual reality - but mental health is a big issue here.

Founder depression is an acknowledged syndrome and there have been a number of well-publicised suicides. Experts blame the toxic mix of long hours (many talk of 80-hour weeks) and little sleep but surely the clincher is the huge competition and pressure to be first to market and then to make it large as quickly as you possibly can. Anything less is failure.

With tech, super-quick growth is possible - one of our talks at Blackbox was on the subject of exponentiality from Pascal Finette at Silicon Valley's Singularity University, a think-tank set up in 2008 to solve the world's most critical problems through technology. But, at the same time, start-ups are burning through money, so investors get antsy, or someone else comes along with the same idea and a shorter timescale.

One of the many founders we heard from was an eminently sane chap from Poland, Marcin Treder of the design application UXPin. "When we were raising seed investment there was nothing else in my life. No matter what your friends do, you're not going to Yosemite." But once he got his money, his venture capitalist introduced him to a monthly entrepreneurs' meeting. "We get together and we talk about our problems. It's like group therapy."

In the valley of the unicorns, sharing your troubles may not make you rich. But it's probably the best way to stay sane.

Louise Chunn is the founder of welldoing.org

WSJ.D Technology: Apple Purchases Startup Emotient

Apple Inc. has purchased Emotient Inc., a startup that uses artificial-intelligence technology to read people's emotions by analyzing facial expressions.

It isn't clear what Apple plans to do with Emotient's technology, which primarily was sold to advertisers to help assess viewer reactions to their ads. Doctors also have tested it to interpret signs of pain among patients unable to express themselves, and a retailer used it to monitor shoppers' facial expressions, the company had said.

Improving image recognition is a hot topic in Silicon Valley, where Apple rivals Facebook Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and others are investing heavily in artificial-intelligence techniques.

An Apple spokeswoman confirmed the purchase, but declined to elaborate.

Emotient, based in San Diego, previously had raised $8 million from investors, including Intel Capital. The company had been seeking a new round of venture-capital financing, but wasn't able to secure it on favorable terms according to a person familiar with the matter.

Emotient Chief Executive Ken Denman declined to comment. The company this week revised its website and removed details about the services it had been selling.

Apple has expressed interest in the field. In a 2014 patent application, it described a software system that would analyze and identify people's moods based on a variety of clues, including facial expression.

In October, Apple confirmed that it had acquired another artificial-intelligence startup, VocalIQ Ltd., which aims to improve a computer's ability to understand natural speech.

In May, Emotient announced that it had been granted a patent for a method of collecting and labeling as many as 100,000 facial images a day so computers can better recognize different expressions.

Its technology leaves some skittish, including Paul Ekman, a psychologist who pioneered the study of reading faces to determine emotions and is an adviser to Emotient.

In an interview with The Wall Street Journal last January, Dr. Ekman said he was torn between the potential power of software that can read emotions and the need to ensure that it doesn't infringe on personal privacy. He said the technology could reveal people's emotions without their consent, and their feelings could be misinterpreted.

An Emotient spokeswoman says the company doesn't reveal information about individuals, only aggregate data.

The latest job moves in the trading industry and coverage of people making the news in the world s financial capitals

Wall retires from chief executive role at Marex Spectron

John Wall is to retire as chief executive of Marex Spectron after more than three years at the helm amid a wide-ranging board reshuffle at the UK commodities broker.

As part of the changes Jeremy Isaacs, the group s non-executive chairman and a key figure in the creation of the Marex business, will also step back from his role.

The duo have played a key role in short life of the company, whose modern incarnation was created when Marex bought by JRJ Group, a private equity firm founded by Mr Isaacs, former head of Lehman s European operations. In the intervening six years it has grown rapidly by hiring staff and purchasing smaller brokers, such as the 94.5m deal for Spectron, in 2011. Mr Wall, who had been at UBS for more than 25 years until his appointment at Marex, was appointed in part to integrate the Marex and Spectron companies.

Mr Wall will be replaced by Ian Lowitt, the group s chief financial officer, who will also move from New York to London to take over. Rob Watts, the group s financial controller, will become Marex s new CFO.

Both appointments take effect from Friday 8th January and remain subject to regulatory approval.

 With the firm in excellent shape, I feel that now is the right time for me to step back. It has been a privilege to lead this great company and I have no doubt that Ian is the right person to take charge of the next stage of its development,  said Mr Wall.

Mr Isaacs will be succeeded by Simon Heale, a non-executive director and former chief executive of the London Metal Exchange. Mr Isaacs will remain on the board. (Philip Stafford, January 6)

Euronext appoints former Tullet executive to lead FICC push

Euronext has appointed Paul Humphrey, a former executive at interdealer broker Tullett Prebon, to help the European exchanges operator develop a strategy to exploit rapidly-changing fixed income, rates and foreign exchange markets.

Mr Humphrey, who had been working at Thomson Reuters as a consultant, will join the group on January 4 with the title of head of fixed income, rates and FX (FICC) strategy. He was previously chief executive of Tullett s electronic broking and information business until the summer of 2014. He has also worked at ABN Amro, Van der Moolen, SLK/Goldman Sachs and ICAP.

His appointment comes as exchanges are increasingly eyeing markets that have long been dominated by banks, which continue to make billions of dollars in profits from it each year. Exchanges have generally been unable to establish a presence in fixed income and forex markets. However a combination of unlawful activity by banks, deep structural change and the emergence of cheap and reliable technology that has allowed alternative ways of trading to emerge. Euronext operates stock, commodity and derivatives markets around the region but has little OTC business.

Mr Humphrey will report to Lee Hodgkinson, head of markets and global sales, who said:  His appointment further strengthens our senior leadership team and his vast experience and strong vision will help us fulfil our growth ambitions in an important sector of the business.  (Philip Stafford, December 2)

Preuss to step away from Eurex role in Deutsche Brse reorganisation

Deutsche Brse, Europe s largest exchanges operator by market capitalisation, has unveiled a wide-ranging internal reorganisation that will see Andreas Preuss step away from his role as head of the Eurex derivatives exchange.

The internal reshaping comes five months after Carsten Kengeter, a former UBS banker, became chief executive with a plan to  put client focus at the heart of its structure.  In a statement on Wednesday, Deutsche Brse said it would create a new  Clients, Products and Core Markets  unit that will encompass its derivatives trading, clearing and settlement business. It will be headed by Jeffrey Tessler, chief executive of its Clearstream settlement business.

Mr Preuss, deputy chief executive and for many years Deutsche Brse s most senior representative at industry events, will become chief executive of a new division, called  IT & Operations, Data & New Asset Classes . It will combine Deutsche Brse  market data unit, the European Energy Exchange and 360T, the foreign exchange trading network the company bought for  ¬725m over the summer.

The group s cash equities business, which includes the well-known Frankfurt Stock Exchange Xetra, will be separated from the Eurex derivatives business and given its own divisional status  given its high political as well as macroeconomic importance , the company said. The enlarged division, named  Cash Market, Pre-IPO & Growth Financing , will include certificates and warrant businesses and the creation of an  innovative pre-IPO market . It will be led by Hauke Stars, who was previously responsible for Deutsche Brse s market data division and the renewal of its IT infrastructure.

Mr Kengeter will be directly responsible for group strategy, mergers and acquisitions as well as government relations. (Philip Stafford, November 12)

London Stock Exchange Group appoints MSCI s Corrado as COO

London Stock Exchange Group has appointed Chris Corrado from MSCI as both group chief operating officer and chief information officer to replace the departing Antoine Shagoury.

The appointment is effective immediately. Mr Corrado, who has also held a series of senior technology officer roles at banks like Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Merrill Lynch and UBS as well as companies outside financial services, including eBay and AT&T Wireless. He began his career at IBM.

Mr Shagoury is returning to his family in the US.  I d like to extend my warmest sincere thanks to Antoine for his leadership and outstanding contribution to the Group over the past five years. Antoine has identified a strong successor and developed a deep bench of talent to carry on his legacy,  said Xavier Rolet, LSE group chief executive.  I m confident the Group will benefit from Chris  deep experience as we continue to diversify our business and grow our global footprint. (Philip Stafford, November 12)

London Stock Exchange Group hires former CME lobbyist Jachym

Jonathan Jachym, the former CME Group senior lobbyist in Washington, has re-emerged in a similar role for the London Stock Exchange Group as the US becomes an increasing focus of business for the UK bourse.

Mr Jachym quit the CME at the start of September after five years in the role to  pursue another opportunity , as he described in a departing email. He was previously executive director, government relations at CME in Washington and held a similar position in Europe for three years.

Mr Jachym will become head of North America regulatory strategy and government relations for the LSE, according to two people familiar with the move.

His appointment comes as North American market assumes a greater role in the overall LSE business. Its $2.7bn purchase of Frank Russell, the index compiler, has meant that around 30 per cent of turnover comes from the US. To underscore that focus, this year the LSE has also licensed a series of Russell and FTSE indices to CME Group, the world s largest futures exchange, to develop equity index futures and options. It agreed a similar deal with another Chicago exchange, CBOE, in February. Mary Schapiro, who was chair of the Securities Exchange Commission between 2009 to 2012, also joined the LSE s board on July 1.

Before that, Mr Jachym was legal and regulatory counsel at the Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness, a US consumer trade group. (Philip Stafford, October 9)

London Stock Exchange Group names new head of exchange

The London Stock Exchange Group, which runs exchanges, indices and trading platforms, has promoted Nikhil Rathi to be the chief executive of its stock exchange business, the London Stock Exchange.

He will replace Alexander Justham, known through the industry as  JJ , who informed the group of his decision to leave earlier this year after three years in the role, the bourse said in a statement.

Mr Justham previously had responsibility for regulatory strategy, government and public affairs, and UK regulation, and formerly worked at the UK financial regulator, the-then Financial Services Authority.

Xavier Rolet, group chief executive of the LSE, said:

 I would like to warmly extend my personal thanks to JJ for his great contribution and wish him all the best for the future. 

Mr Rathi joined the LSE from the UK Treasury last year to be its chief of staff and director of international development. His roles at the finance department included director of the financial services group representing the UK government s interests in the EU and internationally.

 During the past year, Nikhil has played a key role driving the Group s strategy in key markets, such as China and India as well as supporting key integration projects across the group,  Mr Rolet added. (Philip Stafford, September 29)

Deutsche Brse appoints Gotsman as derivatives adviser

Ilan Gotsman, one of Europe s leading futures trading entrepreneurs, has joined Deutsche Brse as an adviser to develop its Eurex derivatives business.

The 51-year old Israeli was appointed with immediate effect, the German exchange told employees in a memo released on Tuesday.

His role will be to advise Eurex on ways to increase both volume and open interest in contracts, product development, pricing structures and improve its competitive position. He will also advise on identifying other growth opportunities, the company said.

He will report to Carsten Kengeter, the group s new chief executive, and Andreas Preuss, deputy chief executive and head of Eurex.

Mr Gotsman has maintained a low public profile but is well-known within the futures industry. In the early 1990s he helped to set up GH Financials, a London-based clearing broker.

He has also founded Butterfly Investments, which uses proprietary mathematical models to identify mispricing in the exchange-trade interest rate derivative. He also founded Matrix Capital Markets Ltd, a private trading derivative company in 2003. (Philip Stafford, September 8)

Markit names Mutnikas as co-head of Solutions business

Markit, the UK data provider, has appointed a former Bank of England risk adviser to help develop its fast-growing analytics business.

The London-based group named Yaacov Mutnikas as managing director and co-head of its Solutions business, it said in a statement. He reports to Lance Uggla, chief executive, and also joins Markit's executive team. He began last Thursday.

"I want analytics to be growing force in Markit in the future," said Mr Uggla. "When you think about the use of technology, the quantitative use of risk, in margin for collateral and the pieces of the post 2008 world, there is a lot of analysis required. It needs an analytic mind but also someone comfortable with technology and software. Yaacov has the toolbox to make a big difference."

Turnover at the unit rose 17 per cent to $82.3m in the three months to June 30, driven by new business wins and acquisitions. Excluding deals, Markit s Solutions business has recorded organic growth of 13 per cent in the first six months of the year.

Mr Mutnikas has worked as a senior adviser to the Bank of England on systemic risk. He has also worked at Bridgewater Associates, a hedge fund, and risk management software business Algorithmics, where he was chief technology officer. It was sold to IBM for $387m in 2011.

He is also a keen rower and was part of the team that holds the record for the fastest 8-man crossing of the Atlantic. (Philip Stafford, September 7)

DTCC names Scharf as chief security officer

DTCC, the US post-trade services provider, has appointed former Bloomberg and Experian executive Stephen Scharf to the newly-created position of chief security officer.

The move will allow Mark Clancy, also DTCC chief information security officer, to become the full-time head of a venture to combat threats from computer hacking in financial markets.

Mr Scharf was previously global chief information security officer at Experian, the credit data scoring company.

The group said Mr Clancy will be able to assume his full-time position as chief executive of Soltra, the project between the DTCC and the financial services industry to encourage banks and other critical infrastructure companies to improve the sharing of information on cyber attacks.

 Risk management remains a top priority across the industry, and we look forward to Stephen s contributions as we continue to protect DTCC and the global markets,  said Andrew Gray, managing director, group chief risk officer at DTCC. (Philip Stafford, July 21)

WFE names FCA s Hill to key policy role

The World Federation of Exchanges, a trade association for the world s bourses, has hired Gavin Hill from the UK s main markets watchdog as its new head of regulatory affairs.

Mr Hill spent 14 years at the Financial Conduct Authority and its predecessors, and has overseen equities, derivatives and commodities exchanges since 2006 as a manager in its Markets and Supervision Divisions. He was also responsible for the FCA s commodity markets policy and served on committees for the Euronext College of Regulators.

The 50-year old organisation has moved to London and reshuffled its staff to bolster its role as an active lobbyist, compared to a traditional focus on market data and industry research.

 The addition of Gavin will significantly strengthen the WFE team and reinforce its regulatory capacity and institutional knowledge as well as its City of London stakeholder network at a key time for the organisation,  said Nandini Sukumar, the new chief executive of the WFE.

Mr Hill starts at the WFE on September 21. (Philip Stafford, July 7)

LCH.Clearnet names Vinci as head of US repo unit

LCH.Clearnet, the world s largest over-the-counter swaps clearer, has appointed John Vinci from BNY Mellon to spearhead a push into the US fixed income clearing business.

Mr Vinci, who will become Head of US RepoClear, will be responsible for developing the clearing house s business in a critical part of daily market operations.

Repo markets grease the wheels of the financial system by allowing bonds to be exchanged for cash on the proviso that they will be repurchased at a later date. At present LCH largely clears cash bond and repo trades across 13 European markets. Monthly volumes average around  ¬13tn.

 This new appointment will support the business  growth ambitions in North America, working with our clients and members to deliver greater efficiencies in the US fixed income markets,  said David Weisbrod, chief executive of LCH s US business.

Mr Vinci will start on July 13 and report to Mr Weisbrod and Bruce Kellaway, global head of fixed income at LCH. He has also worked at JPMorgan Chase and Bankers Trust.(Philip Stafford, July 7)

LSE appoints former SEC chair Schapiro to its board

Mary Schapiro, one of the US s most experienced markets regulators, will join the board of the London Stock Exchange Group as a non-executive director.

Her appointment reflects the LSE s focus on US stock and derivatives markets for growth. The group is hoping to capitalise on two trends   greater use of passive investments like exchange traded funds and a regulatory mandate to risk manage more over-the-counter swaps through clearing houses.

Ms Schapiro, who was chair of the Securities Exchange Commission between 2009 to 2012, will join on July 1. She has also been chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the US derivatives regulator, and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (Finra).

 Mary s extensive knowledge of the US financial and regulatory landscape, her broad global markets experience, and her understanding of complex financial infrastructure will be of great value to the group as we continue to grow our global footprint,  said Chris Gibson-Smith, LSE chairman.

Last year the LSE bought index compiler Frank Russell Company from insurer Northwestern Mutual   its largest deal to date   to expand into indices and exchange traded funds. More than $5tn in assets are benchmarked to Russell indices, which include the well-known Russell 2000 for listed small-cap US companies.

The LSE also created a new role, head of its US business, to be held by David Weisbrod. Mr Weisbrod will be responsible for implementing the LSE s plans for the region and also co-ordinate its relationship with its main regulators and other public stakeholders.

He will continue in his role as chief executive of the US business of LCH.Clearnet, the world s largest swaps clearing house. (Philip Stafford, June 11)

NYSE appoints Cunningham as new COO

The New York Stock Exchange has promoted Stacey Cunningham, once a floor trader at the Big Board, to be its new chief operating officer.

In her new role, Ms Cunningham will oversee the rollout of a new trading technology platform, called Pillar, and the introduction of NYSE's planned midday auction, which is intended to boost liquidity in thinly-traded securities.

Ms Cunningham, previously president of the exchange's governance division, will report to Tom Farley, NYSE Group president. She has also worked as head of sales and relationship management for NYSE. After leaving trading a decade ago, she also worked at Nasdaq.

 Stacey will contribute to our work on enhancing and simplifying our equities platforms, advocating for listed companies and our trading customers in market structure discussions, and innovating to deliver more value to the global capital markets,  said Mr Farley. (Philip Stafford, June 3)

Hasenpusch set to take over at CME Clearing Europe

CME Group, the world s largest futures operator, is set for a change of head at its European clearing business.

Lee Betsil, the current head of CME Clearing Europe, is expected to return to the US over the summer and the Chicago-based group plans to replace him with Tina Hasenpusch, the unit s current chief operating officer, according to two people familiar with the situation. Ms Hasnpusch s appointment is dependent on approval by UK regulators, the people said.

CME began clearing off-exchange interest rate swaps to challenge the market incumbent LCH.Clearnet for a share of the $500tn business two years ago, and has expanded to clear commodity, power and energy futures traded on its London-based exchange.

Its clearing house is also testing changes to the way it calculates the margin required to back interest rate swaps and will provide estimates for the impact on open positions to its clearing members later this year. (Philip Stafford, May 21)

Virtu appoints former ICAP Nixon to board

Virtu Financial, the US high-speed electronic market maker, has appointed former ICAP executive John Nixon to its board of directors, effective immediately.

Mr Nixon, who was most recently head of ICAP s US business, left the UK interdealer broker in March after a 16 year career in which he held a range of senior positions.

He had overseen ICAP s fixed income electronic broking business in the US, which covered some of the group s most important revenue-generating desks. His period in charge included the creation of ICAP s electronic over-the-counter interest rate derivatives platform, called iSwap, as well as its new swap execution facility, the new electronic marketplaces mandated by US regulators as they seek to strengthen global OTC markets.

Virtu lifted the lid on some modern high-speed trading practices when it floated on Nasdaq last month, with an equity market capitalisation of just under 3bn.

 I have known John during his successful career at ICAP and always relied on his integrity and judgment. We look forward to benefiting from his insights on the board as well as his deep and long term relationships,  said Vinnie Viola, Virtu s executive chairman, in a statement.

Business
Family Leave Gaining Momentum in the Workplace; Big changes at blue-chip companies last year changed life for a lot of new parents

Big changes at blue-chip companies last year changed life for a lot of new parents, but there is still a long way to go.

Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Accenture, Netflix Inc., Blackstone Group LP, Nestl SA and others have expanded paid leave for new parents and added benefits such as shipping breast milk and paying for family nannies to travel with employees on business trips.

At Netflix, employees can take up to a year of paid leave to care for a child, while Amazon also increased time off for fathers and adoptive parents, in addition to birth mothers.

Benefits experts say that trend will continue in 2016, as companies court millennial employees who are beginning to start families and seeking roles that allow greater flexibility.

Experts also expect to see more workers thinking beyond leave, figuring out ways employees can balance the demands of work and family after they return to the job. Accenture allows new parents to cut back on business travel during that first year, and private-equity firm KKR & Co. and investment bank Credit Suisse Group AG now pay for infants and child care providers to travel with new parents who have to be on the road.

The big question in 2016 will be whether new parents will take those extended leaves and what happens when they return to the office.

 It's one thing to offer a benefit, but if employees feel like they can't take advantage of it, it's not doing them any good," says Karen Rubin, managing director, North America, of Talking Talent, which provides coaching to firms such as Deutsche Bank, Bank of America and McKinsey & Co. on family leave transitions.

Some firms, such as Credit Suisse are using data analytics to carefully track whether changes to its leave policy have an impact when it comes to retaining and hiring women. Returning from a maternity leave is a turning point that often results in attrition for female employees, human resources leaders say.

To ease workers' qualms about taking long leaves, KKR, Credit Suisse and others are introducing parental-leave coaching to train both parents and managers as to how to handle monthslong leaves.

Company executives and bosses must set the tone by applauding or promoting employees who take leaves, or by taking significant leaves themselves, say work-and-family experts and HR consultants.

Facebook Inc. founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg won plaudits after announcing he would take a two-month paternity leave following the birth of his daughter late last year, a long time for a chief executive but less than the four months of paid leave the company offers to all employees.

Yahoo Inc. chief Marissa Mayer said she would take only a  limited time away" following the birth of her twins in December. Her decision has been criticized by some, but she may have had little choice as Yahoo goes through a critical period where it is considering a sale of its core businesses.

Under Ms. Mayer, however, the company expanded paid leave to as much as 16 weeks.

As of now, most companies pumping up parental benefits are in fields such as technology and finance, where the fight for talent is fierce and where women are underrepresented. Less progress is being made in companies with a more diversified workforce.

Only about 13% of workers have access to paid family leave, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data and the U.S. remains one of few countries not to mandate paid leave for mothers.

Washington, D.C., is weighing one of the most generous family-leave measure in the country, which would require employers to offer 16 weeks of paid leave to care for a newborn or sick family member. The bill, however, faces opposition from some businesses that contend a mandate would be burdensome.

Paid-leave laws are floating around Congress and the issue is a centerpiece of Democratic presidential candidates' platforms. In this election year, however, individual businesses and municipalities are likely to be the ones driving the biggest changes.

The Property Report
Korean Fund Part of Berlin Deal

Brookfield Property Partners LP has bought another slice of a European capital city, in partnership with an Asian sovereign-wealth fund.

A person familiar with the deal said the Canadian firm has joined with state-backed Korea Investment Corp. to buy 17 buildings on Potsdamer Platz, a major public square in central Berlin, for 1.3 billion euros ($1.4 billion) from Germany-based Savills Fund Management GmbH.

Brookfield said its joint-venture partner was "an Asian sovereign-wealth fund."

Representatives of the company weren't available for further comment.

Brookfield said in November that it had agreed to acquire the properties there in principle for around 1.3 billion euros.

Potsdamer Platz, at the intersection of five of the German capital city's busiest streets, is home to 480 companies, as well as homes, shops, restaurants and cafes.

Brookfield bought a major London business district, Canary Wharf, last March together with Qatar's state-backed investment fund for GBP 2.6 billion ($3.8 billion).

The large deals helped to make Brookfield the biggest buyer of European real estate in 2015, according to data-provider Real Capital Analytics. Including the Berlin deal, the firm has been involved in $9.2 billion worth of transactions in the past 12 months, the data show.

"Potsdamer Platz is one of the world's iconic properties, and we are pleased to be adding it to Brookfield's growing portfolio of world-class assets," Ric Clark, chairman of Brookfield Property Partners, said in a statement.

Low interest rates have made returns on real estate look attractive to investors, compared with bonds and other assets, and commercial-property markets world-wide have heated up as a result in the past year.

Investors broadly expect the demand to continue in 2016, according to a survey by real-estate broker Colliers International.

More than half of the roughly 600 investors surveyed said they intended to increase property holdings this year, while 11% indicated they planned to reduce exposure to the sector.

In Europe, investors' hunt for returns "do not appear to have dissipated as a key driver of global demand," the Colliers report from December said.

Just because the amount of jargon which sprouts from the mouths of technologists and bankers needs occasional lambasting, here s a transcript of "http://tabbforum.com/videos/google-is-intensely-focused-on-financial-services-corrie-elston?utm_campaign=4e8bb88403-UA-12160392-1&utm_medium=email&utm_source=TabbFORUM%20Alerts&utm_term=0_29f4b8f8f1-4e8bb88403-271082638&ticket=ST-14519358223215-z7X1kDFEz51rEPCfXyHVYU9iV9I62iATDLLGietf" with technologist-turned-banker-turned-technologist Corrie Elston, CTO of financial services for Google Cloud Platform (formerly a technologist at Goldman Sachs) by Alexander Tabb, Tabb group founder and COO, on how excited Google is about getting into financial services in the next few years.

FWIW Corrie appears throughout in standard issue  do no evil  apparel   perhaps because there s nothing like a goofy corporate T-shirt to take minds off critically evaluating the underlying dialogue in favour of simply thinking about cats on the internet or colourful inflatable furniture? Who knows?

Either way the caption reads  Fintech Barbarians at the Gate    which is funny because, well, go see "https://dizzynomics.wordpress.com/2015/01/06/whhbwha-gothic-noble-wolf-edition/"of Ataulf the Visigoth leader who succeeded Alaric, the original sacker of Rome, for the irony.

Transcript follows (meaningless jargon in red):

TABB: The big news today at MarketTech appears to be that Google is really very interested in financial services, in the institutional capital markets and we re very excited about that.

ELSTON: Absolutely. We are very focused on financial services, one of the small number of verticals we are interested in. We are intensely focused on finance.

TABB: With Google making their interests known, where do you see Google and the Google Cloud platform bringing innovation to the markets? We ve had a lot of conversations about cloud, but where do you see innovation and Google s name coming together and cloud in the capital markets?

ELSTON: Google s an innovation company, its history is predicated on innovation and there s a lot of different ways that we can help financial services sort of capitalise, move more quickly, be more agile: there s infrastructure, you can spin up structure which is both performance and cost effective very easily. Even more importantly in some ways you can spin it back down again just as quickly, there s value added services on top of it like Big Query and Data flow, and Big Table in Google s cloud platform, whereby you can profit from some of the internal tools that Google s developed over the years. So there s infrastructure, there s products. There s also approach and best practices &

TABB: I d like to talk to you about that because a lot of your competitors in the market are well known competitors in this space, often times talk about the financial aspect. But we want to talk about the innovative aspect of it and the approach. How does Google approach this market, this vertical, that would set it in a leadership position?

ELSTON: Well, we want a close relationship with financial companies, we want that sort of connection with people because we don t just want to change where people do their compute, we want to change how they do their compute. We want people to do differently, to think about analysis differently, to think about the work loads that they are running like risk analytics and simulation, and those sorts of things, we want to change the way people do that, and a lot of the products that we re bringing out in Google cloud platform, like Kubernetes is a way of orchestrating workloads so you don t have to think about oooh how many machines, how many cores, how much memory, you think about it in a different metrics. You think about the compute that you want, how quickly you want to get it done, a small number of ways of classifying this compute and then you do it.

TABB: When we talk about cloud in the financial services one of the topics which always comes up is the question of security. There s a perception that the public cloud is not secure. Yet the data out there shows that the cloud is equally as secure or insecure as institutional data centres. How does Google approach the security question when it comes to cloud?

ELSTON: Google sets a high water mark for security as a technology company. We have 500 plus people focused on security, we build our hardware and software stack from the ground up with security in mind, we build our products with security in mind. Google sets a high water mark for security and I think the perception is changing very quickly is that security is no longer a disadvantage of the cloud, it s an active advantage and differentiator for the cloud, particularly in Google s case, we are using things like homomorphic encryption whereby your data is encrypted at rest, your data is encrypted in flight, your data can stay encrypted whilst it s being processed, encrypted with your own keys, so as well as Google having a set of best practices whereby we can manage keys on your behalf or we don t have to manage the keys on your behalf. You can manage your own key, using your own key management infrastructure, and yet still have it encrypted the entire time.

TABB: Do you see public cloud being able to dislocate or disenfranchise more the front-office aspect of it or is it more the middle office and back office operations which we re talking about in capital markets?

ELSTON: Middle and back-office I put into one broad bucket and I think those are good use cases for the cloud today.



Helpful Translation: We [Google] would like banks to trust us with their mission critical data and processing operations, and are prepared to give them the illusion they still control and can access hardware infrastructure exclusively so as to achieve that objective. Eventually, that way, we can create one happy clappy financial data hub for the whole world, with all the banks dependent on our cloud system. FWIW, maximum trust in us means maximum sharing, and that means maximum potential scaling and the biggest baddest financial vertical of all time. You banks will be familiar with this concept because, well, it s the same concept that underpins banking.

If things go to plan, we might one day be able to migrate entire human souls into the cloud or have all economic activity staged up there. And don t worry about security. Look here s us entrusting you with the keys to your own financial cloud kingdom:

Whatever you bind on your balance sheet on earth will in this way also be bound in our cloud, and whatever you loose on your balance sheet   if you read the terms and conditions properly   will probably not be applicable to us.

And for a more creatively inspired rendition of the interview, there s this:

TABB: God has looked upon the earth and seen it is wicked because of the shoddy financial services and the institutional capital markets still ravaging the system. We re excited about this, tell us more?

ELSTON: Absolutely. God saith to me, his personal representative on this physical plane (you know me because of my regalia), that he is very focused on purifying the wicked financial services, for it is indeed one of the few verticals he envisages being a direct path to eternal life in the heavenly cloud platform.

TABB: With God making his interests known, where do you see God and his heavenly cloud kingdom bringing purification to the markets? We ve had a lot of conversations about heavenly kingdom platforms, but where do you see God the innovation spirit and God the Alpha bet coming together in the capital markets?

ELSTON: God is a spiritual enterprise, his history is predicated on redeeming the financial coupon of the soul and there s a lot of different ways that He can help financial services, sort of, capitalise and move more quickly, be more agile in obtaining that goal: for example, there s the infrastructure, the data temples, which can spin up the souls of the faithful on demand. Even more importantly you can spin them back down to earth in a violent thunder bolt to hell whenever you so wish (especially if they don t meet the requirements of your T&Cs). Then there s value added services on top of it for those who get into the heavenly cloud platform, like the ability to Big Query God s heavenly database at any time or sit at his Big Heavenly Table   something which will help you profit from some of the internal tools that God has developed over the years to better battle Satan and fend off Apple-related challenges from the Database of Knowledge. So there s the heavenly infrastructure, there s the heavenly products, like eternal life and security, there s also approach and best practices & [See our Terms & Commandments for Best Practice Approaches]

TABB: I d like to talk to you about that because there s a lot of competing gods in the market these days, who often times talk about the financial soul aspect. But we want to talk about the innovative spiritual soul aspect and the approach. How does your God approach this market, this vertical ascent, that would set it in a leadership position to beat all the other potential gods?

ELSTON: Well, we want a close relationship with financial capital, we want that sort of eternal server connection with people because we don t just want to change where people do their worship, we want to change how they serve. We want people to do it differently, to think about eternal data life differently, to think about how their data lives are dealing with things like sin and temptation, and simulation, and those sorts of things, we want to change the way people do that, and a lot of the products that we re bringing out in Google cloud platform, like the "http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Demystifying-Kubernetes-the-tool-to-manage-Google-scale-workloads-in-the-cloud", your guide and pilot to the eternal after life, is a way of orchestrating workloads so you don t have to think about eughhh how many shepherds you need to guide the flocks &

[Ed - enough already.]

Some perhaps more useful background: Banks, payment companies and financial service companies are amongst a special group of institutions "http://www.computerweekly.com/opinion/Why-banks-are-wary-of-public-clouds" dependence on third parties when it comes to data and processing services for sensitivity/privacy/proprietary reasons; for liability reasons, for trust reasons, regulatory compliance reasons and for mission critical reasons (they can t afford to suffer an outage). Getting banks to commit to the cloud would therefore be major a feat for computing companies because banks don t really want to be another account name at the Google central service.

A few years back there was a lot of scepticism about whether banks would ever adopt cloud services fully. For a flavour of thinking back then see this"https://www.capgemini.com/resource-file-access/resource/pdf/Cloud_Computing_in_Banking.pdf".

Of course, since fintech exploded onto the scene banks have become more open minded about giving shared services a try   notably because in the new regulatory environment, which makes their banking operations much more capital intensive and less profitable, banks can t afford the luxury of in-house systems anymore. They need to find ways to scale their operations and outsourcing computing systems to third parties is the first obvious thing to do. Hence the obsession with fintech solutions which can cut technology costs all round.

While regulators have always "http://www.computerweekly.com/news/2240110502/Financial-services-regulations-holding-banks-back-from-public-cloud-says-UBS-IT-security-chief", the fact that tech companies are making bold marketing claims about how the banks can have their cake and eat it   e.g. scaled up cloud services and full control of the data centres with total security   many are being convinced the risks have now been greatly reduced. Add to that innovations like blockchain, which aim to distribute data amongst multiple entities in a bid to minimise single-point of failure risk, and the regulators become happier still. (Although, surely the more you distribute and replicate the data, the smaller the scaling cost advantage?)

In any case, banks which want to stay profitable and ahead of the game in the new environment only have three choices: Put all their eggs in one reputable basket for maximum cost advantage (but also maximum concentrated trust risk); distribute their eggs across a number of less well known providers whilst keeping a few at home as well (a cautious testing approach, which might disadvantage them in the short run vs entities that go with the first approach); trust in the power of encryption completely and distribute their eggs to totally anonymous third parties with no accountability (maximum quantum computing breaks all encryption codes one day risk).

There is a fourth option of course: operate just as you are doing today   i.e. less profitably but also with less potential unknown unknown systemic risk.

Sovereign-Wealth Funds Agree to Invest $380 Million in Italian Property; Funds picking up Italian real estate as the nation s economy recovers

LONDON Sovereign-wealth funds are picking up Italian real estate as the nation's economy recovers.

Government investment funds in Azerbaijan, Abu Dhabi and Qatar in the past two weeks have agreed to invest a combined  ¬350 million ($380 million) to buy and develop three separate properties in Milan, according to a person familiar with the transactions.

The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority is buying a 1960s building that will be demolished to make way for a new tower, and the State Oil Fund of the Republic of Azerbaijan is buying a building from the Italian chamber of commerce, the person said. On Dec. 22, the Qatar Investment Authority agreed to buy a property from BNP Paribas SA.

The purchase prices weren't disclosed. The  ¬350 million includes the cost of redeveloping the three sites. All three will be managed by Italian property company Coima SGR, the person said.

Fannie and Freddie Give Birth to New Mortgage Bond; Government hopes to get taxpayers off the hook if another mortgage crisis arrives

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are turning to crisis-era tools to reduce their exposure to mortgage losses and spark a new market for financing home buyers.

Beginning in 2016, the two government-controlled housing giants will ramp up sales of a new type of security that will transfer most of the cost of defaults on all but their safest mortgages to private investors.

The securities will be based on the value of a pool of underlying mortgages but only indirectly, making them a derivative similar to those that figured in the financial crisis seven years ago.

The insurance-like products are called Connecticut Avenue Securities by Fannie Mae and Structured Agency Credit Risk by Freddie Mac. Standard-issue bonds from the housing giants protect investors from the risk that home buyers will stop making payments on their loans. With the new securities, however, investors could lose some or all of their principal if the underlying mortgages default.

The effort marks a notable return to financial engineering in housing finance elements of which served useful purposes before bloating in the years leading to the crisis.

The new securities ultimately could help reduce the government's role in mortgages by persuading investors to take on the risk of default. Right now, the U.S. housing market relies almost entirely on guarantees from Fannie, Freddie or other government-backed entities. The companies, along with government agency Ginnie Mae, back most mortgages and issued 96% of all mortgage bonds in the first 10 months of the year, according to trade publication Inside Mortgage Finance.

Banks used to issue hundreds of millions of dollars worth of mortgage bonds that didn't carry Fannie or Freddie's guarantees, but that market dried up after the financial crisis.

Proponents hope the new securities could help restore investors' appetite for mortgage risk. If it works, backers think the securities could become a mainstay of the bond and housing markets over time, perhaps even getting included in the major indexes tracked by bond funds.

 To many people, mortgage credit risk is still a bad word," said Laurie Goodman, director of the Housing Finance Policy Center at the Urban Institute, adding that she isn't optimistic that the market for privately backed mortgage bonds will revive soon.

Fannie and Freddie already have sold about $25 billion of the securities since 2013 to private investors, including money managers such as BlackRock Inc. and Invesco Ltd., hedge funds, real-estate investment trusts and other investors.

Earlier this month, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which regulates Fannie and Freddie, set a goal for the companies to transfer most of their risk on many of the new mortgages they back to private investors. The guidance covers mortgages of more than 20 years where homeowners make less than a 40% down payment and says the companies should lay off the risk on 90% of the unpaid principal balance.

Fannie and Freddie don't make loans. They buy them from lenders, wrap them into securities and guarantee to make investors whole if the mortgages default.

In practice, that has meant that investors have taken on the risk of losses if interest rates rise but have left the government with the risk if borrowers default. The new securities along with other methods Fannie and Freddie use to lay off risk mean that the government is increasingly transferring that default risk to private investors as well.

The new securities allocate the risk of default to different tranches. The housing giants typically hold the safest tranche and the riskiest tranche. Investors can buy those in the middle based on their risk and return appetites.

For example, in June, Freddie Mac sold $950 million of Stacrs covering $18.4 billion of Freddie-backed loans. If a severe housing downturn emerged in a few years, those mortgages could be expected to suffer a 2% loss, said Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi. Without the protection conferred by the securities, Freddie would be hit with losses of $368 million. Instead under the terms of the June deal, Freddie would lose only $143 million, while the private investors would lose $225 million, Mr. Zandi said.

In exchange for taking that risk, in that deal investors got yields of between 1.15 percentage points and 7.55 percentage points above a benchmark short-term interest rate.

Some market watchers note that the companies' programs still are nascent and that the market has yet to show how much appetite it has for the new securities. Fannie and Freddie's early deals only protected them from losses beyond a certain level, though the companies have begun to sell  first-loss risk" as well.

 We're going from no place to some place," said Lewis Ranieri, the financier who co-invented the mortgage-backed security.  There's still a question of whether [the securities sales] can be expanded to really provide the goal of making the government the guarantor of last resort."

Among other outstanding questions are at what price investors will buy the securities in times of market stress and how much issuance it will take until the securities easily trade on the open market. Right now, the debt trades infrequently and tends to stay with the investor who first bought it. New capital standards have caused banks to pull back from dealing in all sorts of bonds, cutting off that avenue for trading as well.

Although BlackRock has bought portions of the Fannie and Freddie deals, it has done so on a limited basis, said Kevin Chavers, BlackRock's managing director, on a panel this month hosted by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a trade group.

BlackRock's  primary concerns are the lack of liquidity in that marketplace and the lack of liquidity is largely driven by the capital requirements that dealers are required to maintain," Mr. Chavers said.

Hedge funds and money managers have made up the bulk of the earliest investors, with REITS, banks and insurance companies participating to a lesser extent.

Over the next year, proponents of the risk-sharing deals hope for the development of some of the features of a more mature market. New York-based Vista Capital Advisors, a financial-products company specializing in the corporate- bond market, hopes to release indexes based on the Fannie and Freddie bonds early next year, said Richard MacWilliams, managing partner at Vista.

Vista hopes to release products later in the year based on the indexes that would allow investors to trade Fannie and Freddie's credit risk more easily, Mr. MacWilliams said.

Rate-Rise Winners: Foreign Banks

By Katy Burne

Copyright  2015, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 

Some of the biggest beneficiaries of the Federal Reserve's recent interest-rate increase will be foreign banks.

Units of foreign banks this year received nearly half the roughly $6.25 billion in interest the Fed paid banks on the money, called reserves, they park with the Fed, the central bank's data show. Those institutions control just about 15% of all bank assets in the U.S.

The Fed's interest payments to banks are likely to roughly double next year because in mid-December it raised the rate it pays on reserves to 0.50% from 0.25%. The amounts could rise even more in coming years if the central bank continues lifting the rate, called the interest on excess reserves rate, or IOER.

Foreign banks receive a disproportionate share of the interest payments because they own an outsize share of total reserves.

U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks had $881 billion of reserves as of June 30, according to Fed data, accounting for about 35% of total reserves. Look at the figures away from month-end financial-reporting dates, and the total is even higher: For the week ended Dec. 2, foreign firms had parked closer to $1.2 trillion at the Fed, or 47% of total reserves.

Foreign banks hold relatively more reserves because of a combination of regulations and incentives, analysts said.

U.S.-chartered banks, including those owned by foreign banking companies, pay premiums to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. -- ranging from 0.05% to 0.35% -- based on their assets, including reserves but minus other capital measures. But U.S. lenders that don't take deposits, and firms incorporated overseas whose U.S. operations don't take deposits, don't have to pay FDIC fees.

Both foreign and domestic banks can borrow money overnight at low short-term rates and park them at the Fed at a higher rate, earning a profit or "spread." But for some foreign firms, the spread can be larger because they often don't have to pay the FDIC fees.

To illustrate: Before the Fed's rate increase, banks paid about 0.13% to borrow overnight in the federal-funds market and earned 0.25% on their reserves -- a difference of 0.12 percentage point. A foreign bank could get a spread of 0.12%. Domestic banks that paid FDIC fees of about 0.07% on average on their insured deposits would be left with a spread of about 0.05%.

After the rate increase, both types of banks could pay about 0.35% to borrow overnight and get 0.50% on their reserves. That is a 0.15% spread for some foreign banks. But domestic banks, after paying the FDIC fees, get a roughly 0.08% spread.

The New York branches of Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG each had about $40 billion in reserves at the Fed as of June 30, earning about $100 million in interest.

People familiar with the matter say the extra spread for foreign banks may be offset elsewhere. Units of foreign banks that don't take retail deposits often borrow from other banks in wholesale funding markets that can get adverse regulatory treatment, whereas domestic banks can tap into deposits more cheaply, some of these people said.

Until now, the difference in spreads hasn't been a source of controversy. But it could attract attention as the Fed raises interest rates, which will increase its payments to banks.

Raising the IOER rate to 0.50% from 0.25% will increase the Fed's interest payments to banks to about $13 billion annually, assuming reserves stay at the same level, said Karen Petrou of Federal Financial Analytics Inc.

The Fed is subsidizing both U.S. and foreign banks, said Joseph Gagnon, a former Fed economist now at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, and the latter have a proportionately larger advantage. "I'm surprised it hasn't gotten more attention," Mr. Gagnon said.

A Fed spokesman said, "Payment of interest on reserves is a key tool for setting interest rates at levels appropriate for achieving maximum employment and price stability. We treat all banks that operate in the United States the same."

The Fed started paying interest on reserves in 2008. It plans to use the IOER rate as its primary lever for controlling short-term rates, in part because its postcrisis stimulus policies left markets awash in money, rendering its old tools less effective.

Still, some Fed officials have expressed concern about how it looks to have the central bank making big interest payments to banks.

James Bullard, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, said in an August radio interview that if Congress isn't comfortable with the size of payments to banks, in particular foreign ones, "They should definitely tell us right now, because . . . we would need to change our exit strategy dramatically if we cannot rely on the interest on excess reserves as being a tool of monetary policy."

Highflying big-data company Palantir Technologies Inc. on Wednesday disclosed $200 million in new funding, bringing the total amount from its latest round to $880 million.

The new funding "http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000132165515000004/xslFormDX01/primary_doc.xml", according to a Wednesday filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The 12-year-old startup earlier this month "http://www.wsj.com/articles/palantir-technologies-raises-129-million-in-new-funding-1449704949" to a previously reported $555 million private round that began in July. It "http://www.wsj.com/article_email/big-data-company-palantir-technologies-adds-independent-director-1445554811-lMyQjAxMTE1NzI2MjEyODI2Wj" in October. "http://www.wsj.com/articles/palantir-technologies-raises-450-million-in-new-fundraising-effort-1437690978".

Palantir has completed at least 12 financing rounds totaling $1.9 billion from a diverse a group of investors that includes the U.S. federal government's In-Q-Tel venture-capital firm, Founders Fund and Tiger Global Management, a hedge fund. The number of rounds is unusually large even by the standards of private, venture-backed technology companies that have raised money "http://graphics.wsj.com/billion-dollar-club/".

A Palantir representative didn't immediately respond to request for comment.

The company's data-mining software lets government agencies such as the Central Intelligence Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation quickly visualize relationships among large amounts of data. Its technology crunches phone numbers, bank records, friend lists, photos of license plates and a wide variety of other information.

Palantir reportedly helped the U.S. government track down former al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. More recently, the company has taken on corporate clients in banking, oil and gas and retail. At least half of Palantir's clients are commercial, the company has said.

Gerson Lehrman Gets New Private-Equity Backer; SFW Capital Partners invests $212 million for a stake in the professional learning company

Private-equity firm SFW Capital Partners has invested $212 million for a stake in New York-based professional learning company Gerson Lehrman Group Inc. less than a year after the company's prior backer Silver Lake quietly cashed out.

Gerson Lehrman offers its corporate and nonprofit customers phone consultations and meetings with experts in various industries. The company also offers surveys and customized executive education as well as larger team training and the placement of experts and executives in long-term advisory, operational and board roles.

The company was founded in 1998 and in 2007 received a $200 million investment from Silver Lake, which exited earlier this year. It currently has more than 1,000 employees in 22 offices across 12 countries, although the company's new backers see potential to grow further.

 GLG has many growth opportunities in front of it including expansion of its information product offering and geographic expansion in areas such as Asia and Latin America," said SFW Capital Co-Founder and Partner Roger Freeman.

SFW's investment in the company resulted from a long-standing relationship between the private-equity firm, which focuses on providers of analytics tools and other information services businesses, and GLG, said Mr. Freeman.

 GLG was not actively looking for an investment partner. We reached out to them and initiated a dialogue," said Mr. Freeman. He said that the company then ran a very limited sales process before deciding on Rye, N.Y.-based SFW as its new partner.

The new investment follows a period of heightened regulatory scrutiny of expert networks after several high profile insider trading scandals linked to such experts.

One such scandal involved Mathew Martoma, a portfolio manager at SAC Capital affiliate CR Intrinsic Investors, who is currently serving a nine-year prison sentence for illegally trading on confidential information he received in 2008 from neurology professor Sidney Gilman about an Alzheimer's drug in development at that time.

Dr. Gilman was initially introduced to Mr. Martoma through Gerson Lehrman's expert network, The Wall Street Journal reported in 2012. However, Gerson Lehrman was not targeted in the investigation and Dr. Gilman was not charged in the investigation. Mr. Martoma is appealing his sentence.

For SFW, GLG's compliance program was one of the reasons that the firm decided to invest in the business, which Mr. Freeman said sets the company head and shoulders above the competition.

 We took a very close look at the compliance program and it really does set the standard for compliance in professional learning," he said, noting that a team of over 50 people work on the compliance.  Companies across a wide variety of industries seek out GLG and value its compliance program. We think of it as a competitive advantage and one that customers value."

Mr. Freeman and two additional SFW representatives will join GLG's board as a result of the transaction.

Corrections & Amplifications: Gerson Lehrman Group has more than 1,000 employees. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the number of employees. (Dec. 21)

More Scrutiny for Banks --- Regulators signal they are planning to crack down on commercial real-estate lending

By Ryan Tracy

WASHINGTON -- U.S. regulators sent a strong signal to bankers that they are preparing to crack down on risky commercial-real-estate lending, threatening to force banks to raise capital if necessary as they scrutinize the loans next year.

The Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a joint statement Friday that was the latest in a series of regulatory statements expressing increased concern about the booming sector.

"The agencies have observed substantial growth in many CRE asset and lending markets, increased competitive pressures, rising CRE concentrations in banks, and an easing of CRE underwriting standards," said the three bank regulators, which collectively oversee more than 6,000 U.S. lenders.

Any crackdown could curb banks' ability to continue to extend credit to a fast-growing sector that includes mortgages and other loans secured against property such as offices, condominiums and apartments. Banks' holdings of commercial-real-estate loans reached a record high of $1.769 trillion in the week ended Dec. 2, according to Fed data. Small banks held about $1.1 trillion of that total, a trend that has raised red flags among regulators because some small banks with high commercial-real-estate exposures failed during and after the 2007-08 financial crisis.

At the moment, the quality of that credit appears strong, regulators say. Relatively few borrowers have missed payments, and loan losses are low compared with during the crisis. Bankers also say they know how to manage their risks, and that the chances of not getting repaid are currently lower with the U.S. economy growing steadily. But regulators have begun to worry because of signs lending standards are weakening.

"Bankers with long memories will remember the worst loans are made in the best of times," Comptroller Thomas Curry told reporters on a conference call Wednesday.

Earlier this month, a survey of bank examiners by the comptroller's office found lending standards on commercial-real-estate loans excluding construction loans -- a category that now makes up the bulk of bank portfolios -- eased at 24% of banks in 2013, 37% of banks in 2014 and 36% of banks in 2015. The last time lending standards relaxed at similar rates was in the mid-2000s.

The banking agencies are seeking to avoid a repeat of that period, when a boom and subsequent bust in real-estate lending contributed to bank failures and a broader economic downturn. In a footnote to Friday's statement, the agencies cited a January 2013 report from the FDIC inspector general that found regulators didn't adequately question bank practices and didn't evenly enforce regulatory guidelines in the lead-up to the crisis.

Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said he expects regulators will incorporate a significant downturn in commercial real estate into next year's annual "stress tests" of large U.S. banks, a move that would put pressure on firms to constrain the growth of those portfolios.

"I think it's entirely appropriate," Mr. Zandi said of the regulatory pressure. Commercial-real-estate lending "has done the banking system in more than once over the decades." Any crackdown on banks' commercial-real-estate lending could provide opportunities for nonbank lenders such as private-equity firms and real-estate investment trusts. Nonbanks already have been making headway into real-estate markets, in part because banks are grappling with postcrisis capital requirements that restrict the amount of borrowed money they can use to fund real-estate lending.

Forex algorithms evolve amid fear that risk is keeping pace

Algorithm has been a dirty word this year. In September Volkswagen admitted to installing a "sophisticated software algorithm" on vehicles to cheat emissions tests, and in November Barclays was fined $150m for alleged misuse of its foreign exchange algorithm, writes Paul McClean .

New regulation will soon be in place to manage the potential for "market distortion" that has resulted from the increased use of algorithms in financial markets.

In themselves algorithms are not malicious, and their use is widespread in trading across asset classes.

An algorithm is simply a set of instructions to a computer to carry out a specific task: "buy when the price drops below X"; "offer price Y if the market moves in our favour".

However, with the development of artificial intelligence, algorithms have become more sophisticated and many routinely execute highly complex functions. Pricing For much of the 20th century, if traders wanted to buy large sums of a foreign currency they would pick up the phone. The person at the other end would manually scour the market to find a price and call the trader back with it.

Around the turn of the century banks began to automate this process, facilitated by early algorithms.

A trader could input a request electronically, and the price would come back seconds later after it was calculated by the computer at the other end.

This calculation was based on the instructionsgiven to the computer - the algorithm - and took market conditions into consideration before offering a price. Nowadays algorithms calculate and constantly stream these prices to end users.

Risk transfer Traders use risk-transfer algorithms to place orders without taking on the risk of the market moving against them while the order is being executed.

A trader can lock in an order, without having to worry about the pricethey pay rising in response to the order.

While the order is being placed the risk stays with the middleman, often a bank, which profits by the "spread" between the price at which it buys the dollars and the price at which it sells them.

Within many risk-transfer algorithms, a "last-look" algorithm is built in. This is designed to protect the bank from high-frequency traders who may take advantage of tiny delays in rival machines to game the system.

It also allows the bank to take a final look at the price before confirming the order. This is the kind of algorithm that Barclays is accused of misusing. The bank allegedly refused to honour deals if the market moved against it between the time of the order being placed and executed. Execution If investors are willing to take on more risk, they can avoid paying a bid/offer spread by having an algorithm execute the trade, for a fee.

The algorithm may execute simple instructions, such as, "buy $1m once a minute for 100 minutes from these liquidity providers".

In more complex cases the algorithm may execute a trade over a user-defined time limit, striking when it sees opportunities and remembering which liquidity providers are more reliable than others.

The risk lies with the end user during these trades because the price is not locked in and may fluctuate as the algorithm sources the required liquidity.

Liquidity seekers Coming in 2016, these algorithms are designed to trade during peak liquidity. They use a variety of factors, including historical trade data, to predict when greatest liquidity will occur.

ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND

Wiliams & Glyn

Is Available for Sale

Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC on Wednesday said it is considering selling its Williams & Glyn unit as it races to comply with rules that require it to shed the business by the end of 2017.

Following its government bailout, RBS is required under European Union state-aid rules to spin off 314 branches. These have been regrouped under the brand Williams & Glyn.

RBS had planned an initial public offering of the unit, but after receiving "a number of informal approaches for the business," it said it would now also explore a sale to a competitor.

A plan to sell the branches to Santander UK in 2012 fell through amid concerns about the bank's technology. RBS now has 5,000 staff working on the sale process.

Bloomberg acquires prize benchmarking business; Banks

Bloomberg has snapped up Barclays' index-benchmarking business for about 520m as the US financial-data provider continued to grab unwanted assets from banks.

The deal brings to an end Barclays' two-year effort to sell its risk analytics and index-solutions business, which includes some of the fixed income market's most widely-used indices.

Since the Libor rate-rigging scandal, regulators have put pressure on banks to dispose of their indexing businesses owing to concerns about possible conflicts of interest. Bank-owned indexing businesses sell a range of financial products that rely on data provided by their own trading desk as well from third-party sources such as exchanges.

The Barclays business is regarded as one of the crown jewels of the indexing industry, with billions of dollars of assets in derivatives, structured products, mutual funds and exchange traded funds are tied to the indices. The two sides will maintain a co-branding arrangement on the benchmark indices for an initial term of five years.

"At a time when market structure change is causing increased demand for innovative solutions in fixed income, the industry and our mutual clients will benefit from the combination of these assets," said JP Zammitt, global head of financial products at Bloomberg.

Bloomberg has also bought bond indices and taken control of commodity indices formerly owned by UBS in recent years.

Bloomberg, other indexing providers and exchange operators such as the London Stock Exchange Group have all been aggressively expanding their indexing operations via acquisitions, driving up prices. Last month Intercontinental Exchange, the US exchanges operator, bought Interactive Data Corporation, a valuer of illiquid over-the-counter instruments, for $5.2bn.

Barclays originally bought the indexing business in 2008 along with other parts of the collapsed US investment bank Lehman Brothers.

The UK banks said that the sale would result in a pre-tax gain of about 480m.

The disposal will also raise Barclays' common equity capital ratio by about 10 basis points when the deal completes, probably by mid-2016, it said.

"This transaction is further evidence of the good work we are doing in managing down our non-core assets so that shareholders can feel the full benefit of ownership of Barclays' well-performing core businesses," said Jes Staley , the new chief executive of Barclays.

Barclays is rethinking its near-century long presence in Africa as part of a review led by Jes Staley , its new chief executive.

He has raised questions about the strategic fit of the UK-based bank's African business with the rest of the group, but no decision has been taken yet, according to people familiar with the matter. Barclays declined to comment.

The Barclays review comes after investor confidence in South Africa was shaken by President Jacob Zuma's decision to change his finance minister twice in less than a week at a time when the economy is under severe stress. Mr Staley took charge of Barclays at the start of December. The former JPMorgan Chase executive is examining the bank's overall strategy and is expected to present his plans to investors around the time of its annual results on March 1.

The bank yesterday agreed to sell Barclays Risk Analytics and Index Solutions, which includes widely tracked indices for bond investors, to Bloomberg for 520m. Mr Staley said the deal was part of a plan to scale back non-core assets.

Barclays has had operations in Africa for almost 100 years, but the recent contribution of the business to overall group profits has been hit by the devaluation of the South African rand against sterling. The African unit's return on equity was 9.3 per cent last year - below the bank's target of 11 per cent.

Mr Staley , who plans to visit Africa in his first trip outside the US and UK, is unlikely to pull out of the continent, people familiar with the matter said.

But Barclays could decide to sell its retail banking operations in much of the continent, including South Africa, Kenya, Mauritius, Botswana and Zambia, while keeping some corporate and investment banking activities. It owns 62 per cent of Barclays Africa Group Limited, which is listed in Johannesburg and controls the group's main operations in the continent, including Absa, a South African bank it bought in 2005.

Investment bankers said if Barclays decided to retreat from Africa it could sell BAGL shares into the market or trigger domestic consolidation by selling the stake to a local rival, such as Standard Bank, Nedbank or FirstRand. Another option they said was being considered was to spin off the Africa business by giving shares in BAGL to existing Barclays shareholders.

One potentially interested party is Atlas Mara, the acquisition vehicle set up by former Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond to buy African lenders.

ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND

Williams & Glyn

Is Available for Sale

Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC said it is considering selling its Williams & Glyn unit as it races to comply with rules that require it to shed the business by the end of 2017.

Following its government bailout, RBS is required under European Union state-aid rules to spin off 314 branches. These have been regrouped under the brand Williams & Glyn.

RBS had planned an initial public offering of the unit, but after receiving "a number of informal approaches for the business," it said it would now also explore a sale to a competitor.

A plan to sell the branches to Santander UK in 2012 fell through amid concerns about the bank's technology.

Bloomberg, the data and news company founded by the three-time New York Mayor, has acquired a series of financial market indices from Barclays.

The UK bank has agreed to sell Barclays Risk Analytics and Index Solutions to New York-based Bloomberg for 520m. Barclays said on Wednesday that it has:

Agreed to continue to operate POINT for 18 months post completion in order to help clients transition to other providers, including Bloomberg s PORT product. Barclays will retain its quantitative investment strategy index

business, with calculation and maintenance of its strategy indices outsourced to Bloomberg.

The business, which includes widely tracked indices for bond investors, has reportedly been up for sale for over a year. Jes Staley, Barclays  new chief executive, said offloading the business was part of a plan to scale back non-core assets.

Martin Arnold, the FT s banking editor, earlier reported that "http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/ebc2ff20-a356-11e5-bc70-7ff6d4fd203a.html#axzz3uOymuPqH"

Markets
Natural-Gas Prices Drop to Lowest Level Since 1999; Demand has been curtailed sharply by warm weather in the U.S., caused by El Nio

 Natural-gas prices dropped to the lowest level since 1999, as concerns about weak demand continued to weigh on the market.

Futures for January delivery settled down 7.2 cents, or 3.8%, on Tuesday at $1.822 a million British thermal units, the lowest settlement since March 24, 1999.

On an inflation-adjusted basis, Tuesday's settlement price is the second-lowest on record. The inflation-adjusted record low is $1.80/MMBTU, reached in January 1992.

Gas futures have fallen for five consecutive sessions as higher-than-average temperatures show no sign of letting up. Warm weather in the U.S. caused by the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/el-nino-to-last-into-middle-of-2016-1448358886"has sharply limited demand for the heating fuel this year.

About half of U.S. households use natural gas as their primary heating source.

 The potential for early winter is gone," said Donald Morton, senior vice president at Herbert J. Sims & Co., who runs an energy-trading desk.  They're talking 65 degrees in New York on Christmas day. &Every day we go is one less day of demand."

The natural-gas market is oversupplied due to weak demand and continued robust production. Stockpiles stood at 3.88 trillion cubic feet as of Dec. 4, near the record high reached last month and 6.5% above average levels for this time of year. Some traders and analysts say the industry could run out of storage space for gas by mid-2016.

Weather forecasts released Tuesday showed warmer temperatures in the next two weeks than previously forecast. 

Analysts say that even if a bout of cold weather arrives, there is ample gas in storage to meet any spike in consumption.

 There's a lot of negative sentiment out there right now," said Jim Calhoun, trader at Twin Eagle Resource Management in Houston.  The longer this warm winter goes on, the more bullets we have to shoot at any cold temperatures that come our way."

What is considered the winter-heating season in the gas market already has begun. 

Natural-gas producers have gotten increasingly efficient in recent years as a boom in shale-gas drilling pushed output to record highs and kept prices subdued. Analytics firm Platts Bentek, a unit of McGraw Hill Financial Inc., expects natural-gas production in the lower 48 states to average 72 billion cubic feet a day this year, up more than 4% from 2014.

Energy producers also are suffering from low prices for crude oil and natural-gas liquids such as propane, which they produce alongside natural gas.

Money managers, including hedge funds, have held a large net bet in recent months that natural-gas prices would fall, though they reduced their wagers on falling prices in the week ended Dec. 8, according to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

The VelocityShares 3x Inverse Natural Gas exchange-traded note, which is available to retail investors and offers outsize gains if natural-gas futures fall, is up 76% this month.

COMPANIES
The former big beasts of Wall Street who are shaking up banking with fintech investments; Having made fortunes in traditional finance, these star names are busy disrupting their old industry via technology

They made their name on Wall Street. Now, they are trying to disrupt it.

Some of world's highest profile bankers have poured millions of dollars into the booming fintech sector during the past year as they tap into new tech-nology providing online financial services from payments and lending to digital currencies and cross-border transfers.

This month Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan banker who pioneered the use of complex derivatives, was said to have turned down the job of running Barclays to focus on Digital Asset Holdings, a New York-based start-up designed to accelerate derivatives trading by using technology associated with bitcoin.

Other luminaries who have swapped banking for fintech with the aim of challenging traditional businesses include Vikram Pandit , the former chief executive of Citigroup and John Mack , the ex-boss of Morgan Stanley.

Hans Morris , the former president of Visa, who launched Nyca Partners last year to finance and advise fintech start-ups, said Wall Street's top bankers had been attracted by the scope to develop new, nimble products without being held back by the intense new regulation required at traditional banks.

"The clich would be 'regulation is driving me crazy'. It's not like that," said Mr Morris. "It is the scale of what has been asked and the constant wave of new regulatory initiatives. That's what gets you down."

Free of stringent regulation and legacy IT systems, fintech, has become one of this year's hottest sectors, with start-ups attracting billions of dollars of investment. In the third quarter alone, global investment into venture-backed fintech companies such as marketplace lending hit a record $4.85bn, according to CB Insights, a data provider to the venture-capital industry.

Goldman Sachs has estimated that the emerging fintech industry could attack more than $4.7tn in revenue and $47bn in profit from traditional lenders.

The flood of money into the sector has also pushed up the valuations of start-ups, with several, including Funding Circle and TransferWise, achieving so-called "unicorn" status worth $1bn or more.

Below, we look at some of the movers who are shaking up the old-world of finance.

Vikram Pandit, former Citigroup CEO

Since he was ousted from Citi in 2012, Vikram Pandit has become one of the most prolific investors in fintech start-ups. The Indian-born banker steered Citi through the financial crisis, but now his investments are in companies that are trying to wrest business from established banks.

Among the 58-year-old's investments is CommonBond, an online provider of student loans. It raised more than $100m in debt and equity from investors including Mr Pandit in September 2013. The company says a typical CommonBond customer - 32 years old with a FICO credit score around 770 and a six-figure salary - pays about $14,000 less over the lifetime of the loan, compared with a government programme.

Mr Pandit was among a group of investors that in 2013 ploughed $2.7m into Orchard, a data and infrastructure provider for the marketplace lending sector, which also counts former Goldman Sachs co-president Jon Winkelried as an investor.

His fintech portfolio also includes MMKT Exchange, which is developing technology to improve liquidity in the secondary market for loans. More recently, this year Mr Pandit made an undisclosed investment during the $58m fundraising round for TransferWise which valued the cross-border payments company at almost $1bn.

John Mack, former Morgan Stanley CEO

John Mack wasted little time in trying to shake-up the very business at which he spent more than three decades. Since stepping down as chief executive of Morgan Stanley in 2011, he has invested in a clutch of fintech companies, including Lending Club and Orchard.

The 71-year-old banker was one of an array of high-profile investors who helped raise $130m for Dataminr, which analyses social media to create alerts for traders, in March 2015. The fundraising valued the company at about $700m.

Along with the former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers and several prominent venture capitalists, Mr Mack also sits on the board of Lending Club. His 2.4m shares in the marketplace lender were valued at $36m when it floated on the New York Stock Exchange in December 2014, but are now worth just under $33m as the company's shares have slipped in their first year of trading.

In September, Mr Mack participated in a $10m initial funding round for the credit-rating start-up NEFT, or New England Funding Technologies. The company, which hopes to launch its first product, the mPowerCredit platform, in 2016, allows borrowers to update credit scores in real-time.

Joe Saunders, former Visa CEO

After a long career in the credit card business, Joe Saunders, 69, was appointed as chief executive of global technology and payments company Visa in 2007. He steered the group to its initial public offering on Nasdaq in 2008, then the largest in US history , before retiring in 2012. A year later, he helped launch Green Visor Capital, a venture capital firm focused on early stage fintech companies.

"Over the last few years, the changes brought about by the adoption of new technologies has been dramatic and will only accelerate in the months ahead," Mr Saunders said this year.

In September 2015, Green Visor led a $1.5m investment round in payments start-up Kash, as San-Francisco-based company which aims to disrupt established credit card networks. As part of that fundraising, Mr Saunders joined the board as chairman.

That same month, Green Visor also participated in the $8m venture financing round for Cloud Lending Solutions, a technology provider to marketplace lenders and other finance companies. Other investments include DataFox, the next generation research and analytics platform, which raised $5m in July.

Hans Morris, ex-Citigroup banker and ex-Visa president

Hans Morris spent 27 years at Citigroup, rising to become the US bank's chief financial officer and head of finance, technology and operations for Citi Markets and Banking. He left to become president of Visa from 2007 to 2009 before moving to private equity group General Atlantic in 2010.

It was there that he became exposed to "innovation" which led him to found tech venture capital firm Nyca Partners in 2014 with a plan to invest $20-25m over 18 months in financial technology companies focusing on alternative consumer credit, merchant payment solutions and financial infrastructure software.

"We bring together expertise on the financial system with lots of Silicon Valley connections," Mr Morris said at the time.

In addition, Nyca has invested in Indiegogo, a crowdfunding platform that competes with Kickstarter, and Affirm, a company founded by Max Levchin, PayPal co-founder and former chairman of Yelp, that seeks to create a new way for consumers to apply for short-term credit.

Mr Morris is also an investor alongside Vikram Pandit in CommonBond. He held a $4.3m stake, or almost 290,000 shares, in LendingClub at the time of its IPO and sits on the lender's board.

Blythe Masters, former JPMorgan banker

A former JPMorgan veteran, Blythe Masters made her name as a pioneer of credit default swaps, the instruments that became infamous for helping to fuel the mortgage crisis of 2008.

Since leaving the US bank in April 2014, Ms Masters has become one of the most outspoken Wall Street advocates for blockchain , the database technology that underpins the controversial digital currency bitcoin.

In 2015, she joined blockchain start-up Digital Asset Holdings as chief executive, to create products to streamline slow, paper-based parts of the financial services machinery, such as settlement.

The company has made several acquisitions since the beginning of the year, including buying San Francisco-based Hyperledger and Budapest-based Bits of Proof for undisclosed amounts. In October, Digital Asset Holdings bought Blockstack.io, which aimed to provide private blockchain services to the world's finance industry.

That same month, Green Visor also participated in the $8m venture financing round for Cloud Lending Solutions, a technology provider to marketplace lenders and other finance companies. Other investments include DataFox, the research and analytics platform, which raised $5m in July.

Hans Morris, former Citigroup banker and ex-Visa president

Hans Morris spent 27 years at Citigroup, rising to become the US bank s chief financial officer and head of finance, technology and operations for Citi Markets and Banking. He left to become president of Visa from 2007 to 2009 before moving to private equity group General Atlantic in 2010.

In 2014 he founded tech venture capital firm Nyca Partners with a plan to invest $20m-$25m over 18 months in financial technology companies focusing on alternative consumer credit, merchant payment solutions and financial infrastructure software.  We bring together expertise on the financial system with lots of Silicon Valley connections,  Mr Morris said at the time.

In addition, Nyca has invested in Indiegogo, a crowdfunding platform that competes with Kickstarter, and Affirm, a company founded by Max Levchin, PayPal co-founder and former chairman of Yelp, that seeks to create a new way for consumers to apply for short-term credit.

Mr Morris is also an investor alongside Vikram Pandit in CommonBond. He held a $4.3m stake, or almost 290,000 shares, in Lending Club at the time of its IPO and sits on the lender s board.

Blythe Masters, former JPMorgan banker

A former JPMorgan veteran, Blythe Masters made her name as a pioneer of credit default swaps, the complex instruments which became infamous for helping fuel the mortgage crisis of 2008.

Since leaving the US bank in April 2014, Ms Masters has become one of the most outspoken Wall Street advocates for blockchain, the database technology that underpins the controversial digital currency bitcoin. In 2015, she joined blockchain start-up Digital Asset Holdings as chief executive to create products to streamline slow, paper-based parts of the financial services machinery, such as settlement.

The company has made several acquisitions since the beginning of the year, including buying San Francisco-based Hyperledger and Budapest-based Bits of Proof for undisclosed amounts. In October, Digital Asset Holdings bought Blockstack.io, which aims to provide private blockchain services to the world s finance industry.

Investors place a premium on China insurers; Expectations are high as emerging middle class snaps up cover but lack of consumer awareness remains a challenge

While investors shun China bank stocks over fears of exposure to rising bad debt and a slowing economy, insurance has emerged as a bright spot in the financial sector, with an emerging middle class expected to buy more cover.

China's eight Hong Kong-listed insurers were valued at a median 10.7 times estimated 12-month forward earnings in early December, compared with 5 times for banks and 8.5 times for securities brokers, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Growth expectations are being fuelled by China's low rate of insurance penetration, giving providers room to catch up. Premiums were only 3 per cent of gross domestic product in 2014, compared with 7 per cent in the US and 11 per cent in Japan, according to Swiss Re.

"The insurance industry is brimming with fertile soil. The room for growth is gigantic," analysts at Huatai Securities say.

Chinese bank earnings are stagnant and asset growth is slowing amid a debt hangover from the lending binge that followed the financial crisis. In contrast, insurance premiums grew 20 per cent in the year to October, on pace to reach Rmb2.24tn ($349bn) for the full year.

The government is pushing supportive policies to expand the role of private insurance in filling out the country's patchy social safety net.

"Whether it's infrastructure, medical care, pensions, and even education reform, these all need the insurance industry's participation," Meng Zhaoyi , executive director at China Taiping Insurance, says.

Now the challenge for insurers is managing assets that have swelled to $1.85tn. Long restricted to government bonds, insurers have recently been permitted freer rein, allowing them to seek higher yields and take on greater risk.

Property acquisitions like Anbang Insurance's purchase of New York's Waldorf Astoria Hotel signal the beginning of a wave of outbound investment. Cushman and Wakefield expects Chinese insurers to buy $73bn in foreign real estate by 2019 on top of $13bn invested already.

Insurers have diversified their domestic portfolios to include higher-yielding investment in the shadow banking sector.

"Increased alternative investments make Chinese life insurers' credit profiles more vulnerable to an economic downturn, as these types of investments are generally less liquid than straight bonds and are focused on the infrastructure and real estate sectors," rating agency Fitch says.

Just as China's state-owned banks are forced to lend to unprofitable projects to support government policy priorities, insurers have been pressed into a kind of national service.

At the height of China's summer stock market rout, the insurance regulator introduced long-awaited rule changes allowing insurers to increase their equity allocations. It was a signal that authorities expected the groups to join the "national team" of state-owned financial institutions in propping up the market.

Listed insurers including China Life and Ping An fell shy of earnings forecasts in the third quarter in part due to investment losses from the stock market rout. The market has recovered, which will boost fourth-quarter results.

Beyond investment risk, the main challenge facing insurers is lack of consumer awareness. Most so-called life insurance products are more akin to certificates of deposit, where the customer pays a single, lump-sum premium and is guaranteed a payout in several years' time.

Policymakers and insurers want to promote the sale of protection-type insurance products, where payouts are contingent on death, illness, accidents or disaster. The challenge is overcoming Chinese consumers' reluctance to shell out for a product where a payout is not guaranteed. "Peace of mind" remains an undervalued commodity for Chinese consumers.

"The general public still considers insurance an investment product. So it's not just the life insurance companies that have to change; the culture has to change," says Walkman Lee, partner at KPMG China in Beijing, who leads the firm's insurance consulting practice.

To achieve this shift, the industry needs to overcome questionable sales tactics.

China Life, the country's second-largest insurer by revenue, has a sales staff of 949,000 people. By comparison, US insurer State Farm, which has similar revenue, has only 18,000. That has created unprecedented challenges for training and monitoring.

"The Chinese consumer severely distrusts anyone trying to sell them insurance," says Sam Radwan, partner at Enhance, a consultancy focused on China's insurance industry.

While life insurance accounts for two-thirds of premiums, car insurance is the fastest-growing. Deregulation of car insurance prices has created opportunities for insurers to introduce risk-based pricing based on analytics.

Mr Lee says a few car insurers are experimenting with usage-based insurance, where the customer installs a device in his car that tells insurers how much he drives, and how safely.

"What the insurance industry is growing into is different from what we see today," Mr Radwan says. "You know more or less what the Chinese banking industry will be in the next five years. The insurance industry is still shaping itself."

Big banks feel the pain as brutal cull continues; Sector woes: Jobs

Decline likened to that of telecoms and car industries as regulatory shake-up takes toll

After a brutal seven years, bankers still in their seats at the end of 2014 might well have thought the worst was over. Not so for almost 100,000 of them at the biggest banks.

Analysis by the Financial Times shows that job cuts continued at a ferocious pace this year, with 11 of the biggest European and US banks announcing almost 100,000 new cuts in a year when global economic growth rallied and many banks posted improved earnings.

And it is not over yet. "There is still a long way to go in this," said Brian Ledbetter, head of McKinsey's UK financial services team. He likened the banking sector's decline to that endured by the telecoms and car industries, where he said companies ultimately eliminated 40 per cent of their cost bases.

The cuts announced in 2015 amounted to just over 10 per cent of the 11 banks' workforces at the start of the year, after stripping out the impact of large business units sold or earmarked for sale. European banks dominated.

"European banks are in catch-up mode," said Mike Mayo, a New York-based analyst at CLSA - US banks made heavier cuts sooner, after the 2008 collapse of Lehman plunged the financial sector into crisis. The "multitude of CEO changes among European banks" was a "catalyst" for the European cuts, since "you don't bring in a new CEO for business as usual".

Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Standard Chartered and Barclays all announced new chief executives in 2015. The first three together accounted for almost 30,000 of the cuts.

Barclays imposed a hiring freeze in September and is part way through a plan announced last year to cut 19,000 jobs across the group, including 7,000 in its investment bank. New chief executive Jes Staley is expected to announce faster investment bank cuts on March 1.

Mr Mayo said the three Rs - "revenue, rates and regulation" - would be the main drivers of future cuts. New regulations mean all banks must hold more equity, and that means they have to earn higher profits to keep return on equity (RoE) at the levels investors demand.

Mr Ledbetter said banks were being forced to cut jobs because of the obstacles to carrying out mergers - which could improve their productivity and help them cope with sluggish economic growth, as well as the low revenue that results from ultra low interest rates.

"A lot of these jobs are just going away - they will either be done by machines or not at all," he added.

Hakan Enver, London-based operations director of financial services at recruitment group Morgan McKinley, said regulation was behind many of the cuts announced this year. The impact of new regulations was a key reason for the 12,200 job cuts announced by UniCredit and the 9,000 by Rabobank. Both banks have faced questions over their ability to maintain high enough core equity ratios as new regulations have imposed ever-tougher requirements.

The cuts at retail banks, as well as at investment banks are part of a plan to reduce costs, boost profits and shrink the banks, which should all lead to higher capital ratios.

The flip side of the regulations deluge? In some cases, such as HSBC, the cuts will be offset by hiring in other areas, and overall headcount figures are expected to be flat. "The regulatory-driven disciplines are still very busy [for recruitment], such as compliance, audit and risk," said Mr Enver. "We've also seen huge requirements around technology, particularly big data, and around cyber security."

That is little comfort for the bankers who join the almost 400,000 American finance and insurance workers who lost their jobs between 2007 and 2012, or the 80,000 staff cut by Europe's top 30 banks between 2008 and 2014.

"It's very difficult for Morgan Stanley to have lay-offs right before the holidays," said Mr Mayo. It has cut 1,200 people from its fixed-income unit and back office support for that business, following the bank's worst quarter for bond trading since the financial crisis.

FT REPORT - THE FUTURE OF BANKING
Q&A: the 'absolutely essential' role of technology; Interview: Don Duet

Goldman Sachs' co-head of technology, talks to Ben McLannahan about the crucial role of his unit

The day before Don Duet talked to the FT, Goldman Sachs had promoted 38 managing directors to its technology division. The slew of promotions were, says Mr Duet, a reflection of the "absolutely essential" role his unit plays as the firm grapples with myriad new regulations and looks to push in new business directions.

Goldman's tech division has grown to 9,000 people, plus another 3,000 or so strategists, which is about the same as the entire staff of Facebook. How do you see your mission?

It's about risk management, it's about electronic trading and it's become more and more about algorithmic solutions. All of those are underpinned by deep investments in technological capability.

Our focus is not just on the front side - dealing with clients and markets - but also on how we process those transactions, how we get them through to clearance and settlement and how we meet the absolute requirements of trust that are necessary for moving large sums of money.

What about the new regulations?

The regulatory change that has come since the crisis, with respect to capital, has been a great opportunity for us to really invest deeply in shifting from what was more of an intuitive culture focused on return on equity, to a much more precise culture. Now we're asking exactly how much this trade will cost, and working out exactly how much funding is required for this transaction, and exactly how much capital it will consume on the balance sheet.

Through a data-driven methodology we're trying to bring all those concepts directly up to the point of sale or the transaction. We're moving to a fact-based, data-driven organisation.

Describe Symphony, the new messaging and workflow management tool backed by a host of banks and led by Goldman. Why did you get into it - how big can it get?

It was an opportunity for us to do what we would think of as market structure change within our own industry.

If you think about the world of finance, it is a very community-driven business model. Most people don't think that - they think it is JPMorgan fighting Goldman Sachs.

But the fact is, almost nothing happens in our industry that doesn't involve multiple counterparts, working across many different parts of the ecosystem - exchanges, clearing houses, regulators and so on.

We'd built this Google hang-outs-type architecture for our own purposes, and as we continued to evolve our thinking we felt that there was an opportunity to take that source code, open source it, then create an entity that could actually provide that service for the industry.

That led to the purchase of Perzo (an online chat service start-up) and the formation of an investor community that is now Symphony. We have about 19,000 users internally. What we'd love to see occur over time is for this to be a way to really open the whole picture for innovation in our industry.

If I have an open solution that someone else can use as a basis for their own ideas, then maybe people from outside the financial industry will invest in building solutions that we can all benefit from.

You're also pushing into new areas, with plans to develop an online lending business targeting consumers. Why?

Whether it's demographics-driven or otherwise, you see the world is moving much more into a digital paradigm in many elements of consumer finance.

JPMorgan Chase was recently embarrassed by a big data leak. How are you guarding against hackers?

Cyber security is a huge part of our agenda. In the past, you'd say the biggest threat to a company like Goldman Sachs was a large financial risk management problem, and that probably still is true.

But increasingly, as we are operating in a digital world, it's also about cyber attack, loss of data and so on.

We also believe that security is everybody's job. You can't look at it and say "well, that's the team that makes us safe". Every person we have, every engineer in our division is participating in how they think and design solutions and services to ensure that they're fundamentally secure.

Does that explain all these new MDs in technology?

It's recognised here that the value of a senior person sitting in technology - to really help us drive our business forward - is certainly as valuable as someone in an income-producing seat.

Four of AIG s Highest-Ranking Executives to Depart; Shake-up announced as insurer faces pressure to improve profitability

By Leslie Scism

The Wall Street Journal Online

American International Group Inc. said four of its 15 most-senior executives are departing, continuing an effort by Chief Executive Peter Hancock to realign duties and cut costs as the insurer faces pressure from big investors to improve profitability.

The departures will shrink an advisory committee of high-ranking executives that Mr. Hancock formed shortly after taking over as CEO in September 2014. It will become a 10-member team, down from 15.

The shake-up is "http://www.wsj.com/articles/aig-swings-to-loss-on-lower-investment-income-volatile-markets-1446499151", unveiled last month, to cut up to 23% of AIG's senior management, or as many as 320 positions. Duties of the four departing executives will largely be distributed to executives who are remaining. A fifth executive leaving the advisory committee will stay at the company.

The revamping is aimed at making AIG less complex, more efficient and able to make decisions faster, AIG said in a news release.

Since late October, billionaire investors Carl Icahn and John Paulson made public separate proposals to "http://www.wsj.com/articles/icahn-says-he-has-taken-large-stake-in-aig-encourages-company-to-split-1446038362" into three parts.

The investors say such a breakup would reduce the company's regulatory burden and allow it to return more capital to stockholders through share buybacks. They are also pushing for stepped-up cost-cutting to bring the company's financial results more in line with better-performing peers.

Mr. Hancock has responded publicly that management and the board have reviewed the idea of breaking up the insurer and concluded that such a move "http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2015/11/03/aig-earnings-call-live-analysis/". He has said he wants the company to continue with strategic priorities he has had in place for months, which include further narrowing of AIG's operations with some divestitures.

In the news release Thursday, Mr. Hancock said that AIG is  moving forward with a continued sense of urgency" on top priorities, including the existing goals of narrowing its focus on the most-profitable areas,  growing through innovation," and returning excess capital to shareholders.

Two of the four departing executives have key roles running AIG's core property-casualty insurance operations, where the company has struggled to match the strong financial performance of peers such as Travelers Cos. and ACE Ltd. A third is Chief Financial Officer David Herzog.

Mr. Herzog, 56 years old, isn't leaving as a result of disagreement over financial matters, company spokesman Jon Diat said.  David did not have a conflict with Peter," he said, but instead Mr. Herzog is retiring. He will continue as financial chief through the filing of the company's 2015 annual statements in early 2016. Mr. Herzog will be succeeded by Sid Sankaran, 38, currently the chief risk officer. Mr. Herzog declined to comment.

Many of the changes the company has put in place to improve the unit have yet to pay off, but Mr. Hancock believes they have positioned the company for better results, people familiar with the matter said.

Those changes include the installation of information-technology infrastructure that will better automate some functions and the naming of a new chief underwriting officer who has extensive experience in data analysis. In addition to boosting efficiency, such changes are aimed at incorporating more use of data analytics into evaluation of risks in particular clients or entities to be insured.

AIG has said it would give an update of its strategy in advance of its fourth-quarter earnings report in early February.

AIG, which received a nearly $185 billion government bailout during the financial crisis, is one of three insurers that have been designated  systemically important" by a panel of federal regulators. The designation subjects it to yet-to-be-determined but potentially onerous capital rules.

In announcing the 23% reduction in the ranks of senior managers last month, Mr. Hancock said the company needs  fewer generals on the field," having shrunk dramatically in size over the past several years through divestitures to fully repay its bailout.

Besides Mr. Herzog, those departing the company will be John Q. Doyle, 52, chief executive of the company's big commercial-insurance operations; R. Eric Martinez Jr., 48, who is head of global claims and operations; and Jose A. Hernandez, who is CEO of Asia Pacific region.

Among those gaining added responsibilities will be Robert Schimek, who currently heads the company's Americas region. He will take the title of CEO of commercial operations and assume responsibility for the commercial claims organization, according to the release. Kevin Hogan, currently CEO of consumer insurance operations, will add claims responsibilities, as well.

Also gaining broader duties will be Seraina Maag, currently president and CEO overseeing a part of AIG's international operations, AIG said.

Chief Science Officer Murli Buluswar will leave the executive-leadership team but not the company. Rather than report directly to Mr. Hancock as he does now, he will report to Chief Investment Officer Douglas A. Dachille.

Banks on both sides of the Atlantic are playing up their technology credentials as they strive to get ahead of innovations that could otherwise crush them .

Barclays is using its own version of Dragons' Den to pair up with some of the brightest fintech start-ups across the globe and support them in developing technology that the bank could eventually use.

Three rounds of the project have already been run in London and New York, attracting more than 1,000 entries and leaving Barclays with more than 17 potential new technologies including a payments system for Egypt 's unbanked masses and an analytics tool that mines social media for early warnings on issues such as ATM failures.

Citi became one of the first banks to set up a dedicated innovation unit in 2009. It now has more than 400 staff working between six Citilabs across the globe. Projects include a payment system that made it easier for sub-Saharan governments to collect taxes and a set of analytical tools that helps companies find the most efficient ways to pay their suppliers.

Deutsche Bank is in the final stages of building an innovation network, with sites in Berlin, Silicon Valley and London.

Deutsche's head of innovation, Philip Gilligan, likens the set-up to a "tech start-up within a large organisation".

Blockchain for banks still at the 'gluten' stage; Analysis: Trading room

Everyone is talking about the technology but the route to a common framework is unclear

Transferring the technology that underpins bitcoin from a power point presentation to a prototype is challenging the world's largest investment banks.

According to its adherents, blockchain promises billions of savings as banks automate their payment systems. Freeing even a portion of the funds waiting to be settled could be significant. Vast quantities of collateral and margin are tendered as insurance to back daily trading on financial markets, estimated at between $65bn and $80bn a year, according to Oliver Wyman.

The idea that one of Wall Street's basic functions - moving money through a trusted system - can benefit from the Silicon Valley ethos of sharing information on peer-to-peer networks is one that appeals to some bankers.

Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Barclays, UBS and Deutsche Bank are experimenting with their own technologies and have filed patents . But despite the buzz, there are few working models and a lack of joint adoption .

"Blockchain is a bit like gluten," says Tim Swanson, head of research at R3CEV, a New York start-up backed by 30 banks . "Everyone is talking about it but no one knows what it is in great detail."

Like all fads it could fade unless backed up, he adds. "People have to deliver something within the next 12 to 18 months or they will go back to their existing technology vendors."

Few ideas have caught the industry's attention in recent years as much as blockchain, a digital ledger distributed by a network of computers. Each participant must approve a transaction before it is recorded, in a "chain" of computer code. Cryptography is used to secure the transactions and the details are public.

As the ledger is shared by many parties, it becomes close to impossible to tamper with. Ownership of an asset is immediately transferred to a new owner after authentication and verification, guaranteeing nearly instantaneous execution and settlement.

While the industry has been debating security and other issues - including the use of digital tokens, access to the network and the ability to scale - serious practical challenges remain.

It is not clear how committed banks are to this brave new world and the back-office overhaul it entails.

Aite, a consultancy, has suggested that capital-market spending on blockchain research and development could reach $400m by 2019, from $30m last year.

"In terms of total R&D at banks, it's a drop in the ocean," says Virginie O'Shea, an analyst at Aite. "They don't see it as going to revolutionise their business. It's more speculative than anything. Blockchain is this year's 'big data'."

Lee Braine, of the chief technology office at Barclays investment bank, says the sector is pursuing two avenues: testing technology by experiment, and looking at how it could be made to work across financial services. "This is a great opportunity to set up standards early," he says. "This means common interfaces among common systems."

Multiple chains run internally by banks would need to be linked to "interoperate". Increasingly many accept that independent third parties need to set and co-ordinate standards, the way the GSM standard allowed mobile phone networks to interoperate.

Goldman's patent includes the admission that its technology may need a central party, to which both sides of a trade agree, to act as a co-ordinator.

With an internal blockchain "all you've done is set up an interbank liability", says Peter Randall, chief operating officer of Setl, a UK blockchain start-up , and the former head of the Chi-X Europe share trading venue. "True settlement is where you never have to see the other party again."

Companies such as R3, Setl and Digital Asset Holdings, headed by former JPMorgan banker Blythe Masters , are aiming to become that utility-style operator.

Any such system would have to be grafted on to banks' existing IT and payment systems, some of which have been in place for decades, and meet the requirements of market watchdogs. Regulatory issues include anti-money laundering and trade reporting laws.

"In theory it could bring benefits," says Mr Swanson. "But if we're not rigorous in issues like switching costs and all the 'boring stuff', it won't go anywhere."

Many in the industry say expectations are too high, and favour a long-term, phased approach to putting asset classes on the blockchain. It could start with central bank transfers in the payments system and then move on to settlement of various types of security.

UBS has engaged the UK's Clearmatics to develop a "proof-of-concept" bitcoin settlement token, which settles in central bank money. It is a far cry from bitcoin's founding principle to be a cryptocurrency beyond central bank reach.

"The underlying foundation of financial institutions is to achieve settlement finality in central bank funds," says Mr Randall.

Bond Insurers Balk at Puerto Rico Power Authority Deal; The bond insurers, which include MBIA and Assured Guaranty, are worried about the implications for other commonwealth debt

Talks between Puerto Rico's power authority and bond insurers that back its debt have stalled, highlighting the difficulties the U.S. commonwealth is facing as it negotiates with creditors.

Three months ago, bondholders and lenders agreed to accept losses of 15% as part of an agreement to swap old Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority debt for new bonds with more protections. The insurers are worried about the implications for other Puerto Rico debt and haven't signed on.

These talks between Prepa, as the power authority is known, and bond insurers including MBIA Inc. and Assured Guaranty Ltd. are at an impasse, according to people familiar with the situation. At least one of the insurers has expressed a reluctance to insure some of the new debt, according to one of the people.

The "http://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-to-examine-puerto-rico-effort-to-restructure-some-debts-1449256927"whether Puerto Rico should be allowed to have laws permitting public agencies such as Prepa to restructure debts. That move has given Puerto Rico more leverage over its creditors, who must decide whether it makes more sense to strike debt-relief deals now or after the court decision, analysts and investors say. Neither Puerto Rico nor any of the island's local-government agencies have access to bankruptcy protections.

MBIA and Assured declined to comment on the status of the talks. The Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico said in a statement last week that negotiations  have been delayed by the unyielding attitude" of some creditors, highlighting the need for a legal bankruptcy framework.

Prepa, which has about $8 billion of debt outstanding, said Tuesday it had amended its agreement with bondholders to extend the deadline for the authority to reach a deal with bond insurers to Dec. 17. Prepa's bond trustee said in a filing this week it had $24 million to pay investors, who are owed almost $200 million at the beginning of January.

Bond insurers potentially have more to lose from a debt restructuring than mutual funds or hedge funds. Funds often have the opportunity to scoop up debt below face value and then in some cases can make a profit even in a default. Bond insurers can't sell their risk and don't want to set a precedent in which a utility, which could raise rates to pay debt, restructures instead.

Puerto Rico lawmakers in 2014 passed bankruptcy legislation, which was aimed at public agencies including the power, water and highway authorities. Those entities have around $20 billion in debt outstanding, including Prepa's $8 billion. Bondholders sued and lower courts blocked the law, sending Prepa and its creditors into negotiations without it.

A deal with insurers would mark one of the final steps toward completing the Prepa restructuring, by itself one of the largest in the history of the $3.7 trillion municipal-bond market. Puerto Rico officials have held up the Prepa talks as a potential model for other restructuring.

Yet after more than a year of talks, significant hurdles to a final agreement remain. Puerto Rico must pass separate legislation allowing the deal, requiring lawmakers to hold a special session. Also, the deal requires the new bonds to receive an investment-grade credit rating at a time when Puerto Rico's credit is junk.

 Prepa may indeed represent an unfortunate model for what is to come with other public corporation debts," wrote Matt Fabian, a partner at research firm Municipal Market Analytics, in a Monday report.

Sergio Marxuach, public policy director at the Center for a New Economy in San Juan, said the lengthy talks between Prepa and its creditors demonstrate the difficulty of reaching terms with investors without a legal process. Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla on Wednesday repeated his call for the U.S. Congress to grant Puerto Rico access to such a legal framework at a news conference in Washington.

Bankruptcy protections wouldn't be a panacea to Prepa talks, said Howard Cure, director of municipal research at Evercore Wealth Management. A negotiated agreement would help Prepa maintain access to borrowing, which it needs to convert antiquated facilities to natural gas in order to lower energy prices and stimulate the island's economy.

Banks on both sides of the Atlantic are playing up their technology credentials as they strive to get ahead of innovations that could otherwise crush them.

Barclays is using its own version of Dragons  Den to pair up with some of the brightest fintech start-ups across the globe and support them in developing technology that the bank could eventually use.

Three rounds of the project have already been run in London and New York, attracting more than 1,000 entries and leaving Barclays with more than 17 potential new technologies including a "http://techcrunch.com/2015/04/30/dopay-seed/" s unbanked masses and an analytics tool that mines social media for early warnings on issues such as ATM failures.

 Technology is changing our industry and disrupting our whole industry,  says Derek White, the bank s head of design and innovation.  That s why we re doing this 	. 	. 	. 	We are becoming more like a technology company. 

Citi became one of the first banks to "https://www.siliconrepublic.com/companies/2009/09/30/citi-invests-24m-in-dublin-hi-tech-rd-lab"in 2009.

Purchase of Chi-X unit is rare foray into exchange's former core business

Nasdaq is moving to strengthen its North American equities trading business with the purchase of Chi-X Canada, the country's largest alternative share trading venue.

The US's third-largest equities exchange by market share will pay an undisclosed sum for the Canadian company, which is the main competitor to TMX Group in Canada and handles about a fifth of the order flow of S&P/TSX Composite securities.

Chi-X Canada is being sold by Chi-X Global, a venture backed by a consortium of financial institutions that sets up venues to challenge incumbents in markets around the world, including Japan and Australia.

It had been put up for sale this year after receiving unsolicited approaches.

Chi-X Europe, the first and largest of the group's ventures, was bought by Bats Global Markets for $365m in 2011.

The Canadian move marks a rare foray for Nasdaq back into its former core business of daily equities trading. In recent years it has diversified into trading technology, surveillance, data and corporate services, and has been testing ventures such as private market share dealing and technology to dis-tribute ledgers widely among market participants.

Chi-X Canada and CX2, platforms for cash equities trading, were a "natural fit" for the US exchange, said Thomas Wittman, global head of equities at Nasdaq because many customers were the same entities.

There is also an overlap in the way equities are traded in the US and Canada through a system of registered exchanges, alternative trading systems and dark pools.

As with its US counterpart, margins in the Canadian market have fallen sharply over the past decade, with heightened competition forcing exchanges to look elsewhere for growth.

Mr Wittman said the purchase of Chi-X Canada was a launching point for different types of trading in the region.

"This is not the end game; it is a beginning point," he said. "It won't be just cash equities. We will compete in a broad range of products."

Any asset classes that were markets for Nasdaq in the US were fodder for future business, Mr Wittman added. That included derivatives, exchange traded funds, bonds and futures.

"We have competency and technology in all of these platforms. If there is need and demand from those customers there we can deliver it," he said.

The two groups said the deal would be accretive to Nasdaq earnings when transaction costs were excluded, and would have no material impact on its leverage or strategy for returning cash to shareholders.

In recent years Nasdaq has focused on deals it can "bolt on" to existing businesses. In January it bought Dorsey Wright, a US index provider and analytics group, for $225m. Since the beginning of 2012 the exchange has made $1.3bn of acquisitions. Other deals include eSpeed, a bond trading platform, and SecondMarket, a venue for trading privately held securities.

The Anatomy of a Drug Price --- How Pfizer chose to set the cost of its breast-cancer drug at $9,850 a month

Days before Pfizer Inc. was to set the price for a new breast-cancer drug called Ibrance, it got a surprise: A competitor raised the monthly cost of a rival treatment by nearly a thousand dollars.

Three years of market research -- a stretch that started almost as soon as the new treatment showed promise in the laboratory -- was suddenly in doubt. After carefully calibrating the price to be close to rivals and to keep doctors and insurers happy, Pfizer was left wondering if its list price of $9,850 a month for the pills was too low.

"What do you think if we take that up?" asked Albert Bourla, Pfizer's executive overseeing cancer drugs, speaking to his colleagues at the final price-setting meeting last January.

It was a tricky issue. Drug companies have been reaching for new heights of pricing. They routinely raise the cost of older medicines and then peg new ones to these levels.

Yet Pfizer knew setting a price too high for Ibrance might backfire. It could antagonize doctors and prompt health insurers to make prescribing the pills a cumbersome process with extra paperwork that doctors dislike.

A look at Pfizer's long journey to set Ibrance's price -- a process normally hidden from view -- illuminates the arcane art behind rising U.S. drug prices that are arousing criticism from doctors, employers, members of Congress and the public. A Senate committee is holding a drug-price hearing on Wednesday, focusing on sudden large increases imposed by companies that purchased the rights to drugs developed by others.

The average cost of a branded cancer drug in the U.S. is around $10,000 a month, double the level a decade ago, according to data firm IMS Health. Cancer doctors say high costs are unavoidable because all of the options are pricey.

"I think that says something about where we all are in terms of drug costs: We've gotten used to something that is pretty outrageous," says Eric Winer, who heads the women's cancers division at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.

Pfizer's multistep pricing process shows drugmakers don't just pick a lofty figure out of the air. At the same time, its process yielded a price that bore little relation to the drug industry's oft-cited justification for its prices, the cost of research and development.

Instead, the price that emerged was largely based on a complex analysis of the need for a new drug with this one's particular set of benefits and risks, potential competing drugs, the sentiments of cancer doctors and a shrewd assessment of how health plans were likely to treat the product.

In the end, "we went to the right point where patients get the maximum access, payers will be OK and Pfizer will get the [returns] for a breakthrough product," Dr. Bourla said.

The process began in November 2011 when Mace Rothenberg, a scientist who oversees Pfizer's development of cancer drugs, flew to California to review early clinical-trial data on a laboratory compound.

Then called simply PD-0332991, it grew out of work on proteins that help regulate how cells form and divide. In cancer, some of these can shift into overdrive. The research on this won a Nobel Prize. It also set off a hunt by drugmakers for a way to put the brakes on the overactive proteins, called cyclin-dependent kinases.

Visiting Pfizer labs in La Jolla, Dr. Rothenberg saw a slide with two curves veering far apart. It showed that the length of time before breast-cancer patients' disease progressed was twice as long for those who took Pfizer's compound in addition to an existing drug versus patients getting just the older drug.

"I think we have something special," Dr. Rothenberg told the scientists leading the research.

When he got back to New York, he began talking up the compound to win the internal investment needed to develop it, as well as to involve others who would eventually set a price. Pfizer wasn't going to fund further clinical testing and other development costs if it couldn't anticipate good financial returns from a resulting drug.

In this case, the opportunity was clear. Pfizer's novel compound targeted advanced breast cancer fueled by estrogen -- a disease for which existing therapies, a decade or more old, offered only a modest extension of life. A drug that could do better would fill an unmet need and could be priced accordingly. So in 2012, while scientists continued their work, Pfizer employees on the commercial side started on the market analysis that would eventually lead to a pricing decision.

More clinical results arriving in December 2012 supported the compound's promise, but also showed it was associated with lower counts of infection-fighting blood cells. The studies weren't long enough to answer a key question: whether the compound helped people live longer.

They were encouraging enough to keep the Pfizer pricing team going, though. The team began interviewing cancer doctors, seeking to gauge interest in a possible drug with this one's profile of benefits and risks.

Importantly, Pfizer wanted to know what the oncologists would consider comparable treatments.

Among the doctors consulted was Debu Tripathy, then co-leader of the Women's Cancer Program at the University of Southern California. Dr. Tripathy, now at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, says he was excited about the prospective drug described, though he would have liked to see evidence it extended lives.

For a drug comparison, he says he pointed the company to a widely used breast-cancer drug called Herceptin.

Pfizer's compound "looks about as good as Herceptin. Maybe you should price it like that," Dr. Tripathy recalls telling Pfizer.

Herceptin was much cheaper than most other branded breast-cancer drugs, he knew. It cost about $4,775 a month in late 2013, according to its maker, Roche Holding AG, and data firm Truven Health Analytics.

Dr. Tripathy says Pfizer staffers told him it would be better to compare their compound to newer drugs. These are much costlier than Herceptin.

Pfizer says Herceptin wouldn't have been a good benchmark because it wasn't one of the newest drugs in use and because of differences in how it is taken, the kind of cancer it treats and the length of time it stalls tumor growth.

In 2013, Pfizer hired outside firms to conduct hourlong interviews with more than 125 cancer doctors in six cities, while commercial staffers observed. Doctors said they were impressed, and many said that despite having to monitor patients for infections, they would prescribe "Product X" if the price was reasonable.

Most of the doctors, according to two Pfizer staff members, pointed to three drugs the company should consider as pricing benchmarks: Kadcyla and Perjeta from Roche and Afinitor from Novartis AG.

Like Herceptin, two of these differed from Pfizer's drug in the kind of breast cancer treated and in how they were administered. Only Afinitor closely paralleled Pfizer's compound by attacking the same type of breast cancer and being in pill form.

For all three, the cost of treating a patient for a month was between $9,000 and $12,000, including any other drugs that had to be taken with them. These are list prices, from which health plans and insurers negotiate discounts of 20% or so.

"We're going to be somewhere in this ballpark," a Pfizer staffer involved in the pricing research recalls thinking.

The company wanted a price that would maximize its revenue without deterring health plans or keeping the drug from getting to patients it could help. Dr. Bourla recalls telling staff members in late 2014 that the company had "a moral obligation": The patients had a deadly disease that this drug could help, and "it is our responsibility to get it to them."

It was time to talk to insurers.

Pfizer hired firms that surveyed more than 80 health-plan officials such as medical directors and pharmacists. They were asked what restrictions, if any, they might place on a drug with this one's profile, at various monthly prices from $9,000 to $12,000.

At $11,000 a month, one official said the plan "would definitely require physicians to document medical necessity for Product X," according to a person familiar with the surveys. It was the kind of paperwork obstacle Pfizer wanted to avoid.

Staff members put together a chart estimating the revenue and prescription numbers at various prices similar to those of the three drugs Pfizer had decided to use as benchmarks.

The chart showed a 25% drop in doctors' willingness to prescribe the new drug if it cost more than $10,000 a month. This indicated Pfizer might collect higher returns by charging toward the lower end of its range.

Pfizer also had been talking with the Food and Drug Administration. The agency agreed in late 2014 to a speedy review, without waiting for results from an elaborate "Phase 3" clinical trial, so that patients with life-threatening conditions could get the drug earlier. This sped up the time to market by about two years.

Pfizer took steps to put the drug in patients' hands as fast as possible after FDA approval. Oral cancer medicines aren't dispensed at local drugstores but at specialty pharmacies that help patients gain insurance approvals, remind them to take pills and assist with side effects. Pfizer lined up 24 of these to supply the drug once approved.

Hoping to smooth the drug's way onto health-plan lists of covered medications, Pfizer economists created a dossier containing data on clinical benefits and risks, plus -- important to the plans -- the likely effect on their budgets.

The economists mined electronic health records, drug-prescription tallies and health-insurance claims to estimate the number of prescriptions, costs of treating side effects and monitoring patients for infections, and spending that might be avoided if the drug kept cancer at bay longer.

The economists cited a 2012 report showing that a typical million-member commercial health plan spent $320 per member a month, of which the spending on cancer drugs came to just $4.20. Scenarios they ran indicated the new drug, if priced below $10,000 a month, would increase that spending no more than six cents.

Pfizer staff members staged two mock reviews by health-plan officials. The officials, who were paid for their time, sat around a conference table and simulated a day-long discussion of how to handle a drug such as this one.

Pfizer employees say the mock reviews supported a monthly price below $10,000.If it was higher, insurers could start requiring doctors to fill out paperwork justifying its use.

The staff felt they finally had it. When they met in November 2014 to nail down a price, they picked a figure just below the cutoff: $9,850 a month. This would be the list price, from which health insurers and pharmacy-benefit managers would negotiate discounts and rebates with Pfizer.

The staffers just needed a green light from Dr. Bourla, the executive overseeing cancer drugs.

The price they had picked was well below the cost of treatment involving one of the three benchmark drugs Pfizer had identified. But it was close to the price of the other two, and slightly above the price of the most direct competitor, Novartis's Afinitor.

Then, on Jan. 6, 2015, Novartis raised Afinitor's price 9.9%. Novartis says it adjusts prices to reflect "an evolving health-care and competitive environment," new evidence and the need to support R&D.

The new price for the close rival drug put its monthly price $687 above what Pfizer was planning to charge.

Meeting in Dr. Bourla's New York office three days later, Pfizer staff members mentioned that price increase. Dr. Bourla asked if Pfizer, too, should go higher.

"This may make some plans just not use it, and some will make things difficult and that will frustrate patients," he recalls being told.

Alternatively, Dr. Bourla asked, should Pfizer charge a lower price than it was planning? Would doing so reach substantially more patients? He says staffers told him that a price closer to $9,000 a month wouldn't improve health-plan coverage, and Pfizer would be leaving money on the table.

They were back to $9,850. "Let's go with that," Dr. Bourla said.

On Feb. 3, the FDA approved Ibrance. Within hours, pills were on their way to pharmacies.

Sales are off to a strong start. The drug has been taken by about 18,000 breast-cancer patients so far.

Industry analysts expect Ibrance will eventually bring Pfizer billions of dollars a year in revenue.

Tech's Hometown Bank --- Startup boom and tight bonds fuel Silicon Valley loan surge, but risks loom

TinyCo Inc. was in big trouble last year. The mobile-game startup owed $10 million to Silicon Valley Bank but didn't have the money to pay it off. Company co-founder Suleman Ali was so stressed that he broke out in hives.

Then, Marc Andreessen, the prominent technology investor and one of TinyCo's directors, made a call to Silicon Valley Bank. His firm, Andreessen Horowitz LLC, borrows from the bank, and SVB invests in startups through the giant venture-capital firm.

The bank gave TinyCo six more months to pay back the loan. The gamble worked. TinyCo was able to finish animating the "Stewie" character in its "Family Guy" game, started turning a profit and repaid the $10 million, according to Mr. Ali. Mr. Andreessen wouldn't comment.

Close connections -- and lots of them -- are an essential part of the business strategy at what in many ways is the hometown bank of America's tech industry. When startups get their first investor check, it often gets deposited at the Santa Clara, Calif., bank, which also loans money to startups for working capital.

The bank offers invitation-only mortgages to company founders and venture-capital executives and helps venture-capital firms fund their investments. The bank's parent, SVB Financial Group, owns warrants in 1,625 companies. Warrants give SVB the right to buy shares in those companies.

"It's a whole ecosystem we are building,"says Gregory Becker, president and chief executive of Silicon Valley Bank and SVB.

The boom in technology startups has made SVB one of America's fastest-growing banking companies, with a profit of $263.9 million last year, up from $48 million in 2009. Total assets, including loans, swelled 40% in the last 18 months to about $42 billion at the end of the third quarter.

But strains in the tech market are starting to hit the bank, too. In October, SVB said it expects slower loan growth next year. The volume of loans for which the bank doesn't expect to be fully repaid has nearly tripled since March but still is a tiny percentage of all loans.

Even the bank's fans say its devotion to being in the middle of the money flow in Silicon Valley makes SVB vulnerable to growing uncertainty about the valuations of closely held startups and the chilly environment for recent initial public offerings. More than half of all U.S. venture-capital funds and venture-capital-backed companies are clients.

Borrowers include e-commerce startup Jet.com Inc., which is challenging Amazon.com Inc. and was running low on cash as it raised $350 million of fresh equity last month. Mobile payments startup Square Inc., another SVB customer, went public in November at a value that was less than what some investors paid a year earlier.

"SVBis a long-term player," says Byron Deeter, a partner at venture-capital firm Bessemer Venture Partners, which steers startups to the bank. But "if the music stops, it can stop really fast."

The bank's share price has slipped about 15% since July. Matthew Keating, an analyst at Barclays PLC, expects SVB to write off roughly 0.3% of its loans this year, higher than the 0.15% now widely seen by banks of similar size. An SVB spokeswoman says its write-offs are "in line" with those of large banks.

SVB's chief executive, Mr. Becker, says he worries about the possibility that venture-capital funding could dry up quickly, which could cause SVB's loan portfolio to shrink and loan losses to increase.

Still, the impact would likely be "short-lived" and not "material," Mr. Becker told analysts and investors after the bank's third-quarter results.

There are more than 5,000 banks in the U.S., and many try to form tight relationships with their customers. Those ties can lead to new business for the bank, help solve problems and provide a human touch that financial statements can't.

SVB takes that approach even further. Since opening its first office in San Jose, Calif., in 1983, the bank has done business with tens of thousands of startups, including Cisco Systems Inc., Twitter Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. in their infancies.

Along the way, SVB has learned how to lean on venture-capital firms for leads on potential loans and feedback on existing ones. The SVB spokeswoman says: "It is a data point among many in our decision-making process."

Because of those connections, the bank often is more willing than others to give companies a break on their loans if they run into trouble, according to entrepreneurs and venture capitalists who have done business with SVB.

Some outsiders say showing too much mercy could delay the day of reckoning for some shaky companies and exaggerate the startup boom's health.

"Guess what? Ninety percent of companies are off-plan at some point in their history," replies Mr. Becker of SVB. "Maybe they violate a loan covenant, and then that's when we have the dialogue with the venture capitalists."

Sometimes, help arrives in the form of what Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and venture capitalists call a "runway." That can mean making a loan to a young company between fundraising rounds, extra time to recover from a rough patch or money that keeps the company alive while it is seeking a buyer.

"SVBis the kindest bank in the business," says Martin Pichinson, who has worked withthe bank through Sherwood PartnersInc., the Mountain View, Calif., restructuring firm where he is co-president. "They will work with clients because of their relationship with VCs."

Mr. Ali, TinyCo's co-founder, says the mobile game maker breached covenants on its $10 million loan from SVB, including once at the end of 2013's third quarter. TinyCo couldn't fix the problem for six months.

"No other bank would have waited more than 45 days," he says.

The SVB spokeswoman says: "We worked with the company because we understood the risks and concluded that it made sense to work with them, as evidenced by the outcome."

When borrowers are in financial trouble, SVB often makes a "comfort call" to venture-capital firms that provided funding to the startup. For instance, if the venture-capital firms express willingness to do another funding round, the bank sometimes relaxes loan terms, according to some borrowers.

In 2012, Mamasource Inc., a provider of coupons and discounts to mothers, was spending more than it was bringing in and had violated terms of a $1 million loan from Silicon Valley Bank, says Gary Hagmueller, a former consultant to Mamasource.

He says the bank extended the loan's terms and conditions after placing a "comfort call" to Shasta Ventures, a venture-capital firm that invested in Mamasource and is a client ofSVB's private-equity services group.

"They could have put Mamasource into default. They chose not to," says Mr. Hagmueller, now finance chief at data-analytics software company Ayasdi Inc. He says the loan was paid off when Mamasource was acquired by another company in 2013. SVB declines to comment on the loan.

In general, says Mr. Becker, the bank's CEO, no "guarantees" are made by SVB or venture-capital firms when they stand behind a struggling company. The bank's "dialogue" with venture-capital firms results in a "win-win for both of us," Mr. Becker says.

Lee Kirkpatrick, chief financial officer of Twilio Inc., says the provider of Web-based software for video, text and voice messaging, wanted an additional cash cushion after the $17 million in venture-capital funding it got from Bessemer and Union Square Ventures.

Mr. Kirkpatrickspoke with Mr. Deeter, the Bessemer partner who also is a Twilio director. The two men and Twilio's board agreed that the best plan would be to seek a credit line from SVB until Twilio's next funding round.

The bank declines to comment, but Mr. Kirkpatrick says it provided $1 million. Twilio wound up not needing the credit line and raised $70 million in venture capital in 2013. "The credit line extended our runway going into the next financing," Mr. Kirkpatrick says.

Mr. Deeter says SVB will often "get you to that next milestone, and it's cheaper than raising equity." Twilio's last funding round valued the company at more than $1 billion.

Overall, SVB had revenue of $1.43 billion in 2014, nearly triple its 2009 total of $482 million. Gains on investments made largely through venture-capital funds totaled $49.2 million.

SVB made $71 million on warrants, including from Twitter and FireEye Inc. Both companies borrowed from the bank before going public, granting warrants to SVB as part of their loan agreements. The number of companies in which the bank now holds warrants is up 33% since 2009.

Among venture-capital-backed private companies valued at $1 billion or more, Airbnb Inc. and DocuSign Inc. have been SVB customers. So have Cornerstone OnDemand Inc., Fitbit Inc., TrueCar Inc. and Zendesk Inc., which grew from startups to publicly traded companies.

Through a unit, SVB also manages investments in venture-capital funds that were valued at $1.2 billion at the end of last year. Those investments include some of SVB's own money.

Despite the risks, analysts say the strategy is helping SVB hold off larger rivals such as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Morgan Stanley, which have begun vying for commercial-banking business from startups and venture-capital firms.

For now at least, no other bank can come close to matching the relationships that SVB has throughout Silicon Valley. Sometimes, the result is a loss on a loan made by the bank.

In September 2013, SVB issued a loan-default notice to music website SpinMedia LLC, which owed the bank about $13 million, according to former managers at the company. Venture-capital firms that had poured $120 million into the company said they weren't willing to invest any more money.

Stephen Hansen, SpinMedia's chief executive at the time, says SVB could have "swept" the company's account to collect what the bank was owed.

Instead, the bank sent in a workout team to represent SVB in negotiations to save SpinMedia, the music company's former managers say.

SVB's Mr. Becker also took a call from Allen Beasley, one of his neighbors in the Sharon Heights section of Menlo Park, Calif. The two men are friends, and their sons have played on the same football team.

Mr. Beasley, a partner at venture-capital firm Redpoint Ventures and director at SpinMedia, urged the bank CEO to be patient, people familiar with the situation say. Mr. Beasley said he believed SpinMedia could sell itself.

"SVB became our only option," recalls Mr. Hansen. "Everyone was stuck."

The bank also had done lots of business with the venture-capital firms that were giving up on SpinMedia. New Enterprise Associates has made investments in at least 33 companies alongside SVB, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

One partner at New Enterprise Associates was a board "observer" for SpinMedia, meaning he could attend directors' meetings but not vote. Andrew Sheehan, a partner at Sutter Hill Ventures, was a SpinMedia director.

Mr. Sheehan got a $4.8 million mortgage from SVB in December 2012, real-estate records show. The SVB spokeswoman wouldn't comment on the loan.

In January 2014, SpinMedia accepted an offer from private-equity firm M/C Partners that wiped out the entire equity investment by venture-capital firms and about half of what SpinMedia owed SVB.

SVB suffered a loss of about $7 million, say the people familiar with the transaction. The bank confirms that it took a loss but won't say how much.

"When a situation goes off plan," the SVB spokeswoman says, "we work to maximize repayment of the loan, not to curry favor with anyone." Mr. Beasley and M/C Partners wouldn't comment.

"It turned out not to be inSVB's best interest from a tactical point of view, but from a relationship point of view, it was," says Mr. Hansen, who has launched a website to connect people who share interests like surfing and mountain biking. Silicon Valley Bank "is a bank I want to deal with in the future. They played ball."

US
Supreme Court to Review Puerto Rico Appeal; Lower courts ruled island had no authority to restructure debts unilaterally

WASHINGTON The Supreme Court agreed Friday to review Puerto Rico's moves to restructure public utilities' debts by enacting its own bankruptcy law, stepping into the territory's effort to address its fiscal troubles.

The court took up Puerto Rico's appeal as the U.S. territory continued to struggle over its fiscal situation. The governor this week signed an order allowing the territory to make its latest $355 million debt payment, and it faces an additional $950 million due Jan. 1.

As an unincorporated territory, Puerto Rico lacks the authority that U.S. municipalities hold to "http://www.wsj.com/articles/puerto-rico-treasury-in-talks-to-restructure-islands-debt-1444853744" under section 9 the federal bankruptcy code. To fill that gap, the territorial legislature adopted a law authorizing several public agencies and utilities to discharge most of their debts over their creditors' objection.

 It is hard to overstate the importance of this issue to the future of Puerto Rico and its people," the territory said in its petition to the high court.  The island now finds itself caught in a  death spiral' where it can neither pay nor restructure its debts."

Puerto Rico's law was challenged by bondholders, including the Franklin Funds and BlueMountain Capital Management, which argued federal bankruptcy law pre-empts the Puerto Rico statute. Lower courts agreed.

The Franklin Funds said they and fellow plaintiff Oppenheimer Funds hold approximately $1.56 billion in bonds issued by the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, a utility covered by the challenged statute.

 The holders of Prepa bonds have the right to a receiver to collect the pledged revenues, and the right to compel an increase in electricity rates so that revenues will be sufficient to repay the bonds," the Franklin Funds said in a court brief. Rather than discharge the debt, it called for appointment of a receiver who  can and will keep the lights on, and who also can increase revenues, cut costs and collect debts."

The bondholders include mutual funds holding tax-free state and municipal bonds. Because Puerto Rico bonds are exempts from all state and federal taxes, Franklin and other funds focused on a particular state's municipal bonds have filled out their portfolios with Puerto Rico bonds.

Several investors and analysts said the Supreme Court's move could give Puerto Rico a stronger position as it negotiates with investors about restructuring debts that total more than $70 billion.

John Miller, co-head of fixed income at Nuveen Investment Management LLC., which manages more than $100 billion of municipal bonds, said the court's announcement took many Puerto Rico investors by surprise and may shift leverage toward the commonwealth, particularly in talks around the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, where some bondholders had already agreed to restructuring terms.

 This is an unexpected new twist that definitely does have the potential to put a lot more power in the hands of the government of the commonwealth," he said.

Even though Puerto Rico's law was aimed at agencies such as the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, and not central government obligations, any implication that the island can make its own restructuring laws is a setback for creditors, said Matt Fabian, partner at the research firm Municipal Market Analytics.

The Supreme Court will hear the appeal in early 2016, with a decision expected by June.

Justice Samuel Alito recused himself from the case. He gave no explanation for sitting out the case, as is customary. But his financial disclosures list numerous mutual funds managed by Franklin and other companies, including funds focused on tax-free income.

Corrections & Amplifications

Japan's Ultracheap Megabanks

Japan's top banks are about to start unloading their vast holdings in other companies. This could be the key to improving their ultralow valuations.

Japan's new corporate-governance code, pushed by the government, discourages the kind of cross-shareholdings that have long been a defining feature of corporate Japan. This is especially significant for the nation's lenders, which hold equity stakes in many of their top customers. For instance, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial and Sumitomo Mitsui each has a significant stake in Toyota Motor.

Regulators hope that reducing these holdings will pave the way for a more rational allocation of lending, and eliminate conflicts of interest that arise when a bank is both a shareholder and a creditor of a company.

For the banks, it also means the unwinding of a risk that has hung over their share prices. Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo Mitsui and Mizuho Financial all have equity holdings equivalent to 40% to 50% of their Tier 1 capital, of which a great deal is unrealized valuation gains. This means that any decline in share prices could put pressure on their capital levels.

Last month, the three so-called megabanks unveiled for the first time concrete plans to sell off some of these holdings. They each plan to sell 25% to 30% of their holdings, over roughly the next three to five years, and more afterward. Goldman Sachs analyst Katsunori Tanaka says these targets should be viewed as minimums, and actual sell-downs could happen even faster.

This will replace low-quality capital with hard cash, and boost capital ratios by lowering risk-weighted assets. Excluding unrealized gains on securities, the three have an average common-equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.7%. If they were to sell just a quarter of their equity holdings, this would rise to 9.4%, according to a report by Mr. Tanaka.

Better capital levels could in turn pave the way for more cash returns to shareholders, especially for Mitsubishi UFJ and Sumitomo Mitsui, which have stronger balance sheets.

The three banks trade at between 0.7 and 0.8 times book value, in line with their averages over the past few years. Now that they are finally starting to unwind their shareholdings, the discount to book value is likely to fade. As Japan's megabanks sell, it is time for investors to buy.

BHP: More

Copper at

Lower Cost

Just what the copper market needs: more metal.

BHP Billiton, under fire since the disaster at its Brazilian iron-ore joint venture, Tuesday burnished its credentials when it comes to the red metal, which accounts for about a quarter of its operating profit.

The Anglo-Australian miner boosted its copper production outlook. It expects to maintain output at its biggest mine, Escondida, at 1.2 million metric tons a year for a decade, starting in its fiscal year to June 2017, without any further major investment.

Meanwhile, BHP can increase production from its Spence and Olympic Dam mines slightly. The bottom line is that BHP has effectively added a decent-sized mine to the market, while also improving its margins.

BHP plans to cut average copper costs to $1.08 a pound, down about 15% on forecasts for this fiscal year and more than 45% below the spot price. About half the improvement since fiscal 2012 is due to currency. The rest is from higher volumes and cost cutting.

Near term, this adds low-cost metal to the market. BHP's additions come as about 1.7 million tons of supply from large projects are forecast over the next two years, according to Barclays. The miner's guidance suggests it should produce 180,000 tons more in fiscal 2017 from those three mines than expected, based on Macquarie's forecasts, or 100,000 tons more overall. With BHP's ability to sustain its dividend in question, this is welcome news for the miner. For higher-cost miners, it only adds to the pressure.

Cementing a Win for Bondholders

For China Shanshui Cement's beleaguered bondholders, a near-death experience should turn out to have a somewhat happy ending.

Shareholders on Tuesday voted to replace Shanshui's board, installing in its place handpicked representatives from Shanshui's main cement-making rival and biggest shareholder, Tianrui Group. This included appointing the chairman of China Tianrui Group Cement, Tianrui's listed subsidiary, as Shanshui's chairman.

The episode could prove a decisive win for Tianrui in a prolonged shareholder battle it fought against a handful of China's cement makers.

Bondholders unaccustomed to China's rough-and-tumble offshore bond market would be forgiven for checking their necks for whiplash. Shanshui's $500 million of bonds due in 2020 have skyrocketed in value to near 90 cents on the dollar, according to Lucror Analytics, after a precipitous fall a few weeks ago, when the company defaulted on loans and filed for liquidation in a court in the Cayman Islands, where the listed company is domiciled.

The reason for the rebound: The appointment of new leadership triggers a change-of-control clause in the bonds, compelling early repayment of the bonds at face value. Tianrui says it will make good on this.

Bondholders may feel they aren't out of the woods completely. Days before the shareholder vote, the old Shanshui board said it started legal action in China against Tianrui, alleging Tianrui paid 500 million yuan ($78.2 million) to minority shareholders as an inducement to vote its way. If Shanshui can persuade a court that the payments occurred and were inappropriate, the shareholder vote could be annulled.

More plausibly, courts will see the legal challenge as a last-ditch effort by the old Shanshui board to derail the Tianrui takeover. That would be a similar outcome to the old board's move to seek liquidation, which the Cayman judge rejected. The move was more of a ploy to prevent Tianrui taking over than something done with creditors' interests in mind.

The company now has a month to redeem the bonds. Yet bondholders remain skittish, with the bonds still trading at a discount to the redemption value of 101 cents on the dollar. With signs pointing to Tianrui solidifying its victory, that skittishness seems overplayed.

-- Jasper Moiseiwitsch

Overheard

Chinese investors just poured millions into English champion Manchester City. Getting a piece of China's own elite soccer club won't come cheap either.

Five-time Chinese Super League winner Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao F.C. is seeking to sell as much as 15% of itself on a little-known Beijing stock market that could give the soccer club a market capitalization of $2.8 billion. That is, if it hits the top of its listing range.

If it does, the reigning Asian champion would be among the most valuable soccer clubs in the world, not far behind 20-time English-league winner Manchester United's $3.1 billion. The latest deal for Manchester City put its owner, which also owns two other clubs, at a valuation of around $3 billion.

Evergrande Taobao, 60% owned by property developer Evergrande Real Estate and 40% held by Jack Ma's Alibaba, has won championships, but at a cost. The team has lost money for nearly the past 2 1/2 years, while spending big on World Cup-winning Brazilian coach Luiz Felipe Scolari and former Real Madrid star Robinho.

Not all soccer clubs are losers. Manchester United has reported consistent operating income over the past few years, sometimes bringing in more than $100 million a year. Its New York-listed shares trade at 4 times book value. Evergrande Taobao would issue new shares at 15 times.

Evergrande's stake in the club is booked using the equity method, so a high market value won't create an immediate windfall. But Evergrande, one of China's most indebted developers, could use its stake as collateral for more debt.

It is a beautiful game, indeed.

The Property Report: Unibail Mall Strategy: Big Is Better

Last month, 50,000 shoppers showed up as Unibail-Rodamco SE opened the biggest mall in the Nordic region with fireworks, music, parties and other events billed by the Paris-based real-estate giant as "Stockholm's largest housewarming."

The festivities at the Mall of Scandinavia reflected the splashy side of Europe's largest listed landlord's retail strategy as it tries to cope with competition from online shopping while navigating Europe's uncertain recovery. The strategy's less-exciting side involves selling off smaller shopping centers.

But shoppers and investors are paying more attention to Unibail's strategy to develop malls as leisure destinations.

The Mall of Scandinavia has an IMAX theater, more than 20 restaurants and a "Flagship Avenue" aligned with tony shops sporting facades more than two stories tall. Most days the mall features cooking demonstrations, live music and attractions like rides on a Formula One simulator at the new Boss store.

Close to a quarter of the new mall's 1.1 million square feet is devoted to entertainment and eating, an unusually high percentage. "We want to create destinations where people can spend more time," said Jaap Tonckens, Unibail's chief financial officer."The longer time people stay, the more they spend," Mr. Tonckens said.

About two decades since online shopping took off, Unibail is amping up its effort to show the world that brick and mortar stores are still dominant players in the retail world. The company owns office buildings and convention centers, but retail property accounts for around four-fifths of its portfolio.

And Unibail's shopping-mall development pipeline has never been bigger, according to Green Street Advisors. At 8.2 billion euros ($8.69 billion), the projects under way make up a significant chunk of its overall property portfolio valued at 37.7 billion euros, Green Street said.

The development push comes amid a consumer recovery in Europe thanks in part to inexpensive energy prices and the relatively low value of the euro, which is helping European exports. Growing traffic and sales at stores are boosting the likelihood that landlords can bet on rising rental income.

At the same time, retail landlords are growing increasingly confident that competition from online retail won't have as great an impact on brick-and-mortar stores as some analysts predicted. Some traditional retailers -- such as sellers of books and electronics -- have been clobbered.

But other companies, such as clothing stores, are adapting to a world that requires retailers to have presences in stores and online that complement each other.

"When online first came about, you were either a store or online," said Jonathan Rumsey, of Cushman & Wakefield. "But retailers know they need a physical store presence for branding and so people go shop and touch the goods they're buying."

Unibail is selling smaller malls away from major cities, partly because they are being hurt more by online retail. Without some of the attractions of bigger malls, they are more likely to be shunned by shoppers.

"Our focus is on large, leading shopping centers in major metropolitan areas," Mr. Tonckens said. "It's one area we think retail will be successful."

Unibail has sold 2.1 billion euros of property deemed not to be core to its strategy, the company said. In the past two years, Unbail has sold 31 properties and bought six, according to Real Capital Analytics.

Investors have largely applauded Unibail's moves. The company's shares have been on a mostly upward trajectory after plummeting below 75 euros in 2009, and hit their record high of more than 260 euros earlier this year. Currently they are trading in the 245 euro range.

Unibail was founded in 1968, and listed on the Paris stock exchange in 1972. In 2007, the firm bought Dutch rival Rodamco Europe NV for 11.2 billion euros, creating the current company.

Other new Unibail locations include Polygone Riviera, a 750,000-square-foot open-air shopping center near Nice, France, that opened in October. The Mall of Scandinavia, which cost Unibail 640 million euros, is the biggest mall in the company's portfolio and it is also "the best mall in our portfolio in terms of technology," Mr. Tonckens said.

To keep people in stores longer, the Mall of Scandinavia provides perks such as valet parking, personal shopping assistants and cellphone charging stations. These extras are also new for Stockholm and most other parts of Sweden, where smaller, decades-old malls tend to dominate.

"There has been a real novelty factor to it," Mr. Tonckens said.

But Unibail's strategy isn't without concerns. U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs last month downgraded Unibail's shares to a "sell" rating from "neutral" due to "a number of headwinds," including lighter mall foot traffic and "tighter leasing negotiations with retailers," the analysts said in a note to investors. The bank also said some of the firm's 1.5 billion euros of uncommitted development projects are likely to be delayed.

Other analysts have expressed concern about the company's current level of debt. According to Green Street, Unibail's debt is equal to about 42% of the value of its assets, compared with 25% in 2007. If the value of its property portfolio falls, Unibail "could have a much worse experience than they did in the previous downturn," said Peter Papadakos, managing director at Green Street.

Unibail executives say the company's financial position is solid. "We're in a stronger position now than we were in 2007," Mr. Tonckens said. "We are prepared if things go bump in the night."

Shanghai takes command in metals trading; Commodities

Over the summer the surge of Chinese retail investors into equities alarmed global markets . Now the same is happening in commodities, as metals become a favourite tool to bet on a slowing Chinese economy.

Investment funds in China have piled into trading on the Shanghai Futures Exchange this month, sending global prices for copper down to a six-year low and nickel to a 10-year low.

The price moves highlight China's influence on global metals prices as the boom that was spurred by the country's demand comes to an end. Lower commodity prices have hit shares in global miners, sending Anglo-American to a record low on Friday, as well as revenue in producing countries such as Chile.

It has also led producers in China to announce cutbacks. On Saturday, nine large copper producers in the country agreed an initial plan to cut refined metal production by more than 200,000 tonnes in 2016, Reuters reported.

"Much the same way they leapt on the Chinese equity market on the way up they've leapt on [the] commodities market on the way down," one banker in London said. "It's been an eye opener for me - how much weight those markets actually have."

The Shanghai Futures Exchange plans to launch an oil futures contract to international investors this year. If the same volumes can be achieved as those in metals that could further cement China's global influence on commodity prices, according to analysts.

Investors in China are trading huge amounts of futures contracts each day. Last week, trading in zinc futures was more than four times open interest - the number of total outstanding contracts that have not yet been closed, according to broker Marex Spectron. Over the past four years the London Metal Exchange has only ever seen its trading volume peak at one times open interest, their data show.

"It's really a quite staggering amount of intraday churn," said Guy Wolf, global head of market analytics at Marex. "The Shanghai market is clearly user speculative."

Copper prices rose 80 per cent between 2001 and 2011, but have since dropped 50 per cent.

While western hedge funds have taken out big bets on the metal's decline this year, Chinese traders have had the most impact on the price.

Markets
European Retail Property Deals Surge; Sales volume hits postcrash record; Spain market lures investors

The Christmas season is just heating up in Europe, but for investors in retail property, the shopping spree has been going on all year.

The volume of malls, shopping centers and other retail real estate purchased this year hit  ¬64 billion ($67.8 billion) as of the end of November, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics. That already makes this year a postcrash record and makes it likely that 2015 will chalk up the highest retail property sale value in euro terms since Real Capital started collecting data in 2007.

Part of the surge is due to the overall investor appeal of commercial property incomes in a low interest-rate world.

But the appetite for European retail is particularly keen. In the past 12 months, retail deals accounted for about 26% of the overall commercial property investment volume in Europe, according to Prudential Real Estate Investors, which manages $61.5 billion around the world.

That is up from 22% the previous 12 months, said Raimondo Amabile, Prudential's head of Europe.  Retail is gaining on office and other asset classes," he said.

The surge contrasts sharply with the distaste investors had for European retail for much of the downturn. The increase in demand also underscores the intensifying search among investors globally for property types and geographies that have both reasonable prices and a decent outlook on cash flow growth through higher rents and occupancies.

Investors in Europe are looking far beyond the top retail markets that they have concentrated on until recently, like the high street shopping districts of London and Paris. Off the beaten path, investors can buy properties at yields that are far above those that are further along in their economic recoveries.

 The world is expensive so we're always trying to find pockets of opportunity," said Chris Burk head of foreign acquisitions for TIAA-CREF, which manages about $1.7 billion in European retail real estate.

Spain has been particularly attractive this year because the economy is on track to chalk up its strongest performance since 2007. Paris-based shopping mall operator Klpierre had been on the hunt for another property in Spain since executives began to notice increasing demand from shoppers at two Madrid shopping centers they owned.

Earlier this year, Klpierre purchased Plenilunio shopping mall in the city in a deal that valued the 70,000 square meter (753,474 square foot) property at  ¬375 million.  We saw an increase in sales in our existing assets in Madrid and that told us that if an opportunity was there, we should seize it," said Klpierre Chief Executive Laurent Morel.

The seller of Plenilunio, Orion Capital Managers LP, purchased it in May 2009 when  people in the market were very afraid in general," said Roberto Roca, head of Spain for the real-estate investment firm. Orion noticed investor sentiment was getting bullish last year when an investor paid 20% more for another property than Orion had planned to offer.

Orion since has sold Plenilunio and Puerto Venecia, a shopping center with a small lake lined with restaurants, the kind of features that helps it compete with online retail.  It's more about the experience, not just shopping, so families spend an entire day there," said Adolfo Favieres, head of Spain for Cornerstone Real Estate Advisers LLC.

A big factor fueling bullishness: Investors like the statistics they are seeing on retail sales and the improving economies of many European countries. Thanks in part to growing consumer confidence, retail sales in the European Union were up 3.3% in the third quarter of 2015 compared with the same period in 2014, according to Eurostat. Until this year, the highest annual increase in Eurozone retail sales since 2008 was in 2014, when the increase was only 1.3%, Eurostat said.

Rents are rising as a result in many markets with growing demand for space from domestic retailers, U.S. companies like Apple, Victoria's Secret and Forever 21 and Asian stores like Uniqlo, Muji and Samsung. Listed European retail companies, excluding those in the U.K., saw 2.6% annual rental growth in the first half of 2015,  crushing inflation," which remained at 0%, according to a recent report by Green Street Advisors.

 Generally in the more dominant, in the more consolidated shopping centers in Spain, if not in all of Europe, we have seen a real improvement in sales and rents," said Andrea Orlandi, head of European real estate investments in London for the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.

Of course, there are numerous risk factors facing European shopping center investors. The economic recovery remains subdued in many countries. Also, commercial property values throughout the world are vulnerable to a sharp increase in interest rates.

Still many retail investors say they are looking to buy more on a continent that has far less retail space per capita than the U.S. Investors also are taking confidence to limits on supply in many parts of Western Europe where local governments strictly control new developments.

For example, TIAA-CREF, which manages about $1.7 billion in European retail real estate, is looking to buy regional malls, according to Mr. Burk. Houston-based Hines is looking at several possible acquisitions in Greece and is also raising a $1.3 billion fund for buying high street retail in cities throughout Europe.

 Two or three years ago we wouldn't have been doing that with the same conviction," said Michael J.G. Topham, Hines' chief executive of Europe.

Investors that purchased earlier in the recovery are now boasting big profits because prices have been steadily rising. Hines estimates that its Liffey Valley regional shopping center in the Dublin region has gone up 70% in value since it purchased a majority stake in the property two years ago.

But even with the rise in prices, investors still see value in many European markets. For example, Tristan Capital Partners this year made two big purchases in Italy, Le Centurie shopping center near Padua for  ¬29 million; and a portfolio of four shopping centers two in the northern Piedmont region and one each in Rome and Sicily for  ¬122 million.

In both deals, the initial yield was in the mid 7% range while the cost of financing was under 3%, according to Cameron Spry, a Tristan partner. In more established markets, like London, yields are well below 5%.

 If you think retail spending is going to pick up, and you're generating low double-digit returns and in normalized markets these properties will trade at (yields) that are 100 basis points higher, that's pretty attractive," he said.

New timber exchange seeks to tackle illegal logging

A pioneering Brazilian carbon trader is launching a timber exchange that aims to tackle another intractable environmental problem   how to source legally harvested timber from tropical forests.

"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/2d12cf38-05b7-11e1-a429-00144feabdc0.html" Rio de Janeiro-based company, BVRio, plans to use big data to assess whether potential sellers are in compliance with US and European restrictions on illegal wood imports. The issue of illegal logging is one of the thorniest facing the $250bn global wood-based products industry.

BVRio plans to open the Responsible Timber Exchange in January or February but the group is taking its first step on Tuesday by launching an app that allows buyers to assess the provenance of a wood order by entering its barcode.

 Our plan is that it becomes an effective tool to shift away from the current mode of doing business in the Amazon, which is through agents and a bunch of dodgy characters, to something of the 21st century,  Mr Costa said.  If Uber managed to change the taxi industry and Airbnb [can challenge the hotel business], why can t we do that with the timber trade? 

The deforestation caused by illegal logging in the Amazon, west Africa, Southeast Asia and Russia is likely to be a key concern at the Cop 21 global climate change talks in Paris starting next week.

Chatham House, a London-based think-tank, has estimated that illegal timber imports into countries that process wood products, including China, Thailand and Vietnam, as well as to consumer markets including the US, UK, France, Netherlands, Japan, South Korea and India, are worth $17bn a year.

The problem was starkly illustrated in 2011 when US federal agents raided Gibson Guitar in Nashville and Memphis, confiscating pallets of exotic woods imported from Madagascar and India. The instrument maker settled with the US Department of Justice the following year for a total of $350,000.

Last month, US wood supplier Lumber Liquidators paid a record $13m in fines and other charges after it imported wood-flooring from China that used illegally logged timber from Russia s Far East, the habitat of the endangered Siberian tiger and critically endangered Amur leopard.

Mr Costa is a former forester who co-founded carbon-trading firm EcoSecurities from his home in Oxford in the UK in 1996 and sold it to JPMorgan in 2009 for 129m. He said the timber exchange would combine scores of databases to conduct cross checks of each wood shipment.

On the exchange, a buyer will register an order. Potential sellers would then be verified based on the traceability of the timber and its compliance with specific legal, environmental, social and labour criteria.

The combined database will not only use official documentation, such as logging permits and sawmill operating licences, but also draw on the legal record of forest owners, loggers and even the forest engineers involved in a shipment to assess the risk of irregularities.

The exchange would overlay scores of other data, such as the average volumes of a given species of tree normally cut under a standard permit, satellite images and, in the future, field checks.

The system, which will eventually be expanded to west Africa, updates every day, Mr Costa said.

Robbie Weich of London-based Tradelink, which sources and processes hardwoods in Brazil, said the BVRio system sought to overcome the problem of corruption and fraud involved in the timber supply chain. Often relying on official documents has not been enough to prevent a buyer from ending up with illegal timber.

 There have been a lot of investigations that show that just going off and gathering the documents that legislation says you have to gather is not enough   it still puts you at risk,  he said.

UK watchdog examines insurers  use of big data

The use of "http://www.ft.com/indepth/big-data" by general insurers has drawn scrutiny from the UK financial watchdog, which is requesting information as a potential prelude to a full study.

The "http://www.ft.com/topics/organisations/Financial_Conduct_Authority_UK" on Tuesday issued calls for inputs about information from sources such as loyalty cards, social media, aggregator sites and other online platforms that is collated and analysed to give a snapshot of consumer behaviour. The regulator said  we recognise that the use of big data brings both benefits and risks for consumers .

"http://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Big_data" is used across the financial sector but has become particularly important to insurers who use information about consumers  behaviour to calculate premiums.

Platforms such as social media also offer insurers a way to verify whether claims are fraudulent. They can, for instance, check whether two people in a seemingly random road accident are connected.

There is evidence that consumers are concerned their personal information is being used in ways never made clear to them when they signed up to various websites. A survey by the Association of British Insurers in 2013 found that 71 per cent of consumers would be unhappy with insurers pricing their products based on information gathered from social media.

The ABI said on Tuesday that insurers  treat personal data sensitively and securely  and that  big data can make insurance work better for customers by improving the claims experience and creating personalised and innovative products .

The FCA uses  calls for inputs  as a first step before launching full market studies. These can then be used to determine if a market is working well or not. At the end of such studies, the FCA can order that business lines be broken up or certain products banned, even in the absence of a technical breach of regulation.

The watchdog can investigate potential breaches of antitrust rules or refer markets to the Competition and Markets Authority for a more in-depth study.

If particular breaches are found to have occurred during market studies, enforcement action can be taken directly by the FCA, which has opened inquiries this year into wholesale banking and asset management.

Chris Woolard, the FCA s policy and competition director, said:  Big data is having an ever-growing social and commercial impact and has the potential to transform practices and products across financial services.

 We are starting our work on big data by seeking to better understand how insurance firms are using data, and how this may evolve in the future. 

Craig Skinner, insurance director at professional services firm PwC, said big data presented an  opportunity  for insurers to price policies more accurately. But he also said there were  ethical considerations around the use of certain data that has been captured  and that  much of the information stored, and used within an insurer, is relevant to the individual and therefore needs to be handled with care .

U.S. News --- THE OUTLOOK: Housing Wealth Rebounds, but Impact Muted

By Joe Light

American homeowners are finally digging out of the hole created by the housing crisis. But their housing wealth is playing a much smaller role in the overall economy than it did before the downturn.

Home equity has roughly doubled to $12.1 trillion since house prices hit bottom in 2011, according to the Federal Reserve. As a result, a key gauge of housing wealth -- homeowners' equity as a share of real-estate values -- is nearing the point seen a decade ago, before the downturn.

Such a level once would have offered a double-barreled boost to the economy by providing owners with more money to tap and making them feel more flush and likely to spend. But today, that newfound wealth has had little effect on behavior. While the traditional ways Americans tap their home equity -- home-equity loans, lines of credit and cash-out refinances -- are higher than last year, they are still depressed.

In the first half of the year, owners borrowed $43.5 billion against their homes, according to trade publication Inside Mortgage Finance. That was 45% higher than in the first half of 2014, but scarcely a quarter of the amount seen when equity was last as high in 2007.

Meanwhile, cash-out refinances, which let homeowners take out a new mortgage and tap some of the home's value at the same time, were up 48% in the three months ended in August from the year-earlier period, according to Black Knight Financial Services. But they remain below the level seen in the summer of 2013. The average cash-out refinance in the three months ended in August left the borrower with mortgage debt of about 68% of the home's value -- not a risky level by any stretch.

Home equity's effect on consumer spending is at its lowest ebb since the early 1990s, according to Moody's Analytics. The research firm estimates that every $1 rise in home equity in the fourth quarter of 2014 would translate to about two cents of extra consumer spending over the next 1 to 1 1/2 years. That was a third of the impact home equity had before the bust, Moody's said.

The impact is more muted now despite the fact that home equity per homeowner has roughly doubled. At the end of the second quarter, the figure was about $156,700, up from $81,100 in the second quarter of 2011, according to Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi. Though the homeownership rate has fallen, the total number of households has increased, meaning the number of households that own hasn't changed much since the housing bubble burst in 2006, Mr. Zandi said.

Why aren't homeowners feeling flush again? For one thing, since rising home prices over the past few years largely have made up for ground lost during the recession, many owners might not even realize they have equity to tap.

The percentage of homeowners who were underwater, or owing more on their mortgage than the home's value, dropped to 8.7% by mid-2015 from 21% at the end of 2011, according to CoreLogic. Yet the percentage of homeowners who thought they were underwater fell by merely one percentage point to 27%, according to housing-finance company Fannie Mae.

The bust looms large and home equity is seen as more fleeting than it used to be, said Fannie Mae chief economist Doug Duncan.

"Consumers are definitely more conservative financially than they were 10 years ago. They've seen that house prices can be volatile," Mr. Duncan said.

Mortgage lenders also aren't giving owners access to as much equity as they used to. While it was common during the boom to see loans that took out 100% or even more of a home's value, now few will let an owner take out more than 80%.

Finally, other kinds of loans are cheaper, removing one incentive to tap home equity. Six years ago, for example, the average five-year new-car loan had an interest rate of 6.83%, versus 5.56% for a $30,000 home-equity line of credit. But in the week ended Nov. 11, the average interest rate for a five-year new-car loan was 4.3%, according to Bankrate.com, versus 4.74% for the HELOC.

Home equity as a share of real-estate values at the end of the second quarter was 56%, according to the Federal Reserve, not quite back to the level of 60% seen in the boom. That means Americans' mortgage debt is still elevated relative to home values, which could be another factor affecting the decision of whether or not to cash out equity.

Could home equity start to flex its muscle sometime soon?

Some economists think it might. One reason: In many metro areas, home prices have overtaken or are about to overtake their boom-era peak. About 38% of metro areas had prices above their pre-2009 peak at the end of the third quarter, up from a 30% level last year, according to Moody's Analytics and CoreLogic. A further 13% of metros are within 5% of their prebust peak.

That's important, because it means new home equity is being created rather than merely making up for lost ground. It also means fewer homeowners are underwater, freeing them up for a home sale and potential move-up purchase while also making home improvements and renovations seem less like throwing good money after bad.

"We're at an inflection point," Mr. Zandi said. "Since the crash, it's all been about repairing homeowners' equity but now that house prices are returning to prerecession levels, we will see homeowners' equity driving consumer spending, home improvements and economic activity."

Small Business (A Special Report)
The Money Game: A New World of Online Lending

Karen Mills spent five years monitoring the state of small-business lending as head of the U.S. Small Business Administration. Since leaving the job in 2013, she has continued to keep a close eye on developments in the field -- particularly the rise of alternative lenders.

These online services, which compete with traditional banks, rapidly vacuum up data from small businesses' bank accounts and credit-card statements to deliver a lending decision within days. And they typically are willing to make much smaller loans than traditional banks do.

The Wall Street Journal spoke with Ms. Mills, now a senior fellow at Harvard Business School, about how alternative lenders are taking innovative approaches to using big data and what traditional banks may do to catch up.

Below are edited excerpts of the conversation.

WSJ: How did you get interested in online lending to businesses?

MS. MILLS: I came into office at the time when credit was frozen. When I left Washington, I wanted to take a look at whether, in the recovery, there was still a credit gap.

The banks said, "I'm lending to every small business that's qualified." The businesses said, "I'm going from bank to bank and can't get a loan."

They were both right. Banks were competing for better customers, over $1 million. For small businesses that wanted a loan of $50,000 or $250,000, banks were not as interested because those loans were less profitable, or unprofitable.

Enter our new online lenders. In the last two to three years I've been watching this, it has really taken off.

WSJ: How are the online lenders using big data?

MS. MILLS: Instead of relying on the traditional FICO score, they add current cash-flow information, with the permission of the small business. They can have access quickly, and online, to bank accounts and credit-card activity, so they know if the small-business owner is paying rent on time, has lots of customers and is collecting cash from them quickly.

Then they can make an assessment from that. Several of them also use things from social media.

It's generally thought that assessing small-business credit is difficult because the businesses are all different. The more information you have to distinguish their financial patterns and activity, the more you can establish a sense of what drives the creditworthy borrower.

The online lenders have automated the process of analyzing this data with algorithms, compared to personal underwriting. Banks are learning from the new innovators, and they are asking, "How can I do some of this in-house?"

I would not count the traditional lenders out. I think they will be very much a part of this picture, whether they adopt some of the activities or they partner or they do other kinds of arrangements that we haven't yet seen, they will definitely be in the game.

Some of the traditional bankers have told me that in the last six months or so, they have really made significant changes in their turnaround times in response to this new competitive element. That's good for small-business owners.

[Traditional banks have advantages if they get into this space.] It costs the new online lenders maybe 15 points of margin to find these customers, but banks have lots of these customers [that they could potentially tap for smaller loans]. The other thing that banks have is very low-cost capital from depositors. In downturns, or when the rate environment changes, which may be happening, it's not clear that some of these [new] institutional or hedge-fund lenders will be as interested in providing the capital to this market.

Partnerships between online lenders and banks will grow. If banks want to hold loans on their books from these borrowers, they can buy them in the market. A partnership is also a win for the online lender because banks are referring customers to them, and that's what's hard for the online lenders, finding customers.

This will be positive if there's transparency to the small-business owner on the terms of the loan.

WSJ: What are the downsides of this kind of lending?

MS. MILLS: This is a largely unregulated space. Some of the loans can be expensive for small-business owners. As we move forward, we need to make sure the small-business owner understands the duration and pricing of the loan.

Hedge funds poach computer scientists from Silicon Valley

Hedge funds and asset managers are scrambling to poach talent from "http://www.ft.com/intl/magazine/silicon-valley-special" and attract computer scientists fresh from college to capitalise on the investment industry s hottest frontier.

So-called quantitative financiers, or quants, have for years come up with innovative, complex ways to analyse and trade on company earnings or economic releases. But thanks to huge gains in computing power and algorithmic research, they are now pushing into  unstructured data  such as internet searches, social media, satellite images, earnings calls or weather patterns to find market signals and overlooked trading opportunities.

To do so they need to deploy innovative, increasingly powerful quasi-artificial intelligence algorithms, ratcheting up demand for computer scientists to do coding that is beyond mathematicians and physicists.

 Traders used to be first-class citizens of the financial world, but that s not true any more. Technologists are the priority now,  says Jared Butler, a headhunter at Selby Jennings.  It s easier to hire a computer scientist and teach them the financial world than the other way around. 

Two Sigma, a $28bn hedge fund, and BlackRock, the world s biggest asset manager, earlier this year snapped up two former Google engineers, underscoring the mounting demand for computer scientists to help gain a digital edge in the cut-throat money management industry.

Two Sigma is one of the hedge fund industry s fastest-growing companies, and is led by computer scientist David Siegel and mathematician John Overdeck. They recently hired "http://research.google.com/pubs/AlfredSpector.html", formerly vice-president of research and special initiatives at Google, as chief scientist.

BlackRock "http://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/08/us-blackrock-hire-google-idUSKBN0OO2C720150608", a former Google engineer, this year as a managing director in its  scientific-active equity  team, where he will bolster the asset manager s efforts to mine data sets for lucrative investment opportunities. In late 2012, David Ferrucci, head of IBM s Watson supercomputer, joined Bridgewater Associates to build the $168bn hedge fund s artificial intelligence arm.

 Quants have always been in demand, but the structure of the demand has changed over the past two years,  said Michael Karp, chief executive of Options Group, a recruiter.  The world is becoming more technologically demanding, and a lot of firms now need computer scientists that can code algorithms. 

The problem confronting quant money managers   and banks rushing to revamp and build their technological capabilities   is that the financial industry is less attractive than Silicon Valley s biggest companies or hottest upstarts, especially in recent years.

Dennis Ruhl, head of JPMorgan Asset Management s quantitative behavioural finance unit, said:  We absolutely need more computer scientists, but it s a challenge as the financial industry has suffered an image crisis in recent years. 

Many asset managers are, as a result, establishing closer ties with universities so they can tap directly into the pipeline of talent, or setting up contests such as the "https://www.ahl.com/coderprize" or the "https://websim.worldquantchallenge.com/en/cms/wqchallenge/contest/challenge/" to unearth self-taught programming talent.

Mr Butler at Selby Jennings concedes that attracting top tech talent is a big obstacle for the finance industry, but said the potential salary and intellectual challenges of a career at the more innovative trading firms or hedge funds is still an attraction to many computer scientists.

 It s a constant thorn in my side. Whenever I find a red hot programmer they ll have a job offer from Google, Uber or somewhere else. But there is an allure in building a successful trading strategy as well.

COMMENT & ANALYSIS
Robots will enrich not replace us; OPINION

The robots are coming to take our jobs. So says Martin Ford in The Rise of the Robots , the FT/McKinsey business book of the year . Andy Haldane, chief economist of the Bank of England, last week warned that 15m jobs in Britain were at risk from automation. Is artificial intelligence about to take over? I am not so sure.

Innovation is always a threat to incumbents; look at the race among carmakers to make a driverless car before Google writes the software for computers with four wheels. Electricity sparked the second industrial revolution, destroying old jobs in industries that became superfluous and leaving workers with stranded skills.

It was tough being a blacksmith in 1920, after industrialists perfected the science of the electric arc and the techniques of mass production. Skills that had been built up through long years of hard labour were now as good as worthless.

This is one reason why university graduates enjoy greater sustained long-term growth in earnings than apprentices - they are better able to ride waves of technological change.

It used to be that industrial towns grew up around the coalfields or water supplies that sustained the machines - only to decline when the machines were themselves superseded. Now clusters emerge around universities and research institutes instead.

But while robots and automation will create problems for particular industries and the people working in them, the economy as a whole can adapt. I do not expect us to depart from the path of industrialisation in which jobs change radically and old ones disappear, but the number of people in work keeps increasing. Technological advances bring extraordinary benefits to consumers, as goods become cheaper and new products are created that no one could have foreseen.

Human wants are infinite; the lack of things that had not even been invented a few decades earlier is enough to make us feel poor. If nothing else, people will always pay for interaction with other human beings.

Cinema has not killed live theatre; easy access to recorded music has only increased the premium people pay to hear a performance live. The IT revolution has disrupted industries, but it has not been a net destroyer of jobs.

One reason why robot paranoia has taken hold in the US is that companies are taking a greater share of the economic pie, at the expense of workers, at a time when participation in the labour market is falling.

But much of this is a result of American policy failures that need not be replicated elsewhere. America used to be a world leader in educating its workforce but now Britain has a higher graduation rate. Since 1999 the proportion of 25- to 54-year-olds who participate in the labour market has increased by 3 percentage points in the UK while in the US it has fallen by a similar amount.

In the UK pay inequality has been broadly flat since the 2000s and has fallen since the crash; in the US it is rising. Britain's problem is not that technology is moving too fast: our trouble is that our inventions do not reach the market quickly enough.

We need sustained government investment to spur disruptive technologies, such as automation and robots. This is not the same as old-fashioned propping-up of incumbents; indeed, the technologies in question are a challenge to existing companies. And in the US there is far more federal and state support for the commercialisation of new general-purpose technologies. Britain must keep up.

The problem facing many major economies is not that robots will take all the jobs; it is that they will not be able to take them fast enough as human workers retire.

Japan, with its combination of low birth rates and opposition to immigration, has long been a leading inventor of robots.

They are pioneers in assistive technologies for the elderly - from exoskeletons to help frail people get up and move to service robots that will keep them company.

Britain's care sector is wrestling with a planned increase in the minimum wage for workers over the age of 25. It could instead turn to innovative technological advances to help it bring down costs. There are still too many policy discussions which assume technology is fixed. Industry, too, has been too slow to adapt. Because we think of robots as machinery, our conventional model of factory safety has been to keep humans well away from them.

Yet their potential will only truly be unleashed when they are used far more flexibly - so that people think of them almost as colleagues.

I can just about imagine a future where the main debate in public policy is how to distribute revenues from robots to citizens so they can enjoy a life of leisure. It would be rather like HG Wells' Time Machine - except that the proletariat would consist entirely of robots, so that all the humans would enjoy the fey and carefree existence of his elite.

The problem we confront today is the opposite. We have more work to do than people to do it. Robots are the answer - not the threat.

From a swipe of a connected watch to a touch of a smartphone, technology has brought a wide choice of digital options for shoppers wishing to replace the traditional wallet.

But, despite high-profile launches of payment platforms, cash and cards are still the preferred means of payment globally. A study released in October by Aimia, an analytics company, found that fewer than one in 10 UK consumers were  very likely  to use a digital wallet   a number that has barely changed over the past three years.

Consumers remain highly sceptical about the technology. Aimia says that about three quarters of UK shoppers feel the arrival of companies such as Apple to the payments market has not changed the probability of them using a digital wallet.

About 40 per cent simply prefer cash and debit cards, but a similar number have concerns about data security and lost or stolen phones.

The launch of Apple Pay was seen by many analysts as the moment that the sector would go mainstream, given the trust that many of its users have in the US technology group, but research suggests that only a small percentage even of Apple customers use the platform regularly.

Marc Allsop, senior vice-president at Aimia, says:  Payment providers must ensure they address concerns about data security and prove to customers that their details are secure. Only then will digital payments truly become part of everyday shopping behaviour. 

Consumer behaviour also simply takes time to change, according to analysts, and there needs to be a clear benefit or incentive to use a digital wallet instead of a payment card or cash.

Paul Lee, a researcher at Deloitte, a consultancy, says use of digital payment platforms will grow as improvements are made to loyalty schemes and biometric information, as well as location, can be instantly used to authenticate user and in-app payments.

Part of the problem is also the fragmentation of the market. Apple has left plenty of room for rival options. JPMorgan Chase has recently revamped its Chase Pay platform, for example, and improvements have also been made to MasterCard s MasterPass and Visa Checkout.

Even so, analysts suggest it will take a combination of many different products to change the behaviour of consumers and turn mobile money into a viable alternative to traditional forms of payments.

How to pay?

The FT s guide to the benefits and shortcomings of high-tech alternatives to cash, which has not been bettered as a choice of payment for more than two millennia.

 " Debit/credit/prepaid cards: chip & pin

How it works Chip-enabled debit or credit cards are now commonplace in many countries. The card s chip and the point-of-sale terminal generate a cryptogram and attach it to the consumer s personal account number. The cryptogram is sent to the issuing bank for processing.

Pros Fast, easy to use, secure and safe in comparison to cash and basic cards. There can be added benefits such as consumer protection and cashback services.

Cons You need to remember a pin for each card.

 	. 	. 	. 	

 " Debit/credit/prepaid cards: contactless

How it works The chip in your credit or debit card can be tapped on a reader and, using radio-frequency identification or near-field communication (NFC) technology, this communicates with the consumer s bank in much the same way as the chip-and-pin method.

Pros Same protection as chip-and-pin cards and there is no need to remember a code number. Easy and quick to use.

Cons There is normally a limit, in the UK it is 30 for example. Less secure than using a pin if stolen. Risk of accidental payments.

 	. 	. 	. 	

 " Prepaid contactless wearables

How it works Some wearables, such as key fobs, allow you to load money that can be used where contactless payments are available.

Pros Easy and fast to use.

Cons Need to load on money every time you want to use it and there is normally a limit.

 	. 	. 	. 	

 " Digital wallet payments using contactless near-field communication technology (Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and others)

How it works A smartphone application that allows people to pay by swiping their phone across a payment point, either linked to a bank account or to a prepaid store of cash.

During a physical NFC transaction, each of these  digital wallets  will use the cryptogram on the consumer s card as well as a secure  token . The bank card networks   services used by banks such as Visa and MasterCard that provide the infrastructure, or network, behind the payments system   generate the tokens (each one is a 16-digit number, exactly like a card number, linked to the consumer s card number). The digital wallets store these tokens (either on the device or in the cloud) so the consumer can make a payment.

During a transaction, the token and cryptographic information is sent to the merchant. The card network decrypts the token and sends it to the issuer for processing.

Digital wallets, such as Apple Pay, act more as a channel for transactions as the network providers handle the creation of the tokens.

Pros Convenient way of paying and relatively secure given that the number is stored as a token rather than the consumer s actual card data. Smartphones are now in widespread use.

Cons Needs a mobile device that is compatible with the app and customers  banks will need to have signed up to the service. Requires the right sort of contactless retail equipment to work.

 	. 	. 	. 	

 " Digital wallets payment in-app

How it works Similar to the digital wallets using NFC payment technology but requires an app on the users  phone that pays a retailer online.

Pros Convenient as there is no need to enter card details, which makes payment safe and secure.

Cons Need to download the app. As with NFC payments, you will need the right sort of mobile phone and an issuer signed up to using the digital wallet service of your choice.

 	. 	. 	. 	

 " Digital wallets for in-app, online and in-store purchases (for example MasterPass)

How it works An electronic wallet allows consumers to securely store credit or debit card details together with personal information, normally managed by the consumer s bank.

Pros Convenient as there is no need to enter card details, safe and secure with, for example, pay-at-table options to cover a restaurant bill without requiring the services of a waiter.

Cons Need to download the app.

 	. 	. 	. 	

 " Stored value wallets (such as PayPal/Skrill/Neteller)

How it works Also sometimes called e-wallets, there are online prepaid account where a user can add money to be used whenever required

Pros Covenient and safe as there is no need to enter card details.

Cons You can only pay where you see the stored value wallet symbol, may not be widely accepted. Needs topping up, and sign-up with one of a number of competing options.

 	. 	. 	. 	

 " Faster payments network (such as Pingit/Paym)

How it works Services such as Pingit and Paym allow you to pay your friends and family using their mobile number.

Pros No need to remember your friends  and family members  current account numbers and sort codes.

Cons Need friends and family to sign up to the service, as well as your issuer. This is a UK-only service.

 	. 	. 	. 	

 " Automated Clearing House or bank transfer-based mobile payment schemes in-app (such as Zapp or CurrentC)

How it works People can make payments from their bank accounts by electronic credit or debit transfers using mobile devices.

Pros The consumer never has to provide any of their personal or payment information to the merchant.

Cons You need to sign into your banking app in order to pay. Retailers and banks need to sign up to the system.

British Business Bank backs PE fund aimed at creative industries

The UK government s British Business Bank has backed a private equity fund aimed at the country s creative industries in a drive to end a period of financial neglect for the sector.

The 40m fund raised by Edge Investments and to be launched at the National Theatre on Wednesday, will be the first government-backed fund for the sector, with 24m provided from the state development bank.

Despite the importance of industries such as gaming and media to the British economy   providing 1 in 12 jobs, according to the Creative Industries Federation   they have been overshadowed by efforts to promote investment in the country s tech start-ups.

Parts of the sector could also be facing a shake-up through changes such as the mooted "http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/nov/04/channel-4-private-investment-option-david-cameron" of Channel 4 television.

 It s been very hard for creative industries to know where to look for finance,  said David Glick, Edge s chief executive and founder.

One of the British creative industry s most recent successes, the $5.9bn sale of Candy Crush maker King Entertainment to Activision, began with a  ¬29m venture capital investment by Apax, now a large buyout firm, 10 years ago.

Entertainment One, the distributor that owns the UK children s television series Peppa Pig, is also riding a global wave of consolidation among TV production companies.

But most of the sector s companies are small to medium-sized enterprises, an area of the economy where banks have pulled back from lending.

 We could be doing a huge amount more, if we solve the funding drought for these businesses,  Mr Glick said.

Edge s existing investments include deltaDNA, which provides analytics for free-to-play games, and Coolabi, a media company that has brought the Clangers back to children s television after a 40-year absence.

MirriAd, an Edge portfolio company that makes in-video advertising technology, signed a collaboration deal with China s Youku Tudou last month.

The new fund will seek to make between 12 and 15 investments, Mr Glick said, with backing by individual investors available to  give us firepower over and above the 40m . Edge will aim to make three times backers  money on deals.

 We really want people in the sector to bring their business ideas,  he said.

The government has also sought to encourage investment in British TV, film and game companies in recent years with a series of tax credits.

 We can t rely on tax advantages,  Mr Glick said.  For us, it s about providing patient capital for these businesses to grow. 

 Of course it would be wonderful if Edge backed a unicorn    start-ups that rise to over $1bn in valuation    but we re really nursing companies through the funding drought and taking them to the midsize level,  Mr Glick said.

The British Business Bank was launched two years ago under the previous coalition government with a mandate to increase financing for smaller UK businesses.

 This is the first fund specifically focused on the creative industries backed by the British Business Bank,  said Ken Cooper, managing director of the bank s venture capital arm.  We look forward to working with Edge Investments, which has extensive experience in this sector and a proven track record. 

 The creative industry is of increasing importance to the wider UK economy and we are particularly pleased that this fund will ensure these high-growth businesses have access to the finance they need to scale.

COMPANIES
BGC's status in sector has rivals doffing caps; Asset deal trailblazer

BGC Partners, a broker, is emerging as one of the linchpins of the industry shake-up and its aggressive dealing in assets has left analysts and rivals doffing caps.

The latest was the sale of Trayport, an electronic energy trade platform, to Intercontinental Exchange for $650m, which allowed it to recoup all but $100m of the $750m outlay for Trayport's parent GFI Group in March.

"While Trayport provided less than 3 per cent of BGC's consolidated revenues in the third quarter, the consideration we will receive represents about 20 per cent of BGC's fully diluted market capitalisation," says Shaun Lynn , president of BGC.

That echoed a deal in 2013 when it sold eSpeed, a US Treasuries trading platform, to Nasdaq at a price that equalled its entire market capitalisation.

Analysts were quick to compare BGC's moves with Tullett Prebon's 1.1bn purchase of the global broking business of ICAP the week before. The remainder of GFI will be about 1,000 voice brokers and Fenics , a risk analytics business.

"Valuing Fenics at zero works out to just around $100,000 per broker for BGC versus around $1.1m/broker for Tullett. Given all the competitive poaching among the big five interdealer brokers over the years, are ICAP brokers really 10 times more valuable than GFI brokers?" says David Weiss, Aite Group analyst.

BGC has hinted Fenics is likely to sold next. Third quarter pre-tax earnings grew by more than 82 per cent to $25.3m and those profits, BGC said, were larger than the quarterly revenues of eSpeed when it sold to Nasdaq. Philip Stafford

The Property Report: New Office Leasing Picks Up in Europe --- Corporate sentiment improves in region as Madrid, Berlin, Prague see gains; Milan lags

Companies in Europe this year have signed new leases for office space at a faster rate than at any time since the start of the 2008 financial crisis, a sign of improving corporate sentiment that could benefit property investors betting on rising rents across the region.

Madrid, Berlin, Prague and Warsaw all have seen an uptick in companies signing new office leases this year,pushing vacancy levels down, according to data from real-estate broker CBRE Group Inc.

Across Europe, office-leasing volumes were up 15% in the first nine months of 2015 compared with last year, the data show. The overall Europe office vacancy rate, meanwhile, stood at 9.1% in the third quarter. While that is still above the record low of 7.1% hit in 2008, cities such as London, Dublin, Munich, Hamburg and Berlinall are close to record lows, according to broker JLL.

The improving outlook, coupled with still-attractive prices compared with the U.S., is boosting Europe's appeal among several big investors. For example, Europe has accounted for about half of the capital that Morgan Stanley has spent or plans to spend so far from its latest private-equity real-estate fund. Only 5% of the investment has gone to U.S. deals.

"We think there's going to be extended, low growth in Europe," said John Klopp, co-head of Morgan Stanley's real-estate fund business. "But there are going to be a lot of bumps along the way."

In Spain,whose economyisexpected to grow more than3%this yearfollowing a deep recession, recent leases include one signed by French bank BNP Paribas SA, which is movingabout1,700 employees from three locations to a20,000-square meter Madrid office. The space is about5,000 square meters larger than the buildings the employees will leave behind.

In Berlin, Rocket Internet GmbH, which invests in online businesses, plans to move into 22,000 square meters of office space to accommodate its growing staff. The technology industry in the city occupies 210,000 square meters of space, according to broker Savills.

Mostoffice markets in Europe were slower to pick up than those in major U.S. cities. Comparably weak economic growth has discouraged or limited companies from committing to new leases.

But in 2015, leasing volume started to increase more broadly across the Continent, analysts said.

"An upward trajectory is more widespread,"said Alex Colpaert,head of offices research in the region at broker JLL.

Late last month, shares of the world's two largest real-estate-services firms, CBRE and JLL, surged after the companies posted strong third-quarter results thanks in part to stronger European leasing activity.

The recovery is far from even. Office activity in London began heating up more than two years ago.

Demand in Dublin, home to European operations for many technology firms such as Twitter Inc. and Google Inc., grew ahead of cities on the Continent.

Other markets, meanwhile, are still lagging behind. Office leasing volume in Milan was down 16% in the first nine months of 2015 compared with the period last year, CBRE data show. In Paris, despite a strong 53% uptick in the third quarter from last year, volume was still down 6% in the first nine months.

But the broader pickup bodes well for investors that have been paying increasingly higher prices for office buildings throughout the Continent in recent years.Commercial real-estate transaction volumes in Europe are booming, with <euro>200.7 billion ($216.23 billion) invested in the first nine months of the year, according to Real Capital Analytics.

The sales volume rise has partly been fueled by investors seeking yield in a low-interest-rate environment. But as property prices have risen, investors increasingly have based purchases on hopes that rents will rise.

Prime office rents in Europe rose 2.1% in the third quarter compared with last year, CBRE data show.

"Rents are seeing upward pressure, and in aggregate will continue to do so," said Richard Holberton, senior director of research at CBRE.

Even inMadrid and Barcelona, where rents have been weak for some time, "we're starting to see evidence of an increase," Mr. Holberton said. "It's generally toward the prime end of the market. That's where the demand is."

An imbalance between supply and demand for officesshould help drive a rise in prime rents over the next three years in Barcelona, Madrid, Stockholm, Copenhagen and Munich, a recent report from U.K. firm M&G Real Estate said.

Also helping landlords: limited levels of new construction. In London, one of the few exceptions, office construction is at its highest level in seven years as vacancy rates hit a 14-year low of 3.9%, according to the accounting firm Deloitte LLP.

But elsewhere, little new supply is expected to hit the market until vacancies drop much further. For example, the vacancy rate in Madrid was16.5% in the third quarter, compared witha low of nearly 6%in 2007.

Still, the Madrid rate is inching down as companies react to the expanding economy. "International companies are not in cost-cutting mode anymore," saidPatricio Palomar,head of alternative investments at CBRE in Madrid. "They have the support of their parent companies and they are in an 'increasing revenue' mode and looking for iconic buildings that show they are ready to grow."

KPMG's office in Madrid has about 20% moredealadvisory business in the pipeline than it had last year at this time. Feeling more confident that the economy is strengthening, the firm will move into new offices in Madrid's Torre de Cristal skyscraper, said KPMG Spain President John Scott.

"Undoubtedly, we have all seen that things have been improving," Mr. Scott said.

EXCHANGES

ICE to Buy Trayport

In $650 Million Deal

Intercontinental Exchange Inc., owner of the New York Stock Exchange, agreed to buy broker-tech platform licenser Trayport for $650 million in stock.

Trayport is a London-based unit of GFI Group, which was acquired by BGC Partners in March. Trayport licenses its technology platform to serve brokers for electronic and hybrid trade execution primarily in the European over-the-counter utility markets. ICE said the transaction will enable it to provide new services to the European OTC energy markets, including European power, natural gas and coal.

As part of ICE, Trayport will offer customers access to a broader range of risk-management and analytics services as the OTC markets evolve. ICE expects to extend the platform to support the development of energy markets in Asia

BANK BONUSES

European Regulator

May Extend Curbs

Thousands of small banks and investment firms across Europe are bracing for new rules that may force them to cap or change the structure of bonuses for their highest earners.

Currently, European rules restrict big banks to paying bonuses of up to twice fixed pay and must pay them out over years. Smaller banks and asset managers have largely escaped bonus regulations on the basis that they present less of a risk to the financial system.

Next month, the European Banking Authority is expected to decide whether it will apply rules on pay and bonuses to include a wider range of financial companies. Industry groups representing small banks, hedge funds and other asset-management businesses have been scrambling to lobby the EBA to exclude them from the bonus regulations.

Executives at financial companies are bombarding their advisers with calls and drawing up contingency plans, according to lawyers. A major fear is that they would have to follow the route of big banks hit by the bonus rules and increase fixed pay, a move that could blow apart their business models.

A spokesman for the EBA said that it is drafting advice to the European Union's executive arm, the European Commission, recommending that the way the rules are applied to small firms should be reviewed. That could lead to a legislative change allowing small firms to escape the steep cost of complying with bonus regulations.

Intercontinental Exchange , the owner of the New York Stock Exchange , said Monday it agreed to buy broker-tech platform licenser Trayport for $650 million in stock.

Trayport is a unit of GFI Group , which was acquired by BGC Partners in March. Trayport licenses its technology platform to serve brokers for electronic and hybrid trade execution primarily in the European over-the-counter utility markets. Intercontinental Exchange said the transaction will enable it to provide new services to the European OTC energy markets, including European power, natural gas and coal.

London-based Trayport will continue to serve its customers energy producers and consumers, brokers, exchanges and clearing houses with its existing technology platform. As part of Intercontinental Exchange , the company said, Trayport will offer customers access to a broader range of risk management and analytics services as the OTC markets evolve. Intercontinental Exchange expects to extend the platform to support the development of energy markets in Asia

 European regulators have made clear that they do not expect OTC gas and power markets to be subject to the mandatory clearing provisions that are being applied to other commodity markets," said Intercontinental Exchange Chief Executive Jeffrey Sprecher .  As such, these vital markets will require continued investment as part of the European energy market evolution."

White Star Capital, a transatlantic venture capital group focused on start-up hubs outside Silicon Valley, has launched a $70m fund, the latest investment group to open in the hunt for tech companies outside the US.

The group, which will be based in London, New York and Montreal, will look to make investments in fledgling tech groups in the three cities, but in particular look to deploy capital across Europe.

The company, co-founded by Christian Hernandez Gallardo, a former European executive at Facebook, Google and Microsoft, and Eric Martineau-Fortin, a private equity and mergers industry veteran, joins a crowded field of new tech funds with a focus on the continent.

In the past year, three London-based groups were launched: Notion Capital with a $120m fund, Highland Europe with a  ¬332m fund and Octopus Ventures with a $140m fund.

 A lot of funds opening up is a good thing,  said Mr Hernandez.  The amount of funds [supporting early stage tech companies] in Europe could be twice the size, and the region could still benefit. 

In spite of the emergence of increased funding in Europe, the money pales into comparison to what is available in the US. According to the US National Venture Capital Association, US venture capital funds had $156.5bn under management in 2014.

Mr Hernandez said White Star emphasised its transatlantic set-up in assisting European groups expand their businesses in North America.

 We have a purposeful presence in New York and London,  said Mr Hernandez.  This is a bridge we already see entrepreneurs crossing   starting in Europe and then setting up commercial operations in the US. We ve seen that with Spotify and others. But also this is an opportunity to be active in two important tech hubs. 

White Star Capital plans to make investments between $500,000 and $5m. The company said it had already deployed $25m in launching the fund, including investments in the New York robotic locksmith group KeyMe; Mnubo, a Montreal-based internet of things analytics company, and Stockholm-based financial technology exchange Cryex.

Tech
Secretive, Sprawling Network of  Scouts  Spreads Money Through Silicon Valley; Sequoia Capital has funneled millions of dollars to scores of well-connected entrepreneurs and academics, who invest and look for ideas

 Startup investor Jason Calacanis took a $25,000 gamble five years ago on a company almost no one had heard of called UberCab. That investment in what is now Uber Technologies Inc. has ballooned to roughly $110 million.

Mr. Calacanis has never said publicly where the money came from: Sequoia Capital, one of Silicon Valley's biggest venture-capital firms. Since 2009, Sequoia has funneled millions of dollars to scores of well-connected entrepreneurs, academics and other people known as scouts.

Scouts invest the money in startups and keep their eyes and ears open for ideas that Sequoia might like. Mr. Calacanis introduced Thumbtack Inc.'s founder to a partner at Sequoia, which bought a stake in the local-services website that has since surged 50-fold, research firm VCExperts estimates.

Thumbtack's founders now steer tips to Sequoia, too.  Sequoia had been great to us, so we were happy to send other high-quality entrepreneurs their way," says Marco Zappacosta, chief executive of Thumbtack. He has made a few startup investments of his own using Sequoia's money.

The secretive ecosystem of cash and connections is an unusually powerful example of how venture-capital firms try to gain an edge in the never-ending hunt for the next blockbuster. That search has gotten trickier now that some startups with sky-high valuations are hitting turbulence.

Most of Sequoia's scouts are entrepreneurs whose startups were funded by the firm. That means they know a lot about what Sequoia is looking for and will recommend the firm to other entrepreneurs.

Forging tight relationships that generate new deals for venture-capital firms is more important than ever as the cost of creating startups falls. The resulting acceleration in company launches has made it harder for venture-capital firms to identify the best opportunities as startups emerge. And competition is growing as new investors who are flush with capital invade the technology world.

Sequoia has been a mainstay of the venture-capital establishment for decades. Based in Menlo Park, Calif., on Sand Hill Road, the Main Street of Silicon Valley's venture-capital industry, Sequoia made early bets on many of today's tech titans, including Apple Inc., Google Inc. and Cisco Systems Inc.

It was the only venture firm that backed messaging company WhatsApp, sold to Facebook Inc. last year for $22 billion. Sequoia invested about $60 million for a stake valued at $3.5 billion in the deal. Sequoia now owns stakes in 33 private,"http://graphics.wsj.com/billion-dollar-club/", more than any other venture-capital firm.

Opening doors

Sequoia's track record opens lots of doors, and the firm opens even more with its careful cultivation of scouts.

The network includes Dropbox Inc. Chief Executive Drew Houston, the three co-founders of Airbnb Inc., Facebook executive Mike Vernal, professors at Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley, and a daughter of Sequoia's managing partner, Douglas Leone, according to documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.

 Sequoia also invited John and Patrick Collison, the Irish brothers who co-founded Stripe Inc., to become scouts, but they declined. The five-year-old online-payments company got an early investment from another scout, Sam Altman, the president of "http://www.wsj.com/articles/tech-incubator-y-combinator-takes-new-tack-with-venture-capital-fund-1444938590". Sequoia was an investor in his previous company, Loopt.

Mr. Altman later helped Sequoia seal its own investment in Stripe, according to the venture-capital firm. In July, Stripe said it had raised new funding that "http://www.wsj.com/articles/online-payments-startup-stripe-raises-new-funds-at-5-billion-valuation-1438060715".

In all, Sequoia's scouts have put money into dozens of startups, according to documents reviewed by the Journal and interviews with scouts. The Journal couldn't make an exact tally because the investments are scattered and Sequoia officials declined to discuss the program's full scope.

 Everybody in the business tries to generate proprietary deal flow," says Roelof Botha, the Sequoia partner who heads the scouts program.  That's part of the challenge in our business: How do you become distinctive in the mind of an entrepreneur?"

Mr. Botha adds:  Hopefully, [a scout investment] means that we have a better-than-otherwise opportunity to meet that company at some point and evaluate whether it might be a good fit for us."

If a scout's investment is successful, the vast majority of gains are shared by the scout and Sequoia's limited partners, Mr. Botha says. Other scouts and Sequoia partners themselves get a small piece of the gains.

Most of the gains since the scout program was created in 2009 are paper gains, not actual profits, Mr. Botha adds.

Sequoia says it instructs scouts to tell startups in which they invest where the money is coming from. But the firm tries to hide the investments from rivals by making them through limited liability companies with odd names. The names include Dragonsteed LLC, Vermillistock LLC and Rocketbooster LLC.

Keeping a low profile is important because Sequoia doesn't want to jeopardize the future fundraising prospects of startups that previously got money from a scout. It would look bad if everyone knew that Sequoia decided not to invest an even larger amount in a later funding round.

 I don't like the word  secret,'" Mr. Botha says.  I think we have just been discreet about the program all along."

The existence of Sequoia's program "https://pando.com/2012/05/04/sequoia-confirms-existence-of-stealth-scout-program-whos-next/" by tech blog PandoDaily. Few scout names or other details have been disclosed.

 The Journal identified a total of 78 scouts or 73 men and five women from incorporation records filed in California, other documents and interviews. In addition, scout names are listed on documents for 44 different limited liability companies. All but two are registered to Sequoia's headquarters address.

Sequoia confirmed the names of a handful of scouts. When contacted by the Journal, many scouts confirmed their participation or declined to comment.

Some people in the documents say they are no longer active scouts or haven't made investments. Mr. Botha says Sequoia is looking for new recruits.

Like other venture-capital firms, Sequoia also works college campuses. In addition to a small number of professors who are scouts, a separate team of unpaid students at Stanford, Harvard University, Columbia University and other elite colleges is on the lookout for promising ideas and entrepreneurs.

The next Zuckerberg

 VCs want their brand names on campuses," says Daniel Liem, who says he was a Sequoia scout while studying computer science at Stanford.  They want to find the next Zuckerberg or Spiegel," Mr. Liem adds, referring to the founders of Facebook and Snapchat Inc.

Mr. Liem now works at FiscalNote Inc., a "http://www.wsj.com/articles/venture-capitalists-enlist-student-run-funds-to-find-the-next-facebook-1430341449"and artificial intelligence to forecast legislation.

Sequoia's scouts usually invest about $30,000 at a time and are given initial access to about $100,000 a year. Mr. Botha says the amount can grow if scouts identify even more hot ideas.

To fill its pool of scouts, Sequoia turns mostly to the founders of companies already backed by the venture-capital firm or a select group of computer-science professors. Entrepreneurs often reach out to those people for advice long before approaching any venture-capital firms.

For scouts, the appeal is membership in an elite club and free money to make seed investments, which they might not be able to afford.

Sequoia's program is  a great way to be involved in the startup [and] angel community before I have the means to do so myself," says Steve Garrity, co-founder and chief technology officer at Hearsay Social Inc. Sequoia owns a stake in the media technology firm.

Mr. Botha says Sequoia's name is included in wire transfers to recipients. Two recipients say they knew the money came from Sequoia, but two others say they had no idea about the source until a Journal reporter told them.

 Now I think of my company as having a Sequoia radio collar on it," says an angel investor who was disappointed to learn that Sequoia got a stake through a scout in one of the companies where he is an investor.

For most entrepreneurs and startups, though, cash is a tie that binds. Matt MacInnis left Apple in 2009 after seven years to start digital-publishing company Inkling Inc.

 Sequoia invested in Inkling about a year later. After that, Mr. MacInnis says, he was recruited to the scout program by Bryan Schreier, a Sequoia partner.

Mr. MacInnis decided to invest in Clever Inc. with money from Sequoia and out of his own pocket. The educational software firm was launched by friends who worked with him on the Harvard Crimson newspaper, including Tyler Bosmeny, Clever's co-founder and CEO.

When Mr. Bosmeny was ready to seek a new round of funding, Mr. MacInnis connected him with Mr. Schreier at Sequoia. The venture-capital firm led a "http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/03/25/clever-raises-10-3m-to-help-schools-students-use-new-learning-apps/" in Clever in 2013 and was part of a "http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/12/16/clever-raises-30-million-for-single-login-education-tech-app/" later.

Mr. MacInnis says he was a  good skid greaser." Now Mr. Bosmeny is a Sequoia scout, too, recently investing with Mr. MacInnis in Captain401, a startup that helps businesses set up 401(k) plans, according to Mr. MacInnis.

Other scout investments by Mr. MacInnis include Zenefits Inc., a human-resources software provider valued in its "http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2015/05/06/zenefits-tagged-with-4-5-billion-valuation-after-just-two-years/". Sequoia hasn't made an additional investment in Zenefits.

Scouts are a  very early warning system, like having a bunch of little satellites installed across the Valley, picking up blips on the radar," he says.

Omar Hamoui became a scout in 2009 while he was CEO of AdMob Inc., a mobile advertising startup backed by Sequoia. Google"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704402404574525651367011402", a big windfall for the venture-capital firm. Mr. Hamoui became a partner at Sequoia in 2013.

 When Sequoia turned 40 years old in 2012, Mr. Calacanis "https://plus.google.com/on his Google+ page for helping him get started as an angel investor. Those investors generally are affluent individuals who back fledgling companies with their personal funds.

Mr. Calacanis was one of the earliest scouts and ran an "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303277704579346683243739554"called Inside.com, in which Sequoia had invested.

The $25,000 from Sequoia that Mr. Calacanis sank into Uber was part of the company's first fundraising round, which raised less than $2 million.

Since then, Uber's total funding has "http://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-valued-at-more-than-50-billion-1438367457". Uber was last valued at $51 billion, making it the world's "http://graphics.wsj.com/billion-dollar-club/". Sequoia's piece of the original $25,000 stake now is likely worth more than $40 million.

Mr. Calacanis says he hasn't sold any Uber shares. Sequoia hasn't invested in Uber since then.

Mr. Calacanis also plowed scout money into Thumbtack, the local-services website. 

The investment was made a few months after Mr. Zappacosta pitched the startup during a steakhouse dinner in San Francisco organized by Mr. Calacanis, according to the Thumbtack co-founder.

Mr. Calacanis later introduced Mr. Zappacosta to Mr. Botha, the Sequoia partner in charge of the scouts program. Mr. Botha also was a director of Inside.com. 

Mr. Zappacosta says Mr. Calacanis urged him later to take a direct investment from Sequoia.  There are times they are going to be hard on you, but that's what you want," Mr. Zappacosta recalls being told.  They're going to push you to be better."

In September, Thumbtack's valuation "http://graphics.wsj.com/billion-dollar-club/?co=Thumbtack".

Mr. Zappacosta says he didn't know for three years that the initial investment from Mr. Calacanis was made with Sequoia's money. He says the secrecy doesn't bother him.

 At the time, [Sequoia] had rules about not wanting to divulge that it was the source [of scout] funds," he says.  Now they want you to tell the founder."

Scouts propose new investments by submitting a short questionnaire about the startup to Sequoia, which rarely says no. It makes sure the company is based in the U.S. and not in a controversial business like guns or alcohol.

 Other scouts sometimes get emails offering them a chance to  follow on" with an investment, says someone who got one of the emails.

Scouts also have chances to hobnob with one another at annual meetings. Mr. Botha says the events build a  sense of community."

Last year, a few dozen scouts ate dinner at tables in Mr. Botha's backyard in Los Altos Hills, Calif., chatting and presenting data about some of their investments, say people who were there.

Mr. Botha later sent an email with a link to photos from the evening, according to a copy reviewed the Journal. He asked the scouts to keep Sequoia in mind and thanked them for being part of the firm's  family."

Argus hires BofA to review business options; Media

Argus Media Group has hired bankers to advise on options for the privately owned company, including a sale or a stock market flotation.

The London-based company, which helps assess global oil prices and provide industry news, said it had appointed Bank of America Merrill Lynch to conduct a review of its business after receiving approaches from several prospective investors, including trade buyers and private equity funds.

There have been several transactions involving financial data and media companies in the past two years that provided impetus for some Argus shareholders to seek an exit while the "market is hot", said one person familiar with the situation.

These include Markit's $1.3bn flotation in New York last year, Verisk Analytics' agreement to buy Wood Mackenzie for 1.9bn in March, and McGraw Hill Financial's proposal to purchase SNL Financial for $2.2bn in July.

Any deal involving Argus would enable the company to grow through acquisitions, said the person close to the matter.

Adrian Binks , Argus's executive chairman, said: "We think the scale of our operations is at a point where we need to transition from a privately owned family business to a corporate structure that better matches what I see as our very significant long-term potential."

Mr Binks, who announced in June that he was stepping down as Argus's chief executive, is understood to be committed to retaining his stake in the company, while other shareholders, including members of the founding Nasmyth family, are said to want to sell.

Mr Binks' shareholding provides him with 30 per cent of the voting rights at Argus, and his approval was required to hire advisers and begin a strategic review.

"Our aim is to allow those of our current shareholders who wish to exit to do so at a full and fair price," he said.

Apple, Banks in Talks on Mobile Person-to-Person Payment Service; Service would be a rival to PayPal s Venmo platform

Apple Inc. is in discussions with U.S. banks to develop a payment service that would let users zap money to one another from their phones rather than relying on cash or checks, according to people familiar with the matter.

The move would put the tech giant in competition with an increasing number of Silicon Valley firms trying to persuade Americans to ditch their wallets in favor of digital options.

A small but growing number of Americans are already starting to embrace such services allowing consumers to pay baby sitters, split dinner checks and share other bills.

The talks with banks are continuing and it is unclear if any of the firms have struck an agreement with Apple, these people said. Key details remain in flux, including technical aspects that would determine how the service would tie into the banking industry's existing infrastructure, they said.

If Apple's plans go forward, the service would likely be similar to PayPal Holdings Inc.'s Venmo platform, which is popular among younger consumers to do things such as pitch in on gifts and share rent payments with roommates.

It isn't clear how Apple will make money on the service, but the move is another effort by the firm to tighten its hold on customers by getting them to use their iPhones for everyday needs, including financial services.

It also represents the latest attempt by banks and other providers to shift Americans away from cash and checks, which can be more costly and less efficient for the banks and less convenient for customers. Those methods are still the most popular ways people send money to friends and pay service providers such as handymen.

The Apple service under consideration would allow consumers to send payments from their checking accounts to recipients through their Apple devices. It would likely be linked to "http://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-to-allow-retail-store-credit-cards-on-apple-pay-system-1433780801", which allows customers to make credit-card and debit-card payments with mobile phones.

A launch isn't imminent, but one person said such a service could get off the ground next year. This year, Apple was granted a U.S. patent for an encrypted person-to-person payment system using electronic devices that communicate wirelessly.

Apple has been talking with a number of banks about the service, including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Capital One Financial Corp., Wells Fargo & Co. and U.S. Bancorp, the people said.

Most person-to-person services allow users to send money to friends or others via an app on cellphones, typically by putting in the recipients' phone number or email address. The transfers are generally free, though the providers charge for certain transactions such as when a payment is funded from a credit card rather than a checking account.

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304536104579558071421978060", accounting for 19% of mobile person-to-person payments, according to a report from Aite Group LLC, a consulting firm that focuses on the payments industry. It is favored by young adults and teenagers who particularly like a feature in which they can list their payments on a social-media feed. Consumers made $2.1 billion of mobile payments using Venmo in the third quarter, up from $700 million in the year-earlier period, according to PayPal.

A PayPal spokesman said,  We welcome any development that encourages people to address the awkwardness of dealing with cash when paying friends or family back."

Alphabet Inc.'s Google unit, payment startup Square Inc. and Facebook Inc. all offer person-to-person payments as well.

Patrick Moorhead, principal analyst at Moor Insights & Strategy, said technology firms are in part battling to get access to users' financial information, which companies can then use to develop other products. For example, when Apple created Apple Pay, it had hundreds of millions of users who had registered credit cards with them on iTunes.

 The winner may be the place where people are already spending their time," said Mr. Moorhead.

Apple in recent years has added a number of options, including "http://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-ceo-tim-cook-apple-music-has-15-million-users-1445319068", aimed at keeping the iPhone central to customers' lives.

Speaking on Wednesday at Trinity College in Dublin, Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook said that digital-payments systems like Apple Pay will become so pervasive in the future that  your kids will not know what" cash is.

Most people prefer to pay each other using traditional methods. Fewer than one in five North Americans use their mobile phones to make at least one payment a week, according to a report issued last month by consulting firm Accenture.

One potential reason for slow adoption is the security concerns about the multiple new ways for consumers to send money. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. last year warned consumers that person-to-person services can carry fees and privacy risks, particularly if there is a social-media aspect to them.

Apple introduced Apple Pay in October 2014. Over the past year, it has steadily added banks and merchants willing to accept Apple Pay. Apple Pay is more widely known than other mobile-payment options, but it is still in its early stages. Of eligible Apple Pay users, only 13% said they had tried the service, according to a June survey conducted by PYMNTS.com, a payments industry news site, and InfoScout, an analytics firm. That figure was down from 15% in March.

Facebook introduced peer-to-peer payments through its Messenger service in March. Once a user adds a debit card to a Facebook account, the person can send money through the chat window.

Google said it has allowed people to send money to each other via its Gmail service for a few years, but created an app called Google Wallet two months ago for people seeking a mobile option. It allows users to send payments to each other via debit card through an emailed link. Square also allows peer-to-peer payments using debit cards to users who have created a  $cashtag" account with the service.

Apple last month announced that it is joining with American Express Co. to bring Apple Pay to Canada and Australia, but banks that issue under the Visa Inc. and MasterCard Inc. brands haven't signed up to the service.

One of the options being considered by Apple is to hook into an existing person-to-person payment service called clearXchange that is already offered by the nation's banks, according to a person familiar with the talks. The service, which has recently been overhauled and expanded, lets people use their checking account to send each other money with an email address or cellphone number.

Under the discussions, Apple wouldn't charge the banks for participating in its person-to-person payment service, said the person familiar with the talks. That is different from Apple Pay in which the banks pay Apple for each transaction.

Sending money is free through Venmo when pulled from a linked bank account, but there is a 3% fee on credit cards and some debit cards. Receiving money through the Venmo app is free.

My Tour of American Credit Scores

Imagine my surprise when I learned that my son, freshly out of college and applying for a car loan, enjoys a higher credit rating than I do, despite my 35 years of never missing a credit card or mortgage payment. One car dealer explained that my son had a pristine status simply because he'd never borrowed.

Whether out of embarrassment, confusion or curiosity, I decided to look into the rating, known as the FICO score, which is pulled for nearly all consumer lending -- 90% of credit checks, 10 billion times a year. Yet the more I dug, the more I uncovered vague if not manipulative practices. Remember how three credit-rating firms stamped bogus AAAs on subprime mortgages, leading to the financial crisis in 2008? The similarities are eerie.

FICO is software from the Fair Isaac Corp., which bills itself as a "predictive analytics and decision management company." Started in 1956, Fair Issac began licensing its code in 1989 to the three national credit-rating firms in America, Experian, TransUnion and Equifax, to produce scores ranging from 300-850. The formula is secret, the Kentucky Fried Chicken recipe of lending.

We know a little about what goes into a credit score: unequal parts payment history, amount owed, length of history, types of credit. FICO doesn't care whether you pay your rent, utilities and cellphone bill, or save for a down payment on a house. A sample model floating around suggests that points are added for a long payment history, which makes sense, but deducted for having too many credit checks performed or, oddly, paying your credit card bill in full each month rather than underpaying and carrying a balance.

Plenty of tips to improve your FICO score are available, including reporting your credit card as stolen so that when you get a new one, you'll have two credit cards with long payment histories. I doubt that works.

Want to know your FICO score? Good luck. Thousands of websites offer free credit scores, but they're inaccurate estimates affectionately known as FAKO scores. Most have disclaimers. Many, such as Truecredit.com, are owned by the same credit agencies that calculate your score for banks or mortgage lenders. The websites often require signing up for an alert service at $29 or $39 a month. By the way, perusing these sites will flood your browser with ads from credit agencies.

The only place to find your true score is myFICO.com, owned by Fair Isaac. It comes with the following note in tiny font: "Your subscription will automatically renew at $29.95 unless you cancel." Et tu, FICO?

Enter the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, pushed into existence by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.). In May 2014 the CFPB complained that medical debt, a short credit history and interactions with collection agencies unfairly craters your score. Presto: That November FICO rolled out a tweaked formula that rinsed these biases. The company suggested credit scores could rise by 100 points.

But now lenders know that the scores can be manipulated at the whim of government agencies, so they will discount scores by 100 points, regardless of whether you had medical debt or dealt with collection agencies. The result for everyone else is higher costs for loans or denial of credit, and lenders now seek alternative credit scoring systems.

That's at least one positive development: The creation of smart software with algorithms that try to predict how likely a borrower is to repay a loan. SoFi, a San Francisco firm, consolidates student loans using an algorithm that considers where you went to school and who you work for, along with your income and expenses. The company has since added mortgages and personal loans.

Former Google staffers founded the online lender Upstart, which cuts deals based on grade-point average, SAT score, college attended and even major. "You are more than your credit score," the website reads. "On Upstart your education and experience help you get the rate you deserve." I wonder if gender-studies majors from Brown will ever be able to borrow again.

Facebook recently snagged a patent for a method of calculating your credit risk based on how your Facebook friends measure up. (Which reminds me, I have some shady high school friends to scrub from my account.)

Also intriguing are the online peer-to-peer groups Lending Club and Prosper, which sell loans to members and get out of dealing with banks. Prosper sent me a flyer preapproving me for $35,000, but I didn't want to risk the shame of falling further behind my son. So I applied for a Prosper loan for medical expenses on behalf of my dog. I'd nearly wrapped up the Fido loan application when the company requested her Social Security number to verify . . . her FICO score. There is no escape.

More than half of Americans have bad credit scores, according to a recent report from the Corporation for Enterprise Development. Perhaps we could address that by showing people reliable scores. The next step would be unveiling the algorithm so consumers can improve rather than game their scores.

Another issue is allowing more than three credit agencies access to the underlying database so they can make informed algorithms rather than guessing on college majors and deadbeat Facebook friends. But most important, if the score is to mean anything, is keeping Ms. Warren and her comrades from deciding how a car salesman hands out loans.

Charges Announced in J.P. Morgan Hacking Case; Three men allegedly hacked 12 companies, including J.P. Morgan and Dow Jones and

In one of the biggest cybercrimes in history, federal prosecutors say, three men stole data on more than 100 million people from a dozen companies' computers and used a vast global network of accomplices to turn it into hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal profits.

Indictments unsealed Tuesday in Manhattan and Atlanta accused the men and hundreds of their accomplices of carrying out last year's big data breach at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and a host of other crimes around the world involving computer networks in South Africa and Brazil, money laundered through Cyprus and illegal credit-card payments processed in Azerbaijan.

Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara on Tuesday said this  diversified criminal conglomerate" was  breathtaking" in the size and scope of its hacking.

The indictments allege the three defendants and their associates hacked into banks and other companies to obtain customer information that they later used in a pump-and-dump stock scheme. Meanwhile, the computer-hacking operation made possible a network of other criminal activity, including illegal Internet casinos, a payment processing service for other criminals and an unlicensed bitcoin exchange, prosecutors alleged.

Among the most lucrative was a pump-and-dump scheme, where the men would artificially inflate prices of penny stocks and then trick investors into buying them by sending spam to the email addresses they had stolen during the hacks. To further the scheme, the defendants sometimes engineered mergers with shell companies to create publicly traded stocks that could be manipulated, prosecutors said.

The mastermind of the enterprise, prosecutors allege, was Gery Shalon, a 31-year-old Israeli citizen and resident. The indictment described moments where he bragged about the success of his schemes, including the pump-and-dump one, which he allegedly called  a small step towards a large empire."

When asked by a co-conspirator whether buying stocks in America was popular, Mr. Shalon allegedly responded:  It's like drinking freaking vodka in Russia."

One of the biggest breaches occurred last year when hackers broke into J.P. Morgan's networks and made off with the contact information of more than 83 million customers.

Although a criminal complaint had already been filed against the defendants earlier this year, Tuesday's indictments were the first time officials named the suspected hackers and linked them publicly to the J.P. Morgan hack.

In total, the men are accused of breaching 11 other companies, spanning online brokerages to software-development companies. The companies included Dow Jones & Co., the parent company of The Wall Street Journal. Ashley Huston, a spokeswoman for Dow Jones, said:  The indictment unsealed today refers to the public disclosure we made on Oct. 9. The government's investigation is ongoing, and we continue to cooperate with law enforcement."

The schemes allowed Mr. Shalon and his accomplices to turn stolen information into hundreds of millions of dollars, including at least $100 million hidden in his Swiss and other bank accounts, prosecutors said.

In addition to Mr. Shalon, prosecutors filed expanded charges against 40-year-old Ziv Orenstein, also an Israeli citizen, and 31-year-old Joshua Aaron, a U.S. citizen living in Moscow. The three face 23 criminal counts, including wire fraud, computer hacking and money laundering, which carry decades in prison if convicted.

Mr. Orenstein and Mr. Shalon were arrested this summer in Israel and are awaiting extradition to the U.S. Mr. Aaron remains a fugitive. Lawyers for Messrs. Shalon and Orenstein in Israel didn't comment, and an attorney representing Mr. Orenstein in the U.S. wasn't immediately available for comment. Neither Mr. Aaron nor his lawyer could be reached.

The breach of J.P. Morgan, described as  Victim 1" in one of the indictments, made use of a computer server based in Egypt that had been rented under an alias from a third-party company, prosecutors said, adding that the rental was abruptly canceled the day after the J.P. Morgan hack was first reported in the media in August 2014.

A J.P. Morgan spokeswoman said the bank has joined with law enforcement  in bringing the criminals to justice," and it continues to cooperate with them on cybercrime.

The investigation into the three men began when J.P. Morgan came forward  early on" to share information with the government, prosecutors said. That led investigators to uncover a broader network of criminal activity with computer hacking at its center. They built their case partly with the help of two cooperating witnesses, described in the indictment as  promoters" who identified companies for the defendants to target in the pump-and-dump scheme.

Another person allegedly involved with Mr. Shalon's schemes was Anthony Murgio, 31, who had been charged earlier this year for running an unlicensed bitcoin exchange and was slapped with new conspiracy and wire-fraud charges on Tuesday. Mr. Shalon owned the exchange, prosecutors alleged, and used it to charge customers a fee for exchanging cash to bitcoin, a digital currency. Mr. Murgio's lawyer didn't respond to a request for comment.

A separate but related indictment unsealed on Tuesday by the Atlanta U.S. attorney's office detailed how Mr. Shalon, Mr. Aaron and a third unnamed defendant hacked into E*Trade Financial Corp. and Scottrade Inc. to steal customer data. The unnamed defendant is described as a computer hacker believed to have resided in Russia.

At one point, the defendants discussed stealing nonpublic information, with an unnamed co-conspirator telling Mr. Shalon that top managers in one of the companies may have  some interesting info" in their email.  It's a big company after all. [Maybe] they have some secrets."

Mr. Shalon responded:  Yes, this is a very cool idea."

The company, identified in the indictment as Victim 5, is Scottrade. A Scottrade spokeswoman said the company was continuing to work closely with the authorities. An E*Trade representative said the company is continuing to focus  significant time and energy" to keep customer data safe.

Prosecutors said the case shows how much companies struggle to keep up with savvy cybercriminals. The defendants are also accused of processing payments for other criminals, including illegal pharmaceutical distributors and software counterfeiters.

In addition to disguising payments and constantly obtaining new bank accounts, the men tried to evade detection by hacking into a company that assessed merchant risk for credit-card issuers, starting in 2012. The breach allowed the defendants to read employees' emails and figure out how to sidestep the company's efforts to monitor illegal payments, according to the indictment.

Mr. Shalon discussed the risk of law-enforcement detection of their activities with an accomplice who said,  [in] Israel, you guys probably don't have to be afraid of the USA. . . meaning that even if there is some case, they won't be able to do anything?" Mr. Shalon responded that there was  nothing to be afraid of in Israel," though he later said he would get a passport in another name.

Prosecutors have also accused the defendants of operating at least 12 illegal Internet casinos around the world, including in the U.S. The men allegedly launched cyberattacks against rival gambling businesses to secretly review their executives' emails and gain a competitive edge, according to the indictment.

Mr. Shalon orchestrated hacks into his competitors' customer databases and directed denial-of-service attacks to temporarily shut down their businesses, prosecutors said.

The FT and Glassdoor s inaugural Best Places to Work ranking lists the top-30 employers in finance and consulting in the UK.

Peninsula Business Services, the consulting firm, garnered the top rank for its sound management, strong benefits, excellent career development and training opportunities as well as its efforts to make the workplace fun and rewarding. Read the case study here.

At seventh, GE Capital, was the top-ranked employer in financial services and stood out because of its focus on the individual priorities and ambitions of each of its employees. It also scored highly among its current and former employees for its focus on bringing inclusivity and diversity to the workplace. Read the case study here.

The financial crisis and a host of scandals have made it much more difficult for banks and companies that serve the financial sector to attract top quality recruits. Employers are having to rethink radically the benefits they offer to compete with the technology sector and start-ups. Money is no longer enough. Read the analysis here.

Andrew Chamberlain, "http://www.glassdoor.com" s chief economist, says analysis of the recruitment site s data shows that, over time, employee satisfaction boosts company value.

He writes:

"https://www.glassdoor.com/research/do-satisfied-employees-impact-stock-performance/" found that if investors had bought shares in Glassdoor s 50  Best Places to Work  in 2009 and held them until the end of 2014, they would have outperformed the S&P 500 by 115.6 per cent.

The results suggest a meaningful economic link between employee satisfaction and stock market performance.

To be fair, being named on the Glassdoor (or any other)  best-of  list is no guarantee of future stock performance. But the research shows that companies recognised for excellent culture and high employee satisfaction outperform the stock market over time   while companies that rank poorly have significantly underperformed.

Before the launch of Glassdoor in 2008, measuring company culture was a monumentally difficult task   particularly for outside investors. But a growing database of company reviews from employees has allowed a clear link between company culture and broader financial performance to emerge.

The message to today s executives is clear: workplace transparency is here to stay. Those who ignore the importance of corporate culture may be doing so at the expense of their companies  financial detriment.

Methodology of ranking

The ranking was created by analysing the tens of thousands of anonymous reviews left on Glassdoor.com by people in the UK for their employers.

Employers included those in consulting, financial analytics and research, financial transaction processing, insurance agencies and brokers, insurance carriers, investment banking and asset management, and lending. Those with fewer than 30 reviews were excluded.

The resulting employers were ranked by their overall company rating, highest first. Their ratings ranged from 4.5 to 3.4 on a five point scale (1-5). The  average  rating across all 8m employer reviews on Glassdoor is 3.2.

Snapchat has been marked down by one of its most high-profile investors, raising further questions about the soaring valuations of private technology companies.

Fidelity, the only fund manager to have invested in the four-year-old messaging app best known for disappearing photos, wrote down the value of its stake by 25 per cent in the third quarter, according to data from investment research firm Morningstar.

It had valued each share at $30.72 at the end of June but cut the valuation to $22.91 by the end of September.

Other Snapchat investors include Benchmark and Kleiner Perkins, the Silicon Valley venture capital firms, as well as tech companies Alibaba, Tencent and Yahoo. Snapchat was valued at $15bn at its fundraising in May, according to people familiar with the matter. That made it the fourth-most highly valued private US tech start-up, behind taxi-booking app Uber, Airbnb, the accommodation rental site, and data analytics company Palantir.

The markdown highlights a debate in Silicon Valley about the high valuations assigned to private companies. It follows a string of initial public offerings of tech groups that have been priced lower than their last private fundraising rounds.

It is unclear why Fidelity marked down its stake but Snapchat is still searching for a sustainable revenue model.

The app has 100m daily active users who watch billions of videos on the site each day. But it does not appear to have convinced marketers that its experimental advertising formats will pay off.

"There's huge potential but as yet there isn't a proposition that is clearly identifiable. I think they are not yet in the stage really of defining how they can make brands live on the platform," said Nigel Morris, senior executive at Dentsu Aegis Network, the advertising agency.

Fidelity and Snapchat declined to comment on the writedown.

Valuations in private tech companies depend on a range of factors, including the financials they disclose to investors to the share price of similar companies.

The fortunes of Facebook and Twitter, the listed social networks most like Snapchat, have diverged. Shares in the former have risen 41 per cent in the past year, while Twitter's stock has fallen 33 per cent.

REVIEW --- The Uberization Of Money --- The familiar middlemen of 20th-century banking and investing are giving way to something very different; Are we ready for the opportunities -- and the risks?

Imagine that you want to buy a home. You might find a real-estate agent to show you around, which is a very 20th-century way of doing things. Or you might go 21st century and use the Web to research prices and available properties and to take a few virtual tours.

When it comes time to buy, however, you will probably revert to procedures that were created in your grandparents' era. You will assemble financial documents and present them to a loan officer at a bank, who will take weeks to determine what you can borrow and at what rate and then present you with a narrow menu of costly options.

Imagine instead a simple online interface that could generate a tailored credit score for you, taking into account your future earning potential based on your education and location. It would connect you to lenders ranging from banks and credit unions to pools of individuals who want to lend privately at a negotiated rate for whatever duration you agree on. You could shop around, combine different types of financing and arrange a mortgage package that best suits you, all within a few hours.

We aren't quite there yet, but we may be soon. Over the next decade, the familiar 20th-century modes of banking and investing will give way to something very different. We are on the verge of the Uberization of finance, which will bring multiple new opportunities but also a range of new risks.

The ubiquitous ride-sharing company uses a simple device -- the smartphone -- to connect people who want rides with people who want to drive them. Uber is a high-tech middleman that is making the intermediaries of the past obsolete. The financial world is one of the most mediated industries on the planet, and that is precisely what is about to change. Uberization also means using vast amounts of data to make those connections feasible.

Technology is one source of this shift, but so is legislation. The JOBS Act of 2012 contained a seemingly innocuous provision making it easier for startups to raise money from investors previously deemed too poor to dabble in such ventures. At the end of October, the Securities and Exchange Commission finally approved the rules, which will go into full effect early next year. As a result, any company or person with an idea can solicit and raise up to $1 million without most of the onerous regulatory and reporting requirements of the past.

So what lies ahead? Retail banking is the one area of the financial world that has undergone tremendous change over the past decade. Bank tellers are now scarce, and many consumers use smartphones for payments and deposits. It also has become much easier to trade shares online.

But core services such as lending money, raising capital and investing for clients still depend on a firm to act as a conduit -- and as a choke point. With many promising startups already launched and with venture capital funding new ones every day, here's a glimpse of what we can expect in the years ahead.

The most immediate change will be an explosion in peer-to-peer lending. Just as Uber returns us to a world where anyone with a car could offer a ride to anyone with a thumb, peer-to-peer lending is both new and old. Before there was a robust retail and commercial banking system, there were people with money to lend and people who wanted to borrow it. But the current wave of peer-to-peer services takes this much further, into a hypercharged virtual realm where pools of small lenders can combine online to disperse pools of small loans. And they can do it without the friction, cost or heavy regulatory hurdles of traditional banking.

There are already many players in this field, such as Lending Club and Prosper, but most are already a decade old -- ancient by tech standards. With less than $7 billion in loans in 2014, they are tiny in the multi-trillion-dollar lending world. Now the sector is showing explosive growth. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that it could be a $150 billion business by 2025.

The downside is that peer-to-peer interest rates are higher than at mainstream banks, sometimes well into the teens. The upside is that people who need modest sums (one site caps them at $35,000) can easily obtain funds from small individual lenders looking for a high return. What makes it attractive for lenders is that they can spread their capital over far more loans than any one peer could make to another peer, which reduces their risk.

And the options are proliferating. Venture capitalists clearly believe that nontraditional lending will be a huge market, especially for millennials who, in survey after survey, express distrust and disdain for traditional banks. New companies such as SoFi (which has raised more than $1 billion) are focusing on individual loans at even lower costs and on the student market, helping people to refinance their loan packages. SoFi is also rapidly moving into mortgage refinancing, another area where traditional banks and government have been, to put it mildly, sluggish.

Lending money to businesses remains a pillar of the financial sector. Yet credit standards, judging by Federal Reserve surveys of loan officers, remain much tighter than before the financial crisis of 2008-09. That may be prudent, but it has had a chilling effect on business creation. The U.S. is now 12th in the world in new business creation, according to Gallup, and significantly fewer new businesses are started today than in the 1970s, when the U.S. population was much smaller.

Loans to large companies are up over the past decade, but lending to small business has contracted, from more than $700 billion in 2008 to less than $600 billion today, according to the Small Business Administration. As for the Silicon Valley ecosystem of venture capital, it certainly doles out funds to dreamers, but it excludes many types of businesses, especially brick-and-mortar ones.

All of this explains why new funding ventures have received such a boost from the JOBS Act. Kickstarter is the most familiar, with Indiegogo close behind. These crowdfunding platforms let almost anyone announce an idea and solicit money for it, usually in chunks of $1,000 or less. No established venture-capital firm or large bank would dole out such small amounts. Their overhead alone, for due diligence and compliance, would mean steep losses on investments that size.

But the new crowdfunding sites remove those layers, and for now they have few of the regulatory burdens or scrutiny. It is the Wild West of fundraising. The most recent success was Oculus Rift, a maker of virtual reality headsets that raised $2.4 million on Kickstarter and then was bought by Facebook a little more than a year later for $2 billion.

The big hitch? A Kickstarter contribution is a donation. When people fund projects on the site, it is out of passion for the product, not any hope for a financial return.

The next wave of crowdfunding, through sites such as SeedInvest and Fundable, will offer equity ownership to those who throw money into the ring. This new model could upend the insular world of venture capital and business loans while at the same time providing new opportunities for small investors. As for a would-be innovator, if you can post an idea online, raise a million dollars for it and (most important) choose how much equity you want to part with at what valuation, why go through the gauntlet of a commercial loan application or make the rounds at the VC firms on Sand Hill Road?

The result is likely to be billions of dollars of new funding, which would spur lots of good ideas -- and lots of bad ones, too. The prospect of unconventional new funding sources has already prompted comparisons to 1999, when millions of individual investors joined the IPO craze only to see their shares of Pets.com become worthless. Such risks are very real, but either way, much more money will be in motion.

The traditional model for buying and selling stocks, managing a portfolio and handling assets for retirement was to pay someone else to do it. The next model will be to use Web-based technology to do it yourself or to work in conjunction with experts online.

One of the hottest areas of fundraising in the financial world is a panoply of online wealth-management companies offering a range of services. Their assets are tiny today, not much more than $20 billion. But they have attracted attention and funding because they, too, threaten to disrupt the traditional modes.

Betterment, Wealthfront, Personal Capital and other "robo advisers," though still marginal in terms of assets, have shaken the wealth-management market. Especially for smaller accounts, they offer basic asset allocation and investing services for a fraction of the ordinary fees. Fund behemoths such as Vanguard and online brokers such as Schwab also have developed and unrolled their own digital advisory services.

Then there is the rise of exchange-traded funds, which are challenging actively managed mutual funds, especially those that charge high fees to deliver the same returns as an index. More than 1,500 ETFs now account for $2 trillion in U.S. assets.

Change will also arrive in the way that stocks and bonds are sold. The 20th-century model has already given way to the online world of ETrade and Schwab, but those models are being challenged, too. Newer digital entrants can offer fractional shares of both stocks and bonds. Bond trading in particular is still controlled by a small number of dealers in the belly of traditional Wall Street for high, opaque fees.

Those who profit purely by facilitating simple financial transactions are increasingly hard-pressed to compete when many of those transactions can be done for nearly zero cost. The traditional investment banks are already seeing profits from their trading desks plummet. Bond business for Goldman Sachs was down 33% last quarter, and its rivals didn't fare much better.

The trend ahead is worse for these legacy firms. If they offer a service that is not easily automated, they can thrive. If not, look out. Why pay a broker a hefty commission if the same purchase can be done online for pennies? Why pay a human adviser who does no more than cookie-cutter asset allocation? Why pay an active mutual fund if it only offers index returns?

The developing financial landscape will include more creative ways to save and invest, more ways to buy and sell stocks and bonds, and more demand for better advice, delivered interactively online.

For the past century and a half, every bubble that has burst in the equities market has been followed by a long period of retrenchment. Individuals get burned and then avoid exposure to future losses. That happened after the Great Depression and after 1999, and it is happening now in the wake of the financial crisis. Equity markets have gone up and up since March 2009, but retail investors have been largely on the sidelines.

But what if the next wave of stock ownership isn't just trading your own account, but stocks as a form of affiliation with brands? What if that Starbucks card came not just with a free latte after 10 purchases but a share of Starbucks after 100? And what if the maker of that cool new device, the GoPro of tomorrow, could offer its shares directly to its avid users instead of having to rely on investment banks to dole out the shares?

Several Silicon Valley startups are already attacking the problem. Loyal3 aims to connect public companies to loyal customers who want to buy shares as early as the IPO, while EquityZen and others do the same for private companies. The idea of directly marketing shares to customers is old, but the new wave makes it far easier -- at the click of a button -- and cheaper. If these novel ways of buying and distributing shares take off, it could turn stock ownership into a more universal phenomenon.

Providing financial services to the less well-off and the unbanked is also an area seeing considerable investment interest and activity. ZestFinance, founded by former Google executives and flush with venture capital, uses big data to offset the inherent risks. It is just one of many new ventures in this field, which promises to open hitherto closed spigots of capital to all classes, not just the middle and upper.

It is easy, of course, to forecast a new world of money in motion and all of the benefits it may entail. These innovations are almost all products of the last five years, after the financial crisis. They might look less promising if the tide suddenly goes out again. A large institution can survive a bad investment; an individual of modest means won't so easily weather a complete wipeout on a peer-to-peer loan.

Whatever the risks, however, the Uberization of finance is no fad or stunt. Many of today's startups may implode, as most do, but the spread and democratization of capital -- and the proliferation and analysis of data -- are irresistible trends. They will offer new opportunities to millions of people, entrepreneurs and investors alike. They also will unlock a vast amount of money, energy and talent, and to that we simply should say, bring it on.

Global Finance -- MoneyBeat: Merrill Lynch Warns of the Coming Robot Apocalypse

If you're looking for a hot investment idea, Bank of America Merrill Lynch has one word for you: robots. If you are a cautious investor, the firm has two words for you: killer robots.

The firm published a massive, 300-page report last week outlining the opportunities for investors in robotics and artificial intelligence. "Robots and AI are becoming an integral part of our daily lives," equity strategist Beijia Ma wrote, "as providers of labor, mobility, safety, convenience, and entertainment." The firm estimates this will be a $153 billion market by 2020, with robots performing 45% of manufacturing tasks by 2025, compared with 10% today. There are opportunities for investors in aerospace, transport, financials, health care, services and mining. But there are risks, too: Robots could replace workers, robots pose cybersecurity risks, and so on. But there was one specifically that caught our eye.

Killer robots.

"We anticipate growing risks around robots," the report says, "the smart grid, autonomous or self-driving cars, and drones and commercial flights. Stakeholders are also raising legitimate, longer-term questions as to when robots/AI reaches a point that machines are truly intelligent or smarter than humans, and around the development of fully autonomous weapons." The report cites a Pew survey that found 48% on industry insiders worry about the effects of robots on society. If robots take all the jobs, for example, it risks societal upheaval.

Then there are the military drones. The firm estimates that $123 billion will be invested in drones over the next decade. But, then, who is going to control the drones?

"The use of weaponized unmanned aerial vehicles or drones has already changed the face of warfare, but has also drawn global criticism," the report says, and mentions campaigns against the development of "autonomous killing weapons" that have included such luminaries as Stephen Hawking, Steve Wozniak and Elon Musk.

But, that phrase, "killer robots." Makes you think of the Terminator, right? And if Stephen Hawking is worried about it, shouldn't you be, too? Is the singularity near? The moment when robots become self-aware, become far more intelligent than all of us idiots wandering around playing Angry Birds?

Well, it's a risk.

The Uberization of Money; The familiar middlemen of 20th-century banking and investing are giving way to something very different. Are we ready for the opportunities and the risks?

Imagine that you want to buy a home. You might find a real-estate agent to show you around, which is a very 20th-century way of doing things. Or you might go 21st century and use the Web to research prices and available properties and to take a few virtual tours.

When it comes time to buy, however, you will probably revert to procedures that were created in your grandparents' era. You will assemble financial documents and present them to a loan officer at a bank, who will take weeks to determine what you can borrow and at what rate and then present you with a narrow menu of costly options.

Imagine instead a simple online interface that could generate a tailored credit score for you, taking into account your future earning potential based on your education and location. It would connect you to lenders ranging from banks and credit unions to pools of individuals who want to lend privately at a negotiated rate for whatever duration you agree on. You could shop around, combine different types of financing and arrange a mortgage package that best suits you, all within a few hours.

We aren't quite there yet, but we may be soon. Over the next decade, the familiar 20th-century modes of banking and investing will give way to something very different. We are on the verge of the Uberization of finance, which will bring multiple new opportunities but also a range of new risks.

The ubiquitous ride-sharing company uses a simple device the smartphone to connect people who want rides with people who want to drive them. Uber is a high-tech middleman that is making the intermediaries of the past obsolete. The financial world is one of the most mediated industries on the planet, and that is precisely what is about to change. Uberization also means using vast amounts of data to make those connections feasible.

Technology is one source of this shift, but so is legislation. The "https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/jobs-act.shtml" contained a seemingly innocuous provision making it easier for startups to raise money from investors previously deemed too poor to dabble in such ventures. At the end of October, the Securities and Exchange Commission finally approved the rules, which will go into full effect early next year. As a result, any company or person with an idea can solicit and raise up to $1 million without most of the onerous regulatory and reporting requirements of the past.

So what lies ahead? Retail banking is the one area of the financial world that has undergone tremendous change over the past decade. Bank tellers are now scarce, and many consumers use smartphones for payments and deposits. It also has become much easier to trade shares online.

But core services such as lending money, raising capital and investing for clients still depend on a firm to act as a conduit and as a choke point. With many promising startups already launched and with venture capital funding new ones every day, here's a glimpse of what we can expect in the years ahead.

Hey buddy, can you spare a loan?

The most immediate change will be an explosion in peer-to-peer lending. Just as Uber returns us to a world where anyone with a car could offer a ride to anyone with a thumb, peer-to-peer lending is both new and old. Before there was a robust retail and commercial banking system, there were people with money to lend and people who wanted to borrow it. But the current wave of peer-to-peer services takes this much further, into a hypercharged virtual realm where pools of small lenders can combine online to disperse pools of small loans. And they can do it without the friction, cost or heavy regulatory hurdles of traditional banking.

There are already many players in this field, such as Lending Club and Prosper, but most are already a decade old ancient by tech standards. With less than $7 billion in loans in 2014, they are tiny in the multi-trillion-dollar lending world. Now the sector is showing explosive growth. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that it could be a $150 billion business by 2025.

The downside is that peer-to-peer interest rates are higher than at mainstream banks, sometimes well into the teens. The upside is that people who need modest sums (one site caps them at $35,000) can easily obtain funds from small individual lenders looking for a high return. What makes it attractive for lenders is that they can spread their capital over far more loans than any one peer could make to another peer, which reduces their risk.

And the options are proliferating. Venture capitalists clearly believe that nontraditional lending will be a huge market, especially for millennials who, in survey after survey, express distrust and disdain for traditional banks. New companies such as SoFi (which has raised more than $1 billion) are focusing on individual loans at even lower costs and on the student market, helping people to refinance their loan packages. SoFi is also rapidly moving into mortgage refinancing, another area where traditional banks and government have been, to put it mildly, sluggish.

If you build it, they will come.

Lending money to businesses remains a pillar of the financial sector. Yet credit standards, judging by Federal Reserve surveys of loan officers, remain much tighter than before the financial crisis of 2008-09. That may be prudent, but it has had a chilling effect on business creation. The U.S. is now 12th in the world in new business creation, according to Gallup, and significantly fewer new businesses are started today than in the 1970s, when the U.S. population was much smaller.

Loans to large companies are up over the past decade, but lending to small business has contracted, from more than $700 billion in 2008 to less than $600 billion today, according to the Small Business Administration. As for the Silicon Valley ecosystem of venture capital, it certainly doles out funds to dreamers, but it excludes many types of businesses, especially brick-and-mortar ones.

All of this explains why new funding ventures have received such a boost from the JOBS Act. Kickstarter is the most familiar, with Indiegogo close behind. These crowdfunding platforms let almost anyone announce an idea and solicit money for it, usually in chunks of $1,000 or less. No established venture-capital firm or large bank would dole out such small amounts. Their overhead alone, for due diligence and compliance, would mean steep losses on investments that size.

But the new crowdfunding sites remove those layers, and for now they have few of the regulatory burdens or scrutiny. It is the Wild West of fundraising. The most recent success was Oculus Rift, a maker of virtual reality headsets that raised $2.4 million on Kickstarter and then was bought by Facebook a little more than a year later for $2 billion.

The big hitch? A Kickstarter contribution is a donation. When people fund projects on the site, it is out of passion for the product, not any hope for a financial return.

The next wave of crowdfunding, through sites such as SeedInvest and Fundable, will offer equity ownership to those who throw money into the ring. This new model could upend the insular world of venture capital and business loans while at the same time providing new opportunities for small investors. As for a would-be innovator, if you can post an idea online, raise a million dollars for it and (most important) choose how much equity you want to part with at what valuation, why go through the gauntlet of a commercial loan application or make the rounds at the VC firms on Sand Hill Road?

The result is likely to be billions of dollars of new funding, which would spur lots of good ideas and lots of bad ones, too. The prospect of unconventional new funding sources has already prompted comparisons to 1999, when millions of individual investors joined the IPO craze only to see their shares of Pets.com become worthless. Such risks are very real, but either way, much more money will be in motion.

What's a broker?

The traditional model for buying and selling stocks, managing a portfolio and handling assets for retirement was to pay someone else to do it. The next model will be to use Web-based technology to do it yourself or to work in conjunction with experts online.

One of the hottest areas of fundraising in the financial world is a panoply of online wealth-management companies offering a range of services. Their assets are tiny today, not much more than $20 billion. But they have attracted attention and funding because they, too, threaten to disrupt the traditional modes.

Betterment, Wealthfront, Personal Capital and other  robo advisers," though still marginal in terms of assets, have shaken the wealth-management market. Especially for smaller accounts, they offer basic asset allocation and investing services for a fraction of the ordinary fees. Fund behemoths such as Vanguard and online brokers such as Schwab also have developed and unrolled their own digital advisory services.

Then there is the rise of exchange-traded funds, which are challenging actively managed mutual funds, especially those that charge high fees to deliver the same returns as an index. More than 1,500 ETFs now account for $2 trillion in U.S. assets.

Change will also arrive in the way that stocks and bonds are sold. The 20th-century model has already given way to the online world of ETrade and Schwab, but those models are being challenged, too. Newer digital entrants can offer fractional shares of both stocks and bonds. Bond trading in particular is still controlled by a small number of dealers in the belly of traditional Wall Street for high, opaque fees.

Those who profit purely by facilitating simple financial transactions are increasingly hard-pressed to compete when many of those transactions can be done for nearly zero cost. The traditional investment banks are already seeing profits from their trading desks plummet. Bond business for Goldman Sachs was down 33% last quarter, and its rivals didn't fare much better.

The trend ahead is worse for these legacy firms. If they offer a service that is not easily automated, they can thrive. If not, look out. Why pay a broker a hefty commission if the same purchase can be done online for pennies? Why pay a human adviser who does no more than cookie-cutter asset allocation? Why pay an active mutual fund if it only offers index returns?

The developing financial landscape will include more creative ways to save and invest, more ways to buy and sell stocks and bonds, and more demand for better advice, delivered interactively online.

Stocks aren't just for them.

For the past century and a half, every bubble that has burst in the equities market has been followed by a long period of retrenchment. Individuals get burned and then avoid exposure to future losses. That happened after the Great Depression and after 1999, and it is happening now in the wake of the financial crisis. Equity markets have gone up and up since March 2009, but retail investors have been largely on the sidelines.

But what if the next wave of stock ownership isn't just trading your own account, but stocks as a form of affiliation with brands?

Goldman Sachs dumps stock pledged by Valeant chief

Valeant said on Friday that Goldman Sachs had sold more than $100m-worth of shares in the struggling drugmaker, which had been pledged as collateral against a personal loan from the investment bank to the company s chief executive.

Goldman contacted Michael Pearson, Valeant s chief executive, earlier this week and gave him 48 hours to pay off a $100m loan that he took out in 2013 after a precipitous decline in the company s share price triggered a so-called margin call on the debt.

After he failed to raise enough cash to pay off the loan, Goldman on Thursday morning dumped the entire block of just under 1.3m shares, held in Mr Pearson s name, which were worth roughly $119.4m at the open of trading in New York on Thursday.

The sale of Mr Pearson s pledged shares contributed to a rout in the company s stock price on Thursday, during which its market value fell as much as 20 per cent. Roughly 57m shares changed hands during the day, compared with a daily average of 4m over the past 12 months.

Valeant s shares rallied 3.8 cent on Friday, after closing down 14 per cent on Thursday.

The embarrassing announcement is the latest setback for Valeant and its high-profile hedge fund backers, who include Bill Ackman, Jeff Ubben and John Paulson. It comes after months of controversy surrounding the drugmaker s reliance on high prices, aggressive sales techniques and debt-fuelled deal making.

Goldman s decision to terminate the loan to Mr Pearson underscores the impact of the rout in Valeant s shares on his personal wealth. Mr Pearson owns roughly 9m shares, accounting for Goldman s sale on Thursday. In August that stake was worth almost $2.4bn; as of Friday morning, the value had plummeted to $720m.

Valeant s share price has crumbled 70 per cent since early August amid investigations into the company s implementation of sharp price increases for its drugs and a murky relationship with a pharmacy group that it kept shielded from investors for the best part of a year.

Goldman Sachs has been Valeant s financial adviser of choice and has collected about $210m in investment banking fees from the drugmaker since 2009, according to Dealogic.

Mr Pearson took out the loan from Goldman in 2013, chiefly to pay a tax bill incurred when he received a pay package that was mainly comprised of Valeant shares.

Rather than selling shares to pay the tax, Mr Pearson borrowed the money from Goldman. He also used some of the $100m to make a charitable donation to his alma mater, the North-Carolina based Duke University, and to help pay for the construction of a community swimming pool, Valeant said. Duke announced in June 2014 that Mr Pearson had made a $30m gift to its engineering school.

 Since joining Valeant, I have not sold any shares provided to me as compensation, and it was not my desire that shares be sold now,  Mr Pearson said.  I have complete confidence in Valeant s ability to move forward and continue meeting our commitments to patients, doctors, and shareholders. 

Although Valeant s board approved Mr Pearson s use of his shares as collateral for the loan, and disclosed the arrangement, a recent securities filing shows that directors had become uneasy about the amount of stock that executives were pledging against their personal financial commitments.

 The board 	. 	. 	. 	has committed to reducing the level of pledging generally at the company in the future 	. 	. 	. 	[and] has adopted a policy generally disallowing future pledges,  said a Valeant filing from April.

Like many chief executives, Mr Pearson has received the vast majority of his pay in Valeant shares in an arrangement designed to align his interests with other shareholders. Since the start of 2015, he has received no salary, and is instead remunerated entirely in cash and stock bonuses tied to performance.

The long bull market in stocks has encouraged executives to borrow against their shares and has kept regulators and investor groups on their toes as they keep watch over excesses.

The Securities and Exchange Commission requires public companies to report whether shares have been pledged or held in margin accounts by directors and executives. Just under 7 per cent of 10-K filers reported such pledges last year, according to Audit Analytics, a consultancy. Among those, an average of 4 per cent of shares outstanding were pledged   a slight increase on 2013.

ISS, the influential proxy adviser, said two years ago that any significant pledging of company stock amounts to a  failure of risk oversight  that warrants voting against directors involved. Glass Lewis, another proxy firm, said in its guidelines for the 2015 proxy season that it was looking out for executives seeking to protect the value of pledged shares by hedging, which  severs the alignment of interests of the executive with shareholders .

Arguments against pledging shares are built around possible risks to shareholders, including the potential for heightened falls in the value of stock because of margin calls or loan defaults. Pledging is also risky for executives who may find themselves forced to sell stock or come up with more collateral during  blackout periods,  in potential violation of insider trading rules.

According to the Council of Institutional Investors, a non-profit group, the big cautionary tale remains the case of Aubrey McClendon, former chief executive of Chesapeake Energy, whose forced stock sales at the height of the financial crisis magnified the company s distress.

 It s problematic,  said Michael Pryce-Jones, director of corporate governance at CtW Investment Group.  The bottom line is that it [pledging shares] risks volatility in the stock, and skews incentives to the short term.

How About Fraud Alerts for Health-Care Charges?

As I approached the counter at Burberry's store in Midtown Manhattan almost eight years ago, I knew I was about to splurge. The purchase was a cashmere scarf, a Christmas gift for my wife, who had lovingly put up with another year of my work travel. I was a federal prosecutor at the time and not exactly living on a Madison Avenue salary, but it was the holiday season and who doesn't love a nice scarf?

The gentleman at the counter swiped my credit card and carefully folded the scarf, placing it into the iconic plaid box. A moment later, he smiled smugly and said, "Sir, your card has been declined." My initial embarrassment later turned to surprise when I discovered why: Based on my purchasing history, the credit-card company didn't think I would shop at Burberry. Rather than allow a potentially fraudulent purchase, the transaction was blocked.

The federal government, one of the largest payers of health-care claims in the world, should adopt this technology if it hopes to beat back fraud. Each year the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pays more than $853 billion in health-care claims, amounting to almost 25% of the federal budget. But an estimated 10% of the claims paid are fraudulent. This year alone, the federal government will pay about $85 billion in fraudulent claims. That is more than the combined earnings of Exxon, Wells Fargo and Microsoft.

Most people would be surprised to hear that government health-care programs are "trust-based" systems that rely on the good faith of medical providers to bill only for legitimate services. The government does little to assess the legitimacy of a claim before paying it. The results can be striking.

When I was chief of the Health Care Fraud Unit in the Justice Department's Criminal Division, I often witnessed the ugly side of this trust-based system. In the 2000s, bogus "infusion therapy" clinics proliferated across South Florida. The clinic owners had no medical background or expertise but billed more than $1 billion to Medicare for treatment that was rarely needed or even provided. Patients were often paid $20 to show up and sometimes received buffet meals when they arrived. Once the Justice Department uncovered this operation, it convicted about 50 people -- clinic owners, doctors and nurses. Infusion therapy billings in South Florida dropped to less than $50 million in 2010 from $2 billion in 2005.

Later in the 2000s, community mental health centers began preying on the most vulnerable members of society. These centers recruited patients from corrupt patient brokers -- often owners of assisted-living facilities or inpatient rehabilitation facilities -- who received money for dumping patients at a center for eight hours a day. The mental health center would then bill Medicare for services that were never provided.

The patients often had mental-health trouble or substance-abuse problems. Some couldn't say where they lived. Others were unable to speak or move. Yet these community mental health centers billed Medicare more than $500 million for providing intensive mental-health services. The Justice Department convicted more than 60 people; one received a 50-year prison sentence.

These aren't success stories. They're failures. After paying hundreds of millions of dollars to criminals who perpetrated egregious fraud, the government is spending millions more to incarcerate them. Unlike my credit-card company, the federal government has no tools that flag suspicious claims and stop them before payment is made.

CMS receives about 4.4 million Medicare claims a day, but there isn't a central location for receiving and analyzing them. Instead, a hodgepodge of private contractors is responsible for paying different types of Medicare claims from different regions of the country. Separate contractors are responsible for reviewing those claims to identify fraud, but only after they've been paid.

In 2010 CMS began developing a data analytics tool called the Fraud Prevention System, which was layered on the web of existing contractors. Although there has been no independent review of the program, CMS has claimed that the tool "identified or prevented" approximately $454 million in fraudulent claims in 2014. Nobody outside of CMS, however, knows the amount of claims blocked before payment -- the true test of success.

CMS's $85 billion a year fraud problem is getting worse, but there are several steps the federal government can take. First, CMS needs to reconsider its disjointed strategy for processing and reviewing Medicare payments. This bureaucratic structure has created a model of "pay and chase," because the contractors who pay claims do not identify fraudulent ones.

Second, all health-care claims should be reviewed by a sophisticated data analytics tool at the time of submission, rather than after the money has disappeared. Third, CMS should invite outsiders to review its fraud-detection systems and help develop new ones. Credit-card companies perform unbelievably complicated data analyses and can share best practices with a bureaucracy that has lived by the mantra "yesterday's technology tomorrow."

Markets
Municipal Bonds Shine in Bleak Landscape; Sector is returning about 2% this year, beating corporate bonds and many other supposedly higher-performing asset classes

Investing in boring bridges and sewers is paying off once again.

Municipal bonds sold by U.S. state and local governments are returning about 2% this year, according to Barclays PLC data, beating corporate bonds and many other supposedly higher-performing asset classes.

It is the second year of near market-leading returns from a sector typically prized for its low, steady performance. Muni bonds last year posted a total return of 9%, which comprises price appreciation and interest payments, approaching the S&P 500's total return of 14%.

At a time of low returns and high volatility in other markets, the concerns facing muni bonds including "http://www.wsj.com/articles/puerto-rico-treasury-in-talks-to-restructure-islands-debt-1444853744" from Puerto Rico, the U.S. commonwealth that has some $72 billion of debt outstanding seem relatively manageable to many investors, compared with the risk of a steep pullback in stocks or other riskier assets.

Municipal bonds are considered nearly as safe as Treasurys because they are backed by tax revenue or fees on critical public services, such as water. The debt also is boosted by interest payments that are typically tax-free, often used to fund peoples' retirements.

Even buyers who can't enjoy the tax breaks are purchasing municipal debt, said David Kotok, chief investment officer at Sarasota, Fla.-based Cumberland Advisors.  If you look around the world, the forces in the advanced economies that would drive interest rates lower, or keep them low, are in place," he said.

Investors have struggled to find better performance.

Total returns in 2015 amount to about 1% for Treasury debt and near-flat returns for highly rated corporate bonds. The S&P 500 has returned 3.9%.

Other market sectors have fared worse. Hedge funds were down an average of about 1.5% in 2015 through September, according to research firm HFR Inc. Commodities are down 17% year to date as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index.

The durability in the $3.7 trillion sector persisted even as municipal debt faced challenges throughout the year, including the first default from Puerto Rico and concerns about the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/for-some-bond-investors-chicago-isnt-their-kind-of-town-1427926688" and states such as Illinois. Investors also spent several months on the sidelines, concerned about possible interest-rate increases earlier in the year.

Those worries diminished when the Federal Reserve didn't move rates, and demand for municipal debt increased. Investors have added money to municipal-bond mutual funds in five of the past six weeks, after withdrawing more than they put in every month from May to September, according to Lipper data. About $2 billion has flowed into municipal-bond mutual funds this year through October.

 Investors began to get more comfortable with the fact that we weren't going to see increased interest rates, which led to more robust demand, and that's helped recent performance," said Peter Hayes, head of municipal bonds at BlackRock Inc., which manages about $111 billion in tax-exempt debt. Mr. Hayes also noted rates have begun to tick up of late.

Investors have returned to munis after a 2013 selloff spurred by fears of a Fed rate increase and another that began after analyst Meredith Whitney predicted widespread defaults in a December 2010 television interview. There were no defaults on debt rated by Moody's Investors Service in 2014, and several analysts said the market includes thousands of diverse municipal entities, many of which have improving resources after the recession.

Meanwhile, the supply of bonds for new borrowing has dwindled, even as state and local governments rushed to take advantage of low rates, according to research firm Municipal Market Analytics. Though issuers have sold almost one-third more debt than during the same period of last year, most refinanced outstanding bonds, constricting the total available.

A supportive foundation leaves municipal bonds poised to benefit as rates increase, said David Hammer, executive vice president and municipal bond portfolio manager at Pacific Investment Management Co. Historically, the debt has outperformed other bonds when interest rates rise, and with state and local finances improving along with the U.S. economy, investors are facing less risk than in recent years, he said.  That creates a pretty attractive backdrop," Mr. Hammer said.

Some analysts said persistent demand has driven up prices, reducing the tax-free income that makes the debt attractive. Many in the market would prefer lower prices and higher yields, which would make it easier to sell bonds or mutual funds, said Matt Fabian, partner at Municipal Market Analytics. Bond yields fall as prices rise.

 You don't buy an income-producing asset if it doesn't produce income," he said.

Still, several investors said the market has provided enough income relative to other assets to shrug off concerns about potential defaults from Puerto Rico, which skipped its first debt payment in August.

Lyle Fitterer, managing director for Wells Fargo Capital Management, which oversees about $39 billion in municipal bonds, said he is still concerned about the impact of possible Puerto Rico defaults. Still, such risks are low marketwide, and once investors consider their tax bill, municipal debt still looks compelling, he said.  Sometimes, superboring can be good," he said.

Mutual Funds
BlackRock to Buy BofA Funds --- Firm will manage the money-market assets, which make big banks face more regulations

Bank of America Corp. agreed to sell its $87 billion money-market fund business to BlackRock Inc., in a deal that comes as both asset managers and banks grapple with low interest rates and changing regulations.

BlackRock will manage the assets, which include money-market funds, separate accounts and other cash-management products, while Bank of America will continue to handle distribution.

The deal, expected to close in the first half of next year, will boost BlackRock's cash-management platform to more than $370 billion of assets under management.

Financial terms weren't disclosed, though BlackRock said the impact isn't material to its earnings. Barclays analysts said in a note that margins in the cash-management business are likely to expand as interest rates rise.

The sale by Bank of America takes the lender out of the business of directly managing assets for large institutional clients and highlights a move by some banks to simplify their businesses in the face of postcrisis rules.

The money-market fund industry is preparing to face costly new regulations that take effect next year that require prime funds to abandon their fixed $1 share price and float in value like other mutual funds.

Analysts from Credit Suisse Group AG said the deal signals the greater need for scale in the money-market business because of declines in profitability attributable to low interest rates, and future increases to price competition.

"It's an environment that makes scale absolutely essential," said Tom Callahan, co-head of global cash management at BlackRock, the world's largest fund manager.

Firms offering money-market funds have waived some or all of their fees in recent years amid a prolonged period of low interest rates.

"It's a highly problematic business under current low rates," said Karen Petrou, managing partner at Washington-based consulting firm Federal Financial Analytics Inc.

She said cash-management businesses are likely to be beneficial for fund managers longer term, but that large banks offering those services are subject to additional layers of regulations.

In addition to boosting the scale of BlackRock's business, the fund manager also is betting that hedge funds, insurers, pension funds and endowments will increasingly turn to cash-management products as some of the largest global banks tell them to take large cash deposits elsewhere.

The Wall Street Journal reported last month that U.S. banks are working to shed certain types of deposits that are deemed risky by regulators. Boston-based State Street Corp. for the first time earlier this year began charging some clients for large dollar deposits.

"That's a lot of money in motion that's going to be looking for homes," Mr. Callahan said.

The Credit Suisse analysts speculated that as rates rise, many larger money-market participants will use the opportunity to cut pricing and seek to grab the potential $500 billion to $2 trillion wave of excess deposits that could flow from banks.

Money-market mutual funds fulfill a crucial role in finance, offering individual savers and corporate treasurers a convenient place to invest spare cash with low risk to investors' principal. They invest in short-term debt and other instruments that are almost like holding cash.

Bank of America and Merrill Lynch, which the bank bought in 2009, have been shrinking the asset-management business, and this isn't the first transaction with BlackRock. Merrill sold its investment-management division to BlackRock in 2007.

Also, Bank of America sold Columbia Management to Ameriprise Financial Inc. in 2010.

Other big banks, such as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., meanwhile, have been emphasizing asset management in recent years due to a stable revenue stream that can balance out volatile trading and investment-banking units.

Monsanto, Deere Set Deal Over Farm Data

Monsanto Co. and Deere & Co. struck a deal to strengthen their cooperation in the emerging business of big-data services that help farmers improve crop performance.

Deere agreed to buy Monsanto's line of high-tech planting equipment, called Precision Planting, and in return make it easier for farmers to link their John Deere machinery to Monsanto's Climate Corp. unit, which crunches data on crop performance and weather conditions to formulate farming advice. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

The deal "benefits all our customers and will allow for more information and better data-driven insights to come out of Climate," Mike Stern, president of the division at Monsanto, saidTuesday.

Monsanto and Deere, along with other agribusiness giants like DuPont Co. and Cargill Inc., are investing heavily in sensor technology, data-analysis systems and wireless transmitters to drive a technology revolution on U.S. farmsthat they hope will become big new revenue streams. The companies are selling services that harness data-crunching techniques honed in Silicon Valley to help farmers boost crop yields and use equipment, seeds and fertilizermore efficiently.

For Monsanto, which has spent more than $1 billion to build out its suite of computerized farming services, the deal announcedTuesdayenables easier access to data collected by Moline, Ill.-basedDeere'svast number of green-and-yellow tractors and combines. Deere controls about two-thirds of the U.S. market for high-horsepower farmtractors. Under the deal, Monsanto's Climate division will become the first outside company with which Deere allows its equipment to share data in what the companies called "near real-time."The arrangement is exclusive for multiple years, according to Monsanto.

Farmers will decide whether or not they want their Deere equipment to stream data to the Climate system. Both companies maintain that the farmers using their systems own the data related to their own fields, though the companies can use some information to develop services.

The deal is Deere's third in less than a month to expand its own lineup of technology-based farming gear and services, after agreeing to buy a French planter company and forming a joint venture around farm-management software.Falling sales of Deere's big-ticket machinery in a weakening North American farm economy are causing the company to turn its attention to services and niche product lines that offer farmers lower costs and greater efficiency.

Mr. Stern said getting out of the business of making and selling Precision Planting's high-tech planters focuses Monsanto's Climate division more on its data-science services, a business Monsanto has estimated will deliver several hundred million dollars in annual revenue by 2019.

Hedge Fund Cantab Backs Big Data  Institute at Cambridge University; Cantab donation to fund Cambridge University institute focusing on big data  research

Hedge fund Cantab Capital Partners LLP has donated 5 million to Cambridge University to fund a research center into big data, backing a field that aims to identify everything from flu outbreaks to people's shopping habits.

The donation by the Cambridge, U.K. based firm one of Europe's biggest computer-driven hedge funds with $4 billion in assets will fund the Cantab Capital Institute for the Mathematics of Information for five years in the university's Mathematics faculty.

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/macro-funds-fare-better-than-ctas-in-hedge-fund-industry-1437402021", which analyze decades of historical market data to try to identify patterns they can profit from, have increasingly focused on the field of big data in recent years as they try to gain a trading advantage over rivals.

Companies and government bodies are using similar theories as they try to find practical ways of sifting through vast quantities of data, from the Internet and other sources, in areas from health care to retailing and law enforcement.

Cantab co-founder Ewan Kirk, a former Goldman Sachs partner who has a net worth of 210 million, according to this year's Sunday Times Rich List for the U.K., said Cantab would gain no direct benefit from the center and said he was unsure whether or not the research could help financial investing.

 One of the places where there's a huge amount of data but not much information is finance," he said, although he added that it was  OK" if there was no practical benefit for finance.

 From me down, we are generally geeky men and women who like science, who like mathematics, who like technology," he said. This matches  our interests in the things we find exciting."

The donation is the latest move by a major European hedge fund to pour cash into academic research.

The David and Claudia Harding Foundation, the foundation of Winton Capital founder David Harding, has given 20 million to Cambridge University's Cavendish Laboratory, which has set up a research program named after the firm. Brevan Howard, one of the world's biggest hedge fund firms, donated 20.1 million to London's Imperial College in 2013 to set up the Brevan Howard Centre for Financial Analysis.

In the U.S., hedge fund billionaire John Paulson "http://www.wsj.com/articles/hedge-fund-manager-paulson-to-donate-400-million-to-harvard-1433340902" earlier this year, the institution's biggest-ever donation.

Hedge-fund managers have at times faced criticism for donations to academia or the arts, such as the accusation that they are trying to buy honors or repair the industry's sometimes maligned image.

Mr. Kirk said that Cantab, 80% of whose researchers went to Cambridge University, would receive no direct benefit from the institute and said the firm was  certainly not doing this for the image of the industry."

It is  something valuable for the whole of society. It's just as valuable as giving money to the Royal Opera House, maybe in some cases more," he said.

The new institute will have six lecturers and up to 18 Ph.D students. The donation is the first to the university by the firm, although Mr. Kirk said he also gives personally.

Fed Imposes New Limits on Big Banks to Reduce Bailout Risks; Proposal doesn t meet industry s worst fears but will push banks to issue $120 billion in additional debt

WASHINGTON The Federal Reserve proposed a new bank bailout-prevention rule that would place new restrictions on how big financial institutions manage their finances increasing their costs and restricting the way they run their business in the name of preserving financial system stability.

The rule would set a new minimum level of  total loss-absorbing capacity," or TLAC, for eight of the largest U.S. bank holding companies, in an attempt to force them to hold enough resources on their books so that they would never again need to seek an infusion of taxpayer funds, even if they face extreme trouble along the lines of the 2008 financial crisis.

Specifically, it would require those institutions to issue a combined $120 billion in new long-term debt to shore up their buffer in case of their own insolvency. It would likely increase the aggregate annual funding costs of the firms by between $680 million and $1.5 billion, the Fed estimated.

The Fed's rule adds to other actions designed since the crisis to reduce the risk that a large bank would need a taxpayer bailout if it got in trouble, a list that includes higher capital requirements, new  stress tests" examining how banks would perform under tough economic conditions, and a requirement that banks author  living wills" planning for their own demise.

Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen, in a statement, said the TLAC rule would  substantially reduce the risk to taxpayers and the threat to financial stability stemming from the failure of these firms."

In some respects, banks like the rule because it helps end the perception they are  too big to fail." But they may feel this rule goes too far. Greg Baer, president of the Clearing House Association, a group of large banks, said the rule  is the final piece of the puzzle in ensuring that the largest banks" could fail without a bailout, but added  nonetheless, the Fed proposal seems to go significantly beyond the types and amounts of loss absorbency required for this purpose."

Karen Shaw Petrou, an independent analyst who does consulting work for large financial firms as managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics Inc., noted that as a result of the rule's costs  it will be more difficult for these banks offer competitive loan products," potentially creating opportunities for smaller banks or mutual funds and other nonbanks.

The Fed is seeking a minimum  total loss-absorbing capacity" a combination of shareholder equity and debt of at least 18% of risk-weighted assets for the eight American institutions designated as  global systemically important bank" that could threaten the global financial system if they suffered serious losses. That figure is expected to rise higher for firms considered to pose outsize risks because of the size, breadth, and nature of their operations, such as J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.

The 18% Fed requirement appeared to be less than the industry's worst fears. Some Fed watchers had expected a 20% minimum. The Fed also gave firms until 2022 to fully comply, and will take comments on the rule before making it final.

 At 18%, with a more elongated phase-in, it becomes more manageable," said Jason Goldberg, an analyst with Barclays PLC.

But the Fed's approach was stricter in some ways than one proposed by global regulators last year. For instance, the draft rule says each firm's loss-absorbing capacity must include a minimum amount of debt as part of its buffer to protect taxpayers in the event of a bank collapse. The international rule gave firms more discretion in combining equity and debt to meet their minimum target.

With the additional debt requirement, the effective minimum loss-absorbing capacity a combination of capital and debt would rise to at least 23.5% for J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., the top U.S. bank by assets.

The Fed estimated a minimum required loss-absorbing capacity of at least 21.5% of assets for Citigroup Inc.; 20.5% for Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley; and 18.5% for Wells Fargo & Co.

State Street Corp. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. would likely face a minimum loss-absorbing capacity of at least 18%.

But the Fed rule was extremely complex, and there is some uncertainty with those estimates: They reflect estimates under one of four measurements of loss-absorbing capacity in the Fed's rule. Fed officials said the actual minimums could be different, depending on the specifics of each individual firm, As the firms evaluate the rule, they will likely disclose how it affects them.

Collectively, the eight firms are expected to have to issue $120 billion in new long-term debt by Jan. 1, 2022, according to the Fed. For many firms, whose balance sheets range as high as J.P. Morgan's roughly $2.417 trillion, the impact of the new debt could be minimal.

Fed staff said the firms have existing debt that can be refinanced or reworked to meet much of the new requirements. Two of the firms Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley aren't expected to have to issue any debt at all, since they already have substantial levels. Because the banks will have to get at least some of their newly mandated funding via long-term debt, regardless of what investors charge the banks to borrow and regardless of whether they'd prefer to get their funding on a short-term basis, their costs would likely go up. Analysts expect the costs to be manageable for the firms, which collectively make billions of dollars a quarter.

The Fed staff said the benefits of the rule would outweigh any increased costs to banks or the economy.  We don't think the cost of compliance [to] the firms is going to be that great," said Mark Van Der Weide, deputy director of the Fed's Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation during the Fed's public meeting on the rule Friday.  We do think the financial stability benefits will be large."

In the months before Friday's announcement, Wells Fargo executives had feared that they would have a tougher time meeting the rule than other firms because the San Francisco bank relies less on debt and more on deposits than its peers. It said in September it had loss-absorbing capacity of 18% close to the Fed's estimate of an 18.5% minimum needed for the company to meet the new long-term debt rule.

In a statement Friday, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman said the firm was reviewing the draft rule but  it appears the proposal is in line with our expectations. We remain supportive of regulations intended to ensure adequate loss absorbing capacity."

The industry did lose one battle on the rule: The Fed said so-called structured notes, a type of debt that can include derivatives, couldn't count toward a firms' total loss-absorbing capacity. The industry had wanted those notes to count.

The Fed rule also applies to the U.S. units of global banks that regulators have designated  systemically important." Those subsidiaries will have to maintain a total loss-absorbing capacity of at least 16% and potentially 18 % of risk-weighted assets, and long-term debt equal to at least 7% of their risk-weighted assets.

Write to Ryan Tracy at ryan.tracy@wsj.com

Corrections & Amplifications

A Fed rule proposed Friday wouldn't allow structured notes to count toward a bank's loss-absorbing capacity. An earlier version of this article indicated that the notes could count for as much as 5% of a bank's loss-absorbing capacity. (Nov. 1, 2015)

Because the banks will have to get at least some of their newly mandated funding via long-term debt, regardless of what investors charge the banks to borrow and regardless of whether they'd prefer to get their funding on a short-term basis, their costs would likely go up. Analysts expect the costs to be manageable for the firms, which collectively make billions of dollars a quarter.

The Fed staff said the benefits of the rule would outweigh any increased costs to banks or the economy.  We don't think the cost of compliance [to] the firms is going to be that great," said Mark Van Der Weide, deputy director of the Fed's Division of Banking Supervision and Regulation during the Fed's public meeting on the rule Friday.  We do think the financial stability benefits will be large."

In the months before Friday's announcement, Wells Fargo executives had feared that they would have a tougher time meeting the rule than other firms because the San Francisco bank relies less on debt and more on deposits than its peers. It said in September it had loss-absorbing capacity of 18% close to the Fed's estimate of an 18.5% minimum needed for the company to meet the new long-term debt rule.

In a statement Friday, a Wells Fargo spokeswoman said the firm was reviewing the draft rule but  it appears the proposal is in line with our expectations. We remain supportive of regulations intended to ensure adequate loss absorbing capacity."

The industry did lose one battle on the rule: The Fed said so-called structured notes, a type of debt that can include derivatives, couldn't count toward a firms' total loss-absorbing capacity. The industry had wanted those notes to count.

The Fed rule also applies to the U.S. units of global banks that regulators have designated  systemically important." Those subsidiaries will have to maintain a total loss-absorbing capacity of at least 16% and potentially 18 % of risk-weighted assets, and long-term debt equal to at least 7% of their risk-weighted assets.

Corrections & Amplifications: A Fed rule proposed Friday wouldn't allow structured notes to count toward a bank's loss-absorbing capacity. An earlier version of this article indicated that the notes could count for as much as 5% of a bank's loss-absorbing capacity. (Nov. 1, 2015)

PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY
IBM's acquisition of Weather Co is a test for the big data  economy

What is Big Data worth? News this week that IBM had acquired the digital assets of the Weather Company for $2bn is - so to speak - one data point.

Like Monsanto's purchase of a similar company, Climate Corporation, for nearly $1bn two years ago, the deal provides a graphic demonstration of the new data economy that is taking shape. Whole classes of information - in this case, detailed local data about, and forecasts of, weather conditions - may now be applied to everything from making more effective business decisions to providing better local services.

But the data sources alone, or even the technology platforms that are being built to collect, collate and analyse them, are only ingredients. With deals like these, the real test lies in the uses to which the new data substrate will be put. And that makes it about people: specifically, the people who can identify new needs and turn them into applications that mostly have not been dreamt of yet.

IBM's Weather Co deal stands in stark contrast to news of the company's weak quarterly earnings last week. Those were a reminder that the "old" IBM, like much of the existing IT industry, is slowly dying.

Buying Weather Co shows how the pieces are being put in place for a new industry, even if it will take time for the revenues to become meaningful. It is one of the two biggest deals from IBM in the past seven years, matching its 2013 acquisition of SoftLayer, a key piece of cloud-computing infrastructure.

Monsanto's aim was to sell Climate Corp's data to farmers so they could increase crop yields. For its part, the Weather Co already supplies information to airlines and utilities, the types of company that have a critical interest in knowing where and when extreme conditions will occur. IBM hopes that its deeper roots in the digital economy will greatly extend the uses. A large slice of commerce - to the tune of $500bn a year, according to IBM - is heavily dependent on the weather.

Much of the Weather Co's information is pulled together from public sources. This is supplemented by proprietary data sets, such as the barometric pressure readings from 40m smartphone users who have opted in to the company's app.

Companies that can tap into the data emanating from such smartphone networks have become a valuable resource. Waze, the Israeli traffic app acquired by Google for about $1bn in 2013, collects its information from millions of smartphone users who are signed into the service.

Such data are only as valuable as the applications they can support. Traffic and mapping information is quickly coming to assume a significant place in the automotive world, first to support ride-hailing services like Uber but, more significantly, as a platform for autonomous vehicles.

If the application exists, the company with the best data wins. Thanks to the highly detailed maps it assembles from cars travelling on streets near its headquarters, Google's driverless vehicles already move confidently around the streets of Silicon Valley, almost as though they were running on invisible tracks. Without those kind of data, it will be hard to be a contender in the driverless future. No wonder a group of German carmakers is prepared to pay $2.8bn for Nokia's mapping service, Here.

For its part, Google is still largely a closed system, using its infrastructure, data and analytics to support its own "killer apps". It has not come up with anything yet to rival internet search, although initiatives such as the driverless car could turn out to be equally significant.

But, for IBM, success will come from drawing in other developers. It is the strength of the ecosystems it builds around its new data platforms that really matters, says Daryl Plummer, a vice-president at research firm Gartner.

Few will question IBM's credentials. It has the tech - nology, including, with Watson, some of the most advanced artificial intelligence capabilities (what it prefers to call "cognitive computing"). But, as Mr Plummer puts it: does it have the heart? To put it another way: can it attract and inspire developers to dream up data-driven apps to change the world? And can it put itself at the centre of the new "smart" ecosystems being built around cities, industries and communities? It is a cultural question as much as a technological one.

IBM is not alone in facing it. From General Electric, with its ambition to build an industrial "internet of things", to Amazon, with its big early lead in cloud computing, companies from very different backgrounds are converging on the same point. It is shaping up to be an intriguing fight.

Moody s Revenue Growth Soft on Currency Exchange; Revenue at Investors Service unit was flat at $548.1 million

Shares of Moody's Corp. fell Friday as the company warned that a slowdown in debt issuance could hinder business at its credit-ratings business through the end of the year.

Moody's lowered revenue guidance for ratings work with corporate bonds, non-U.S. debt and finance. Shares of the New York-based firm fell 3.4%, or $3.47, to $98.06 during afternoon trading.

Debt issuance from highly rated companies, a major slice of the bond markets, had been  quite light," said Linda S. Huber, Moody's chief financial officer, on the company's third-quarter earnings call.  Only this week have we seen issuance pick up," she added

Moody's affirmed its 2015 earnings guidance of $4.55 to $4.65 per share. But that outlook includes a three cent benefit from legacy tax matters, and the full-year guidance suggests that fourth-quarter earnings will fall below analysts' estimates, said William Bird, of FBR & Co., in a Friday note to investors.

 Debt issuance trends suggest a slow start to the fourth quarter and we suspect this was taken into consideration in the outlook," Mr. Bird said.

Moody's reported a stronger-than-expected profit in its third quarter, but uneven capital markets activity and foreign exchange headwinds kept its revenue growth in check.

Revenue at the Moody's Investors Service unit, the biggest revenue driver, was flat at $548.1 million in the latest quarter. The company said it was up 5% on a constant currency basis.

In the analytics division, which provides financial data and other types of market intelligence to investors and banks, revenue was up 6% to $286.8 million.

In all, the company reported a profit of $231.6 million, or $1.14 a share, up from $215.2 million, or $1 a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items such as a legacy tax matter, earnings were $1.11 a share. Revenue grew 2.3% to $834.9 million.

Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters projected earnings of $1.07 a share and revenue of $847 million.

U.S. revenue grew 7.3% to $482.1 million, while foreign revenue fell 4% to $352.8 million.

Investors rely on the bond grades issued by Moody's, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services and Fitch Ratings. Collectively, they issue about 95% of ratings globally a total virtually unchanged from before the financial crisis.

Before Friday, Moody's had gained 6% so far this year.

Wall Street's New Trading Club

By Bradley Hope 
862 words
30 October 2015
The Wall Street Journal

English
Copyright  2015, Dow Jones & Company, Inc. 

BOSTON -- The most exclusive new club on Wall Street opens for business next week and there are a few things you won't find: members with under a billion dollars or high-frequency traders.

Those are among the rules laid out by the founding members of Luminex, a private trading platform designed to give the world's largest asset managers a new place to buy and sell large blocks of stock.

Large asset managers have complained in recent years that exchanges are now rife with high-speed traders who rapidly change the prices of their bids and offers to take advantage of heightened interest in a stock, cutting into profits of the firms that place them. "Dark pools," a type of private trading venue designed to help institutions anonymously trade, have had their own problems with keeping client orders secret.

In response, last year a group of firms led by Fidelity Investments began work on a trading platform that would provide what it calls a cheap and secure solution. In addition to Fidelity, other Luminex owners include BlackRock Inc., the largest money manager in the world by assets, Invesco Ltd. and Capital Group Cos.

Luminex is looking to potentially win market share from other dark pool operators that focus on block trading, such as Bids Trading LP, Liquidnet Holdings Inc. and Investment Technology Group Inc. Those venues account for more than 200 million shares traded every week, according the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.

In interviews at the Boston offices of Luminex Trading & Analytics LLC, executives detailed for the first time how the platform will operate. Luminex is technically a dark pool, too. But it stands apart from the other roughly 40 dark pools because of strict membership requirements, a low-cost structure, and rules that encourage trading large amounts of stock in each transaction, analysts said.

Here is how it works:

Luminex only allows institutions with a billion dollars or more under management and a "long-term investment strategy," so that means no high-frequency traders or quantitative hedge funds.

Trades cost a quarter of a penny a share versus a cost of up to two cents a share at other block-trading venues.

All orders must either be 5,000 shares or valued at a combined $100,000 or more to be entered into the system.

Large investors prefer to trade blocks of stock because it reduces the possibility that the price of a security will change in the midst of trading. Such institutions have found it hard to find opportunities to buy and sell in larger sizes in recent years as the market became more fragmented, with trading on 12 exchanges and scores of dark pools.

The proliferation of high-speed, computerized trading firms also has made it more challenging at times. Such nimble firms are adept at noticing changes in supply and demand for stocks. For instance, if speedy traders figure out demand has increased for a stock, they will seek to raise the price. That could make the overall transaction more costly for the institution.

"The reason this exists is large institutions are getting frustrated," Jonathan Clark, chief executive of Luminex, said. "To successfully trade a big order for a less liquid stock, it can take them a month. There's a feeling that there must be another way."

Some market observers said Luminex members could struggle to find others who want to buy when they want to sell, and vice versa, because they will often have largely similar investment ideas.

It also is unclear how much Luminex members will use the venue, said Justin Schack, a managing director with Rosenblatt Securities Inc. who studies the stock market. "There's a natural ceiling to how much block trading will get done in this market in general," he said. "It's a small portion of the market."

Mr. Clark said the similarities among participants likely won't be a problem because Luminex's members have a range of reasons to trade stocks at any given moment. If a mutual fund has redemptions, for instance, then it may sell shares no matter its views on the stocks, he said.

So far, 73 institutions have been authorized to trade on the venue by a board made up of Luminex's owners. Nineteen firms have been denied membership because they were too small or had overly complicated business models, according to the company.

Fidelity, whose former CEO Edward "Ned" Johnson III came up with the idea for Luminex several years ago, owns 60.8% of the company, while the other members each own 4.9%. Mr. Johnson originally code-named the project "Sakura," which means cherry blossom, a reference to his penchant for Japanese gardens, but the firm had to change the name because it couldn't obtain the website domain name.

Luminex will be another "tool in the toolbox" of big institutions, said Robert Minicus, head of global equity trading at Fidelity. "We don't think the markets are broken, but this is a potential solution to problems we all face," he said.

Tech
Oxford Glides Past Cambridge in Tech; Ancient university rivals vie to outpace each other in nurturing startups, attracting investment

OXFORD, England A centuries-old rivalry between two of the world's best-known universities is now spilling into the global tech-startup scene.

For years, the University of Oxford, about 900 years old, has been playing catch-up with the University of Cambridge, 806, when it comes to tech-related spinoffs and the funding of new tech ventures. But now, Oxford is quietly gaining ground and establishing this ancient university town about an hour's train-ride west of London as another global tech hot spot.

One measure of Oxford's success: Startups springing up around the university have attracted more investment so far this year than competitors from Cambridge. Oxford-based startups raised $169.2 million in venture capital in the first nine months of the year, edging out Cambridge-based companies, which raised $156.8 million, according to Dow Jones VentureSource, a database of startup funding.

Oxford firms raised more money than Cambridge during all of 2012, too, but otherwise have lagged behind. For all of last year, for instance, Oxford ventures raised $102.83 million, compared with Cambridge's $184.96 million.

Oxford, meanwhile, has ramped up its courtship of startups and made it easier for student and faculty entrepreneurs to make money off their research. It also has embarked on a tech-related building boom: A 17,000-square-foot biotech research center is set to rise across the street from Oxford's main medical-school campus. It will house what Oxford is calling its  bio-escalator," a startup accelerator geared toward biotech firms.

 There's no question that Cambridge got out there with the tech thing way ahead of us," says Oxford's John Bell, whose post as Regius professor of medicine was created by Henry VIII.  But we're reeling it in."

Prof. Bell is now a driving force in Oxford's tech push, overseeing both the biotech accelerator and a new data-crunching center going up next door. He also sits on the board of Isis Innovation Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary named after the portion of the River Thames running through Oxford which commercializes the university's intellectual property and serves as its on-campus startup incubator.

The two schools are still minnows amid the world's burgeoning tech hubs. Outside Silicon Valley, cities like Tel Aviv, Stockholm and New York have all made strides in attracting tech startups. The two British universities are also sometimes overshadowed in the tech world by other college towns, like Cambridge, Mass., home to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University.

For years, Cambridge University has been a top destination for British research, particularly in life sciences. Pharmaceuticals giant AstraZeneca PLC is relocating its global corporate and research headquarters to Cambridge, joining a handful of other big-name labs, life-sciences institutes and firms that have grown up next to the university.

Tech has also long been a draw. Trinity College, one of Cambridge's oldest, created the Science Park in 1970. It has grown into a tech- and sciences-related business park home to more than 100 companies.

Andy Hopper, who now heads the university's computer laboratory, helped build Acorn Computers Ltd., the British personal-computer maker. It broke up into several independent units in 1998, including spinning out what became chip-design giant ARM Holdings PLC.

In 2003, Cambridge established the Centre for Entrepreneurial Learning to promote and encourage aspiring entrepreneurs. Today, Cambridge  has a powerful, tight tech cluster," says Prof. Bell of Oxford.  And they've got terrific angel investors and a swarm of venture capitalists."

Another key attraction: Cambridge has been relatively liberal about allowing faculty to benefit commercially from research. It allows in certain circumstances faculty to hold copyrights for intellectual property without having to license it from the university, as Oxford requires.

 Cambridge employees have much more freedom," Prof. Hopper says.

Roy Azoulay, a senior technology-transfer manager at Oxford's Isis, defends its more-conservative copyright policies. Oxford's approach can  add a lot of value by licensing IP on behalf of the inventors some of whom are researchers who have no desire in starting companies," he says.

For centuries, Oxford and Cambridge have competed fiercely on everything from the number of Nobel Prize laureates and British prime ministers educated at their respective campuses, to a 186-year-old rowing race held each year on the River Thames.

Now, the two schools also compete for top tech-startup luminaries. Artificial-intelligence darling DeepMind Technologies was founded by Demis Hassabis, who studied computer science at Cambridge between 1994 and 1997. Alphabet Inc.'s "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304691904579345641537039368" last year.

VocalIQ, a voice-recognition startup that was spun out of the engineering department's spoken dialogue systems group, was recently acquired by Apple Inc. to "http://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-acquires-artificial-intelligence-startup-vocaliq-1443815801?alg=y". It will remain in Cambridge.

Oxford, meanwhile, counts as one of its recent tech successes NaturalMotion Ltd., a digital-animation company created by an Oxford zoology student that was "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304428004579353103678787742" by game maker Zynga Inc. Also last year, the company formerly known as Google, through its DeepMind acquisition, bought up two Oxford artificial-intelligence spinoffs, Dark Blue Labs and Vision Factory.

Oxford officials acknowledge they are still playing catch up with Cambridge when it comes to a startup ecosystem. Isis Innovation is boosting its staff and moving into new offices. Isis last year also moved to make it easier for smaller companies to get access to university intellectual property.

Isis says it spins out a new company about every two months. Since starting to keep track eight years ago, Oxford says it has spun out 110 startups, 80% of which are still operating. Cambridge says it has spun out at least 226 companies since 1976, with 53% of those still active.

Tough Sales Tactics Used at Philidor --- Mail-order company used by Valeant gave staffers instructions for boosting payments

A mail-order pharmacy used by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. had a simple message for staffers charged with getting health insurers to pay up: Don't take no for an answer.

If a health insurer wouldn't work with Philidor Rx Services LLC, the pharmacy instructed staff to try again using the identification number of a partner pharmacy to secure payment. "We have a couple of different 'back door' approaches to receive payment from the insurance company," a Philidor training manual said.

Canada-based Valeant has said that Philidor and its network of pharmacies was "one of our competitive advantages," providing drugs to patients and a source of sales growth. But use of the pharmacy and its affiliates is drawing scrutiny from analysts and investors concerned about the practice's sustainability.

Some analysts say aggressive tactics could backfire, angering payers and slowing sales at a time when Valeant is under pressure to show it can grow organically and not just through acquisitions. At least one payer, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care in New England, has said that it is reviewing its relationship with Philidor.

Industry experts say Philidor's use of different ID numbers is unusual. The pharmacy's identification number "is always supposed to be connected to the actual provider putting in the claim," said John Norton, spokesman for the National Community Pharmacists Association, a trade group.

The training manual for insurance-claim processors at Philidor and other company documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal indicate the pharmacy went to great lengths to fill prescriptions when insurers balked. Other instructions include tinkering with a drug's price, lowering it until a payer's system accepts the claim, and then raising it again to seek out a plan's maximum allowable price. Other guidance suggests billing for a lower quantity.

"Philidor is the patient's advocate in seeking to ensure that they receive the medication that was prescribed by their doctor at the lowest possible cost to them. This includes following up with insurance companies on behalf of patients," a Philidor spokesman said.

Valeant, which has asked a committee of board members to examine the company's relationship with Philidor and the pharmacy's work, declined to comment.

Questions about Valeant's business practices and its relationship with Philidor, along with federal investigations of its drug pricing and other issues, have weighed on Valeant's stock, which has lost more than half its value since peaking in August. In recent days, a short seller has accused the company of using Philidor in an accounting scheme, and former Philidor employees say Valeant staffers worked directly in the pharmacy's offices, sometimes using fake names.

Valeant said last week it acquired an option to buy Philidor last December for $100 million and has defended its accounting.

The drug maker has said that Philidor doesn't restrict prescriptions to any particular manufacturers, but former Philidor employees say nearly all of the prescriptions the pharmacy filled are for Valeant drugs.

The Philidor documents reviewed by the Journal reference only Valeant drugs by name. PowerPoint slides instructing insurance-claim processors use Carac, a Valeant drug for ultraviolet-ray damage to the skin, as an example. The training manual gives only a "Valeant Product and Program Overview," citing drugs such as Valeant's acne medicine Solodyn and toenail fungus treatment Jublia.

A bottle of 30 of Solodyn tablets can cost up to $1,040.41, according to Truven Health Analytics, which publishes average wholesale prices. An 8-milliliter bottle of Jublia costs $1,075.72.

To control spending on such pricey medicines, health insurers and companies that manage the plans' drug benefits use a variety of tools, such as directing pharmacists to substitute a lower-priced generic made by a different drug company, and asking patients to pay higher copays. Sometimes, health plans reject a claim because a drug costs too much.

Philidor used various means to lower patient copays. The training manual, which has one page dated in July 2014 and another in October 2014, outlined six different ways that Philidor staff could lower patient copays to as little as $35. "They all essentially do the same thing," the manual said, but using them individually helps Philidor "know which insurances pay better than others."

As far as overcoming rejections, the training manual advised submitting a lower quantity for certain drugs to the payer "to see" if the drugs would then get reimbursed.

The training manual discussed "back door" methods to receiving payment from insurance companies in a section on dealing with insurers "that we are not contracted with" and therefore won't pay Philidor for any medicines.

The manual directed insurance-claims processors to first submit claims using Philidor's unique identification number. If that resulted in an error message saying Philidor doesn't have a contract, the processors should use an identification number for another pharmacy, such as "our partner in California, West Wilshire Pharmacy." That pharmacy didn't respond to a request for comment.

In May 2014, California's board of pharmacy denied Philidor's application for a permit to operate as a pharmacy in the state, saying the pharmacy had made "false statements," including some that concealed Philidor's true owners and beneficiaries, according to documents from the pharmacy board. A few months later, a Delaware-registered firm affiliated with two Philidor executives bought a 10% stake in West Wilshire Pharmacy, of Los Angeles. Philidor has appealed the board's decision.

The PowerPoint, which isn't dated, gave step-by-step instructions on what to do when an insurer rejected a prescription over cost. It advised calling the insurer for an override, and also tinkering with the drug cost until the insurer agreed to pay. Specifically, the manual advised dropping the drug's cost in $500 increments "until paid and then increase by $100 to get as close as possible to the max amount allowed by the insurance company."

WSJ.D Technology: Owner of Weather Channel Sells Some Assets to IBM

International Business Machines Corp. on Wednesday agreed to acquire the digital and data assets of Weather Co., owner of the Weather Channel.

Financial terms weren't immediately disclosed, and calls seeking further comment from IBM were not immediately returned. The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday that the deal could be valued at more than $2 billion, citing a person familiar with the matter.

The deal doesn't include the traditional TV channel business but does include such digital businesses as the website and app, intellectual property, infrastructure and data.

IBM is particularly interested in Weather Co.'s forecasting group, WSI, which houses the technology and weather data that the Weather Co. collects, manipulates and licenses to companies ranging from airlines to utility companies to insurance providers.

Shares of IBM rose 1.3% to $139.69 in morning trading.

Weather Co. is owned by a consortium that includes private-equity firms Bain Capital LLC and Blackstone Group LP, and Comcast Corp.'s NBCUniversal. They bought the company in 2008 for roughly $3.5 billion. Weather Co. Chief Executive David Kenny is expected to join IBM after the deal closes, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Weather Co. had courted various types of potential buyers. More than a year ago, Google Inc. was offered the chance to bid on the Weather Channel's digital assets, but the company wasn't interested, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Weather Co. is best known for the Weather Channel and its friendly meteorologists like Jim Cantore, who people routinely turn to for information during hurricanes and blizzards. But prospects for the TV channel have dimmed in a tough media environment where consumers are cutting the pay-TV cord and slimming down cable packages. That has raised fears that smaller networks like Weather Channel will struggle to grow subscription fees.

People close to Weather Co. say that the company envisions a future for the TV channel tied to "over-the-top" streaming products. Earlier this year, the company struck a deal to be carried on Dish Network Corp.'s Sling TV streaming video service. A sale of Weather Channel is also on the table, one of the people said.

Weather Co. and IBM already have an alliance, struck earlier this year. The idea was to combine Weather Co.'s weather data and forecast information with IBM's cloud computing skills and analytics know-how, so the two could come up with new ways to package and sell weather data and business solutions to different industries. IBM's artificial intelligence service, Watson, is central to that arrangement.

IBM believes that it can enhance the Weather Channel's forecasts to build new products. Retailers, for example, could better manage their supply chain by knowing when sales might slump because of snowstorms.

Over the past year, IBM has worked hard to secure new data sources for its software, forging new relationships with Twitter Inc., Apple Inc., Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic Inc., and the Weather Channel's WSI division, which generates more than 10 billion weather forecasts a day.

In August, IBM said it would buy Merge Health care, a medical imaging company.

Kennedy Wilson Europe Real Estate PLC has made its first foray into Italian real estate, buying a portfolio of office buildings for 185.5 million euros ($205.3 million).

The London-listed property firm bought nine buildings rented to the Italian government ministries from Italian group InvestiRE SGR.

Kennedy Wilson Europe, which was launched on the London Stock Exchange in 2014, also owns property and real-estate loans across Ireland, the U.K. and Spain.

The firm has been hunting for deals in Italy since its initial public offering, said Mary Ricks, president and chief executive of Kennedy Wilson Europe. While this is the first acquisition in Italy,  it's not been for a lack of trying," she said.

Commercial real-estate investment in Italy has more than doubled this year from last year, with around  ¬6.9 billion spent in the first three quarters of the year, according to Real Capital Analytics.

Increased deal making in Italy has been in part driven by surging competition for property assets in bigger international property markets like the U.K. and Germany. Demand has sent prices shooting higher, pushing down prospective returns. Yield-hungry investors have been looking further afield.

For Kennedy Wilson, the yield on its latest portfolio is 6.3%. Leases on the properties expire in December 2022.

 We like the yield a lot," Ms. Ricks said.  When I look at the yield on a government (bond) in Italy, with the same duration, the coupon just doesn't compare."

A recently-issued Italian government bond maturing in September 2022 is yielding 1.02%, according to Tradeweb data.

While investment in Italy has been especially busy this year, sentiment has been strong across Europe. Real estate transaction volumes on the Continent in the first nine months of the year hit  ¬200.7 billion, up 30% from the same period last year, according to Real Capital Analytics.

The biggest office in the Italy portfolio, at 283,400 square feet, is in Milan and leased to the customs and finance ministries. Other office locations include Rome and Florence.

The deal was completed with cash.

InvestiRE SGR is the management company of the closed-end mutual property investment fund known as Fondo Immobili Pubblici.

Pharmacy s Sales Tactics Disclosed; Mail-order company used by Valeant gave staffers instructions for boosting payments

A mail-order pharmacy used by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. had a simple message for staffers charged with getting health insurers to pay up: Don't take no for an answer.

If a health insurer wouldn't work with Philidor Rx Services LLC, the pharmacy instructed staff to try again using the identification number of a partner pharmacy to secure payment.  We have a couple of different  back door' approaches to receive payment from the insurance company," a Philidor training manual said.

Canada-based Valeant has said that Philidor and its network of pharmacies was  one of our competitive advantages," providing drugs to patients and a source of sales growth. But use of the pharmacy and its affiliates is drawing scrutiny from analysts and investors concerned about the practice's sustainability.

Some analysts say aggressive tactics could backfire, angering payers and slowing sales at a time when Valeant is under pressure to show it can grow organically and not just through acquisitions. At least one payer, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care in New England, has said that it is reviewing its relationship with Philidor.

Industry experts say Philidor's use of different ID numbers is unusual. The pharmacy's identification number  is always supposed to be connected to the actual provider putting in the claim," said John Norton, spokesman for the National Community Pharmacists Association, a trade group.

The training manual for insurance-claim processors at Philidor and other company documents reviewed by The Wall Street Journal indicate the pharmacy went to great lengths to fill prescriptions when insurers balked. Other instructions include tinkering with a drug's price, lowering it until a payer's system accepts the claim, and then raising it again to seek out a plan's maximum allowable price. Other guidance suggests billing for a lower quantity.

 Philidor is the patient's advocate in seeking to ensure that they receive the medication that was prescribed by their doctor at the lowest possible cost to them. This includes following up with insurance companies on behalf of patients," a Philidor spokesman said.

Valeant, which has asked a committee of board members to examine the company's relationship with Philidor and the pharmacy's work, declined to comment.

Questions about Valeant's business practices and its relationship with Philidor, along with federal investigations of its drug pricing and other issues, have weighed on Valeant's stock, which has lost more than half its value since peaking in August. In recent days, a short seller has accused the company of using Philidor in an accounting scheme, and former Philidor employees say Valeant staffers worked directly in the pharmacy's offices, sometimes using fake names.

Valeant said last week it acquired an option to buy Philidor last December for $100 million and has defended its accounting.

The drug maker has said that Philidor doesn't restrict prescriptions to any particular manufacturers, but former Philidor employees say nearly all of the prescriptions the pharmacy filled are for Valeant drugs.

The Philidor documents reviewed by the Journal reference only Valeant drugs by name. PowerPoint slides instructing insurance-claim processors use Carac, a Valeant drug for ultraviolet-ray damage to the skin, as an example in a slide. The training manual gives only a  Valeant Product and Program Overview," citing drugs such as Valeant's acne medicine Solodyn and toenail fungus treatment Jublia.

A bottle of 30 of Solodyn tablets can cost up to $1,040.41, according to Truven Health Analytics, which publishes average wholesale prices. An 8-milliliter bottle of Jublia costs $1,075.72.

To control spending on such pricey medicines, health insurers and companies that manage the plans' drug benefits use a variety of tools, such as directing pharmacists to substitute a lower-priced generic made by a different drug company, and asking patients to pay higher copays. Sometimes, health plans reject a claim because a drug costs too much.

Philidor used various means to lower patient copays. The training manual, which has one page dated in July 2014 and another in October 2014, outlined six different ways that Philidor staff could lower patient copays to as little as $35.  They all essentially do the same thing," the manual said, but using them individually helps Philidor  know which insurances pay better than others."

As far as overcoming rejections, the training manual advised submitting a lower quantity for certain drugs to the payer  to see" if the drugs would then get reimbursed.

The training manual discussed  back door" methods to receiving payment from insurance companies in a section on dealing with insurers  that we are not contracted with" and therefore won't pay Philidor for any medicines.

The manual directed insurance-claims processors to first submit claims using Philidor's unique identification number. If that resulted in an error message saying Philidor doesn't have a contract, the processors should use an identification number for another pharmacy, such as  our partner in California, West Wilshire Pharmacy." That pharmacy didn't respond to a request for comment.

In May 2014, California's board of pharmacy denied Philidor's application for a permit to operate as a pharmacy in the state, saying the pharmacy had made  false statements," including some that concealed Philidor's true owners and beneficiaries, according to documents from the pharmacy board. A few months later, a Delaware-registered firm affiliated with two Philidor executives bought a 10% stake in West Wilshire Pharmacy, of Los Angeles. Philidor has appealed the board's decision.

Other states where Philidor is registered as a pharmacy have taken note of the firm's troubles in California.  We're reviewing the information at hand, including the rejection in California," Cindy Hamilton, chief compliance officer at the Oklahoma State Board of Pharmacy, said Wednesday.

The PowerPoint, which isn't dated, gave step-by-step instructions on what to do when an insurance company electronically rejected a prescription because the drug cost too much. It advised rechecking the submission for any mistakes, and calling the insurance company for an override.

 If override is successful &Great!!!" the PowerPoint said.

If not, it directed tinkering with the cost of the drug until the insurance company agreed to pay. Specifically, the manual advised dropping the drug's cost in $500 increments.  until paid and then increase by $100 to get as close as possible to the max amount allowed by the insurance company."

IBM Buys Weather Company s Digital Assets, Expanding Move into Data Crunching; Venerable company continues its acquisition of data-related ventures

International Business Machines Inc.'s purchase of Weather Company's digital assets extends IBM's bet that it will profit from a new wave of data-crunching software. The deal also catapults the 104-year-old company into a new line of business: consumer advertising.

The companies didn't disclose the acquisition price. The tie-up, which was announced Wednesday, could be worth more than $2 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.

IBM will hire Weather Company CEO David Kenny and sales chief Jeremy Steinberg along with 900 other Weather Company employees.

The deal doesn't include Weather Company's traditional TV channel business, but does include such digital businesses as the website and app, intellectual property, infrastructure and data. The TV channel will continue as a separate entity owned by a consortium that includes private-equity firms Bain Capital LLC and Blackstone Group LP, and ComcastCorp. 's NBCUniversal.

Shares of IBM were up 2.2% to $140.83 in late trading.

For IBM, based in Armonk, N.Y., Weather Company's primary attraction is data that can feed Watson, the 100-year-old company's self-learning computing platform.

Weather Company, based in Atlanta, Ga., collects 4 gigabytes of data per second from 40 million mobile phones, 147,000 sensors in weather observing stations, airplanes flying 50,000 flights daily, and an undisclosed number of windshield wipers flapping in Internet-connected smartcars. IBM plans to use that data to improve the Weather Company's modeling technology to unleash a new generation of predictive applications.

The move is part of a huge bet IBM has placed that data-rich services and applications delivered over the Internet will make up for shrinking revenue from hardware and information-technology services. IBM has posted revenue declines for 14 consecutive quarters. It is looking for growth from investments in analytics, security, and cloud computing to eventually reverse the decline.

Weather Company's data is the latest addition to IBM's growing stock of information resources. Over the past year, the company has secured new data sources, forging relationships with Twitter Inc., Apple Inc., Johnson & Johnson, and Medtronic Inc. In August, IBM said it would spend $700 million to buy Merge Health care, a medical imaging technology company that came with a trove of 30 billion X-rays, computerized tomography, and magnetic-resonance-imaging scans.

These moves included an earlier partnership with Weather Channel's WSI division, which generates more than 10 billion weather forecasts a day.

In the deal, IBM will also get Weather Company's digital advertising operations, which serve ads to 40 million smartphones every day, reaching a total of 82 million unique monthly visitors, when combined with the Weather.com website.

IBM already sells interactive marketing services to retailers and other businesses. With Weather Company, IBM will have another product to sell to those customers:  a well-placed and well-timed ad," said Bob Picciano, IBM's senior vice president of analytics.

 We think there's a great opportunity for people in retail, but also people who are managing events, people who work in public safety and public sector, [and] financial institutions," Mr. Picciano said.

The WSI forecasting group with its sophisticated weather forecasting software is an valuable asset, said Jon Nese, a meteorology professor at Pennsylvania State University who formerly worked at the Weather Channel. Mr. Nese said that graduates from his program were increasingly being snatched up for corporate tasks such as helping to predict cocoa yields for candy companies or assisting traders on commodity exchanges.

 American business is very quickly realizing that weather impacts the bottom line," he said.  Meteorologists are lurking in the shadows at many, many, many businesses that you would have never thought of before."

The relationship between IBM and Weather Company began as a partnership earlier this year, and it soon became clear that IBM's Watson artificial intelligence software could help the Weather Company's nascent business products reach more customers and deliver greater value.

Mr. Kenny, the Weather Company CEO, said that the partnership had helped the combined companies move beyond weather predictions to actionable advice.  It was actually beginning to find the answers to what people should do,  said Mr. Kenny. "The biggest problem we have with weather forecasts is that people don't always know what to do."

The two companies plan to build new services based on not just weather data, but also other sources such as the sentiment of Twitter users, commerce data from IBM's back-end systems, and personal health data.

 Everything going on in a person is also a big complex system with a lot of interrelated data," said Mr. Kenny.  If we could put all that data in a platform like this, you could better predict what might happen and perhaps be preventative."

ICE to buy IDC for $5.2bn as exchange groups snap up rare industry assets

Intercontinental Exchange, the US exchanges operator, is making an aggressive push into fixed-income markets long-dominated by investment banks with the purchase of Interactive Data Corporation in a $5.2bn deal.

Atlanta-based ICE has agreed to pay Silver Lake and Warburg Pincus, IDC's private equity owners, $3.65bn in cash and $1.55bn in common stock for the group, which provides analytics and data for banks and hedge funds for hard-to-value off-exchange instruments.

The deal will throw ICE, best known as a commodity futures exchange operator and owner of the New York Stock Exchange, deep into the market for pricing illiquid bonds. New global banking and markets regulation is set to usher in more electronic quote-driven trading and clearing in fixed-income markets in the US and Europe.

IDC evaluates prices for 2.7m financial securities every day and competes with companies such as Bloomberg.

The deal reflects a growing interest among exchanges in purchasing rare industry assets. Last year, the London Stock Exchange bought Frank Russell, the US stock index provider, for $2.7bn to expand into the US and the exchange traded funds markets, while Deutsche Brse bought the 50 per cent of Stoxx it did not own for $697m.

ICE has been pushing into the market with ventures such as the administration of Libor and IsdaFix and the purchase of UK-based SuperDerivatives for $350m last year. Its market data service revenues have risen from about $100m in 2010 to an expected $700m this year - before the IDC deal was announced - according to UBS. Christopher Harris, analyst at Wells Fargo, said the deal would mean 40 per cent of ICE's group revenues would come from market data, up from just over a fifth.

Silver Lake and Warburg bought IDC in 2010 in a buyout that gave the company an enterprise value of $3.4bn after Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, sold them its 61 per cent stake for $2bn.

ICE Makes Big Bet on Bond Data --- New York Stock Exchange owner to acquire Interactive Data in $5.2 billion deal

The owner of the New York Stock Exchange is betting billions that corporate-bond trading is moving into the modern era.

Intercontinental Exchange Inc. said Monday it agreed to buy financial-data provider Interactive Data Corp. from private-equity firms Silver Lake and Warburg Pincus LLC for $5.2 billion. ICE outbid several other suitors, reflecting its view that there is big money to be made from bond-price data as the buying and selling of corporate debt shifts to electronic marketplaces.

Interactive Data competes with companies including Bloomberg LP and Thomson Reuters Corp. in providing pricing and data services to traders, portfolio managers and risk and compliance teams at financial institutions. Among its best-known products is hard-to-get pricing data on corporate bonds.

While stocks are bought and sold on exchanges, bonds traditionally have been traded over the phone between large banks and brokers. Over the past two decades several brokerage, financial-technology and other firms have launched venues for electronic bond trading that they say offer more transparency about prices and an easier way for buyers and sellers to connect. Those efforts have helped move a small but growing share of transactions to the new marketplaces.

Kevin McPartland, head of market-structure research at consulting firm Greenwich Associates, estimates that electronic bond trading could represent as much as 30% of overall trading in the next few years, up from about 20% today.

Analysts said that by acquiring Interactive Data, ICE is in a position to profit in two ways: by launching its own corporate bond-trading platform and selling its data to other emerging trading venues, in addition to the firm's current roster of banking, asset management and other clients.

"The data is valuable, but the company is suggesting it opens them up to other things as well," said Richard Repetto, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill + Partners.

Scott Hill, ICE's finance chief, said at an investor conference in September that the firm is in the "early days" of expanding in the data business. A person familiar with the matter said the main driver of the deal for ICE was the stable revenue from Interactive Data's data and analytics, though the firm hasn't ruled out launching a trading platform.

Some investors are skeptical that corporate bonds will be traded on exchanges to the same degree as stocks, citing the relative complexity of bonds.

"You're a long way off from seeing fixed-income trade on an exchange," said Scott Kimball, senior portfolio manager at Taplin, Canida & Habacht LLC, which is part of BMO Financial Group. "Fixed income is just not a one-size-fits-all marketplace."

The deal will make ICE the third-largest financial market data provider behind Bloomberg and Thomson Reuters, according to Burton-Taylor International Consulting LLC, which tracks the firms' market share. Exchanges have increasingly sought to diversify their businesses, with some focusing on data provision as a source of steady revenue.

The data provider attracted heavy interest because it has bond pricing that isn't available elsewhere, people familiar with the discussions said. Talks around an acquisition accelerated in recent weeks after the firm filed paperwork for a potential initial public offering, the people said. Terms of the ICE deal were completed late Sunday night, they said.

The other bidders at the late stage were Markit Ltd., which competes with Interactive Data to provide banks and investors with bond-pricing data, and Nasdaq Inc., which is hoping to expand its fixed-income businesses, the people said. ICE ultimately topped their bids by several hundred million dollars, the people said.

Banks, asset managers and global organizations have raised concerns in recent years about corporate-bond-market liquidity, or difficulty buying and selling bonds without significantly affecting prices. Some argue that postcrisis regulations that make it more expensive for banks to hold large inventories of bonds have hurt market liquidity.

Trading-platform providers say they help facilitate trades by connecting buyers and sellers and shedding more light on pricing. The International Monetary Fund said in an October report on financial stability that electronic trading platforms could boost trading volumes and market liquidity in over-the-counter markets.

ICE, which bought the New York Stock Exchange in 2013, is paying $3.65 billion in cash and $1.55 billion in shares for Interactive Data. The deal is expected to close by year-end.

Silver Lake and Warburg Pincus stand to nearly triple their money on their 2010 acquisition of Interactive Data, reflecting the recent surge in demand for fixed-income data. The value of their roughly $1.2 billion stake in the original deal is worth over $3 billion in the sale to ICE.

J.P. Morgan to Retool Its Chase Pay Product

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. is overhauling its payment product in a way that will allow it to compete more directly with the likes of Apple Inc. and PayPal Holdings Inc.

The New York-based bank is retooling its Chase Pay product next year to make it easier for its 94 million credit, debit and prepaid cardholders to buy goods and services through retailers' websites, mobile apps and physical stores.

The move is the latest by a big bank motivated by the perceived gold rush that financial and technology companies are racing toward as more consumers buy things on their mobile phones. Financial firms are also rushing to serve consumers who may bypass credit cards in the future.

The nation's largest bank by assets on Monday said it is partnering with some of the country's largest retailers starting in mid-2016, including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Target Corp. and Best Buy Co.

The bank's executives hope the companies will push their customers to pay with the new Chase Pay apps since that may also save money for the merchants.

With the changes, J.P. Morgan Chase customers will see the Chase logo pop up on merchants' apps or their sites. Currently, customers shopping online wouldn't see the logo but might encounter gateways to pay through Apple Pay or PayPal.

Even as more consumers bank online and check their accounts with mobile phones, many have yet to fully adopt digital or mobile payments, whether using a technology or a financial firm, industry experts say. But J.P. Morgan Chase believes it has an edge given its large customer base and merchant research.

"We've got the scale to bring an awful lot of customers," said Gordon Smith, the head of J.P. Morgan's consumer and community banking, in an interview.

Banks have put a lot of investment into digital and mobile wallets in recent years, but consumers have often preferred to swipe the old-fashioned way. A survey released by the research firm Gallup in July found that 13% of U.S. adult smartphone owners have a digital wallet app but around three out of every four of them rarely, if ever, use it.

"The reality is no one knows which [digital wallet] will win yet," said Mr. Smith, who introduced the changes at the Money20/20 financial-technology conference in Las Vegas.

The bank announced a broad initiative around Chase Pay two years ago and has spent the past nine months building the technology in-house, with an initial 250 employees across technology, design, business, analytics and research, Mr. Smith said.

Citi Tests ATMs That Scan Your Eyes

Will ATM machines soon be able to identify you by your eyes?

Citigroup Inc. is testing new technology with automated-teller-machine maker Diebold Inc. that would allow customers to withdraw money with an eyeball scan or a code on a smartphone instead of a card swipe.

The new technology announced by Diebold on Monday, is the latest foray by big banks to find easier, more secure ways for consumers to access their cash than the ATM card, a staple in consumers' wallets for decades.

Citigroup may decide not to retool its machines with this new wrinkle, and any mass rollout may be years away. Other big banks including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp. recently started internally testing their own cardless ATM technologies.

Citigroup's experiment involves a new kind of cash machine that lacks a screen or touchpad. Instead, customers would first check the bank's mobile app on their smartphone or tablet ahead of time to sign in and select how much money they want to withdraw. Then, they would approach the machine, which would quickly scan their iris to verify their identity. The machine, which connects to the mobile app, would spit out the right amount of cash.

J.P. Morgan showed off a cardless ATM during its investor day earlier this year but hasn't yet offered consumers a demonstration. A bank spokeswoman said it is also evaluating the use of voice- and facial-recognition technology. A Bank of America spokeswoman said the bank has tested cardless ATMs internally and will begin a customer pilot of them during the first half of next year. Similar features have already been rolled out at the ATMs of smaller banks, such as BMO Harris Bank, a Chicago-based unit of Canada's Bank of Montreal, and Rosemont, Ill.-based Wintrust Financial Corp.

Now, interest from some of the largest U.S. banks signals that more consumers may see the option. "Larger players sometimes like to wait on the sidelines a little longer to see if a product has merit before investing in it," said Daniel Van Dyke, an analyst at Javelin Strategy & Research.

"Everyone is doing more and more on their mobile device," said Wayne Malone, Citigroup's head of global ATMs, in an interview. Between 2013 and 2015, the share of bank customers who said their first preference for basic banking was using their mobile phone rose to 13% from 5%, according to Javelin.

It remains to be seen whether consumers who are generally suspicious of large financial institutions would be comfortable letting a bank scan their eyeballs regularly.

Changing thousands of ATMs' hardware to make use of some of these features would probably be expensive and time-consuming. That means it would likely be tested extensively before any full rollout.

Proponents say the new technologies may give banks a weapon in the fight against frauds that target ATM transactions. Credit-scoring and analytics firm FICO said in May that the number of attacks on consumers' debit cards used at ATMs in roughly the first three months of the year hit the highest level in at least 20 years.

The new technology, by contrast, wouldn't need a card, which means a card's information couldn't be skimmed by machines that are attached to ATMs. The new machines also don't have PIN pads, which thieves have spied on using tiny cameras.

BMO Harris currently has more than 900 ATMs running the software that allows cash withdrawals without bank cards, said Doug Peacock, the bank's lead executive for mobile banking. Mr. Peacock declined to give the number of customers using the cardless option but said it was increasing by a double-digit annualized basis each month and that growth has so far exceeded its goals.

Cardless transactions take about 15 seconds to complete compared with around 45 seconds for more traditional transactions, Mr. Peacock added.

Diebold said cash withdrawals on the ATMs developed with Citigroup can be completed in less than 10 seconds. Citigroup tested the new technology in August with about 30 consumers in a lab it keeps on the 10th floor of its skyscraper in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens, N.Y.

FT REPORT - FUND MANAGEMENT
 Big data  killed the wealth management star; COMMENT

More than 35 years ago, The Buggles, a British band, recorded "Video killed the radio star". The song heralded the onset of an optimistic era of automation, while lamenting some of its side-effects.

Today, in the new-age technology hubs serving the financial centres of London, Paris and Amsterdam, those concerns are gaining ground.

In the twin towers of Socit Gnrale, sprouting out of the purpose-built Parisian business district of La Dfense, private-banking boss Jean-Francois Mazaud describes his "test and learn" approach that was kick-started in the bank's "innovation lab" five years ago.

Idealistic graduates from French business schools, who once would have been busy constructing ill-fated derivative-based structured products, are turning their hand to financial technology, apparently "part of the group's DNA".

The old Buggles nightmare of a system that "can't rewind" is played down by Mr Mazaud, in favour of equilibrium between man and machine. A human-based wealth management offer should allow clients to set their own cursor to regulate time spent with their adviser.

The issues jangling the nerves of French financiers are shared by the pragmatic bankers of the bleak Dutch hinterland in Amsterdam-Zuid, home to ABN Amro, the country's leading wealth manager.

All of them have visited Asia and seen how far banks there are ahead of the technology curve. Most foreign competitors are watching DBS , one of Singapore's leading providers, closely. It is introducing a predictive system from IBM, the technology company, allowing staff to monitor vast reams of data and assist asset-allocation decisions for clients.

This has been influenced, in turn, both by tech-savvy Korean banks and Chinese groups such as Alibaba , the ecommerce group, and Tencent , the gaming and messaging company.

The question for private bankers is how far they can afford to go into this battle with data? Publicly most will say they will do whatever it takes, even if they have private reservations. " Big data are not just a big dream," says Jeroen Rijpkema, chief executive of international private banking at ABN Amro.

This obsession with data delivery and robotic channels of communication has its dangers. Indeed, many of the existing private banking problems of poor asset allocation and the sale of incorrect products are not really solved, but exacerbated.

Blind digitisation will not help heal those wounds. "The only way you can improve this is by changing the underlying model and processes," says Tim Tate, global head of client experience at Citi Private Bank's Canary Wharf headquarters in London.

Much of his bank's transformation process is influenced by its Citi Ventures private equity arm in Palo Alto, California, which helps Citi take a five-year view of digitisation and not get bogged down in the daily IT grind of updating websites and tweaking apps.

Digitisation has, so far, improved the "line speed" of existing services, but it has yet to cause any real disruption or innovation, says Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, an asset management consultancy.

Unlike retailers and other commerce sectors, wealth and asset managers are still missing a huge digital opportunity. "The mindset of many firms is simply to adapt existing capabilities," says Sebastian Dovey, co-founder of Scorpio Partnership, the wealth management consultancy.

The next stage has to be a complete transformation of the industry, and, believes Mr Dovey, revising the engagement rules between bank, client and wealth. They could even go as far as aiming for the sentiment of another hit song of the Buggles era, Fern Kinney's "Together we are beautiful".

The former head of the National Security Agency has attracted funding for his cybersecurity startup from a prominent venture-capital firm, highlighting the continuing ties between Silicon Valley and Washington despite recent tensions.

Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers is among the investors providing a $32.5 million infusion to IronNet Cybersecurity Inc., which aims to help companies fight computer hackers with software.

IronNet was founded by Keith Alexander, who was NSA director in 2013 when former agency contractor Edward Snowden revealed that the NSA had snooped with help from technology firms. Since then, government officials and tech executives have clashed over the proper limits of encryption technology.

The IronNet investment was led by Donald Dixon, an old friend of Mr. Alexander, at Trident Capital Cybersecurity, another West Coast investment firm.

The transition from the NSA to the cybersecurity industry has become fairly common in an age of data breaches blamed on foreign hackers. Mr. Alexander's three most recent predecessors went on to work at Washington-area consulting and investment firms.

Mr. Alexander, a retired four-star four-star general, has taken a more tech-oriented route with IronNet, teaming up with a University of Chicago professor to build antihacking software. A bit of a geek, Mr. Alexander was known for modeling an NSA command center after the interior of Star Trek's USS Enterprise.

IronNet is the latest of several security companies seeking to profile hacker behavior and create computer models to spot it, so they can detect threats more quickly. That could put Mr. Alexander in competition with companies such as FireEye Inc., CrowdStrike Inc. or Palantir Technologies Inc., the data-analytics company that reportedly helped U.S. spies find Osama bin Laden.

In an interview, Mr. Alexander declined to discuss IronNet's progress. He said IronNet has several paying customers, but wouldn't disclose names.

 We don't want them to know how far we've gone," he said, referring to potential competitors. On its website, IronNet uses a mix of tech and military language, promising  real-time visibility and situational awareness across the information environment."

IronNet was launched shortly after Mr. Alexander left the NSA in spring 2014. Many of its employees are drawn from the federal government, including Matthew Olsen, who led counterterrorism efforts for the Obama administration.

As IronNet builds its technology, officials such as Mr. Olsen have offered consulting services to bring in extra revenue. Mr. Alexander said he has been boning up on how to run a startup, such as drafting term sheets for investors.

 It's been a good year," Mr. Alexander said of IronNet in an interview.  I'm not going to say it's been an easy year."

It also hasn't been without controversy. Some critics accused Mr. Alexander of too quickly cashing in or potentially relying on classified intelligence to turn a buck.

This spring, the former general asked the NSA to review IronNet's patent filings for classified material and to check that it didn't borrow from the work of others at the agency. The company doesn't appear to have made any changes since the review.

Mr. Alexander said his patents are submitted and pending.

Investment trusts dust off their dowdy image as boardrooms are shaken up

The battle for control at Alliance Trust captured headlines this year, but it is not the only fund experiencing radical change, as Judith Evans reports

The insult still stings. Five years ago, Peter Hargreaves, founder of fund supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown, told the FT: "I do not think the investment trust industry is capable of being revived.

It's run by a lot of fuddy duddies who have no place in the industry." The 142-year-old trusts sector responded defensively. One supporter admitted trusts had "as much charisma as a three-day-old haddock", but insisted the sector was "more dynamic than its public persona would suggest". Others produced performance data suggesting the fuddy-duddies were outperforming their open-ended cousins.

In any case, Mr Hargreaves' prediction of doom for the sector has not been fulfilled. In market capitalisation terms, investment trusts have since expanded from 77bn to 112bn - growth of 45 per cent. Ironically, Hargreaves Lansdown itself is now one of the largest investment trust brokers in the country, with 2.9bn held in the products on its platform.

Listed funds have become a fashionable format for new asset classes - renewable energy, peer-to-peer debt - and have drawn several US companies to launch products listed on the London Stock Exchange.

Perhaps most importantly, the Retail Distribution Review in 2013 removed the ability of unlisted mutual funds to pay commissions to financial advisers and other intermediaries, something trusts had never been able to do. That change brought trusts on to a level playing field with unlisted rivals in the retail market.

Trusts' ability to "smooth over" their dividend payments and use borrowing to enhance returns suddenly appealed to a wider audience, while the new, more direct competition with mutual funds has prompted a series of trusts to overhaul themselves.

"There is tremendous demand for trusts now, and loads of discounts [to net asset value] have been wiped out," says John Newlands, head of investment companies at wealth manager Brewin Dolphin.

Modern times

The latest trust to be dragged, more or less kicking and screaming, into the modern era was Alliance Trust, a 127-year-old, 2.7bn global vehicle that is a Dundee institution.

After a long battle with Elliott, a US-based activist shareholder, Alliance Trust this month drew dividing lines between the trust itself and its internal asset management arm, awarding Alliance Trust Investments the mandate to run the trust at a low fee of 35 basis points.

It also set out plans to become purely equity-focused, adopted a fixed benchmark and performance target, and switched to a fully cataindependent non-executive board, while it will try - partly through share buybacks - to reduce its discount to net asset value into the single-digits.

Jeremy Beckwith, director of manager research for the UK at Morningstar, says the changes were "something of a blueprint for best practice in corporate governance, especially at the self-managed trusts".

"Everyone is much clearer about what they're trying to do and who's accountable for delivering it," says Mr Beckwith.

"The board has told Alliance Trust Investments, 'This is your mandate and you're now responsible for going on and achieving that. If you don't, we might fire you'." The governance changes mean now could be a good time to buy Alliance Trust, since they are likely to filter through into performance improvements, says James Maltin, investment director at Rathbone Investment Management. "I don't think one could do a great deal of harm in buying Alliance Trust," he says.

Elliott had argued Alliance was sustaining a bloated management structure while failing to deliver better performance than a cheap tracker fund. To push for changes, it nominated people to the board who it said would be fully independent of the trust's management.

Trust boards are meant to oversee the funds impartially, but genuine independence is a perennial problem for those trusts which incorporate their own management rather than farming out the function to a separate asset manager.

Independence may also be a problem "where asset management companies have a family of investment trusts - the board members are essentially appointed with heavy influence from the underlying management company," says Mr Beckwith.

"Historically, [boards] have been seen as fairly cosy places to be, a nice, gentle way to earn 20,000 or 25,000 a year as a non-exec on an investment trust.

"But the pressure has been building over the past few years from activist investors. Boards should be thinking about what they can do to prevent an activist attack." While Alliance Trust came under intense external pressure, the boards of some trusts have themselves been the cataindependent lysts for change. Directors of the underperforming 117-year-old British Assets Trust switched its fund manager from F&C to BlackRock in February, and won existing investors over to a change of mandate from equities to multi-asset income.

The renamed BlackRock Income Strategies trust is now at the front of efforts by BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, to cater for UK pensioners in search of a steady income.

It is one of nine investment trusts to have switched management teams since the start of 2014. Another, Monks Investment Trust, changed managers within Baillie Gifford, the firm that runs it, after five years of underperformance; the new manager, Charles Plowden, immediately changed half the fund's holdings.

Overhauls have paid off for some of Britain's biggest trusts. Witan, which dates back more than 100 years, in 2004 adopted a multi-manager approach and ditched Henderson Global Investors, its former managers, in favour of running itself. It also adopted an extreme approach to share buybacks - reducing its number of shares by almost 50 per cent over 15 years.

The result has been improving performance and a narrowing discount to net asset value - so much so that the company is now issuing new shares again.

Bubbles of complacency

Dinosaurs still lurk among the more than 400 London-listed trusts, at least according to one well-known analyst, Alan Brierley at Canaccord Genuity.

"Corporate governance has improved significantly, but I get the impression that a seven-year bull market has created bubbles of comlysts placency out there," says Mr Brierley.

"There are some top-drawer managers, but also some distinctly average companies where managers are unable to deliver sustained outperformance, and some companies that are too small to compete in this marketplace." Some 130 investment trusts have market capitalisations of less than 50m, prompting questions over their future viability.

Mr Brierley notes that it is impossible to set a minimum level of assets for a viable trust. Some, such as those focused on small- or microcaps, may need to limit growth to ensure they carry out their investment strategies.

But he adds: "For traditional longonly equity funds with a focus on large- and mid-caps, questions have to be asked if the managers are not able to grow the market cap beyond 100m." Meanwhile, more than half of trusts still have performance fees in place - additional charges on top of administration fees, which Mr Beckwith says may be justified in specialist funds, but are hard to defend in mainstream sectors such as UK or global equities. Some 20 funds have ditched them since the start of 2014.

Other funds face question marks over their treatment of investors. One trust, the 227m JZ Capital Partners, won the label "a fund to avoid" from analysts at Numis last month after it issued 79m of equity, diluting the holdings of existing shareholders, despite trading at a steep discount of 40 per cent.

Among global trusts, one of the worst performing over five years is the 631m British Empire Securities and General Trust, run by Asset Value Investors. In share price terms it has returned only 9.3 per cent to investors over five years, in contrast with 159 per cent for its most successful rival, the Lindsell Train Investment Trust, according to figures from FE Analytics.

That resulted in part from market conditions unsuited to the British Empire trust's "value" style, and its mandate to invest in stocks from any country except the US, where markets have been buoyant over the past seven years.

The trust is undergoing a quiet revolution, however. A new manager, Joe Bauernfreund, took charge last month and admits performance has been "less than impressive". He plans to reduce its 40 holdings to nearer 30.

Stops and starts

Radicalism does not always work.

Two other funds, LMS Capital and Dexion Absolute, sought to take on new investment mandates in the summer, only to see their plans knocked back by shareholders.

In parallel with Alliance Trust's hedge fund battle, Electra - a 1.7bn private equity trust - has been under attack from another activist, Edward Bramson of Sherborne Investors Management.

For a second time, Mr Bramson, who now owns almost 30 per cent of Electra, has called a vote on November 5 on whether he and Ian Brindle, a former chair of Sherborne, should join Electra's board. A year ago, Mr Bramson was defeated when shareholders voted down a similar proposal.

Sherborne boasts of having made its investors an average of 19 per cent a year, after fees, for the 12 years to the end of 2014. The performance of its target, Electra, has not been so consistent - but in the past year, according to FE Analytics data, Electra has made its investors 45 per cent.

This has led analysts and shareholders to question whether Electra is really in need of a rude awakening.

But there are parallels between Mr Bramson's arguments and those which triumphed at Alliance Trust: he told shareholders in a letter on October 16 that costs were too high and the board was not independent enough from Electra Partners, which manages the investments.

Electra has made some changes since Mr Bramson began buying the trust, introducing a dividend policy and cutting costs. But Electra's management shot back on October 21: "It is deeply disappointing that Mr Bramson has shown such wilful ignorance concerning the success of Electra and how we operate. He has made a series of ill-judged, ill-informed and ill-founded claims about the company and its board - we cannot let this stand." Analysts at Numis believe the management may now lose the vote, since Mr Bramson has not only increased his stake but won support from some institutional investors. But Charles Cade, head of investment company research, adds: "Whichever way the vote goes, the long term future of the fund appears uncertain, in our view, due to the divided nature of the shareholder base."

Back to the future

Investment trusts have many qualities that open-ended funds will never have. Their capacity is limited by the number of shares in issue, so unlike mutual funds they cannot carry on gathering assets - and collecting percentage- based fees - indefinitely.

They can accommodate illiquid assets such as property without worrying so much about how to sell them if investors desert the fund en masse.

But the listed structure comes with its own constraints, which have kept investment trusts a minority sport even as they become better known.

Liquidity in trusts themselves can be a concern, and big wealth managers and adviser groups can shy away from recommending them because it may not be feasible for large numbers of clients to own the same fund.

Mr Newlands is a long-term fan of trusts but says: "Trusts under 200m are harder and harder to recommend, because investors need the reassurance they can get out as easily as they got into the position.

"We are increasingly aware of the importance of good liquidity and we wish to avoid concentration risk." Mr Brierley argues the sector is in need of more mergers, but questions whether this will happen given that boards which opt to merge are effectively putting themselves out of a job - "six plus six does not equal 12[on a board]".

Analysts hope that more direct competition with open-ended funds, especially now that investors can easily compare performance online, will keep up the pressure for lacklustre trusts to reform.

But the sector is also in a sweet spot as demand has increased, pushing share prices up and discounts to net asset value down.

"We all love to buy high-quality vehicles on high discounts, but there are not too many of those now," says Mr Brierley. "You're having to work a lot harder now than back in 2009."

Discounts

Are they bargains - or cheap for a reason?

When an investment trust trades at a steep discount to net asset value, potential investors face a dilemma. If they buy, will they get a bargain or does the discount reflect poor prospects for the fund, perhaps because of a flawed investment strategy or an asset class under stress? BlackRock's World Mining trust is a case in point. It suffered badly from the downturn in the commodities and resources sectors, and took a steep writedown a year ago after the failure of one of its largest holdings, London Mining, a Sierra Leone iron ore miner. As a result, its share price has fallen almost 34 per cent in the past year and it trades at an 11 per cent discount.

But the fund made a series of changes in March, including a new fee structure, and it may now be time to reconsider the trust, according to analysts at Winterflood.

"We believe that the fund remains an interesting play on a recovery in the resources sector," they say.

Canaccord Genuity recommends a series of "opportunities for the contrarian", including Templeton Emerging Markets, an underperforming trust that also trades at an 11 per cent discount.

John Newlands, head of investment companies research at the wealth manager Brewin Dolphin, argues there may be opportunities in the private equity sector. He suggests looking at products such as Pantheon International Participations, a fund of funds trading at a 15 per cent discount.

"Private equity is a slightly damaged brand - a number of them suffered quite badly in the credit crunch when they were overcommitted and had to sell holdings almost at fire sale prices," says Mr Newlands. "But they've learned their lesson and it's one of the few sectors where there are some attractive discounts left." Buyers must tread carefully, however. A big discount means the market is dubious, and investors should not take the plunge without understanding why.
