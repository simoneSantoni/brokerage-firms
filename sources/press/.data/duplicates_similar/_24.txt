China's Tech Sector Is Underestimated, Venture Investors Say; Kai-Fu Lee, Jim Breyer tells WSJ's tech conference that China shouldn't be taken for granted

LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. Americans underestimate the Chinese tech sector at their own peril, said venture investors Kai-Fu Lee and Jim Breyer at The Wall Street Journal's "http://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/wsjdlive-conference-2016" on Wednesday.

"A lot of people in the U.S. just don't realize how strong the Chinese entrepreneurial, engineering, product, research capabilities are," said Mr. Lee, chairman and chief executive of the early stage venture firm Sinovation Ventures, which invests in Chinese companies.

He pointed to the market capitalization of giant Chinese internet firms Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which are approaching those of their American counterparts Facebook Inc. and Amazon Inc., as well as advanced artificial intelligence research coming from China.

"Anyone here who thinks China is a copycat. That's just wrong," Mr. Lee said, arguing that the U.S. will fall behind China if it takes the country's technology sector for granted.

Mr. Breyer, best known for his early investment in Facebook and a longtime investor in Chinese companies, said that American companies historically have been "darn too arrogant" trying to enter the Chinese market and trying to distribute products or services there that were developed for the U.S. market.

Mr. Breyer and IDG Capital, one of China's top investors, jointly announced in July that they "http://www.wsj.com/articles/jim-breyer-and-idg-raise-1-billion-china-fund-1468324804" in growth-stage companies both in China and those looking to enter the country, one of the largest funds targeting the Chinese market.

Though China is mostly closed today to American tech companies, Mr. Breyer said he's hopeful that companies "like Facebook" will be able to enter China within 10 years.

Facebook founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg is teaching himself Mandarin and is "http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2016/03/18/facebooks-mark-zuckerberg-goes-running-in-hazardous-beijing-smog/", part of his charm offensive meant to help the social network gain entry to the market where it is currently blocked because of censorship.

Creighton's Take: Banks' Big Advantage Over Fintech Deposit Insurance

Banks' Big Advantage Over Fintech Deposit Insurance

Deposit insurance protects savers, but it also presents a barrier to entry for fintech firms as they push to compete with traditional banks.

Fintech investors and practitioners, speaking at last week's "http://www.wsj.com/articles/pro-financial-regulation-event-what-they-said-1476815366", vented their frustration with thicket of state rules that govern lending and payment provision. "I've never heard one single person say it's a great system," "http://www.wsj.com/articles/transcript-governing-fintech-at-wsj-pro-financial-regulation-event-1476838131", managing partner of Nyca Partners, a venture-capital firm that was an early investor in fintech firm LendingClub.

The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is "http://www.wsj.com/articles/regulator-moves-to-create-new-fintech-framework-1459157401" for fintech firms. But even if states gave up their distinct and lucrative licensing regimes, federal deposit insurance would remain a hurdle.

"I don't think fintech is going to disrupt banks. I think they're going to provide value added, if done the right way," said former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman Sheila Bair, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/transcript-sheila-bair-at-wsj-pro-financial-regulation-event-1476835525". Harvard University senior fellow Jo Ann Barefoot, also at the conference, provided a clue why. "The banks have low cost of funds; they have the access to the payment system, and so on," she said.

Deposit insurance confers a big advantage on the 6,000-odd U.S. banks where deposits up to $250,000 are insured by the FDIC. They can obtain funds much more cheaply than any fintech firm, whose creditors have to worry about whether they will get their money back.

"In a typical marketplace lender, investors or creditors are receiving anywhere between 5% and 9%, which is a huge multiple of what banks have to pay on deposits," Sam Hodges, co-founder of Funding Circle, a peer-to-peer lender to small and medium-size enterprises, said in an interview. Meanwhile, the FDIC charges banks between two and 45 cents (for the largest and most complex banks) for every $100 of insured deposits. The FDIC safety net makes banks' low interest rates, typically less than 0.5%, palatable to depositors.

"http://www.nber.org/papers/w22692", a professor of finance at Columbia University, highlights how deposit insurance can tilt the competitive landscape and even foster excessive risk taking. Examining growth in deposits across insured and uninsured banks within and across U.S. states between 1907 and 1917 a unique period in which eight states including Texas and Washington introduced voluntary deposit insurance he finds "insured banks were able to use the promise of insurance to compete away deposits from uninsured banks."

"We find conclusive evidence that deposit insurance caused risk to increase in the banking system by removing the market discipline that had been constraining uninsured banks' decision making," the paper finds.

In the current era, the value of deposit insurance should become clearer if the OCC introduces a new fintech charter.

Details remain unclear, but such a charter might give fintech firms the right to collect deposits without necessarily having to obtain FDIC insurance. Industry observers say fintech banks might be able to build reputations that allow them to raise deposits from customers without the regulation that comes with FDIC insurance.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Moving to Frankfurt After Brexit Could Be a Squeeze for Banks

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/moving-to-frankfurt-after-brexit-could-be-a-squeeze-for-banks-1477474204" when Britain quits the European Union? Mind the Arbeitsstttenverordnung.

That's Germany's strict office-building regulation, which, among other things, prescribes a minimum of one square meter of window for every 10 of floor space, and mandates that all desks enjoy natural light. As a consequence, many buildings are shaped like doughnuts. Good luck squeezing in a trading floor.

Frankfurt is an obvious post-Brexit destination for London banks seeking to move some operations to keep them inside the EU. But tough building codes and a shortage of space may make it harder than imagined.

Big U.S. Retail Bank Operations Under Scrutiny After Wells Scandal

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/big-u-s-retail-bank-operations-under-scrutiny-follow-wells-scandal-1477400747" earlier this month sent formal letters to large and regional banks seeking information about sales practices and incentive-compensation structures following the Wells Fargo & Co. scandal, people familiar with the requests said.

The OCC sent letters to banks under its supervision including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp. and Citigroup Inc., these people said. The requests followed earlier, informal questions about those practices.

China Central Bank Seeks More Control Over Wealth-Management Products

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-central-bank-seeks-more-control-over-wealth-management-products-1477450399" to rein in risk in the country's $4 trillion market for high-yielding investment products peddled by commercial banks to ordinary savers, according to banking executives, asking lenders to subject them to closer regulatory oversight.

In a notice to banks dated Oct. 20, the People's Bank of China requires commercial banks to count so-called wealth-management products as part of their total credit, the executives said. In essence, it means those assets, which currently require no capital cushion, would be subject to capital and other regulatory requirements, helping to bring banks' risk exposure more into the open.

Interactive: Where Clinton and Trump Stand on Wall Street

"http://graphics.wsj.com/elections/2016/where-do-clinton-and-trump-stand-on-wall-street/" and predilections on Wall Street, a big dividing line in the presidential election. The Republican standard-bearer says he wants to rip up the landmark 2010 Dodd-Frank Act enacted in response to the financial crisis. His Democratic opponent says she wants to extend its reach. But the picture is more complex. Both candidates, during decades in public life, have embraced, and tangled with, the financial industry.

SEC Examiners to Look at Advisers' Compliance With Whistleblower Rules

"http://blogs.wsj.com/riskandcompliance/2016/10/25/sec-examiners-to-look-at-advisers-compliance-with-whistleblower-rules/" a risk alert Monday, telling investment advisers and broker-dealers that examiners will be checking on their compliance with a whistleblower-protection rule.

The alert, issued by the SEC's office of compliance inspections and examinations, noted that the SEC has taken several enforcement actions recently in which it charged companies for restricting the rights of ex-employees from speaking to the agency about potential securities violations.

Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Reaches Settlement With Watchdog

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/canadian-imperial-bank-of-commerce-reaches-settlement-with-watchdog-1477437226" and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce have reached a tentative settlement regarding cases in which the bank overcharged investment clients for over a decade.

The Ontario Securities Commission said it would seek approval of the settlement before a hearing on Friday. The watchdog didn't disclose how many CIBC clients were affected or the amount of money involved. The regulator added it found "no evidence of dishonest conduct" by the bank.

WSJ Pro: Ireland Makes Its Pitch for European Banking Authority

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/ireland-makes-its-pitch-for-european-banking-authority-1477413247" to host the European Banking Authority, the latest attempt by the Emerald Isle to beef up its financial sector after the U.K.'s vote to exit from the European Union.

The EBA, which works to harmonize EU banking rules and oversee balance-sheet health checks, is currently based in London. After Brexit the group will have to move to a country within the EU.

The Fiduciary Rule: A Compliance Outline

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-fiduciary-rule-a-compliance-outline-1477409573" set to take effect in April, efforts to comply with the stepped-up regulation are under way across the adviser world.

The rule, unveiled last spring, holds brokers and advisers who work with tax-advantaged retirement savings to a "fiduciary" standard, meaning they must work in the best interest of their clients and generally avoid conflicts, which can come about with commission-based compensation. Previously, such investment professionals were required to offer only "suitable" guidance, a less-rigorous standard.

The Property Report
IPO Spat Roils German Real-Estate Firm --- IVG Immobilien and hedge funds feud over pulled offering, snub of Blackstone deal

The biggest initial public offering in Europe's real-estate sector this year was postponed when investors became skittish over market volatility.

But it was the decision to turn down a private sale to Blackstone Group LP in the days following the pulled IPO that has ignited animosity among the roughly 30 hedge funds that own IVG Immobilien AG, one of Germany's biggest property companies, people familiar with the matter said. A spokesman for IVG declined to comment.

The turmoil poses a problem for IVG's chief executive, Dietmar P. Binkowska, who believes the contentious relationship between hedge-fund owners is limiting his ability to use fresh funds for other parts of the business, the people said.Mr. Binkowska declined to comment through the IVG spokesman.

The situation highlights the hurdles companies face when owned by a collective of hedge funds, an industry that recently has come under pressure because of poor performance and large outflows of money. Such fractured ownership structures are rare for major European property companies, with IVG's problems rooted in the financial crisis.

IVG had planned to float a stake in a subsidiary, OfficeFirst Immobilien AG, on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in a deal that valued the company at up to 1.8 billion euros ($1.96 billion). That number included issuing new shares worth 450 million euros for OfficeFirst, which has a portfolio of about 100 properties in six of the biggest German cities.

Given the size, the outcome of the deal was being closely watched. There have been just $1.1 billion of real-estate IPOs in Europe so far this year, well below total volumes for the previous three years, according to data-firm Dealogic. A successful IPO of OfficeFirst would have been a strong signal for Europe's listed real-estate market, analysts said.

Postponing the IPO was only the latest headache for IVG, once Germany's largest commercial-real-estate company. In 2014 the firm was taken over by creditors as mounting debt in the aftermath of the financial crisis pushed it toward insolvency.

OfficeFirst was formed this year to hold mostly office properties in six major German cities, including Berlin and Frankfurt. The idea behind the IPO was that international investors would be interested in stable rental income in one of Europe's strongest economies.

IVG postponed the IPO this month because investors became increasingly concerned over falling share prices for German real-estate companies during the course of the roadshow, OfficeFirst said earlier this month in a statement. Uncertainty about the future of monetary policy at the European Central Bank and Federal Reserve also had "led to marked reticence among investors," the statement said.

A couple of days after announcing the delay, OfficeFirst's biggest hedge-fund owners, Anchorage Capital Group and Marathon Asset Management LLP, both based in New York, negotiated an outright sale of the company to Blackstone, according to people familiar with the deal. Anchorage and Marathon are IVG's largest shareholders, with a combined stake of roughly 30%.

The U.S. private-equity giant was willing to pay 1.3 billion euros for OfficeFirst, bringing the total deal value to above 3.3 billion euros including debt, the people said. That would have been at the upper end of the book-building range of OfficeFirst's IPO attempt. A spokesman for Blackstone declined to comment.

Rejecting Blackstone's offer has been seen as a mistake by a group of about six other hedge funds that each hold around 5% of IVG, including Perry Capital LLC, Capital Management LLC and York Capital LLC, people familiar with the matter said. The hedge funds now are alleging that IVG's move to halt both the Blackstone sale and an IPO has significantly reduced the value of OfficeFirst, the people familiar said.

The squabble comes amid falling investment in German commercial real estate, where volumes were down 35% to about 32 billion euros in the first nine months of 2016 compared with the year earlier, according to Real Capital Analytics.

The drop in trading has been driven by a lack of buildings for sale rather than weak demand, according to real-estate broker CBRE. Office rents are rising as companies increasingly lease space, CBRE said, a trend that could increase further should financial companies relocate operations out of London because of Britain's decision to leave the European Union.

Office markets in German cities like Frankfurt, a European financial hub and home to the ECB, would stand to benefit.

IVG could use the funds from an IPO of OfficeFirst to pay for other parts of its business. Safety valves at two of the company's 70 underground gas storage facilities ruptured in 2014.

The failed attempt at an IPO or to sell Office First could increase IVG's refinancing costs as the company would have used fresh funds to reduce debt, people close to the matter said.

Awaiting the Next Big Thing

Venture capitalists are always chasing the next big thing. Of late, they are struggling to figure out what that might be.

Nearly a decade has passed since the smartphone sparked a startup gold rush. Silicon Valley investors have yet to identify the next product that will spawn a similar wave of tech companies and lucrative returns.

Venture capitalists are spreading their bets across technologies where the path to profits is unclear, including self-driving cars, drones, artificial intelligence, virtual reality -- even food.

The drive to find the next big thing, coupled with piles of money that investors need to put to work, could spur foolish bets. Venture firms have raised $34 billion through September -- on pace for their biggest year since 2007.

Veteran investor Steve Jurvetson of Draper Fisher Jurvetson said his firm is backing companies in agriculture, robotics, artificial intelligence and aerospace.

"A ridiculous amount of money will be lost foraging into all these areas," he said. "But the greatest opportunities are in those sectors."

Silicon Valley has seen this movie a few times since the 1960s. Its boom-and-bust investing cycles generally begin with about eight years of growth followed by six years of retrenchment, said longtime venture capitalist Arthur Patterson, co-founder of Accel Partners, a sequence some now refer to as the Patterson Cycle.

Faster, cheaper computer chips propelled tech-innovation cycles in the past as profits moved from mainframe computers to personal computers to smartphones and the software products they hatched. Between each transition, the investor outlook was uncertain, and venture capitalists, whose job is to spot technology shifts, scavenged for the next big thing.

Silicon Valley was saved from the doldrums of the 1970s by the PC revolution of the 1980s that propelled such companies as Intel Corp., Apple and Microsoft. By 1990, as PC sales slowed, venture capitalists shifted money into lower-risk, low-tech areas, including retail.

Then the World Wide Web resurrected venture capital. VCs invested nearly $200 billion from 1995 to 2000, and more than 1,000 companies went public, including Amazon.com Inc. and Yahoo Inc.

After the dot-com bust, venture capitalists largely moved away from internet companies. Some made bad bets on clean energy and nanotechnology, and missed the social-networking trend led by Facebook Inc. Others were late to the mobile internet wave led by Apple's iPhone in 2007.

Today, capital is pouring into venture funds, but the funds aren't pouring cash into startups at the same record clip. Investment in startups fell 30% to $41 billion through the first nine months of the year compared with the same period in 2015, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

Some of the most high-valued venture-backed startups are products of the smartphone era, including car-hailing service Uber Technologies Inc. and messaging service Snap Inc. The internet also gave rise to such cloud-computing giants as Salesforce.com and Workday Inc.

Today, new smartphone apps rarely capture the attention of hundreds of millions of people -- apart from flash-in-the-pan mobile games. And the best cloud-computing businesses already are established.

Venture investors are getting antsy as they sense a lull at the end of an investing cycle, said Elad Gil, founder of cancer-testing software startup Color Genomics Inc., and an investor in highly valued startups Airbnb Inc. and Pinterest Inc.

"Trying to find what's next, you start investing in a lot of stuff you don't understand," he said. Venture capitalists, he said, are sitting on funds they feel they need to deploy.

Mr. Jurvetson said one way to avoid bad bets is to steer clear of capital-intensive projects, a mistake his firm and others made when they bet on some early clean-technology companies.

Uber's success encouraged venture capitalists to invest in almost any on-demand app that offered a service with the push of a button. Investors valued such companies like software startups, though the labor and marketing costs of these companies limit their profit margins. Many failed. Others are struggling.

Virtual reality was hot when Facebook bought Oculus VR Inc. and said it would be the next great computing platform. But sales of VR machines and headsets remain tiny compared with the billions of smartphones out there. Established game developers have so far only tiptoed into the market.

Complicating matters for investors: Big companies aren't waiting around for startups to lead the way. Instead, they are spending mountains of cash to keep emerging experts from joining smaller companies.

Chris Dixon, a general partner at venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, cited self-driving cars. Apple, Google and Uber have hired hundreds of robotics and automobile specialists in recent years, essentially pricing them out of the reach of startups.

"They're getting ridiculous offers," he said. Mr. Dixon and other investors said they remain optimistic.

There are "still rockets being built in the barn and hopefully they'll take off," said Steve Vassallo, a general partner at Foundation Capital, who said many of today's promising technologies will take time to develop. "It's not just spinning up a server and burping out an app."

Menlo Ventures Backs AI Star's Startup Clarifai

When Matthew Zeiler swept top awards at an ImageNet Challenge in 2013, the premier battle of the nerds for the artificial-intelligence industry, he attracted more than a little bit of attention.

That was the year he beat out algorithms from IBM, Adobe and the National University of Singapore for image identification.

The star of Mr. Zeiler, 29, has been rising for some time. Before dominating the field at ImageNet, he applied his Ph.D. in neural networks to Google as an intern. There he worked with the company's artificial intelligence group, the Google Brain team, some of the world's experts in the field.

The projects he worked on at Google and his Ph.D. work led to a bidding war for his talent, he said. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg met with him, as did executives from Google, Microsoft and Apple in efforts to woo him with offers.

Ultimately, he passed so he could start his own company, with sky-high ambitions to create mainstream AI used everywhere. It is now offering image recognition in 20 languages.

"We wanted to solve the problem of getting AI to every person on the planet," said Mr. Zeiler, the founder and CEO of Clarifai.

New York-based Clarifai focuses its algorithms on image and video recognition technology. Its API is intended to be used by those building applications so they can easily include image and video recognition into applications.

In a landscape of social apps in which people share their lives in photos and consume billions of videos daily on Facebook, recognition of images and video has grown in importance. Technology and media companies alike want to keep pornography and graphic violence in images and videos off their web and mobile destinations. Companies are also looking for easier ways to identify visual assets of their business.

Clarifai's visual recognition API is capable of identifying more than 11,000 different concepts in photos and videos. It is able to serve customers with industry specific capabilities. For example, for corporations it offers an adult-content moderation model that can provide "not safe for work" feedback. Its travel model can recognize travel-related images, such as "kids' area" or "hot tub," aimed at travel-related businesses.

The startup has picked up customers, including BuzzFeed, Trivago, 500px and StyleMePretty. For BuzzFeed, the media company's editors can use Clarifai's AI technology to help manage all of its visual content better, allowing it to be tagged and found more easily.

Mr. Zeiler compares what Clarifai is doing for the proliferation of its AI to what Twilio has done with its API to deliver text messaging and Voice over internet Protocol to applications. Twilio is used by Uber for such functions. "We're just at the tip of the iceberg on what's possible here," said Mr. Zeiler.

Clarifai on Tuesday said that Menlo Ventures has led a $30 million Series B investment in the company that included participation from existing investors Union Square Ventures, Lux Capital, Qualcomm Ventures, Osage University Partners and others. Clarifai has raised $41.25 million to date.

Before Clarifai, "We didn't find anybody that had taken the view that you should take this tech to the masses in a really simple way. The applications are kind of endless," said Matt Murphy, managing director at Menlo Ventures.

Progressives Set Terms for Possible Clinton Appointments

As polls show Hillary Clinton's presidential fortunes on the rise, progressive politicians and outside groups are gearing up for a battle over appointments to key government financial posts.

Since the conclusion of a contentious primary campaign, Democratic leaders including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, along with labor unions and grass-roots groups, have largely stuck to a unified script, with their opposition to Donald Trump's candidacy far outweighing other concerns.

But with polls showing a yawning gap between the candidates, liberals are readying themselves to push a Clinton administration toward their policy priorities by hiring their ideological allies for top jobs.

"People in those positions have to be willing to rewrite the rules of the economy to make the economy work for everyone," Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, the nation's largest labor union, said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal last week. "If their philosophy prevents them from working with us and other progressive groups to rewrite those rules, then yeah, we would say they shouldn't be appointed."

Ms. Warren, the unofficial leader of progressives in the Senate, previewed the kind of pressure she is prepared to put on potential appointees if they don't, in her view, sufficiently defend progressive policies.

On Monday, Ms. Warren delivered a robust endorsement of Mrs. Clinton at a rally in New Hampshire but "http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/10/24/nasty-woman-elizabeth-warren-hits-the-stump-for-clinton/" the candidate to press for a progressive agenda.

Earlier this month, she "http://www.wsj.com/articles/elizabeth-warren-to-obama-fire-sec-chief-mary-jo-white-1476439200" Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Jo White for her decision not to craft a rule requiring public companies to disclose their political spending activities.

While the White House rejected the request outright, Ms. Warren had success with a previous pressure campaign in 2015, when she led the opposition to Antonio Weiss's appointment to a key Treasury Department post due to his Wall Street ties. He withdrew from consideration, though he ended up as counselor to Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew.

And if her point wasn't clear, Ms. Warren spelled out her goals for financial appointees in a "http://www.wsj.com/articles/progressives-want-say-on-filling-administration-posts-if-hillary-clinton-wins-1474502066" last month at the left-leaning Center for American Progress: "We don't need Citigroup or Morgan Stanley or BlackRock getting to choose who runs the economy in this country so that they can capture our government," she said.

To be sure, not all Democrats will toe the Warren line. At a WSJ Pro Financial Regulation event last week, Sen. Mark Warner (D., Va.) "http://www.wsj.com/articles/full-video-sen-mark-warner-has-advice-for-regulators-1476989038" that working on Wall Street was a scarlet letter for potential regulators.

"To take one broad brush and say, per se, anyone that actually has worked in the intricacies of an industry that is extraordinarily complex can't serve the public I don't agree with," "http://www.wsj.com/articles/transcript-sen-mark-warner-at-wsj-pro-financial-regulation-event-1476836928".

The Clinton campaign has drawn Ms. Warren close, as an effective surrogate beloved by the party's base and a possible power player in a Democratic-controlled Senate. The same goes for Mr. Sanders. After negotiations over the Democratic Party platform, he has become one of Mrs. Clinton's most active surrogates.

But in his pitch to voters, many of whom chose him in the primaries and may be skeptical of Mrs. Clinton's commitment to progressivism, he consistently talks about the day after Election Day.

That's when, Mr. Sanders "https://newrepublic.com/article/137103/bernie-looks-ahead", "we begin the effort of making Clinton the most progressive president that she can become."

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Credit-Card Scammers Embrace Online Shopping

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/credit-card-scammers-embrace-online-shopping-1477387802", criminals are buying more goods and services online with credit cards.

The rate of online card fraud is rising sharply as a growing number of purchases take place on the internet while brick-and-mortar merchants race to lock down vulnerabilities in the checkout line. That is prompting new steps to try to curb the threat: The credit-card industry this week is expected to announce a plan to encourage online merchants to provide card issuers with more detailed customer information that could be used to catch fraudulent purchases.

U.S. Oversight of MetLife Called Into Question at Court Hearing

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-oversight-of-metlife-called-into-question-at-court-hearing-1477323670" was called into question Monday at a court hearing where the Obama administration sought to reassert the federal government's authority to regulate the large insurance firm.

Judges at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit asked pointed questions to government lawyers and at times appeared to express sympathy for MetLife during a hearing that lasted more than an hour.

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/metlife-v-fsoc-oral-arguments-four-key-exchanges-1477348123"

The report covers the work the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has done on its "Project Catalyst," which aims to encourage the development of innovative consumer financial products that meet regulatory requirements. The upbeat report comes partly in response to requests from many fintech firms to regulators, particularly the CFPB, for clearer directions on what products they can launch without running afoul of regulations.

"The fraud and illegal conduct here is straightforward," said Dugan Bliss, of the SEC's division of enforcement, during opening arguments in a federal courthouse in Manhattan.

J.P. Morgan said it would cease settling trades in the $13 trillion U.S. Treasury market in July, leaving Bank of New York Mellon the sole provider. J.P. Morgan gave a roughly two-year timeline for clients to migrate across and Bank of New York is signaling its intent to take on as many of those firms as it can, according to people familiar with the matter.

TelexFree Founder James Merrill Pleads Guilty to Fraud Charges

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/telexfree-founder-james-merrill-pleads-guilty-to-fraud-charges-1477343588" the meteoric rise of TelexFree LLC before it was shut down by federal authorities, has pleaded guilty to criminal fraud charges for his role in running a multibillion-dollar pyramid scheme at the company.

Mr. Merrill pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud conspiracy and eight counts of wire fraud in a deal that will limit his sentencing to no more than 10 years in prison, according to a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Boston. Court papers show that if he had been convicted at trial, he could have faced up to 20 years in prison.

ANALYSIS
Private pressures; FT BIG READ: SILICON VALLEY

Investors seeking a return, employees who want to cash in and a need to fund deals are adding to the demand for big name technology companies to launch IPOs after years of defending their private status. By Tom Braithwaite

Walter Price cannot get enough technology stocks. "I was looking at the Bloomberg terminal and all the public tech companies that have disappeared," says Mr Price, who manages $4bn of equities for Allianz Global Investors. "It would be nice to have some more of them," he adds longingly.

The hollowing out of the public markets has reduced US listed companies from more than 8,000 in 1996 to about 4,300 today. In tech, private buyouts, including Dell in 2013, and acquisitions, such as Microsoft's takeover of LinkedIn this year, are shrinking the pool.

Most glaring, though, is the lack of new entrants. There have been only 14 tech initial public offerings this year compared with 371 in 1999 at the height of the bubble , and an annual average of 49 since 1980. The reason is simple: world changers like Uber and Airbnb - so-called unicorns valued at more than $1bn - have elected to stay private .

Several years into this tech boom, however, the IPO drought shows signs of breaking. The pressure from investors and employees to cash in is mounting; the need for a higher profile or more liquid stock to fund acquisitions is becoming more acute; it is harder to raise money privately; and there is pent-up demand from public market investors like Mr Price. The unicorns are finally trotting towards IPOs.

Jim Goodnight thinks they must be mad. In 1999, the founder of Sas Institute, a North Carolina-based data analytics company, almost succumbed to dotcom fever.

"There was a lot of pressure internally from some of the senior management that we ought to go public," says Mr Goodnight. But the bursting of the bubble intervened and Sas prospered in private hands: it now has annual revenues of more than $3bn. As he watches his public peers getting bogged down in regulation and facing pressure from their outside investors, Mr Goodnight concludes: "Why would you want to go public and ruin your life?"

Jack Dangermond agrees. Over nearly 50 years he has built Esri into a mapping software company with $1bn in revenues. "You don't have to go public to succeed and that story is not told to young entrepreneurs," he says. "You don't have to buy shoes with tassels on them and go into debt and use a template in PowerPoint on how to do a start-up."

Even some who make a living from equity offerings appreciate the sentiment. John Kolz, in charge of tech IPOs at Credit Suisse, says he asks company founders a similar question to that of Mr Goodnight: "'Why the hell would you ever want to go public?' I go on to say there are a lot of good reasons but unless you can name them I will be the first to tell you to stay private."

'Only so many investors'

Raising capital used to be the obvious reason: the company sells new shares to the public to expand the business at a time when it is producing relatively little cash flow. But the flood of money into private companies - $261bn since 2010, according to PwC MoneyTree - has alleviated that pressure.

Before Google went public in 2004, it had raised just $36m privately. Uber has raised almost 100 times that amount in one funding round from a single investor - the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia - and overall, the ride-hailing company has raised $15bn in debt and equity, an unimaginable amount for previous generations of entrepreneurs.

This year, however, private fundraising in the tech sector has slowed, with 355 late-stage deals in the third quarter, according to the National Venture Capital Association, the lowest number in any quarter for six years. Smaller unicorns are viewed more sceptically, while even the biggest and best have fewer options.

"There's only so many investors to go to see," says one banker covering the tech sector. "The number of people who have no exposure to Uber and are large and [invest in] privates is a dwindling universe."

For some companies, the chance to raise money at an IPO still looks attractive. Evernote, the productivity app, has not raised money privately for two years and, though it now generates cash, has limited resources.

An IPO, says chief executive Chris O'Neill, might allow funds to be directed at new projects. "I would love to invest a pretty significant amount of money in China," he says. But in the current state: "It's hard for that [China-specific proposal] to compete with things that have [more of] a global impact."

Mr O'Neill is not certain if Evernote will launch an IPO - ultimately his investors and their thirst for liquidity will determine that.

But for tech companies that enjoy the private life, there may come a point when investors expect to be able to cash in on their investments. Venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Benchmark and Sequoia Capital have 10-year funds and can afford to wait. Shorter-term investors are becoming impatient. A VC fund expects to earn a big multiple on its invested cash; private equity firms might care more for the internal rate of return, which is boosted by a swifter exit.

"I do think there is a class of investor who invests more on an IRR basis, who does not have a decade-long horizon and is looking for an exit," says Bryan Schreier, a partner at Sequoia.

One banker who works with private investors says: "Family offices and wealthy individuals may not have appreciated the risks they were taking and they are getting itchy."

Release valve

The patience of even venture capital funds is being tested when companies like Dropbox and Spotify celebrate their 10th birthdays and remain private.

"Nobody's going to cry for the venture capital community," says Scott Kupor, managing partner at Andreessen Horowitz. "But at some point VCs will need to be able to provide liquidity to their limited partners to continue investing in new companies."

An obvious fix is for investors to buy and sell each others' stakes - in the same way that private equity firms, such as Blackstone and KKR, have become comfortable buying mature companies from each other - but that is frowned upon in Silicon Valley. An early angel investor might be permitted to sell their stake but for VC funds it would be seen as a terrible lack of confidence to follow suit.

Something has to give, says Mr Kupor. "Either companies start to go public on a reasonable timeframe or people do start to say, 'Look, let's create a fully formed secondary market.'".

If long-term institutional investors could do with cash, so too could lower-level employees who chafe at living in the San Francisco Bay Area, one of the most expensive housing markets in the world. They might have significant paper wealth in shares but modest salaries. Secondary share markets have developed and act as a release valve.

Companies typically allow staff to sell a portion of their vested stock periodically - typically 10-20 per cent - during a funding round. Institutional investors, however, bridle at senior executives wanting to take out large amounts. Says one venture capitalist: "I'm OK with you taking $1m, $2m, because it's got bloody awful to live here and you need that to go buy a house. When you take $10m, even though you have 90 per cent of your shares, I worry that it gets to a 'you win, I lose' scenario."

For rank-and-file employees, as the gaps between funding rounds lengthen, the secondary sales become less common and the pressure for an IPO, which would allow employees to finally get some cash for their stock at a market price, is building.

Public pressures

After the last major tech boom in 2000 the main driver of IPOs had nothing to do with money. A rule from the Securities and Exchange Commission required private companies with more than 500 shareholders to publish accounts, at which point a number of companies, including Google, decided they may as well go public. Its 2004 IPO filing said: "Our growth has reduced some of the advantages of private ownership." It also pushed Facebook towards its IPO in 2012, but that same year Congress passed the Jumpstart Our Business Startups or JOBS Act, which raised the bar from 500 to 2,000 shareholders and excluded employees from the tally.

Another non-financial impetus has weakened too: the razzmatazz guaranteed by an IPO often raised a company's profile, but the likes of Airbnb and Uber have created strong brands without going public. It is questionable that they will generate much new business on the back of IPO marketing or change the opinions of those investors deterred by their multiple legal battles.

However, for groups whose business is selling to the government, or other companies, the imprimatur of being public and having regularly audited accounts still matters.

"Silicon Valley is a black box," says Aaron Levie, chief executive of Box, the cloud storage company that went public in January 2015. He says going public ends that secrecy and reassures prospective partners. "Customers want to make sure you're building a durable, viable company."

A final reason has stayed fairly constant: acquisitions. As initial products mature, tech companies need to find new growth, which is sometimes easier to buy. Even the flushest unicorn, however, lacks billions of dollars for big purchases. It could attempt to use its own private stock but battle-scarred investors say that is difficult.

"It's just much harder," says Mr Kupor of Andreessen Horowitz. "Because 90 per cent of the negotiation is not just 'I have to figure out what you're worth', but 'you have to figure out if I'm worth what I say I'm worth'."

It is much easier when there is a publicly traded currency to use, as Facebook did, buying Instagram for $1bn on the cusp of its IPO in 2012 and then WhatsApp for more than $19bn in 2014.

Waiting game

It is possible to keep extending the private lives of US tech companies, but the betting is that the biggest names are approaching a tipping point. Snap - parent of messaging app Snapchat - has hired bankers in preparation for a $25bn IPO next year. Jockeying between bankers is well under way for the Uber IPO that will dwarf the rest amid a growing expectation that in 2017 and 2018 a number of the big companies will list .

The wait might not be all bad. Mr Levie of Box notes that five years ago lower quality companies used to opt for an IPO, poisoning sentiment about the broader venture-backed ecosystem. "The counter is you get more Zyngas and Groupons [whose stocks boomed and busted as business model weaknesses became apparent].Because when you are not ready to go public, taking that decision is far more corrosive for the Valley."

Colin Stewart, head of technology capital markets at Morgan Stanley, says by the time the likes of Uber come to market: "The concentration of quality will be among the highest - companies will be bigger, more scaled and either close to profitability or profitable."

At the same time, the idea that the public markets are a hostile place is overdone. Tesla Motors, Netflix and Amazon boast sky-high valuations despite meagre profits. Most popular tech companies can command premium voting rights for their founders, which shield them against unwanted takeovers or activist attention.

Some will shy away from an IPO because they are not offering the sort of growth story that public market investors demand and opt for other transactions like a private sale.

A Palo Alto-based managing director at one of the biggest global private equity groups claims to have been approached about acquiring three separate unicorns.

There also remains a handful of implacable holdouts. Asked whether he still gets investment bankers knocking on his door, Mr Goodnight of Sas Institute thinks for a moment. "We get a stray letter once in a while, saying: 'I have a client who wants to invest in you'," he says in his Carolinian drawl. "We have a special file for that. It's called the trash can."

Intel Capital announced a dozen new investments totaling $38 million in connected devices and robotics, areas the corporate venture arm's executives have in the past deemed particularly strategic to Intel's business.

The deals cited on Monday were Intel Capital's first since it changed its leadership and considered selling off part of its expansive venture capital portfolio, in a deal that could have been worth as much as $1 billion.

President Wendell Brooks took over the portfolio in January following Arvind Sodhani's retirement as its president of 35 years. Mr. Brooks considered selling off stakes in companies not directly strategic to Intel's core chips business. In May Mr. Brooks said the firm wouldn't sell off its portfolio, which includes investments in industries as diverse as mobile gaming, e-commerce and social networking in addition to areas seen as strategic to Intel's business.

The focus on connected devices suggests that Intel Capital will focus on industries strategic to the parent company's core business under Mr. Brooks's leadership.

In the autonomous machines sector, Intel Capital invested in computer vision navigation startup Chronocam and robotics startups Embodied and Perrone Robotics. Intel's fleet of Internet-of-Things investments included smart cities developer Eazytec, IoT connectivity startup Grand Chip Microelectronics, and enterprise application security system StealthMine.

Among others are K4Connect, an IoT system for senior living homes, and CubeWorks, a startup making a low-power computer the size of a grain of rice.

Intel Capital also announced investments in business-data analytics platform Paxata and Kinduct, a startup providing analytics for health and wellness.

The list of new investments included entertainment-related startups as well. Intel Capital said it is backing virtual-reality headphones maker Dysonics, as well as InContext Solutions, which provides virtual-reality products for retail.

The data analysis company Paxata Inc. has raised $33.5 million in additional funding led by Intel Capital. 

The round, classified as a C-1, is the fourth institutional round of funding for the Redwood City, Calif.-based company. Microsoft Ventures participated along with Cisco Investments, Deutsche Telekom Capital Partners and AirTree Ventures. 

Existing investors who returned for this round were Singapore-based EDBI and In-Q-Tel Inc., the Central Intelligence Agency's venture arm, as well as Accel Partners. 

Paxata Chief Executive Prakash Nanduri said the company provides a service he calls data preparation, which gives business people access to the data they need to gain insights and drive sales. 

He said Intel Corp. is a Paxata customer, adding that the Intel Capital investment would allow the company to invest more in machine learning technology. "http://www.wsj.com/articles/intel-capital-unveils-12-investments-under-new-leadership-1477341117" more than $38 million in other investments. 

Mr. Nanduri said with Microsoft Ventures' investment, the companies will become strategic partners. Microsoft isn't currently a Paxata customer, he said. 

Though the company didn't disclose valuation, Mr. Nanduri said it was an up round, and that the company's share price has gone up in every round of fundraising. He said the company had taken a more disciplined approach and had a "positive experience" raising funding.

Head of Consumer Finance Agency Speaks Out on Fintech; Richard Cordray addressed large payments conference

By Rachel Witkowski and Peter Rudegeair

The Wall Street Journal Online

LAS VEGAS The U.S.'s lead federal consumer finance regulator issued a warning Sunday to banks that consumers should be able to determine for themselves what to do with the financial data that underlies their accounts.

"Let me state the matter as clearly as I can here: We believe consumers should be able to access this information and give their permission for third-party companies to access this information as well," said Richard Cordray at Money 20/20, one of the largest payments conferences in the nation.

The remarks were the first time Mr. Cordray, the director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, publicly addressed the issue since The Wall Street Journal reported last fall that several large banks temporarily curtailed the flow of data from customer accounts to websites that help people manage their personal finances, such as Intuit Inc.'s Mint. The outages, from banks including J.P. Morgan Chase & Co, Wells Fargo & Co. and Bank of America Corp., were motivated by banks' desire to keep data requests from so-called aggregators like Mint from overwhelming their servers and ensure account information was being properly safeguarded.

"We're gravely concerned by reports that some financial institutions are looking for ways to limit or even shut off access to financial data rather than exploring ways to make sure that such access, once granted, is safe and secure," he said.

The remarks were part of a broader speech in which Mr. Cordray noted the importance of regulators embracing new fintech products that provide greater credit access to consumers who didn't previously have access to traditional banking. The CFPB plans to release a report Monday on its so-called "Project Catalyst" which is meant to help firms test consumer financial products under the oversight of the bureau. The agency launched a pilot with American Express Co. in late 2014 related to prepaid cards. The push comes at a time when the U.K., Singapore and Hong Kong have launched expansive pilots allowing firms to test fintech products on consumers.

Mr. Cordray noted that the CFPB was keenly interested in products that would help consumers better manage their finances and build "rainy day" funds, as well as how to use artificial intelligence to seek out and analyze consumer data.

"For example, and this is an important example, we met with a number of innovators to see if they can expand access to credit by looking to alternative forms of data and newer methods such as machine-learning of analyzing the data to assess credit worthiness," Mr. Cordray said. "We want to understand how we can influence and channel this [fintech] wave in positive directions and I believe our goals are the same: to put consumers first and improve their lives."

Mr. Cordray's remarks were largely encouraging to fintech firms who have been asking for direction from regulators, and particularly the CFPB, since officials have been careful not to state much publicly on fintech beyond Project Catalyst until now.

"This is the CFPB saying the barriers to innovation should be lowered," said Zach Perret, chief executive of Plaid, a startup that makes software enabling other fintech firms to access their customers' bank-account information. "It really opens the discussion between financial innovators, or innovators in general, and the government."

Wealth Management (A Special Report) --- Europe's Property Investors Look Beyond London: As some big markets cool, there are good opportunities in smaller economies

The European commercial real-estate market is shifting, with the hottest cities cooling off as investors' interest in other locations grows.

Real-estate markets throughout Europe saw investors pile in following the 2008 financial crisis. With the European Central Bank and the Bank of England pushing interest rates to historic lows, real-estate returns have become increasingly attractive to investors frustrated by tiny yields in the bond market. The cheap money the central banks were pumping into their economies also fueled the demand for property.

London was a favorite of investors, along with Paris and Germany's biggest cities. But after years of strong demand pushing up property values in these hot spots, returns are shrinking and investors are pulling back. "Most prime markets in Europe are pretty fully priced.

There's no easy money around" in them, says Walter Boettcher, director of research at property broker Colliers International.

Overall, European commercial property investment was 43.7 billion euros ($47.5 billion) in the first nine months of this year, down 30% from the same period in 2015, according to real-estate research firm Real Capital Analytics. The U.K. led the decline, partly because of caution among investors both before and after Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Germany and France also saw significant declines.

But investment in some countries, including Spain, Poland, the Netherlands and Sweden, is up from last year's levels.

Investment in commercial property dropped 47% in the U.K., 35% in Germany and 32% in France. Investment increased 20% in Poland, 9% in the Netherlands and Sweden, and 6% in Spain.

Big-ticket properties and portfolios of real-estate holdings "are still coming onto the market" in the smaller economies, which also include Austria and Ireland, says Marcus Lemli, head of European investment at real-estate broker Savills PLC. Such opportunities have become rarer in the U.K., Germany and France, he says.

Investors started pulling back from London well ahead of the EU referendum in June, due to caution over the outcome but also because property had become too expensive in the eyes of many of them. Property prices in London were among the first to start rising again after significant losses during the financial crisis; now they're the first to start falling.

In the first half of this year, offices in central London were the only property sector in Europe where prices didn't rise, holding steady, according to Real Capital Analytics. In the months since the Brexit vote, limited property trading in London has masked the extent of the drop in commercial real-estate values since then, brokers say, but they estimate the decline at 5% to 10%.

Still, the drop so far is less than some experts had feared. Brokers say the market is being supported by demand from foreign investors who are taking advantage of the recent steep fall in the value of the pound.

Family offices from Asia and the Mideast have been at the forefront of this investment, says Richard Divall, head of cross-border capital markets at Colliers. Institutional investment "has been quieter," he says.

International investors were behind 78% of the GBP 2.2 billion ($2.7 billion) of commercial property sales in London between July and September, according to Savills.

"London can still offer long-term value," says Richard Gwilliam, head of property research at London-based M&G Real Estate. But many investors are looking elsewhere, including other U.K. cities like Birmingham or Manchester, or other countries that were slower to recover from the 2008 financial crisis and the subsequent euro crisis, he says.

For instance, Spain and Portugal were among the countries that suffered the most during the euro crisis, Mr. Gwilliam says. But now, with rents rising and their economies doing better, there are more solid opportunities in Madrid, Barcelona and Lisbon, he says. "There's a rebound element to it."

There are still concerns throughout Europe. Brexit is part of a politically volatile environment across the continent. European economic growth remains sluggish. Some investors are worried that strong demand stemming from low interest rates is inflating bubbles in property markets.

But for now, at least, those low interest rates continue to draw investors to European real estate, says Neil Blake, head of research for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at real-estate broker CBRE Group.

With the European Central Bank expected to keep interest rates low, "there's a search for yield and investors are willing to look further afield," he says. "I can't see how that's going to change for a while."

Silicon Valley: Under pressure to float

Walter Price cannot get enough "https://www.ft.com/companies/technology" stocks.  I was looking at the Bloomberg terminal and all the public tech companies that have disappeared,  says Mr Price, who manages $4bn of equities for Allianz Global Investors.  It would be nice to have some more of them,  he adds longingly.

The hollowing out of the public markets has reduced US listed companies from more than 8,000 in 1996 to about 4,300 today. In tech, private buyouts, including Dell in 2013, and acquisitions, such as Microsoft s takeover of LinkedIn this year, are shrinking the pool.

Most glaring, though, is the lack of new entrants. There have been only 14 tech initial public offerings this year compared with 371 in 1999 at the height of the bubble, and an annual average of 49 since 1980. The reason is simple: world changers like Uber and Airbnb   so-called unicorns valued at more than $1bn   have elected to stay private.

Several years into this tech boom, however, the IPO drought shows signs of breaking. The pressure from investors and employees to cash in is mounting; the need for a higher profile or more liquid stock to fund acquisitions is becoming more acute; it is harder to raise money privately; and there is pent-up demand from public market investors like Mr Price. The unicorns are finally trotting towards IPOs.

Jim Goodnight thinks they must be mad. In 1999, the founder of Sas Institute, a North Carolina-based data analytics company, almost succumbed to dotcom fever.

 There was a lot of pressure internally from some of the senior management that we ought to go public,  says Mr Goodnight. But the bursting of the bubble intervened and Sas prospered in private hands: it now has annual revenues of more than $3bn. As he watches his public peers getting bogged down in regulation and facing pressure from their outside investors, Mr Goodnight concludes:  Why would you want to go public and ruin your life? 

Jack Dangermond agrees. Over nearly 50 years he has built Esri into a mapping software company with $1bn in revenues.  You don t have to go public to succeed and that story is not told to young entrepreneurs,  he says.  You don t have to buy shoes with tassels on them and go into debt and use a template in PowerPoint on how to do a start-up. 

Even some who make a living from equity offerings appreciate the sentiment. John Kolz, in charge of tech IPOs at Credit Suisse, says he asks company founders a similar question to that of Mr Goodnight:   Why the hell would you ever want to go public?  I go on to say there are a lot of good reasons but unless you can name them I will be the first to tell you to stay private. 

 Only so many investors 

Raising capital used to be the obvious reason: the company sells new shares to the public to expand the business at a time when it is producing relatively little cash flow. But the flood of money into private companies   $261bn since 2010, according to PwC MoneyTree   has alleviated that pressure.

Before Google went public in 2004, it had raised just $36m privately. Uber has raised almost 100 times that amount in one funding round from a single investor   the sovereign wealth fund of Saudi Arabia   and overall, the ride-hailing company has raised $15bn in debt and equity, an unimaginable amount for previous generations of entrepreneurs.

This year, however, private fundraising in the tech sector has slowed, with 355 late-stage deals in the third quarter, according to the National Venture Capital Association, the lowest number in any quarter for six years. Smaller unicorns are viewed more sceptically, while even the biggest and best have fewer options.

 There s only so many investors to go to see,  says one banker covering the tech sector.  The number of people who have no exposure to Uber and are large and [invest in] privates is a dwindling universe. 

For some companies, the chance to raise money at an IPO still looks attractive. Evernote, the productivity app, has not raised money privately for two years and, though it now generates cash, has limited resources.

An IPO, says chief executive Chris O Neill, might allow funds to be directed at new projects.  I would love to invest a pretty significant amount of money in China,  he says. But in the current state:  It s hard for that [China-specific proposal] to compete with things that have [more of] a global impact. 

Mr O Neill is not certain if Evernote will launch an IPO   ultimately his investors and their thirst for liquidity will determine that.

But for tech companies that enjoy the private life, there may come a point when investors expect to be able to cash in on their investments. Venture capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz, Benchmark and Sequoia Capital have 10-year funds and can afford to wait. Shorter-term investors are becoming impatient. A VC fund expects to earn a big multiple on its invested cash; private equity firms might care more for the internal rate of return, which is boosted by a swifter exit.

 I do think there is a class of investor who invests more on an IRR basis, who does not have a decade-long horizon and is looking for an exit,  says Bryan Schreier, a partner at Sequoia.

One banker who works with private investors says:  Family offices and wealthy individuals may not have appreciated the risks they were taking and they are getting itchy. 

Release valve

The patience of even venture capital funds is being tested when companies like Dropbox and Spotify celebrate their 10th birthdays and remain private.

 Nobody s going to cry for the venture capital community,  says Scott Kupor, managing partner at Andreessen Horowitz.  But at some point VCs will need to be able to provide liquidity to their limited partners to continue investing in new companies. 

An obvious fix is for investors to buy and sell each others  stakes   in the same way that private equity firms, such as Blackstone and KKR, have become comfortable buying mature companies from each other   but that is frowned upon in Silicon Valley. An early angel investor might be permitted to sell their stake but for VC funds it would be seen as a terrible lack of confidence to follow suit.

Something has to give, says Mr Kupor.  Either companies start to go public on a reasonable timeframe or people do start to say,  Look, let s create a fully formed secondary market.  .

If long-term institutional investors could do with cash, so too could lower-level employees who chafe at living in the San Francisco Bay Area, one of the most expensive housing markets in the world. They might have significant paper wealth in shares but modest salaries. Secondary share markets have developed and act as a release valve.

Companies typically allow staff to sell a portion of their vested stock periodically   typically 10-20 per cent   during a funding round. Institutional investors, however, bridle at senior executives wanting to take out large amounts. Says one venture capitalist:  I m OK with you taking $1m, $2m, because it s got bloody awful to live here and you need that to go buy a house. When you take $10m, even though you have 90 per cent of your shares, I worry that it gets to a  you win, I lose  scenario. 

For rank-and-file employees, as the gaps between funding rounds lengthen, the secondary sales become less common and the pressure for an IPO, which would allow employees to finally get some cash for their stock at a market price, is building.

Public pressures

After the last major tech boom in 2000 the main driver of IPOs had nothing to do with money. A rule from the Securities and Exchange Commission required private companies with more than 500 shareholders to publish accounts, at which point a number of companies, including Google, decided they may as well go public. Its 2004 IPO filing said:  Our growth has reduced some of the advantages of private ownership.  It also pushed Facebook towards its IPO in 2012, but that same year Congress passed the Jumpstart Our Business Startups or JOBS Act, which raised the bar from 500 to 2,000 shareholders and excluded employees from the tally.

Another non-financial impetus has weakened too: the razzmatazz guaranteed by an IPO often raised a company s profile, but the likes of Airbnb and Uber have created strong brands without going public. It is questionable that they will generate much new business on the back of IPO marketing or change the opinions of those investors deterred by their multiple legal battles.

However, for groups whose business is selling to the government, or other companies, the imprimatur of being public and having regularly audited accounts still matters.

 Silicon Valley is a black box,  says Aaron Levie, chief executive of Box, the cloud storage company that went public in January 2015. He says going public ends that secrecy and reassures prospective partners.  Customers want to make sure you re building a durable, viable company. 

A final reason has stayed fairly constant: acquisitions. As initial products mature, tech companies need to find new growth, which is sometimes easier to buy. Even the flushest unicorn, however, lacks billions of dollars for big purchases. It could attempt to use its own private stock but battle-scarred investors say that is difficult.

 It s just much harder,  says Mr Kupor of Andreessen Horowitz.  Because 90 per cent of the negotiation is not just  I have to figure out what you re worth , but  you have to figure out if I m worth what I say I m worth . 

It is much easier when there is a publicly traded currency to use, as Facebook did, buying Instagram for $1bn on the cusp of its IPO in 2012 and then WhatsApp for more than $19bn in 2014.

Waiting game

It is possible to keep extending the private lives of US tech companies, but the betting is that the biggest names are approaching a tipping point. Snap   parent of messaging app Snapchat   has hired bankers in preparation for a $25bn IPO next year. Jockeying between bankers is well under way for the Uber IPO that will dwarf the rest amid a growing expectation that in 2017 and 2018 a number of the big companies will list.

The wait might not be all bad. Mr Levie of Box notes that five years ago lower quality companies used to opt for an IPO, poisoning sentiment about the broader venture-backed ecosystem.  The counter is you get more Zyngas and Groupons [whose stocks boomed and busted as business model weaknesses became apparent]. Because when you are not ready to go public, taking that decision is far more corrosive for the Valley. 

Colin Stewart, head of technology capital markets at Morgan Stanley, says by the time the likes of Uber come to market:  The concentration of quality will be among the highest   companies will be bigger, more scaled and either close to profitability or profitable. 

At the same time, the idea that the public markets are a hostile place is overdone. Tesla Motors, Netflix and Amazon boast sky-high valuations despite meagre profits. Most popular tech companies can command premium voting rights for their founders, which shield them against unwanted takeovers or activist attention.

Some will shy away from an IPO because they are not offering the sort of growth story that public market investors demand and opt for other transactions like a private sale.

A Palo Alto-based managing director at one of the biggest global private equity groups claims to have been approached about acquiring three separate unicorns.

There also remains a handful of implacable holdouts. Asked whether he still gets investment bankers knocking on his door, Mr Goodnight of Sas Institute thinks for a moment.  We get a stray letter once in a while, saying:  I have a client who wants to invest in you ,  he says in his Carolinian drawl.  We have a special file for that. It s called the trash can. 

***

Snap

The operator of messaging app Snapchat has hired banks led by Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs in preparation for an IPO that could take place as early as the first half of next year, with an estimated valuation of more than $25bn. Last private valuation: $18bn

Uber

The ride-hailing app has said it wants to stay private as long as possible but concedes that an IPO will occur in the next few years. Banks are trying to cozy up to the company by providing debt financing and employee stock plans. Last private valuation: $68bn

Spotify

The Swedish streaming music service is expected to go public in 2017. A debt financing deal this year included a provision giving lenders a bigger cut of equity the longer an IPO was delayed. Last private valuation: $8.5bn

Dropbox

The online file storage service has struggled to develop new products. Growth will be needed to attract investors at an IPO. Last private valuation: $10bn

Palantir

Established 12 years ago, the data mining company is old by the standards of today s unicorns. A need for secrecy given its relationship with the CIA is said to have impeded an IPO, but restless employees and investors might make it more likely. Last private valuation: $20bn

Airbnb

The room sharing site is one of the last to raise a big funding round, allowing it to defer an IPO until probably 2018 at the earliest. It also needs more certainty over legal threats. Last private valuation: $30bn

Presidential Debates Put Financial Regulation on Back Burner

After a primary season flowing with references to Glass-Steagall, Dodd-Frank and breaking up big banks, the tap ran dry when it came time for the presidential debates.

There was "http://www.wsj.com/graphics/elections/2016/election16-debate-final/#mentioned" of financial-regulatory issues in the three debates between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump , or in the vice-presidential debate no discussion of bailouts, taxing hedge funds, or the unauthorized accounts scandal at Wells Fargo & Co .

During the Democratic primary debates, Sen. Bernie Sanders was eager to discuss his ideas for Wall Street and to knock Mrs. Clinton for what he perceived to be her shortcomings in articulating a progressive vision for financial regulation. He called for reinstating Glass-Steagall, a Depression-era law repealed in 1999 that had restricted commercial banks from engaging in investment activities, and often repeated the mantra that if a bank is too big to fail, it is too big to exist.

Mrs. Clinton, by contrast, defended her regulatory plans and said Glass-Steagall wouldn't have prevented the financial crisis. She "http://graphics.wsj.com/elections/2016/where-do-clinton-and-trump-stand-on-wall-street/" to systemic risk management that would take a long look at the growing shadow-banking sector.

On the Republican side, most candidates agreed with the basic premise that postcrisis regulations have gone too far and that Dodd-Frank, the landmark 2010 regulatory-overhaul law, must be repealed. But the campaign's populist tone led the party to include reinstating Glass-Steagall in its platform at the GOP convention in July.

Mr. Trump hasn't talked much about financial-regulatory matters. He made it clear that he supports the approach taken by Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas), the House Financial Services Committee chairman whose plan would drastically alter Dodd-Frank to focus on capital requirements for banks rather than more complex regulations. The two met briefly in New York in June after Mr. Hensarling publicly unveiled his legislation, the Financial Choice Act.

It's not as though Mr. Trump lacked opportunities to bring up financial policy. In the week leading up to the final debate, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/wikileaks-release-reveals-hillary-clintons-sympathy-for-wall-street-1476581312" what it said were transcripts of three closed-door speeches Mrs. Clinton gave to Goldman Sachs in 2013. While she defended Dodd-Frank, she also said that to blame Wall Street for the financial crisis was an "oversimplification," and she showed a general chumminess in her interactions with the firm's chief executive, Lloyd Blankfein .

But Mr. Trump has focused on the optics of those appearances rather than the financial policy implications. Last week, he made the extraordinary claim that "Hillary Clinton meets in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers, her special interest friends, and her donors." Many commentators likened the remark to "http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-plot-against-america-1476745874".

In a campaign driven largely by the personalities of the two major-party candidates, detailed policy proposals haven't gotten much time in the limelight. But in less than three weeks, policy will again take center-stage as one of these candidates begins to select a cabinet and set an agenda and the financial-services industry, among others, will be all ears.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Bank Legal Costs Cited as Drag on Economic Growth

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/boe-official-bank-legal-costs-since-2008-reach-275-billion-1476974749" and law-enforcement officials on financial misconduct may be constraining global growth, some officials warn.

Legal expenses are among the burdens weighing on banks, policy makers say. "The roughly $275 billion in legal costs for global banks since 2008 translates into more than $5 trillion of reduced lending capacity to the real economy," Minouche Shafik, a deputy governor of the Bank of England, told a New York conference of regulators and bankers Thursday. Other policy makers have expressed concern that strict crackdowns on banks' lapses in carrying out anti-money-laundering regulations have led banks to nearly cut off several emerging markets from the global financial system, damping their economies.

WSJ Pro: CFTC's Giancarlo: Traders Need Due Process When Regulators Seek Source Code

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/cftcs-giancarlo-traders-need-due-process-when-regulators-seek-source-code-1476982184"have access to the computer code that drives trading strategies without furnishing a subpoena, a Republican member of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said Thursday.

Christopher Giancarlo's remarks underscore the high-stakes political fight over the CFTC's efforts to update its regulations for the era of automated trading. The agency proposed a rule last year that would require traders to maintain their source code and provide it to regulators upon request. Mr. Giancarlo told an industry conference that regulators could even abuse their access to the data by routinely seeking it after market turmoil.

WSJ Pro: Japan Regulator to Push Banks Toward More Aggressive Lending

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/japan-regulator-urges-banks-to-take-on-more-lending-risks-1477040076" said Friday it would encourage banks to lend more aggressively to businesses even if they don't meet traditional credit criteria, the latest move to promote risk-taking and growth.

The Financial Services Agency, under commissioner Nobuchika Mori, has taken an unusual role for a regulator by cautioning against overly strict lending standards. In an interview earlier this year, Mr. Mori said regulators needed to pay more attention to economic growth and encourage bankers to look at new business models.

SEC Unveils Executive Pay Ratio Guidelines

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-unveils-executive-pay-ratio-guidelines-1476987334" issued its first guidelines for calculating pay ratios that compare executive compensation to that of the company's median employee.

Companies are required to report this information in their proxy, registration and information statements, as well as annual reports for the first fiscal year beginning January 1, 2017. The rule is mandated by the Dodd-Frank law and was adopted in August 2015.

Regulators Say First NBC Bank in  Troubled Condition'

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-say-first-nbc-bank-in-troubled-condition-1476989716". shares plunged after the New Orleans lender said regulators deemed it to be in "troubled condition" and restricted its ability to take on debt.

The disclosures are the latest in a series of mounting financial problems for the bank.

U.S. Treasury Official Encourages Borrowers to Shift From Libor

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-treasury-official-encourages-borrowers-to-shift-from-libor-1476984561?tesla=y"Thursday urged borrowers to move away from Libor, the benchmark interest rate at the heart of a multibillion-dollar manipulation scandal in recent years.

Libor, or the London interbank offered rate, is a rate based on what big banks charge each other for overnight loans.

Senators Press Wells Fargo on Whether or Not CEO Sloan Knew of Sales Tactics

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/senators-press-wells-fargo-on-whether-or-not-ceo-sloan-knew-of-sales-tactics-1476996024"problems continue to mount. In a letter Thursday to Wells Fargo's chairman, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) asked the directors whether they had sufficiently questioned Timothy Sloan about his knowledge of the bank's sales-tactics scandal what he knew and when he knew it before he was appointed the new chief executive officer.

The letter, co-written with Sen. Robert Menendez (D., N.J.), also asked whether Mr. Sloan's predecessor, John Stumpf , would receive any retirement benefits after abruptly leaving the bank earlier this month.

Finra Proposes Steps to Prevent Abuse of Senior Investors

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/finra-proposes-protections-for-seniors-against-exploitation-1476977937?tesla=y"organization said Thursday it has filed proposed rules with federal regulators to tackle financial exploitation of seniors, an early step by the industry to address a rapidly growing problem as the U.S. population ages.

The aim is to protect older investors from scams and financial abuse by strangers, family members and financial professionals a complex task that can require the intervention of financial advisers and bank officials that deal with older adult customers while protecting their privacy and dignity.

Prepaid Cards Play Bigger Role for  Unbanked' Households, Survey Finds

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/prepaid-cards-play-bigger-role-for-unbanked-households-survey-finds-1476972079?tesla=y"bank accounts are using prepaid cards for basic financial services, such as making purchases, receiving deposits and saving for the future, a government survey found.

Among U.S. households that have no access to the regular banking system, 27% reported using prepaid cards in the 12 months prior to June 2015, when the survey was taken, up from 22% in 2013. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . survey, released Thursday, found that 9.8% of all households reported using prepaid cards, up from 7.9% in 2013.

SEC Sharpens Focus on Registered Investment Advisers

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-sharpens-focus-on-registered-investment-advisers-1476971185?tesla=y"is stepping up its scrutiny of a fast-growing class of investment professionals and delegating more of its direct Wall Street oversight, the latest regulatory ripple stemming from last spring's tightening of retirement savings rules.

In response to a boom in the number of so-called registered investment advisers, or RIAs, the SEC has boosted by 20% the number of examiners assigned to monitoring wealth-management firms and investment companies.

Mr. Trump stepped up his payments to a data analytics firm called Cambridge Analytica, which is partly owned by hedge-fund executive Robert Mercer, one of the nominee's top donors, who has expanded his influence in the campaign in recent months.

Encouraging Pooled Retirement Plans

Roughly one-third of private-sector workers lack access to a workplace retirement savings plan. One of the primary reasons for that shortage is that smaller businesses are much less likely than larger businesses to offer retirement benefits, particularly because of the legal and fiduciary responsibilities employers must assume. "http://cdn.bipartisanpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/BPC-Economy-Pooled-Plans.pdf"by the Bipartisan Policy Center , small businesses would be more likely to join multi-business pooled retirement plans if the federal law governing employee benefits were tweaked to encourage them.

Newspaper Ad Woes Accelerate

By Suzanne Vranica and Jack Marshall

Newspapers are suffering an accelerating drop in print advertising, a market that already was under stress, forcing some publishers to consider significant cost cuts and dramatic changes to their print and digital products.

Global spending on newspaper print ads is expected to decline 8.7% to $52.6 billion in 2016, according to estimates from GroupM, an ad-buying firm. That would be the biggest drop since the recession, when world-wide spending plummeted 13.7% in 2009.

That decline is hitting every major publisher, increasing pressure on them to boost digital-revenue streams even faster to make up for lost revenue.

Many newspapers have trimmed costs to cope with the worse-than-expected revenue decline. New York Times Co. and Wall Street Journal-owner News Corp, likely have further head-count reductions on the way, and the Guardian and the U.K.'s Daily Mail recently eliminated jobs.

Analysts such as Jefferies & Co. have pared back their third-quarter estimates for publishers including the Times and Gannett Co.

"We operate in a time of rapidly changing market conditions, especially in the world of print advertising," Gerard Baker, editor in chief of The Wall Street Journal, wrote Wednesday in a memo to employees.

In light of the steep downturn, the Journal this week announced a coming revamp of its print editions that will include the consolidation of sections and other cost reductions, moves designed to make the print newspaper more sustainable for the long haul and help accelerate the newsroom's digital transformation.

Meanwhile, the Times has been working on a strategy to significantly boost digital revenue by 2020, including shifting more resources into digital initiatives and looking at ways to revamp operations such as its Metro section.

"It's definitely been a hard year for print in the first half," said Meredith Kopit Levien, chief revenue officer at the New York Times.

Newspapers have been in a race against time to grow their digital revenues to make up for the collapse of print advertising. They have made strides, but face challenges on that front, including the dominance of Facebook and Google in the digital market and difficulty making money on mobile products.

During the past decade, marketers have fled newspapers for a variety of reasons, including declining circulation, aging readership and the need to fund their digital initiatives.

Other factors more recently have come into play -- the growing use of data and analytics in the media-planning process -- among them.

Moreover, advertisers aggressively are pushing into online video, and marketers in sectors such as retail, financial services and telecommunications are reducing print spending.

The newspaper print-ad outlook is a worrisome prediction given that the overall global ad market is expected to grow 4% this year to $529.1 billion, with a 14% acceleration in digital-ad spending, according to GroupM.

Newspapers, however, aren't alone in seeing ad dollars dry up. Global magazine ad spending also is expected to decline 2.9% this year, estimates GroupM.

To help bolster digital dollars, many publishers slowly are abandoning low-rent display ads and pushing into potentially more lucrative ad offerings such as native ads, video ads and virtual reality. But so far, digital ad revenues aren't growing fast enough to offset declines in print, particularly because ads in newspapers remain relatively expensive.

Although prices vary widely, the average CPM, which is the cost for reaching a thousand people, for a full-page ad in a national newspaper is roughly $100. Meanwhile, the average CPM for a broadcast TV ad in prime time that reaches 25- to 54-year-olds is roughly $37, according to several ad buyers.

That means that when an advertiser weighs the performance of print ads against their cost, print doesn't appear as efficient as other media when ranking return on investment, said David Murphy, chief executive officer of Novus Media, an ad-buying firm owned by ad giant Omnicom Group Inc.

Using data and analytics in the media-planning process "is being leveraged by more and more national advertisers and retailers, and that is a recent phenomenon," Mr. Murphy said.

Jefferies analyst John Janedis has forecast an even more difficult calendar third quarter. Last month he lowered his estimates for the New York Times, predicting a 17% drop in print-ad sales, worse than his earlier projection of 14%.

For Gannett and News Corp, he estimates combined print and digital ad revenues will decline 12.5% and 7%, respectively. The companies declined to comment.

It isn't alone. The New York Times said further downsizing is expected in the newsroom early next year. Emphasizing the importance of digital, the Times this week named A.G. Sulzberger -- who has focused on the newsroom's digital transformation -- as deputy publisher, putting him in line to become the next publisher.

"Newspapers are a tough place to be right now," said Stephen Daintith, chief financial officer of Daily Mail & General Trust. "The decline in the U.K. has been even more severe over the last 12 months."

Cybersecurity Sector Has Limits

Companies no longer are spending blindly on cybersecurity. Investors will have to start getting pickier as well.

For a time, money flowed easily to practically any company that came up with a new way to safeguard corporate networks. Venture capitalists invested nearly $3.8 billion in cybersecurity startups last year, up 69% from the year before, according to CB Insights. And established players also were doing well. A group of cybersecurity companies tracked by UBS improved revenue by an average of 35% last year.

But CB Insights says about $845 million of venture-capital investments went to cybersecurity companies in the third quarter, down 24% from a year earlier. Brent Thill of UBS expects those companies tracked by his firm to average growth of just 20% this year and 17% next year.

A recent warning by Fortinet suggests that forthcoming third-quarter reports will show more deceleration. The company, which specializes in firewalls and associated software, lowered its third-quarter forecast last week, as Chief Executive Ken Xie cited a mix of internal issues. He also noted that corporate customers were "buying with less urgency than last year."

It should be noted that security remains a priority for corporate executives. According to a recent survey by Citigroup, 79% of chief information officers plan to increase their spending on network security over the next 12 months, compared with 77% at the last survey. A similar survey by Morgan Stanley found that security software was the priority for CIOs, above analytics and cloud computing.

However, not all will benefit equally. Analysts say companies focused on firewalls and other hardware may see more price competition. Those that sell security as a service may benefit from a growing corporate preference for cloud-based offerings. But shifting to a service model tends to suppress near-term revenue as more is deferred to future periods. Palo Alto Networks, one of Wall Street's most favored names in security, is down 15% this year, as growth logged in its past two quarterly reports has reflected that shift.

One hopeful sign is that depressed valuations may spur some needed consolidation. Software M&A is already on a tear, with 1,401 announced deals targeting U.S. firms year to date, according to Dealogic. That is up 9% from a year earlier.

The Hack Cyber Security ETF by PureFunds is up less than 1% this year compared with a 8% gain for the S&P 500 Software & Services group. About one-third of the stocks in the Hack fund are down by double-digits for the year. For momentum-driven investors, cybersecurity has hardly been a lock.

The Saudis' Mammoth Bond Is a Defining Deal for 2016

Want a single instrument that wraps together nearly every big political, financial and economic theme in today's world?

Saudi Arabia's mammoth $17.5 billion bond issue, marking its debut in international markets, is it.

The size of the deal is impressive but actually the least important thing about it. Big bond deals tend to build a momentum of their own.

But it does speak to the search for yield. The $6.5 billion 30-year portion of Saudi Arabia's bond is set to pay 2.1 percentage points more in yield than a comparable U.S. Treasury, or around 4.6%.

That is a sizable pickup in a world where developed-market bond yields are on the floor or in negative territory.

That Saudi Arabia is doing the deal at all is a more telling factor: The oil bounty that has propelled the economy has run dry.

The 18-month-long rout in oil prices that started in 2014 sent the country hurtling from a budget surplus to a deficit in 2015 of 15.9% of gross domestic product. That is set to narrow to only 13% in 2016, according to the International Monetary Fund.

In 2013, government debt stood at just 2.2% of GDP, according to Moody's. By 2017, it is forecast to climb to 22.9%.

The level isn't a source of concern, but the swift change illustrates the country's stark reversal of fortunes.

In the near term, buyers of the bonds are betting largely on oil. Swings in the price are likely to have a direct impact on the perception of Saudi Arabia as a credit.

The recovery in oil prices, which stand close to their high of the year, has eased concerns about financial stability and helps explain some of the enthusiasm for the deal.

But further ahead, this is a bet on the ability and willingness of the country to transform itself while maintaining social and political stability.

In that, the 30-year bond is much punchier than the five- and 10-year tranches that accompany it both in terms of domestic politics but also the future of the Middle East as a region. Saudi Arabia has set out ambitious plans to diversify away from oil, but they will take years to come to fruition.

Bankers sometimes like to talk in grandiose terms about their deals. For once, the labels might be justified. The Saudi deal is truly a landmark; its performance over time will say a lot about how the world is changing.

Salesforce

Looks More

Grounded

For Salesforce.com, Twitter appears to have been an aberration. That is actually a bit comforting.

The Wall Street Journal reported leaked emails from Salesforce board member and former Secretary of State Colin Powell that show more than a dozen public companies Salesforce was considering as potential acquisition targets, as of mid-May. One was Demandware, which Salesforce bought in June for $2.8 billion.

Twitter was notably absent from the list. Salesforce reportedly began looking at the troubled social network last month, but it doesn't appear that Twitter was ever a serious part of its strategic plan. Salesforce shareholders recoiled at the idea anyway, sending the stock down 5% between the company's first reported interest and late last week, when it called off the effort.

But Salesforce was clearly in acquisition mode. And its wish list shows the company is opportunistic and more interested in playing close to home. CEO Marc Benioff spoke in his last earnings call about an "M&A window" created by a selloff in cloud and software stocks earlier in the year. The stocks of two companies highlighted in the emails ServiceNow and Tableau Software were down 20% and 50% for the year at the time.

Software valuations largely have rebounded, with the S&P 500 Software & Services Group up 9% since mid-May through Wednesday. So the same kind of bargains won't be as easy to come by. Still, it is nice to know that, when Salesforce puts its dreams to paper, most aren't likely to turn to nightmares.

-- Dan Gallagher

Overheard

Don't spend it all in one place. In fact, you had better not spend it at all.

U.S. Social Security recipients were told what sort of raise they will receive next year and, as expected, it isn't much. The average monthly pension check will go up by about $5 for the 60 million plus people who get them.

But around one-third of the 56 million people who get Medicare the health-insurance program for the elderly nearly all of whom also get Social Security, will see their premiums rise more.

Even for the remainder, who may still see a modest increase, deductibles are set to rise by an amount well above the boost to their checks.

It could be worse for today's senior citizens. According to a report earlier this year from Social Security trustees, those 49 or younger may never get what they are owed as the program will only be able to pay about three-quarters of projected benefits.

Andreessen Horowitz Leads $2M Seed Financing for Cardiogram

Cardiogram Inc. has secured $2 million on the promise that its app could help more people learn they have irregular heartbeats before they're hit by a stroke or some complication of the heart condition.

Andreessen Horowitz is leading the seed financing, which also included individuals such as Rock Health co-founder Halle Tecco and Color Genomics Inc.'s co-founders Elad Gil and Othman Laraki.

Atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat, can lead to a stroke or heart failure. About 2% of people younger than 65 and 9% of people aged 65 and older have atrial fibrillation, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Atrial fibrillation can cause symptoms such as weakness and fatigue. Some people have no noticeable symptoms.

Cardiogram expects the combination of its app and the Apple Watch to improve heart health. The app organizes heart-rate data collected by the Apple Watch. Users can see their heart rate chart on the Apple Watch and get more detailed data and see historical trends on their iPhone. A new feature of the Cardiogram app called Habits enables users to see how specific actions, such as exercise, affect heart-rate data.

Through a study called mRhythm, Cardiogram aims to find out if its app can detect atrial fibrillation. Cardiogram is combining data from more than 100,000 users who have downloaded the app with data from atrial fibrillation patients undergoing a treatment known as cardioversion.

By using that data, Cardiogram intends to teach its machine-learning algorithm to correctly distinguish between normal and abnormal heart rhythms.

Venture investment in products for the heart reached $563.4 million in the first half, according to market tracker Dow Jones VentureSource. That puts this year on track to exceed the $1.05 billion deployed in 2015.

Venture firms are also backing medical-technology startups with treatments for atrial fibrillation. They include VytronUS Inc., which disclosed a $49 million "http://www.wsj.com/articles/vytronus-raises-49m-series-c-for-atrial-fibrillation-treatment-1469804486" round in July.

Andreessen Horowitz General Partner Vijay Pande is joining the Cardiogram board as an observer.

Medallia, the Sequoia Capital darling valued at $1.3 billion last summer, has acquired Kampyle, a startup that makes software for measuring customer feedback. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.

Nine-year-old "http://www.kampyle.com/" specializes in software for businesses to survey people about their customer experience and to collect data on their activity. All of Kampyle's 25 employees will join Medallia, the Palo Alto, Calif.-based maker of customer experience management software with just over 1,000 employees.

Based in Israel, Kampyle raised a $1 million Series A led by Carmel Ventures in 2009. Its chief executive, Ori Soen, said the company has raised additional funding since then, including both debt and equity, but declined to provide details about the amount or the investors.

Kampyle's customers will be able to continue purchasing the product on a stand-alone basis or purchase it integrated with Medallia. Mr. Soen will become general manager of Medallia Digital.

Medallia has raised $255 million in equity from Sequoia Capital, said Medallia Chief Executive and co-founder Borge Hald. "We have raised more money from Sequoia than any company ever," he said.

WSJ Pro Conference: Volcker Resists Bank Breakups, Bair Opposes Risk-Weighting; See summaries of interviews with more than a dozen policy makers and experts at our conference in New York

Corrections & Amplifications:

Mr. Volcker said, "If you break up a $2 trillion bank into $4[00 billion] or $500 billion banks, you've got a problem." An earlier version of this article misquoted him as saying "into four or five banks." He also said the SEC's regulation of broker dealers is in need of reassessment at Tuesday's conference. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated he spoke Monday. (Oct. 18)

NEW YORK More than a dozen policy makers and experts including Paul Volcker and Sheila Bair joined Pro Financial Regulation at a conference Tuesday to discuss the future of financial regulation: what has worked and what hasn't since the financial crisis, the challenges and opportunities presented by fintech innovation, emerging vulnerabilities in the financial system, the road ahead for enforcement, and changes to expect from Washington after the November election.

Read tweets from the event "https://twitter.com/WSJFinReg?ref_src=twsrc^google|twcamp^serp|twgr^author" and check "http://www.wsj.com/pro/financialregulation" in coming days for full videos from the event.

Below are summaries of each interview.

Paul Volcker: The Long View

Chairman of the Volcker Alliance; Federal Reserve chairman from 1979-87

Paul Volcker pushed back against calls to break up big Wall Street banks, and disputed claims that his eponymous Volcker rule had caused a damaging diminution of liquidity in financial markets.

Mr. Volcker, said he understood the appeal of breaking up complex and potentially compromised institutions but is "not convinced" such moves would improve financial stability.

"If you break up a $2 trillion bank into $4[00 billion] or $500 billion banks, you've got a problem," he said. "It's an interesting debate &.But from a stability standpoint it's not on my list."

Mr. Volcker said the Volcker rule isn't an antitrading rule, but a rule against speculation, suggesting claims it had reduced liquidity in some markets were motivated by traders' self-interest.

"Liquidity is in the mind of the beholder &that all depends on the market. A lot of liquidity generates a lot of trading and a lot of risk-taking," he said, suggesting a happy medium is difficult to find. "Go and speculate all you like, but not on my dime."

Mr. Volcker, 89 years old, said claims the rule had imposed $4 billion of compliance costs on banks were "nonsense" and the rule in fact commanded "a lot of support" among bankers themselves, notwithstanding its complexity. "It gets crazy, but that's the way they want it," he said, referring to lobbyists' and lawyers' efforts to complicate a concept proprietary trading that should be obvious to any banker or regulator.

Mr. Volcker weighed in on the Wells Fargo scandal, suggesting it showed banks should separate the roles of chairman and chief executive, a relatively rare practice in the U.S.

"It shouldn't kill the bank. But it is an interesting wake-up call but not just for Wells Fargo, but for some other banks, too," he said. "I'm sure their culture was wonderful on paper."

"Did management have the skill and capacity to control the spirits unleashed by this compensation system? The answer is obviously no," he said.

Last year, Mr. Volcker's Alliance issued a paper calling for a strengthened Financial Stability Oversight Council, to make prudential supervision more rational. On Tuesday, Mr. Volcker said the Securities and Exchange Commission's regulation of broker dealers is in need of particular reassessment. "You hear the most incoherent supervision in that area, which is the heart of the system," he said.

Sheila Bair: Postcrisis Did We Get It Right?

President of Washington College; former Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. chief from 2006-11

Sheila Bair recommended junking the whole risk-weighting system underpinning the Basel capital accord, and called on Hillary Clinton to be clearer about her banking proposals.

Ms. Bair said the evidence showed simple leverage ratios are superior to the risk-weighting framework, which is subject to gaming by banks.

"The best solution is to chuck [risk-weighting]," she said, arguing that leaving banks room to estimate their own risk weights would lead to a race to the bottom. "The best banks will have the highest risk weights, so using this framework penalizes good management," she said.

Ms. Bair's comments come amid a spat, especially in Europe, between regulators who want to "http://www.wsj.com/articles/basel-officialsays-some-banksmay-face-capital-requirement-increases-1475870402" to set their own risk weights, and banks that fear simplifying the framework will result in significantly increased capital requirements.

"[The crisis] showed those banks with the highest risk-weighted capital were most likely to get in trouble," she said, advocating a higher leverage ratio than the 3% minimum Basel III has mandated.

Ms. Bair also took aim at the liquidity coverage ratio, part of the Basel framework that requires banks to hold a high share of liquid assets to ensure they can fund.

"The idea you can calibrate what's liquid and what's not, and create an environment where banks might be selling to raise cash &. is flawed," she said.

On next month's election, Ms. Bair said there was a "a lot of uncertainty" with the Democratic Party platform, which vaguely endorses a "21st century Glass Steagall Act," as it related to financial reform.

The Clinton team "has Gary Gensler, who I have a lot of confidence in," she said, referring to the former head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. She also urged Mrs. Clinton to be more specific about her regulatory plans. "I would feel better about it if she came out with something definitive," Ms. Bair said. "Does she want to increase capital?"

She expressed concern that the Clintons had a "Wall Street centric view of the world," adding that she thinks "you need greater viewpoints. I worry she won't be drawing from a broad enough range of [perspectives]."

Sarah Bloom Raskin: Can Government Ensure Cybersecurity?

Deputy Treasury secretary

Cyberthreats to financial institutions have transformed into a global problem that requires united efforts from government and business, according to Sarah Bloom Raskin.

While government cyberprotection efforts have become more rigorous and proactive, rather than reactive, in recent years, partnering with the private sector is essential to their success, Ms. Raskin said.

"It's something that the government can't do alone," she said.

In recent years, the episodic attacks on a bank's security perimeter have been replaced by regular attempts at stealing the financial institution's "crown jewels," Ms. Raskin said.

"The goals have changed &it's not so much nuisance, but misappropriation," she said.

The Treasury has collaborated with financial institutions to set up information-sharing mechanisms and identify the vectors driving the attacks, she said. An attacker frequently uses the same technology, methodology and internet addresses to target a series of institutions.

"We would like, in real time, for those vectors to be known across the financial sector," Ms. Raskin said.

The Treasury also is working with the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations on a cybersecurity framework.

"We now have realized that in order to get this right, we have to think about this globally," Ms. Raskin said.

Mark Warner: The Congressional Agenda

Democratic U.S. senator from Virginia

Sen. Mark Warner said he is "losing patience" with bank regulators over their disagreements on what some large banks need to do to plan for an orderly unwinding that would avoid the need for taxpayer money.

Mr. Warner helped write the legislation requiring banks to submit "living wills" and devise a resolution process for how they would go out of business in the event of a failure. But the regulators reviewing those plans the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. have disagreed with each other on the plans of two banks whose efforts were considered inadequate earlier this year. Mr. Warner said that six years after Dodd-Frank was enacted, it is time for the regulators to take stronger action in tandem.

If there is "another year of that kind of disagreement without some kind of commonality, then I think you would see even someone like me, who is one of the co-fathers, that would say we need a new threshold," Mr. Warner said. "My fix would have been a great deal of both public and private communication with those institutions."

Mr. Warner said he also is losing patience with regulators who haven't taken direct action against individuals. He cited the settlement with Wells Fargo & Co., which acknowledged creating nearly two million unauthorized accounts. The regulators have indicated in public testimony that individuals could be cited, but the $185 million in fines against the bank came as part of a settlement in which the company neither confirmed nor denied wrongdoing. That, Mr. Warner said, is frustrating.

"I was introduced as the moderate on regulatory issues, and I'm at that kind of breaking point, too, of frustration where we see these kinds of actions and yet no institution or individual ever seems to be held accountable," he said.

J. Christopher Giancarlo: Regulating Markets

Republican commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission

J. Christopher Giancarlo likens policing markets to high-speed highways policed by troopers in 1970s-model cruisers.

"I wish we were more equipped," he said, citing the stark example of CFTC regulations that still refer to trading pits when most trades are now done though virtual exchanges.

"We spend so much time looking backwards to the last crisis that we don't spend enough time looking forward to the next crisis," he said.

Swap-data repositories, a requirement following the 2008 financial crisis to shed light on the complex web of trades, have fallen short, Mr. Giancarlo said.

Mr. Giancarlo, adopting a "21st century markets need 21st century regulation" mantra, says U.S. regulators need to look to the 1990s effort to regulate the internet, and sees promise in blockchain technology and its real-time digital ledgers.

"Imagine if we had access to the blockchain," said Mr. Giancarlo, who favors the U.K. approach of setting up a regulatory "sandbox" that lets companies test ideas without being bogged down by the authorization process.

Cryptocurrencies digital currencies based on cryptography need clarification from Congress, Mr. Giancarlo said.

Also of concern, Mr. Giancarlo said, is a proposal that would give the CFTC unfettered access to high-frequency trading firms' source code the secret sauce behind their trading moves.

The proposal, known as Regulation AT, "is a first step to move into this 21st century digital role," Mr. Giancarlo said, but it would strip away the right to challenge a search and could turn into a "slippery slope," opening the door for the "alphabet soup of government agencies" to access the critical information.

He said he fears that information could end up being stored in some government warehouse without adequate security, just like the Ark of the Covenant in "Raiders of the Lost Ark."

Barney Frank: If Hillary Clinton Wins the Election

Democratic U.S. representative from Massachusetts from 1981-2012; chairman of the House Financial Services Committee from 2007-11

Barney Frank said a Treasury secretary with financial experience would be a good idea, avoiding any recommendations but providing two suggestions on how to improve the financial overhaul law that bears his name.

The Massachusetts Democrat said the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act needs tweaking but argued the law has "already worked well and will stand the test of time."

Still, he said, the $50 billion asset threshold that triggers Fed supervision should be doubled, at the least, and small banks with assets below $10 billion should be exempted from complying with the Volcker rule.

"We have a problem with small banks: I think part of the problem some of them are being over-lawyered going through too much effort to show" they comply with the law, he said.

Mr. Frank also said "risk retention," where lenders are required to remain exposed to at least part of the value of loans they had made, was crucial to maintaining market discipline.

"The single biggest problem we have was when lending switched from people borrowing money from a person they had to pay back to [a system of] securitization," he said, bemoaning a political deal that had exempted residential mortgages from risk retention.

Asked about the next Treasury secretary, Mr. Frank said "someone with financial services experience and knowledge is a good idea," noting President George W. Bush had churned through three Treasury secretaries, two of whom had relatively little financial experience. He also said the "toughest two regulators" in his time in Congress were Gary Gensler, who had been chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and Sheila Bair, who had headed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.

Mr. Frank, now on the board of Signature Bank, also said the Dodd-Frank Act, which runs to thousands of pages, was less complex than people thought because it rolled into one law what "had been done in eight or nine" in the past, citing the post-depression era Glass-Steagall and Investment Company acts.

Panel Discussion: Policing Wall Street

Jamal El-Hindi, acting director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network

Robert Werner, head of financial crime compliance at HSBC Holdings

M. Kendall Day, chief of the asset forfeiture and money-laundering section, criminal division, at the Justice Department

A top government financial-crimes enforcement official said he wanted to strike a fair balance between ensuring banks comply with new money-laundering controls, while taking care to avoid disruptions in the payments chain.

Jamal El-Hindi, acting director of FinCEN, the U.S. Treasury unit that collects suspicious activity reports, said that the goal wasn't wholesale derisking, but a route that improves banks' behavior and transparency without them pulling back.

"We do have to realize we have never told them their goal is to keep everything out," said Mr. El-Hindi. "It's not a zero-tolerance regime; we're not asking for perfection."

Robert Werner said on the same panel that the issue is where to draw the line between making banks resilient, while preventing them from exiting whole business segments out of fear of falling foul of rules.

"It's not zero [tolerance], but where is [the line]?" he asked. "Banks have been left to set the risk appetite around that."

Mr. Werner warned that moves by banks to derisk in response to money-laundering regulations could change the payments system in ways that are unpredictable. He said banks are being hyperconservative in response to the controls, to stay on the right side of the law.

"Banks' risk appetite for providing those services to other banks is inevitably shrinking around what kind of monitoring and testing we will do," he said. "There is going to be a tension between management of risk in the institution &versus policy makers who want to have a robust international payments system."

Mr. Werner said the risk was the resiliency of the correspondent banking system. He suggested banks focus on more limited services, versus an all-or-nothing approach, and tailoring services to their risks.

"Any kind of adjustment where business feels comfortable &we would feel supportive," said Mr. El-Hindi.

Also on the panel, Kendall Day said the Justice Department is reviewing whether to bring civil cases against individuals over money-laundering violations, in an apparent departure from its typical focus on large institutions.

Mr. Day said the agency is increasingly looking to deploy its resources toward pursuing individual civil cases. He said historically the agency has focused on larger institutions, which can generate large fines and settlements, but there are additional opportunities the Justice Department sees that aren't maximum recovery cases.

"In the past, my colleagues would bring [cases] where there were the deepest pockets to bring a suit," Mr. Day said. A new memorandum at the agency makes clear that Justice Department civil colleagues won't now be solely focused on maximizing recovery, he added.

Previously, the Justice Department has investigated individuals in the context of anti-money-laundering violations at smaller banks, mostly where suspicious activity is easier to locate to a defined group of people.

Compliance officers are usually the "easiest person you can make a case against," said Mr. Werner, a former director of FinCEN.

But Mr. Day said the DOJ's new line of attack won't focus exclusively on bank compliance officers.

Lawrence Kudlow: If Donald Trump Wins the Election

Senior contributor to CNBC; informal adviser to Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump

Lawrence Kudlow has signaled that the controversial Consumer Financial Protection Bureau would be overhauled should Mr. Trump be elected president.

"I don't know what it's doing inside the Fed, never seen anything like it. I'm not sure the Fed would like it there," he said, suggesting the current governance gave the CFPB director "way too much power." He said the CFPB's constitutionality was in question a federal appeals court last week declared the agency's unusual independence to be unconstitutional and said he preferred a board of two Democrats and two Republicans from which the president would choose the director.

Mr. Kudlow also scolded the Republican Party for what he called an insufficient focus on growth, citing the past 16 years, including the eight years of George W. Bush's presidency.

"Growth is a job creator and wage increaser, helps solve poverty and long-term debt problems," the CNBC senior contributor said. "I think Republicans are more on the growth path, but not necessarily to my satisfaction," he added, noting growth had averaged 2% a year since 2000 compared with 3.5% over the 16 years before that.

"I'm a John F. Kennedy Democrat and a Reagan Republican," he said. "They were both for growth."

Asked about who would make a good Treasury secretary, Mr. Kudlow declined to offer suggestions but said former Fed governor Kevin Warsh "a young man with tremendous financial ability" and Stanford economics professor John Taylor "an astute monetary analyst" were good people on the Republican side of politics.

Antonio Weiss: The Obama Record

Counselor to Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew

Antonio Weiss has staunchly defended the Obama administration's financial reform record, but singled out Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the market for U.S. Treasurys as unfinished business.

Mr. Weiss said President Barack Obama had overseen the "greatest degree of financial reform in 75 years" that had tilted the financial sector back to supporting the real economy.

"In January and February this year, oil and share prices were collapsing. August of last year, equities collapsed in an unexpected collapse: You did not hear that the fin system was at risk. You didn't here fin institutions were on the verge of failure," he said, pointing to the extra $750 billion of capital U.S. banks had amassed since the financial crisis.

He said "a lot" of things were still on the agenda and warned Congress the administration would remain a steadfast opponent of "riders" on omnibus bills designed to unpick past reforms.

"The public and taxpayers would be served by comprehensive housing finance reform," he said, noting that state-backed Fannie and Freddie had been in conservatorship for eight years.

"Right now, we have a situation where the taxpayer is on the hook for $187 billion that were injected at conservatorship, and in the taxpayer backstop to [government-sponsored enterprises].

"Tens of millions of Americans do not have access to appropriate housing."

Mr. Weiss also highlighted changes in the $13 trillion market for U.S. Treasurys, recently subject to the first review since 1988, prompted by the increased role of algorithmic trading, hedge funds and nonbank traders.

"We've moved from the secondary market carried out by primary dealers where there's a whole array of players. We hope that [the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority] will soon finalize a rule which will provide for official collection of all these transactions," he said.

Panel Discussion: Governing Fintech

Hans Morris, managing partner of Nyca Partners

Upstart nonbank financial services firms are hampered by having to register with individual states to make loans or transfer money, according to a panel of fintech executives.

State-by-state regulation is "painful and expensive, and doesn't serve a public purpose," said venture capital investor and LendingClub Corp. Chairman Hans Morris. Many upstart financial technology firms, such as LendingClub, have opted not to become banks, and so must either partner with a national bank to make loans nationally or go state by state to register as a money transmitter or lender.

That process is expensive and difficult, requiring steps such as fingerprinting of executives in each state, said Mr. Morris, who is also managing partner at Nyca Partners, a venture-capital firm that was an early investor in LendingClub.

"I can't think of one person who would stand up and defend state-by-state processing," he said. "It's quite unbelievable, and it's not good regulation. None of these states are really regulating activities."

John Beccia of Circle, which offers a mobile app to make person-to-person payments using blockchain technology, said the difficulty is compounded by the fact that many banks don't want to partner with fintech firms.

The patchwork of state regulation is "a barrier to entry," he said. "Banks are under a lot of pressure post-Dodd-Frank, and many don't want to work with fintech companies."

Circle was the first firm to apply for a bitcoin license in New York, one of the first states to create a regime to regulate the digital currency.

The complexity of state regulation is a major reason that the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is evaluating a limited banking charter that could be used by fintech firms that wouldn't be quite as onerous as a traditional license, said former banking regulator Jo Ann Barefoot.

"State regulators are working on trying to add more streamlining to address this problem, an incredibly serious problem," said Ms. Barefoot. "That's one reason they're looking at a national charter."

For now, she said, fintech firms have to live in a "permanent state of regulator uncertainty."

"Regulators are going to need a change of philosophy and culture," said Mr. Beccia. "We have to encourage innovation in a sandbox environment, and we have to encourage banks to encourage the derisking of fintech firms." A regulatory "sandbox" lets companies test new technologies and ideas without requirements to get full authorization.

Mr. Morris said an alternative limited charter would be "a major policy benefit" to the U.S.

Panel Discussion: Finreg meets AI

Eugene Ludwig, founder and chief executive of Promontory Financial Group

Alistair Rennie, general manager of solutions at IBM Watson Analytics

Former national bank regulator Eugene Ludwig is a firm believer that artificial intelligence holds the promise of helping to stave off regulatory and consumer risks.

He believes in it so much that Mr. Ludwig is selling his prominent regulatory consultant firm, Promontory Financial Group in Washington, D.C., to International Business Machines Corp. with the plan to build an AI-based consultancy called Watson Financial Services. IBM's Watson technology platform uses natural-language processing and self-learning to sift through mounds of data. Mr. Ludwig said it would help firms predict potential risk areas as well as consumer behavior a way that many regulators and other firms are studying to help prevent systemic risks and financial fraud.

The challenge is to "solve the problems in a more effective way and a more efficient way," Mr. Ludwig said. "Watson is a huge giant leap forward. It's not just like a few steps."

"The typical technological approach has been to &build a rules-based system that is often complex and often very much like a black box," said Alistair Rennie of IBM Watson Analytics. "We just don't think that's viable going forward because of the time to react to a change, to react to a market condition is just too slow."

IBM announced the acquisition of Promontory in September. The expansion of Watson in the financial services industry is under way, executives said.

Transcript By Superior Transcriptions LLC "http://www.superiortranscriptions.com"

JACOB M. SCHLESINGER: We are privileged to have with us here today through a number of these panels many people who've had a hand in crafting the current regulatory regime that was enacted after the crisis. And the portion of the edifice that was designed in part by Senator Warner was dealing with resolution, Titles I and II of Dodd-Frank to the cognoscenti, the living will process whereby banks  

SENATOR MARK WARNER (D-VA): You got to give Corker part of the credit.

MR. SCHLESINGER: Well, we'll get to that. We'll get to that. Anyway, he's not here.

SEN. WARNER: All right.

MR. SCHLESINGER: But the process where banks have to write credible plans for how they can die without asking taxpayers to pay for the funeral, or something like that.

So, as the proud father or one of the proud fathers of that provision, how do you think it's going so far?

SEN. WARNER: Well, let's roll back the clock a little bit. Obviously, there was major debate at that moment in time between many on my side of the aisle, who were interested in simply breaking up, looking at an asset cap. To me, at that moment, in terms of American competitiveness with other large institutions around the world, that didn't seem to be the appropriate process.

So this notion of living wills, a resolution process, it was obviously new. So I think the jury is still out. I have been frustrated a bit that it has taken as long to get the process kind of worked through. More recently I've been very frustrated with the notion that the Fed and the FDIC can't seem to get on the same page, so we can't really see if it's working or not.

Now, I get the fact that these are complex, large institutions. I think we've made progress on capital standards, liquidity ratios, other issues. You know, there's questions about   in light of the Wells Fargo, you know, so not only too big to fail, but too big to manage, which I think are legitimate questions not addressed by Section 165. I think we will only see 165, its effectiveness, if we can make sure that we see the regulators get on the same page in terms of their standards   I'm losing patience with that failure to get on the same page   and then to see, if an institution falls in a non-performing category, what are some of the remedies going to be.

Now, obviously this far after Dodd-Frank, just to say it's still too early to tell is not a fully satisfactory answer. I'm the first to acknowledge that. But I think  

MR. SCHLESINGER: The famous quote   was it Zhou Enlai, when he was asked what he thought of the French Revolution, said it's too soon to tell?

SEN. WARNER: Too soon to tell.

MR. SCHLESINGER: So he's got another hundred years before we can  

SEN. WARNER: I don't get a hundred years. But I think that, you know, we've seen two years in a row   well, we've seen multiple years in a row now where there's been great disparity between the Fed and the FDIC. The last year it's gotten down to the two institutions. If we had another year of that kind of disagreement without some commonality, then I think you would see even someone like me, who is one of the co-fathers, that would say, hey, we need to take a fresh look at this because it's not working.

MR. SCHLESINGER: So what are the alternatives? Let's assume that your frustration continues and it goes beyond the letter that you wrote saying  

SEN. WARNER: The thing   the thing that I would hope would be that   I don't have intimate knowledge of the workings of all these institutions, but from just a   from a rational standpoint, seeing how difficult it's been to do resolution, and when we think about the potential overall international overhang with Deutsche Bank right now, I think the idea that any of these institutions could be simply resolved even with a single point of entry is probably not fully believable to me. So what I would like to see in a certain sense is that if there was an institution that fell outside of that category and there was unanimity of opinion, to see, OK, what would the regulators then do in terms of corrective action. Then I think we'd know is this a tool that is going to make sure that we have   we have put in place a regulatory regime in advance of a crisis that could potentially foresee that crisis and take prospective action rather than retrospective action.

MR. SCHLESINGER: But in terms of the process of getting the Fed and FDIC on the same page, which   you say you're losing patience with that. Can you fix the living wills process? And what would your fix be?

SEN. WARNER: Well, my fix has been a great deal of both public and private communication with those institutions saying you got to get on the same page or this needs to be, you know, reexamined at a   at a committee level.

MR. SCHLESINGER: You mentioned too big to manage, and you alluded to Wells Fargo. Can you talk a little bit about your views on the Wells Fargo scandal? And what particular remedies do you think, legislative or otherwise, are warranted by that?

SEN. WARNER: Well, listen, I've been familiar with the Wells Fargo team for some time. I was, candidly, as surprised as most, I think. This was the entity that had a less complex set of products. It seemed to be kind of more plain vanilla.

You know, I'm outraged. I think I was very disappointed in the former CEO and chairman's testimony when he repeatedly said that's the responsibility of the board when he is the chairman of the board, did not fly and pass the smell test. And you know, I think it continues to raise the question that when we see this kind of excess and how this can be   this is not explained away when literally millions of Americans' accounts were messed with, misappropriated to some level or another. And simply saying we're going to do settlements where there's not acknowledgement of guilt I think is not a satisfactory answer.

So I think the jury is still out on what, you know, Justice Department or other enforcement agencies may take on or not take on. But the   I think the American public wants to see   and I hear this on a repeated basis   that if there are these kind of actions taking place, someone pays the price rather than simply a lump sum paid with no acknowledgement of guilt.

MR. SCHLESINGER: So you're pushing a hot button there that goes beyond the Wells Fargo settlement, which is, as you say, a lot of these settlements involve sort of no admission of guilt, paying a big fine, and that's it. Do you feel as if, again, legislatively, that there might be some need for  

SEN. WARNER: My hope would be that we would not get to that legislative piece. But if we never see action   and I   and listen, I appreciate we had the CFTC up here earlier. We've had, you know, the SEC. You know, the irony is that some of the folks that I work with are on a constant effort to cut their budgets, so their ability to follow through on an enforcement action and take it all the way through a legal process is somewhat constrained by their resources. So, you know, I have some empathy for that. But at the same time, you know, to continue to say, when excess after excess   and remember how I was introduced. I was introduced as the moderate on regulatory issues, and I'm, though, at that kind of breaking point, too, of frustration, where we see these kind of actions and yet no institution or individual ever seem to be held accountable. And that will build up, and that is playing out in the political process right now.

Today you're going to see, later, folks come up from the   what happens if the Democrats or what happens if, God forbid, on the other side. (Laughter.) But you know, when there is agreement   and I say this as somebody who came up through the financial industry and was blessed to do really well   I believe that when both sides are saying the system is rigged and we continue to see these excesses and no one held accountable, that is   you know, I'd like to take you around my state and try to make the argument why that's OK.

MR. SCHLESINGER: So let's talk about the election. And let's assume your desired scenario, which is the Democrats win not only the presidency, but the Senate. What is going to be the agenda from the Senate Finance Committee? What would the priorities   the regulatory priorities be to you?

SEN. WARNER: Well, let me   let me give you less the Democrat Senate Finance Committee and give you more what Mark Warner's agenda items would be.

Here's one of my concerns. I think there is a   much more recognition amongst most members of Congress that we have rightfully earned our 8 percent approval rating and that we've got to put some points on the board. But my concern as a Democrat is, if we simply   let's assume conventional wisdom: Clinton and Kaine win, Democrats take back the Senate by a narrow margin, the House remains Republican. If we simply come back and say let's rehash four or five pre-litigated issues and expect a different result, with only marginal changes around the edges, we're not going to see anything. And the American people want to see some points put on the board.

So what I would do on a regulatory basis, I would look at, for example, the changing nature of the workforce   the fact that, right now, a third of the American workforce is in some level of contingent work, whether it's gig economy, part time, short-termers. They have no social insurance. So the whole social contract that was created in our country in the 1930s and '40s, that was built upon the presumption that you're going to work for the same firm for 20 years   so we're the only country in the world that says social insurance is dependent upon your labor status. I think we need to move to a portable benefit system. I think we need to have   engage with you in this room on the question of, is something fundamentally altered with capitalism? And as somebody who has benefitted from capitalism, believe in the system, when we've seen the average term of hold on a public stock has gone from eight years to four months; when we've seen corporate profits spent 50 percent reinvested in the business, now to 95 percent spent on share buyback on dividends; when large companies that have huge CAPEX are taking away from that CAPEX, you know, to fight back activist investors. Now, I don't want to say and advocate a Japanese economy kind of simplification. But I do think this notion of the long/short challenge, whether we are moving so   whether technology and other things have accelerated so much that we're so focused on short-term results versus long-term value creation I think is a fundamental issue that a lot of folks in America affects their lives in terms of their jobs, in terms of their futures. And you know, that would be whether it's regulatory, whether it's   it is through other efforts.

I honestly think   you know, and this would be   I hope would be probably not a place where government ought to start, but where you ought to start, whether you are on the financial side or particularly those of you on the corporate side, those of you who are on the asset management side. You know, do we need to think about a fiduciary duty definition that goes more than just short term that includes shareholders and other   or employees and other constituencies? Should we be able to look at more long-term value creation? Should we look at how we compensate everybody in this room more towards three-to five-year results? Obviously there are things we could do as policymakers around the edges   differential capital gains rate based on long-term hold, think it makes a lot of   a lot of sense there.

But, you know, to be provocative, if you do a major share buyback campaign, should management be beneficiaries of that share buyback campaign? Should you look   and this would be easy to say, but impossible to implement   but, you know, if you've got lots of cash on your balance sheet   and yes, we got to do international tax reform and do repatriation   but if you're out borrowing money simply for share buyback purposes, should we look at that deductibility of that interest? Should we say, maybe if there's going to be this pushup in value, some of that pushup in value needs to go to the employees as well? We need to make sure   please understand that the anger and frustration in America is so visceral and real, and it's so immediate, and we've not even hit artificial intelligence, automation that's coming in terms of automated vehicles. This wave is going to sweep us all out if we don't come to grips on a way that I think we can make capitalism work for everybody again, whether that's a capitalism 2.0 or 21st-century capitalism. But those would be some of the things I'd be asking.

MR. SCHLESINGER: Does anyone in the audience have questions? We have time for a few. This gentleman right over here.

SEN. WARNER: And I'm happy to go back to financial reform. You can put me back in my box, so  

Q: (Off mic)   and has not been dealt with by Dodd-Frank, and that is the GSEs.

SEN. WARNER: Thank you, thank you, thank you. As somebody who spent two-and-a-half to three years learning more about housing finance than I ever wanted to know, number one; and, number two, when I got into the plumbing, it's remarkable to me that this system worked as well as it did for as long as it did before it blew up. And the notion of, you know, private-sector gain and public-sector accepting the losses just is not palatable.

Now, the effort that, again, Bob Corker and I and then Tim Johnson and Mike Crapo put together was   it was, obviously, maybe a bit too intricate, and the transition time was a challenge. But I think housing finance reform is absolutely the undone part of reform that needs to be done. I think our frame of some explicit guarantee, but only as kind of last party for the federal government to play, with more private capital in front, was still some insurance that low- and moderate-income people and first-time homebuyers are served. I think the notional idea of the 10 basis points, let's say, as a   as a set aside that would go towards that duty-to-serve type obligations would be remarkably helpful to folks struggling to get into the housing market.

I'm pleased to see that both Gene Sterling and Mark Zandi have put out kind of a new frame, and there's one more kind of on the center-right that Michael Bright and some others are working on right now. I think within that frame there really can be a chance to move on that. That is definitely an item that has   that has been left.

And we've had   let's put it like this. I think there is progress when you have from David Vitter to Elizabeth Warren to those of us in the middle all coming together on what's called the GSE Jumpstart Reforms to say we're not going to allow the GSE fees to be used for alternative purposes. That's at least a pretty good starting point to say that there is some appetite for housing finance reform.

MR. : Other questions for Senator Warner?

MR. SCHLESINGER: Let me ask one, actually, while you're looking, which is to get back on the financial regulatory agenda.

SEN. WARNER: Sure.

MR. SCHLESINGER: Secretary Clinton has put out a pretty detailed financial regulatory reform plan. How much of that do you sign onto? What do you like? Is there anything you don't like?

SEN. WARNER: I have not gone through with explicit detail every piece of  

MR. SCHLESINGER: Well, let me ask you about a couple of things that maybe are a little more controversial. She's open to some form of financial transactions tax, which has gotten a lot of traction in the Democratic Party. How do you feel about that?

SEN. WARNER: I'm open to that discussion. You know, we have a financial transaction tax right now. It's a tiny, tiny amount, a faction of a cent that is used to support the exchanges. Now, the question is how far up you go before you push business offshore. And you've seen other countries that have not   that have talked about it that have found hard parts in terms of the implementation. It is easier talked about than implemented. But the notion that this is a   couldn't even be discussed or, you know, would completely explode the markets, you know, or you couldn't ever put it in place, is just not factually accurate, since   again, I should have it in my head, but you know, it's   Gene Ludwig would have this number   but there is a tiny financial transaction tax right now that takes place on every share transaction.

MR. SCHLESINGER: So one of the issues   you mentioned Senator Warren, who's also on the Finance Committee, and one of the issues   the big powers that your committee will have, even if the House still   Republicans still hold the House, is confirming appointees. Senator Warren has made no secret of her view that personnel is policy, as she puts it. She succeeded in blocking the confirmation of Antonio Weiss, a speaker we're going to hear later, to a high-ranking Treasury position. Where do you come down on that spectrum? Should Secretary Clinton, if she's president, not appoint anyone from Wall Street to her  

SEN. WARNER: Senator Warren and I actually work together on a whole lot of issues. We actually have a   some legislation we put together on derivatives, and we've worked together on   we're very close on housing finance reform. Couldn't get to the final stage, but on things like the Jumpstart Reform we're there.

I don't think you can take a whole industry of people and say, per se, you can't serve. I mean, Paul Volcker, nobody I think   I think would ever say that Paul Volcker was not a tough regulator. He was a Chase banker before he became a regulator. Gary Gensler probably made most of you in the room mad at one point or another; he was a Goldman Sachs partner.

So should we make sure that the regulators are balanced and don't simply come from industry? Absolutely. But to take one broad brush and say, per se, anyone that actually has worked in the intricacies of an industry that is extraordinarily complex can't serve the public I don't agree with.

MR. SCHLESINGER: You seem open to a lot of things that, as you say, we might be surprised a moderate is   might not be open to. Both party platforms, surprisingly, embrace the restoration of Glass-Steagall. How do you feel about that?

SEN. WARNER: You know, I don't think   I don't know how you put that genie back in the bottle, and I don't know how you would do that on an American-only basis.

Chorus Uses AI to Analyze Sales Calls

Corrections & Amplifications:

Chorus raised $6.3 million in seed funding. A previous version of this story incorrectly said it raised $6.3 million in Series A funding. (Oct. 19, 2016)

Technology companies have been looking for novel ways to apply artificial intelligence technology to industries. Startup Chorus aims to arm salespeople with AI, promising sales pitch refinements.

San Francisco- and Tel Aviv-based Chorus has raised $6.3 million in seed financing led by Emergence Capital Partners.

Chorus isn't alone. A crowded arena of startups want to improve sales, such as InsideSales and ClearSlide. But Chorus analyzes the actual sales conversations to understand the elements of winning deals.

Cloud computing has helped upend traditional enterprise software markets, but artificial intelligence offers a next wave of industry change.

"How machine learning and AI will interact with enterprise software will be as fundamental a sea change as the move from client-server to the cloud was," said Gordon Ritter, a co-founder and general partner at Emergence Capital. Mr. Ritter invested early in Salesforce.com.

Chorus, which integrates with Salesforce.com and webconferencing tools, records sales calls and then uses speech recognition and natural language processing to extract information from the voice data. The software identifies topics, even if they were not mentioned. For example, mentions of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump would be highlighted as "politics."

Chorus's dashboard shows whether planned topics were covered in the conversation or not, such as "budget," or "follow up." It also shows via a color-coded chart who was speaking when, to identify, for example, if a sales person was speaking too much.

Salespeople can also identify when a competitor's name came up, and what was said to win that deal versus what was said to lose the deal.

Looking at this aggregated data, sales reps and managers can see what techniques, topics or approaches work best for winning deals.

This granular data is typically not captured without voice data, since only about 5% of a conversation is written into notes by salespeople, said Roy Raanani, Chorus chief executive and co-founder.

The technology can identify such things as: "high engagement" with a prospect, an unprofessional speaking manner, hesitations in speech, or speech that is too slow or too fast. It can also identify voice pitch, and how much pitch harmony there is between a salesperson and prospect.

For example, a quick change in pitch can indicate engagement, said Chorus co-founder Micha Breakstone. The software does not currently make recommendations on this type of data but could in the future.

Chorus customers include Cisco's Meraki, Marketo, Qualtrics and Talkable.

"Chorus helps us understand, dissect and ultimately distribute best practices to get new sales representatives up to speed faster while improving existing sales representatives' win rates," said Charlie Besecker, head of global enablement at Qualtrics, in an email.

Kuwait Firm Expands With GE Office Deal in Ohio; Cincinnati property purchase shows how foreign investors play bigger role in U.S. commercial real estate, even in smaller markets

A Kuwait-based financial-services firm seeking more diversity in a world awash in cheap oil is paying $107 million for a new Cincinnati office building occupied by General Electric Co. in its biggest real-estate investment in the U.S.

KAMCO Investment Co.'s purchase of the new development, named General Electric @ The Banks, is a sign that a new cadre of foreign investors is playing a bigger role in U.S. commercial real estate, even in smaller markets like Cincinnati.

The deal comes at a tricky time for U.S. commercial real estate. Overall U.S. sales volume was down 12.2% from last year to $299.1 billion as of the end of August, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics.

But a few foreign players are boosting spending. Chinese investors have purchased or have contracts to buy $12.6 billion worth of property in 2016, more than double last year, while investment from Kuwait jumped to $726 million from $500 million, Real Capital said.

What's more, KAMCO's investment in Cincinnati comes as foreign and other investors increasingly are looking to smaller cities for deals with higher yields.

Foreign investment used to focus on major markets such as New York, San Francisco and Chicago. But prices in those cities have soared in recent years, driving down yields or so-called capitalization rates, a common metric in the real-estate industry that shows the relationship between price and income.

At this later stage in the cycle, cap rates are more attractive for buyers in smaller markets. For example, the cap rate in KAMCO's purchase of the 12-story Cincinnati building is about 5.5%, according to people involved in the deal, meaning that the building's annual income is about 5.5% of its purchase price. In cities like New York and San Francisco cap rates of high quality office buildings are well below 5%.

KAMCO, which is listed on the Dubai stock exchange, has been expanding its investments geographically as it deals with a "dramatic drop in oil prices," the company said in its 2015 annual report. The Cincinnati purchase is part of that diversification effort, according to Faisal Sarkhou, KAMCO's chief executive.

KAMCO is looking for other U.S. property, Mr. Sarkhou said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. Besides diversification, KAMCO is getting know-how from the U.S. real-estate industry, he said. KAMCO hopes to "cross fertilize" its experience with other participants in U.S. deals "to build at home and develop new markets," he said.

Participants in the Cincinnati deal include 90 North Real Estate Partners LP, an investment company with expertise in working with Middle East partners. The London-based firm helped negotiate and structure the purchase of the building from its developer, Atlanta-based Carter & Associates LLC, and also took a small equity stake.

About 60% of the purchase price came from Des Moines-based Principal Global Investors, according to Daniel Cooper, who is head of 90 North's operations in North America. Principal's investment was structured as a lease to keep the deal compliant with the financial rules of Islamic or "Shariah" law, he said. Principal didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

KAMCO's risk is limited because General Electric has leased most of the space in the building for 15 years, with options for another 25 years. GE, which has links to Cincinnati dating back to 1948, occupied the building last month.

GE two years ago leased the space on the banks of the Ohio River and promised to move up to 2,000 workers there. With many of the jobs coming from suburban locations, the deal has been hailed as a sign that rust belt cities were beginning to enjoy the same trends that have been rejuvenating larger cities on the East and West Coasts.

Office tenants in Cincinnati occupied an additional 160,000 square feet as of the end of the second quarter, according to real-estate investment-services company JLL. That helped push the vacancy rate down to 15.9%, JLL said.

Downtown Cincinnati also has seen an increase in residential development and the opening of new bars and restaurants. A new $120 million waterfront park has been opening in phases for about five years.

Eastdil Secured LLC represented Carter in the sale to KAMCO.

Everyone's Worst Investing Fears

Snapchat is not about to disappear -- this newspaper reported earlier this month that the firm may go public next year with a $25 billion valuation. Don't you wish you had invested at a $500 million value? Lots of investors underwater this year sure do.

Last month Perry Capital, which peaked with $15 billion under management in 2007, closed its flagship fund. Richard Perry, a Robert Rubin protege, complained in a recent letter to investors that "this market environment has not worked well for us." Really? The Dow is now within a hair of its all-time high.

Some 10,000 hedge funds invest almost $3 trillion. More funds closed than opened over the past year. With $20 billion in assets, Lansdowne Partners is down almost 15% this year. The Rhode Island State Investment Commission is cutting hedge-fund holdings by half. The California Public Employees' Retirement System droped hedge funds altogether last year. What's going on? This isn't a nasty bear market.

So many asset classes are in a funk. Macro investing, making bets based on major geopolitical trends, was all the rage over the past 25 years. But George Soros breaking the Bank of England is a thing of the past. Debt is now monetized rather than rationalized. There is a glut of commodities -- from forests to food. Energy is fracked. Private equity probably peaked a few years ago, but it hasn't yet marked to market. And bonds? When you have to pay Germany to own its sovereign bonds, it is tough to make money. That leaves stocks.

Equity investors have loved lower interest rates, because they make stocks more attractive than bonds and increase the value of future earnings. But at zero and even negative interest rates, it's a mess. Think of zero rates as a compass that can't point north and only spins around. Dividend-discount models to value stocks are driven by a discount rate that at zero makes every stock worth infinity. So stocks look cheap, even though they've never been more expensive.

What to do? The first rule of investing is that there are no rules. Investing is like fashion. What's hot and what's not changes at the whim of the market. It used to be every fund owned Apple, until it stopped working. Right now we are in what CNBC's Jim Cramer calls a Fang market, because of the power of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Google has done the worst of the bunch since January 2015 -- up only 50%. Netflix and Amazon have both doubled. In an economy with 2% GDP growth, not much else works.

Tomorrow's fashion? If I knew for sure, I'd be on a Bora Bora beach. But I can point to the right neighborhood. It's the New over the Old. New productive companies destroying the old ways of doing business.

The market does the dirty work, providing access to capital for those it thinks will be the next wave of great companies. It starves those in decline. This is why BlackBerry doesn't make phones and why General Motors is throwing good money after bad into technology and partners for autonomous vehicles. SoFi is hurting banks.

But even being the New can be fleeting. Apple's iTunes stung music companies by offering reasonably priced songs instead of full albums. And now streaming companies like Spotify offer unlimited music for $10 a month. The Newer destroying the New. I call this Lily Pad investing: You've got to hop from one company to another before the first one drowns. But it's hard.

Finding the next wave of hot companies can be a pain in the assets. The minor leagues for this crop of the New is often venture capital. The New firms are then swallowed up by public investors during initial public offerings. Yet companies are staying private much longer. There is no public market for SoFi or Spotify. Thanks to "financial reform" acts like Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank, the market for IPOs has been a ghost town.

Trillions in assets are itching to invest in these markets, but for now investors are stuck with firms that are under attack. Try to find investment in virtual reality, genome editing, drones, voice-control interfaces, artificial intelligence, chatbots or robots. Even immunotherapy and gene-therapy investments are far and few between. These companies become billion-dollar unicorns because they stay private. And not all of them will work. Hyperloop is aptly named.

Just recently, the IPO window has cracked open in a small way. Nutanix -- an integrator of servers and storage that hopes to destroy Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Dell EMC -- saw its stock almost triple in the first few days of trading last week. Earlier IPOs would sure be nice.

The king of the New, Uber founder Travis Kalanick, remarked at a German technology conference this summer, "I say we are going to IPO as late as humanly possible. It'll be one day before my employees and significant others come to my office with pitchforks and torches. We will IPO the day before that. Do you get it?" And that tells you why so many are showing such runty returns.

FT REPORT - INVESTING IN CENTRAL & EASTERN EUROPE
Bulgaria strives to become tech capital of the Balkans; Innovation

The nation's history as the former Soviet Union's IT hub has given it a head start, says Kerin Hope

Darin Madzharov, studying for a PhD in computer science in Belgium, was growing impatient with his sister's calls on Skype seeking help with her Sofia high school science course. So he responded with a stream of video tutorials, which her classmates and friends snapped up.

"They became so popular that I gave up my PhD, came back to Sofia and launched an educational website," the 28-year-old says.

His site, Ucha ("learn" in Bulgarian) took off thanks to  ¬30,000 in funding from Launchub, a local accelerator backed by the European Investment Fund (EIF) and the EU's Jeremie tech start-up programme. Two Bulgarian angel investors came up with  ¬200,000 in a further raising and this year Ucha.se is set to make a profit.

"For 20 lev ( ¬10), the price of a meal, you can sign up for a year's worth of lessons covering any national curriculum subject," says Mr Madzharov.

Bulgaria is striving to catch up with central Europe, where economies based on low-cost manufacturing and exports are shifting to innovative and creative industries. A generation of westernised engineers and programmers with a global outlook now underpins the country's emergence as the technology capital of the Balkans.

Computer science and engineering graduates are no longer migrating in droves to the US and Germany. Local companies employ about 40,000 software engineers while the IT sector contributes more than 3 per cent of the country's output, compared with less than 1 per cent four years ago.

"Bulgaria is an interesting hub for IT development with higher-quality [people] and lower costs than elsewhere in Europe," says Asparuh Koev, chief executive of Transmetrics, an award-winning start-up that uses big data and predictive analytics to improve efficiency in the transport industry.

Sofia and Plovdiv, Bulgaria's second city, have become flourishing outsourcing centres , providing jobs for thousands of IT graduates. Some of these go on to develop products that attract the attention of technology watchers and foreign venture capitalists.

Innovation is what sets Bulgarian outsourcing companies apart, according to Dimitar Mantchev, managing director of Programista, a software developer based in Sofia and Plovdiv. "You make customised software and build a client base, then one of your teams develops a new product and you grow much faster."

Bulgarian IT skills were born under communism. Its state-owned electronics companies specialised in computer hardware and basic programming for the Soviet bloc countries. "It's a strength that we've already had two generations of engineers with a strong R&D background," says Daniel Tomov, founder of Eleven, an accelerator fund backed by the EIF and the Jeremie programme.

Until this year, a lack of venture capital had left fast-growing start-ups short of funding. But the situation has now improved because investors are willing to commit more cash, says Lyuben Belov, co-founder of Launchub, which has backed more than 40 start-ups using EU funds.

Mr Belov is setting up Launchub Ventures, a  ¬20m fund with private backers, to provide up to  ¬1.5m of funding for later-stage companies. "We have all the ingredients of a successful ecosystem - mentors, recycled capital, angel investors and investment funds. And there are about 30 companies that are doing really well with 30-50 employees and revenues above  ¬2m."

Neveq Capital Partners, which has pioneered investments in Bulgarian IT companies, has launched a fund supported by the EIF to invest between  ¬300,000 and  ¬3m in local start-ups targeting the global market. Its portfolio has more than a dozen businesses, among them Vayant, a leader in airfare search technology backed by Lufthansa.

"Funding is still going to be a challenge for later-stage companies but international venture capital funds are showing more interest," says Pavel Ezekiev, a partner at Neveq.

Yet some entrepreneurs worry that a looming skills shortage risks undermining Bulgaria's regional IT hub hopes.

"Universities don't have the resources to teach cutting-edge skills so we're going to face a situation where demand outstrips supply," says Roddy Dervishev, founder of Sibiz, which designs high-performance microchips.

A 13-year veteran of Silicon Valley who came back home, Mr Dervishev is one of several leading entrepreneurs committed to sponsoring IT facilities at Bulgarian universities.

Some industry watchers insist the only way for Bulgaria to sustain growth is to source IT skills from outside the EU, from neighbouring Serbia and Macedonia and even Russia and Ukraine.

The country is also attracting businesses to move here. Last year Vlad Ellis moved his company, Speedflow Communications, which provides customised billing software and voice-overinternet-protocol services for international telecoms operators, from Ukraine to Bulgaria. Half his 50-strong workforce moved with him.

Now based in Plovdiv, Mr Ellis says: "The costs are a bit higher but there are talented people here and you don't have political risk."

Darin Madzharov, studying for a PhD in computer science in Belgium, was growing impatient with his sister s calls on Skype seeking help with her Sofia high school science course. So he responded with a stream of video tutorials, which her classmates and friends snapped up.

 They became so popular that I gave up my PhD, came back to Sofia and launched an educational website,  the 28-year-old says.

His site, "http://ucha.se/" ( learn  in Bulgarian) took off thanks to  ¬30,000 in funding from Launchub, a local accelerator backed by the European Investment Fund (EIF) and the EU s Jeremie tech start-up programme. Two Bulgarian angel investors came up with  ¬200,000 in a further raising and this year Ucha.se is set to make a profit.

 For 70 lev ( ¬35), the price of a meal, you can sign up for a year s worth of lessons covering any national curriculum subject,  says Mr Madzharov.

Bulgaria is striving to catch up with central Europe, where economies based on low-cost manufacturing and exports are shifting to innovative and creative industries. A generation of westernised engineers and programmers with a global outlook now underpins the country s emergence as the technology capital of the Balkans.

Computer science and engineering graduates are no longer migrating in droves to the US and Germany. Local companies employ about 40,000 software engineers while the IT sector contributes more than 3 per cent of the country s output, compared with less than 1 per cent four years ago.

 Bulgaria is an interesting hub for IT development with higher-quality [people] and lower costs than elsewhere in Europe,  says Asparuh Koev, chief executive of Transmetrics, an award-winning start-up that uses big data and predictive analytics to improve efficiency in the transport industry.

Sofia and Plovdiv, Bulgaria s second city, have become flourishing outsourcing centres, providing jobs for thousands of IT graduates. Some of these go on to develop products that attract the attention of technology watchers and foreign venture capitalists.

Innovation is what sets Bulgarian outsourcing companies apart, according to Dimitar Mantchev, managing director of Programista, a software developer based in Sofia and Plovdiv.  You make customised software and build a client base, then one of your teams develops a new product and you grow much faster. 

Bulgarian IT skills were born under communism. Its state-owned electronics companies specialised in computer hardware and basic programming for the Soviet bloc countries.  It s a strength that we ve already had two generations of engineers with a strong R&D background,  says Daniel Tomov, founder of Eleven, an accelerator fund backed by the EIF and the Jeremie programme.

Until this year, a lack of venture capital had left fast-growing start-ups short of funding. But the situation has now improved because investors are willing to commit more cash, says Lyuben Belov, co-founder of Launchub, which has backed more than 40 start-ups using EU funds.

Mr Belov is setting up Launchub Ventures, a  ¬20m fund with private backers, to provide up to  ¬1.5m of funding for later-stage companies.  We have all the ingredients of a successful ecosystem   mentors, recycled capital, angel investors and investment funds.

Vista Blazes Past $8 Billion Target for Latest Tech Buyout Fund; The vehicle reached $8.9 billion mark in August as technology market continues to lure investors

Vista Equity Partners collected at least $8.9 billion in investor commitments for its flagship private-equity fund this summer in a year that technology has become private equity's most popular target.

The Austin, Texas, firm, which could raise about $10 billion for the fund, exceeded the initial $8 billion goal for its largest-ever war chest for software and information technology buyout deals.

Vista Equity Partners Fund VI LP hit the $8.9 billion mark in August, according to an investor memorandum.

The firm's latest buyout fund is expected to focus on companies valued between $400 million and $5 billion. Although the fund will make equity investments of $200 million to $1 billion, Vista has the firepower to do bigger deals and to pool capital with co-investors.

Vista the firm behind big-ticket bets on insurance software maker Solera Holdings Inc. and data analytics company Tibco Software Inc. has been shifting its focus to larger businesses in recent years, according to the investor document.

As the firm looks to edge out rivals, Vista of late also has used more debt in its deals, according to the memo.

The firm in September said it would "http://www.wsj.com/articles/infoblox-to-be-taken-private-in-1-6-billion-deal-1474289517" in a $1.6 billion deal. Earlier this year, Vista said it took private digital marketing company Marketo Inc. for around $1.8 billion and said it would acquire Cvent Inc., a cloud-based event management company, for $1.65 billion.

Large take-private transactions with high multiples aren't new for private-equity firms that invest in software and technology. With a limited number of larger private companies to buy and recent pressure to put capital to work, private-equity firms could do more of these deals.

Technology-focused funds raised more than $50 billion in each of the years 2014 and 2015, according to data provider Preqin Ltd. As private-equity players jostle to put this dry powder to work, this raises new risks firms will have to pay more to beat the competition.

The industry poured $55.65 billion into announced technology deals in 2016 through Oct. 12, and is closing in on the roughly $61 billion it deployed in the sector last year, according to data provider Dealogic Ltd. Technology businesses made up the largest share of private equity's global deal volume this year.

Thoma Bravo, another private-equity investor active in the software space, recently said it "http://www.wsj.com/articles/thoma-bravo-raises-7-6-billion-for-latest-flagship-fund-1473704895". Vista's latest fund has drawn keen interest as well. It held a "http://www.wsj.com/articles/vista-equity-sets-10-billion-upper-limit-for-new-fund-1458129602" raising an amount in excess of its 2014 fund.

Launched by Robert Smith and Brian Sheth in 2000, Vista got its start with key commitments from the A. Eugene Brockman Charitable Trust, said a person familiar with the matter. The firm in recent years has expanded into new areas, launching a strategy for smaller deals, a credit arm and a hedge fund along the way.

Everyone's Worst Investing Fears; With assets in a funk, interest rates at zero and IPOs scarce, what's capital to do?

Snapchat is not about to disappear this newspaper "http://www.wsj.com/articles/snapchat-parent-working-on-ipo-that-could-value-company-at-25-billion-or-more-sources-1475778314" earlier this month that the firm may go public next year with a $25 billion valuation. Don't you wish you had invested at a $500 million value? Lots of investors underwater this year sure do.

Last month Perry Capital, which peaked with $15 billion under management in 2007, closed its flagship fund. Richard Perry, a Robert Rubin protg, "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2016-09-26/why-richard-perry-is-closing-his-main-hedge-fund" in a recent letter to investors that "this market environment has not worked well for us." Really? The Dow is now within a hair of its all-time high.

Some 10,000 hedge funds invest almost

"http://www.barclayhedge.com/research/indices/ghs/mum/HF_Money_Under_Management.html". More funds closed than opened over the last year. With $20 billion in assets, Lansdowne Partners is down almost 15% this year. The Rhode Island State Investment Commission is cutting hedge-fund holdings by half, following Calpers dropping hedge funds altogether last year. What's going on? This isn't a nasty bear market.

So many asset classes are in a funk. Macro investing, making bets based on major geopolitical trends, was all the rage over the last 25 years. But George Soros breaking the Bank of England is a thing of the past. Debt is now monetized rather than rationalized. There is a glut of commodities from forests to food. Energy is fracked. Private equity probably peaked a few years ago, but it hasn't yet marked to market. And bonds? When you have to pay Germany to own its sovereign bonds, it is tough to make money. That leaves stocks.

Equity investors have loved lower interest rates, because they make stocks more attractive than bonds and increase the value of future earnings. But at zero and even negative interest rates, it is a mess. Think of zero rates as a compass that can't point north and only spins around. Dividend-discount models to value stocks are driven by a discount rate that at zero makes every stock worth infinity. So stocks look cheap, even though they've never been more expensive.

What to do? The first rule of investing, unlike Fight Club, is that there are no rules. Investing is like fashion. What's hot and what's not changes at the whim of the market. It used to be every fund owned Apple, until it stopped working. Right now we are in what CNBC's Jim Cramer calls a Fang market, because of the power of Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Google has done the worst of the bunch since January 2015 up only 50%. Netflix and Amazon have both doubled. In an economy with 2% GDP growth, not much else works.

Tomorrow's fashion? If I knew for sure, I'd be on a Bora Bora beach. But I can point to the right neighborhood. It's the New over the Old. New productive companies destroying the old ways of doing business.

The market does the dirty work, providing access to capital for those it thinks will be the next wave of great companies. It starves those in decline. This is why BlackBerry doesn't make phones and why General Motors is throwing good money after bad into technology and partners for autonomous vehicles. SoFi is hurting banks.

But even being the New can be fleeting. Apple's iTunes stung music companies by offering reasonably priced songs instead of full albums. And now streaming companies like Spotify offer unlimited music for $10 a month. The Newer destroying the New. I call this Lily Pad investing: You've got to hop from one company to another before the first one drowns. But it's hard.

Finding the next wave of hot companies can be a pain in the assets. The minor leagues for this crop of the New is often venture capital. The New firms are then swallowed up by public investors during initial public offerings. Yet companies are staying private much longer. There is no public market for SoFi or Spotify. Thanks to "financial reform" acts like Sarbanes-Oxley and Dodd-Frank, the market for IPOs has been a ghost town.

Trillions in assets are itching to invest in these markets, but for now investors are stuck with firms that are under attack. Try to find investment in virtual reality, genome editing, drones, voice-control interfaces, artificial intelligence, chatbots or robots. Even immunotherapy and gene-therapy investments are far and few between. These companies become billion-dollar unicorns because they stay private. And not all of them will work. Hyperloop is aptly named.

Just recently, the IPO window has cracked open in a small way. Nutanix an integrator of servers and storage that hopes to destroy Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Dell EMC saw its stock almost triple in the first few days of trading last week. Earlier IPOs would sure be nice.

The king of the New, Uber founder Travis Kalanick, remarked at a German technology conference this summer, "I say we are going to IPO as late as humanly possible. It'll be one day before my employees and significant others come to my office with pitchforks and torches. We will IPO the day before that. Do you get it?" And that tells you why so many are showing such runty returns.

Mr. Kessler, a former hedge-fund manager, is the author of "Eat People" (Portfolio, 2011).

Mulling Bold Bets, VCs Do More Vetting Via Science; Investors shaken by high-profile blowups seek out new means of due diligence

Before bankrolling Freenome Inc. this year, Andreessen Horowitz took the company's diagnostic technology for a test drive.

Freenome aims to catch nascent cancers by analyzing genetic material in blood. Seeking validation, Andreessen sent the startup in South San Francisco, Calif., five blood samples to see if it could distinguish between normal and cancer-containing ones. Freenome passed the test, and Andreessen led a $5.55 million financing in June.

"They got everything right," Andreessen General Partner Vijay Pande said. An accurate test could detect cancers that are curable if caught early, he said. Mr. Pande himself is a former researcher in computational methods applied to biology and medicine.

Scandals at startups promising scientific breakthroughs or other innovations have refocused venture capitalists' attention on due diligence and prompted some firms to consider new means of vetting the people, processes and technologies of companies before they invest. While always fundamental to venture capital, due diligence takes on added significance as entrepreneurs are forcing investors to pick the winners out of a growing mass of likely also-rans.

Some technology investors are moving outside their expertise to search for the next massive hit, in hot areas like digital health, autonomous vehicles or artificial intelligence pushing the issue of diligence to the forefront.

Andreessen Horowitz's checkup on Freenome isn't common practice but it illustrates the lengths that a firm can go to validate a brand new technology.

With venture capital flowing, investors often feel pulled between deciding quickly when a hot startup is fundraising vs. ensuring a high-quality bet.

"Sometimes the more diligence you do the more you can talk yourself out of [an investment]," said Matt Murphy, managing director of Menlo Ventures. "You want to make sure you get the right people and the right strong signal. That's the art of diligence. It's not a volume game."

The game is more about marshaling resources to answer critical questions. In biotechnology, investors call on a growing network of research groups for hire in evaluating potential drugs.

Third-party evaluations help investors spot and kill programs that seem likely to fail. This is important because academic research is often tough to reproduce, according to an American Society for Cell Biology survey in 2014.

Founders Fund used outside experts when vetting cancer drugmaker Stemcentrx Inc., which aimed to kill tumor stem cells. AbbVie Inc. bought Stemcentrx in June for $9.8 billion after clinical trials showed the approach could work.

"Because this was a new field that we didn't have as much expertise in, and what they were doing was cutting edge, we brought in people from our network who understood the cancer space very well, and did diligence on the company very well," partner Scott Nolan said.

One market drawing increased scrutiny is digital health. Venture firms pumped $4.5 billion into the intersection of health and technology last year, up from $4.3 billion in 2014, according to Rock Health.

Tech entrepreneurs moving into medicine have fueled much of the growth. Yet health-care newbies are often surprised at the industry's complexity and long sales cycles, some investors said. One diligence red flag is the tech entrepreneur who won't hire experienced health-care hands for fear they represent old-line thinking, said Tom Rodgers, head of McKesson Ventures.

Startups need people who understand the politics and budget constraints of health-care customers.

"Strong commercial execution," Mr. Rodgers said, "will sadly almost always trump better technology in health care."

Diligence doesn't end once an investment is made. Venture capitalists sitting on boards guard against poor business practices from undermining the company. Michael Greeley, general partner of Flare Capital Partners, said he expects boards will go beyond standard financial audits and call in outside experts to review startups' technology and operations.

Investors want to push companies to adhere to best practices and erase activities that could lead to malfeasance or fraud. Adds Mr. Greeley: "The board doesn't want to be caught uninformed."

Global Finance: ATMs Try to Stop Wave of Cybertheft

By Robin Sidel

The ATM is the newest front in the war against cyberthieves.

A year after millions of U.S. merchants began installing equipment at the checkout line to accept credit and debit cards with security chips, the automated teller machine is getting similar technology.

The move comes as thieves increasingly target ATMs. While chip-enabled credit cards are expected to slow growth in fraud at the checkout counter, the number of ATMs compromised by criminals jumped more than sixfold from 2014, according to a recent report from FICO, a credit-score provider and analytics firm.FICO says the number of 2015 compromises was the highest it ever recorded, though it declined to disclose specific numbers.

The burst of ATM-related fraud also was the largest one-year increase since FICO started keeping track of such data about a dozen years ago. Meanwhile, rates of credit-card fraud, a more popular scheme for criminals, have largely leveled off.

The push to make ATMs more secure takes on added significance this month: Under MasterCard Inc.'s network rules, ATM operators onOct. 21 will become liable for any fraud costs that occur if a MasterCard chip-enabled card is used at a machine that isn't equipped with chip technology. That cost is currently borne by the card-issuing bank. Visa Inc. makes a similar shift next October.

The shift to more secure ATMs is expected to tackle the growing problem known as skimming, by which criminals rig a machine with a device that can steal a customer's card data, often including the personal identification number. The crook can then use the data to make a counterfeit card and drain the associated bank account.

The computer chip embedded in many new U.S. credit and debit cards fights such fraud by creating a one-time code for each transaction, limiting the ability of a thief to steal and replicate data.

"The U.S. market is definitely being targeted with card skimming," said Owen Wild, global marketing director for enterprise fraud and security at NCR Corp., one of the largest ATM makers. Nonbank ATMs account for 60% of recent incidents,up from 39% in 2014,the FICO analysis found.

Cyberthieves make at least 1.5 million illicit ATM cash withdrawals in the U.S. each year, according to consulting firm Tremont Capital Group. That figure represents a tiny fraction of the 5.8 billion ATM withdrawals consumers made in 2013, according to a Federal Reserve estimate.

Still, theft from ATM skimming can be more dangerous to consumers than credit-card fraud because the debit card is tied directly to a consumer's checking account. Banks will typically reimburse customers for losses, but the process can be complicated.

Cost is an issue for ATM operators; It typically costs between $300 and $700 to upgrade an existing ATMto accept chip cards, said Brad Daniel, president at America's ATM, a Plantation, Fla., company that maintains a fleet of the machines.

Everything ATM, an ATM operator and supplier basedin Brooklyn, N.Y., has requested 5,000 upgrade kits from a supplier but has only received 1,000 so far, said Jim Shrayef, principal at the firm. "I cannot get the product I need to satisfy the demand," he said.

So far, it appears that ATM operators are better prepared for the transition to chip cards than merchants that have grappled with challenges to get the equipment ready at the checkout line.

J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America Corp., which operate about 34,000 ATMs between them, say that most of their machines are ready to accept chip cards.

US bank earnings: 5 things to look out for

Analysts are expecting a downbeat earnings season from the US banks, which begin to report third-quarter numbers on Friday. Combined profits for the big six   JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley   are expected to fall about 9 per cent from the same period last year, to $20.1bn.

Here is what to look out for.

The Wells effect

Wells Fargo s sham-account scandal broke in the second week of September   too late to have much of an effect on the books of the US s biggest bank by loans, which has ground out at least $5bn of net profits for the past 15 quarters in a row.

Still, analysts will be keen to get a sense of how Wells assesses the damage to its core retail business, in the wake of a flood of lawsuits and probes triggered by its admission that it opened as many as 2m accounts without customers  consent. And they will also be watching the other banks closely, to see how far repercussions could spread.

Analysts say those pressure-cooker practices were probably not unique to the San Francisco-based bank. Two-thirds of Citi s US branches (481) are within one mile of a Wells branch, according to Barclays. At BofA (2,471) and JPMorgan Chase (2,359) the ratio is about one in two.

Meanwhile, Wells   under a new CEO, as of Thursday   appears to have the most still to lose. The bank has slipped two places in the rankings of the world s most valuable by market capitalisation, while its credit spreads have widened. Changes in the hierarchy of the big banks are  infrequent but tend to be sticky , said Robert Smalley, a credit analyst at UBS.

The mood on Main Street

As ever, the banks  earnings season provides a good opportunity to take the pulse of the US consumer. Some of the specialists in subprime lending   such as Ally Financial, in car loans, and Synchrony, in white-label credit cards   have said that some strains have emerged, particularly in their lower-quality portfolios. But what about borrowers further up the credit spectrum? Are rising delinquencies limited to areas hit by the big fall in the oil price over the past couple of years?

Brighter debt trading

Banks  fixed-income sales and trading departments have pumped out mostly grim updates over the past five years   a period in which the total industry pool of revenues has roughly halved, according to Coalition, thanks to post-crisis regulatory curbs, a shift to electronic trading, and stop-start activity among clients.

But the bulletin should be better this time. Analysts expect Goldman and Morgan Stanley to report combined net income of $2.82bn for the quarter, 24 per cent higher than a year ago, thanks to greater primary issuance in the credit markets and tighter spreads.

According to David Konrad, an analyst at Macquarie in New York, Morgan Stanley is likely to deliver on its pledge of making at least $1bn a quarter in FICC revenues, increasing investor confidence that it will hit its main profit target of a double-digit return on equity by the end of next year.

The return of litigation risk

Deutsche Bank is fretting over a big settlement with the US Department of Justice over the alleged mis-selling of mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the crisis. But for the big US banks, almost all of the Lehman-era matters appear to be in the rear-view mirror.

But that does not mean that new threats are not lurking. The third quarter saw 327 new securities-case filings, according to Lex Machina, an analytics company   the highest quarterly total since 2009, and about one-third higher than the quarterly average since 2011.

Meanwhile, many banks will be anxious about spillover effects from the Wells scandal. Many have pushed aggressively into new business lines in recent years, as they struggled to offset the profit-sapping effects of a flat yield curve. Do the incentives they offered salespeople now look a little dubious?

One bank already in hot water is Morgan Stanley, which has been accused of running sales contests in its stock-based loan business, pitting advisers against each other in a quest to convince customers to borrow against their investment portfolios. The Massachusetts Office of the Secretary of the Commonwealth Securities Division filed a complaint against the bank this month, highlighting what it saw as flaws in compliance and supervisory oversight.

In a statement, the bank said the complaint was without merit.  The securities-based loan accounts were opened only after discussing the product with each client and obtaining their affirmative consent,  it said.

Too-low ROEs

However low the valuation multiples attached to the shares of the big US banks, they remain huge profit machines. Since 2013, notes Mr Kotowski of Oppenheimer, the top six banks have combined to generate an average of $31.4bn of pre-tax earnings every quarter. In the first half of this year, just one of the six   Citi   earned more than Amazon, Facebook and Merck combined.

But such is the level of capital that the banks are now forced to maintain, returns to shareholders remain well adrift of many management teams  targets. This quarter, return on equity figures will be under the microscope again   especially now that banks have done most of their post-crisis spending on compliance.

 We re finally hitting an inflection point,  said Joo-Yung Lee, head of the North American financial institutions group at Fitch Ratings. Capital and liquidity are hugely improved since the crisis, but  profitability continues to lag .

Octavio Marenzi, founder and CEO of Opimas, a Boston-based consultancy focusing on financial services, said that banks would need to consider much more drastic measures   such as exiting entire lines of businesses   as they seek to boost their ROEs.

 There s very little activity at the moment,  he said.  Some of them are trimming here and there but nobody has really seen how bleak things are.

Japanese internet and telecommunications giant SoftBank Group Corp. is teaming up with a Saudi sovereign-wealth fund to create a multibillion-dollar technology-investment fund, in a partnership that combines deep pockets with one of the world's most ambitious tech investors.

SoftBank, led by chief executive Masayoshi Son, is known for its bold and wide-ranging bets, ranging from Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and "http://www.wsj.com/articles/softbanks-operating-and-net-profit-fall-in-fourth-quarter-1462862493". to U.K. chip designer ARM Holdings PLC, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-arm-these-chips-dont-come-cheap-1468827781". On Friday, it announced plans to invest at least $25 billion over the next five years through a fund dubbed the SoftBank Vision Fund.

Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund may contribute an additional $45 billion over the next five years as the fund's lead partner, SoftBank said. SoftBank said in a statement that the company was in talks with "a few large global investors" who could "http://www.wsj.com/articles/softbanks-elephant-gun-packs-a-scare-1476438619" to become the world's "biggest investor" in technology over the next decade.

The ambitious plan lands as tech investors continue to plow record amounts of money into firms like Uber Technologies Inc., the world's most valuable startup at $68 billion, despite soaring valuations that have led many to worry that the sector is overheating.

SoftBank has also been stepping up its deal pace, pouring more than $45 billion into technology investments alongside co-investors over the past two years and putting its overseas investment operations into a separate unit earlier this year. Recent investments include participation in a $4.5 billion fundraising round for Chinese ride-hailing champion Didi Chuxing Technology Co. and "http://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-to-invest-1-billion-in-koreas-coupang-1433313934".

To help bulk up its war chest, SoftBank has cashed in some winning bets, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-to-sell-7-9-billion-of-alibaba-stock-1464731957", in which it has a 28% stake, and "http://www.wsj.com/articles/tencent-agrees-to-acquire-clash-of-clans-maker-supercell-1466493612" for $8.6 billion. But it has also borrowed heavily to finance many of its investments and its debt currently has a junk rating.

The addition of the Public Investment Fund boosts SoftBank's investment firepower. The fund is central to "http://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabias-cabinet-approves-economic-reform-package-1465252667". The plunge in crude prices since 2014 has hurt the finances of the kingdom, which depends on oil income for more than two-thirds of government revenue. Last year, Saudi Arabia's budget deficit was a record $98 billion, or 16% of gross domestic product.

The Saudi government is expanding the scope and size of the PIF, effectively turning it into a war chest for non-oil investments abroad. In June, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-raises-3-5-billion-from-saudi-fund-1464816529", its largest overseas bet. "http://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-approves-economic-reform-program-1461588979", which Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman estimated will eventually be worth nearly $3 trillion.

"The PIF is preparing for the twilight of the oil," said John Sfakianakis, a Riyadh-based economist with the Gulf Research Center. "They are looking for another success story like Alibaba."

SoftBank said its head of strategic finance, Rajeev Misra, will head the new fund, and that it has engaged former Deutsche banker Nizar Al-Bassam and ex-Goldman partner Dalinc Ariburnu for the project.

SoftBank, established in 1981 by Mr. Son, has a long history of investing in technology and telecommunications ventures. SoftBank was one of the earliest investors in Yahoo Corp., a bet that proved hugely successful and which the company largely cashed out of by the early 2000s. SoftBank first invested in Alibaba in 2000, when it put $20 million into the then tiny e-commerce company. Since then, "http://projects.wsj.com/alibaba/" worth $249 billion, making it Mr. Son's most successful bet.

During the past few years, Mr. Son has tried to give more order to SoftBank's investment operations, separating its overseas investments including Sprint from its domestic mobile businesses and putting it under the leadership of former Google executive Nikesh Arora. Mr. Arora "http://www.wsj.com/articles/arora-exits-softbank-pay-attention-to-the-deals-not-the-dealmaker-1466574258" after facing a barrage of criticism from investors.

After Mr. Arora's departure, Mr. Son has said he intends to invest in fields including smart robots, the "Internet of Things" and artificial intelligence areas he has said would be a focus for his company over the next 30 years.

Mr. Son has pledged big bucks elsewhere too. Last year, SoftBank formed a joint venture with India's Bharti Enterprises and Taiwan's Foxconn Technology Group to "http://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-forming-joint-venture-to-invest-in-renewable-energy-in-india-1434981343", although it is unclear how far the project has advanced since its inception. Mr. Son has also said he wants to invest as much as $10 billion in Indian tech companies and around $4.5 billion in South Korea's technology sector over the next decade.

Limits to Putting Nobel Winners' Work Into Practice

The research that earned the Nobel Prize in economics this week has been influential in fostering the use of performance-based pay for top executives, but not all of its insights have been taken on board, experts say.

Oliver Hart and Bengt Holmstrm "http://www.wsj.com/articles/nobel-prize-in-economics-awarded-to-oliver-hart-and-bengt-holmstrom-for-work-on-contract-theory-1476093193" for their research on contract theory, or how to optimally design explicit agreements mainly between firms and workers to maximize productivity. The advice boils down to linking pay to performance where it is both measurable and verifiable and has a tight link to individual effort, as long as that doesn't sacrifice other important outcomes.

Their work has helped underpin the growth in performance-linked pay, especially in financial services, where outcomes are often easier to measure and attribute to individuals. Consider asset managers' returns, traders' profits or the fees investment bankers generate.

Tying pay to performance was such a hot topic, partly because of their research, that in 1993 President Bill Clinton signed a law preventing managers' pay above $1 million from being tax-deductible unless it was "performance based."

Mr. Holmstrm, "http://www.npr.org/2016/10/12/497637786/nobel-prize-winners-demonstrate-importance-of-contracts", pointed to the Wells Fargo & Co. scandal over accounts opened without customers' knowledge as evidence of "creepy and manipulative" incentives. "They thought they were designing a good scheme. &If you raise the number of new accounts we are getting, that's our business model. You get rewarded. And before you knew it, you know they probably created new accounts initially genuine accounts," he said. "But then, you know, they ran out."

The structure of pay in financial services was heavily criticized in the wake of the financial crisis, prompting the "http://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/r_0904b.pdf" a stronger link between pay and risk-taking. "The bonus component of compensation has been much more variable upward in response to good performance than downward in response to poor performance," the global financial regulator noted.

Luigi Zingales, a finance professor at the University of Chicago, said the standards were "mostly window-dressing" that ignored the insights of Messrs. Holmstrm and Hart. "Their  informativeness principle' implies that in order to properly compensate people you need to put into the contract all the relevant variables, and this hasn't filtered through," Mr. Zingales said in an interview.

For instance, linking managers' pay to financial variables such as stock prices is "https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2016/advanced-economicsciences2016.pdf" if the effects of factors beyond the managers' control, such as macroeconomic or industrywide factors, are stripped out.

"When I was a board member I found enormous resistance to it because managers like to be compensated for luck, and because they know when times are bad, job contracts won't be rewritten," said Mr. Zingales, who had served on the board of Telecom Italia.

In finance, it is much easier to measure explicit and especially short-term financial outcomes than it is customer satisfaction, team morale or risk- taking, for example. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co.'s multibillion-dollar losses by a "http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303299604577326031119412436" highlight how incentivizing staff to focus on profits can come at the expense of risk management.

Richard Holden, an economics professor at the University of New South Wales and a former student of Mr. Hart's, said contracts linking pay to performance were rarely "optimal" for other reasons, too. "They typically don't internalize the potential costs of taking on more risk, either for shareholders, or especially in the case of banking, for the financial system and broader economy," he said points well illustrated by the financial crisis.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

CFTC Poised to Modify Source-Code Proposal

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/cftc-poised-to-modify-source-code-proposal-1476391721"is preparing to scale back controversial aspects of a regulatory plan to prevent automated trading glitches from roiling futures and derivatives markets, according to people familiar with the CFTC's thinking, though its new approach is unlikely to mollify critics.

The CFTC is expected as early as this month to float modifications to a proposal that would give the regulator access to the complex computer code that drives high-frequency trading firms' trading decisions, these people said.

Wells Fargo's Textbook Case of Botched Crisis Management

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargos-textbook-case-of-how-not-to-handle-a-crisis-1476380576"Fargo had been slow-footed in responding to outrage over employee behavior that included opening as many as 2 million unauthorized accounts without customer knowledge. It misjudged the significance of firing 5,300 employees over five years for related bad behavior, failing to tell its own board of the number before regulators made it public.

The botched response, a textbook example of how not to handle a crisis, reached a peak when Mr. Stumpf stepped down Wednesday after nearly 35 years at the bank and nine years as CEO. It was an ignominious end to a chief who had overseen Wells Fargo as it grew, at one point, to be the largest bank in the world by market value.

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/elizabeth-warren-to-obama-fire-sec-chief-mary-jo-white-1476439200" to dismiss Mary Jo White as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the latest  and the strongest push by the Massachusetts Democrat to criticize the top markets cop and to influence financial policy making.

While it's  highly  unlikely the Obama administration will oblige Ms. Warren in its final months, the request comes as the former Harvard law professor and other progressive Democrats seek to pull their party to the left and influence the selection of the next round of presidential appointees after the November election. The strategy builds on efforts by progressives to block Obama administration nominees seen as too close to big business.

SEC Delays Changes to Delivery of Mutual-Fund Reports

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-delays-changes-to-delivery-of-mutual-fund-reports-1476377737"is holding off on changing the way mutual funds distribute shareholder reports to their investors, punting on an issue that had become a pitched lobbying battle pitting paper manufacturers and their consumer advocate allies against the fund industry.

The result: Investors will keep getting hefty reports through the mail by default rather than automatically being signed up for digital delivery, unless they opt out of paper.

New SEC Rules Make It Harder for Firms to Manage Cash

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/new-rules-make-it-harder-for-companies-to-manage-their-cash-1476385011", which are set to kick in on Friday, have made life more difficult for corporate treasurers and chief financial officers. They face a sometimes unfamiliar array of investment options as they seek both to preserve and earn some return on their collective trillions.

The rules, which the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted in 2014, make prime money-market funds, which typically invest in short-term corporate and municipal debt, less attractive for corporate cash managers. Anticipating the new rules, investors have pulled money out of prime money-market funds at a rapid clip. Assets under management at those funds totaled $413.07 billion as of Wednesday, according to the Investment Company Institute. That's down 67% from $1.25 trillion at the start of the year.

Mr. Kashkari, who has spearheaded a year-long effort exploring how to address the problem of banks that are so big they pose a risk to the financial system, told an audience at the University of Montana that he will present his findings to the public at the Economic Club of New York with an opportunity for experts and the public to comment on a draft plan.

In his inaugural remarks on the content-sharing platform Medium, which the New York Fed joined Wednesday, Mr. Dudley said reforming the culture of the largest firms would support the long-term health of the banking system and it was imperative to get it right.

Stacy Canan was appointed assistant director in charge of the older Americans' office.

Analysis: China's Ballooning Mortgage Debt Built on Shaky Foundation

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-ballooning-mortgage-debt-built-on-shaky-foundation-1476440211", it's not the size of the debt but its speed that matters.

Seeking to quell worries that China's home-finance market has gotten out of hand, a banking regulator disclosed this week that the loan-to-value ratio in the housing market, or the ratio of the value of mortgage loans to the value of underlying property, was on average 55%. This isn't a figure the government regularly cites, so it's worth examining whether such a level is really safe.

U.S. News: ACA Ads Clash With GOP Message

By Stephanie Armour

WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration is planning to use television ads and direct mail to boost participation in the Affordable Care Act's exchanges in the coming open-enrollment period, but its timing will mean fighting for attention amid the noise of the election.

The ads, which are partly focused on the affordability of coverage under the law, will run headlong into campaigns by opponents of the law who are using their own political ads to denounce it as a costly boondoggle.

Republicans seeking to maintain their House and Senate majorities have latched onto a sharp rise in premiums for many consumers to rally voters to their side. Their offensive may hamper Health and Human Services Department's efforts to sell the ACA as effective and inexpensive.

Open enrollment for 2017 coverage begins Nov. 1, a week before Election Day. Consumers will be able to browse the plans about a week before open enrollment.

"It's going to be incredibly difficult," said Kip Cassino, executive vice president at Borrell Associates Inc., which analyzes political advertising. "HHS is going to have a real problem until the election takes place. It's too intertwined into the political process."

HHS officials say they are confident they can use the experience of the last three years to reach people. Increasing enrollment, especially among younger and healthier consumers, is critical to stabilizing a market that has experienced higher-than-expected health-care costs. Those costs have prompted some major insurers to cut back or leave the exchanges, and led many others to hike premiums for 2017.

The Obama administration will increase its targeted outreach, HHS officials said Thursday in a call with reporters. The administration plans to send out 10 million pieces of direct mail, up from about 800,000 last year.

They will target people who were recently uninsured, lost coverage, or sought coverage in the past through HealthCare.gov or a state Medicaid program, officials said.

HHS also plans to contact the more than 20 million people who have visited HealthCare.gov, the federal exchange website.

The messages will note that financial assistance will enable most consumers who buy coverage on the exchange to purchase a plan with a monthly premium between $50 and $100. Subsidies blunt the impact of higher premiums for many consumers on the exchanges.

Officials said they didn't have details on how much the outreach effort will cost.

There have been 32,686 ads critical of the ACA since Jan. 11, 2016, according to an analysis by Advertising Analytics, a data company in Alexandria, Va. More than $20 million has been spent on broadcast television ads opposing the law. The company has identified about 4,058 spots talking about the ACA by the Democrats.

ICAP buys 70% stake in Abide Financial buys 70% stake in

ICAP is stepping up its transformation into market infrastructure provision by purchasing the 70 per cent it did not own in Abide Financial, a Bristol-based trade reporting specialist.

The London interdealer broker is close to selling its global broking business to rival Tullett Prebon, after which it will become NEX Group and focus on electronic trading and plumbing for over-the-counter markets.

ICAP did not disclose the price for Abide, although it spent 7m to acquire a 30 per cent stake last year via its fintech venture capital arm Euclid. The five-year old Abide will become a subsidiary of ICAP s Post Trade Risk and Information division. Collin Coleman, Abide s chief executive, will report to Jenny Knott, chief executive of PTRI.

Market participants face successive layers of tougher standards to report off-exchange deals, including greater responsibilities and costs for institutional investors, fund managers and pension funds.  For many of our clients it is preferable to outsource their trade and transaction reporting requirements to ICAP and increasing numbers are doing exactly that,  said Ms Knott.

Abide has become one of Europe s largest reporting utilities, with approval to process equities and energy deals. It has also applied with European regulators to become a trade repository for over-the-counter derivatives.

The move extends ICAP s push into emerging fintech companies. Earlier this year it bought the 58 per cent it did not own in Enso Financial Analytics, a data analytics provider for hedge funds and prime brokers. ICAP had spent roughly 15m in amassing a 42 per cent stake since 2013.

Last week it participated in a $16m fundraising for OpenGamma, a US risk analytics software provider, in which it has a 15 per cent stake. The Euclid venture capital arm also has invested in Digital Asset Holdings, a blockchain technology provider, this year.

Falfurrias Collects $237 Million for Fund III, Eyes $300 Million Cap

Falfurrias Capital Partners has surpassed the $225 million target for its third fund, closing on at least $237 million so far, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Falfurrias expects to hold another closing before the end of the year, however, which should take the fund closer to the $275 million mark, said a person familiar with the fundraising.

The firm plans to cap Falfurrias Capital Partners III LP at $300 million, this person added. The amount raised so far for Fund III already makes it the firm's largest vehicle to date and nearly double the size its prior fund, which wrapped up with $126 million in 2013.

Shannon Advisors LLC is placing the fund, according to the filing.

Falfurrias targets investments in companies with between $3 million and $25 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to its website.

The firm already has backed one deal out of Fund III, the person said. In late September, it invested in Marquis Software Solutions Inc., a Plano, Texas, provider of data analytics software and services that help financial institutions, primarily midtier banks and credit unions, identify marketing opportunities and meet and monitor compliance requirements.

Falfurrias, of Charlotte, N.C., was founded in 2006 by Hugh McColl Jr., the former chairman and chief executive of Bank of America Corp., and Marc Oken, formerly the chief financial officer of the bank.

Leverage Ratio Runs Counter to Policy Objectives; New paper from Federal Financial Analytics  predict ratio will have unintended effects

The enhanced supplementary leverage ratio for banks functions as a "binding constraint for the majority of assets" held by global systemically important banks in the U.S., according to a "http://www.fedfin.com/images/stories/client_reports/FedFin by Federal Financial Analytics Inc., a financial research firm. The Federal Reserve and two other regulators completed a rule on the supplementary leverage ratio in 2013, requiring bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to significantly boost the amount of capital they hold as protection against every loan, investment, building, security and other asset on their books, not just the risky ones. Compliance with the rule isn't required until 2018. The Federal Financial Analytics paper says the binding leverage rule runs counter to regulatory policy objectives laid out in the supplementary leverage ratio, and there are dangers that come with "divorcing total U.S. regulatory capital from economic risk." The researchers predict that the ratio will have unintended effects, including ones that adversely affect risk-taking, market liquidity and monetary-policy transmission as the rule "becomes an increasingly binding constraint." They also predict that it will lead to "accelerated migration of financial-intermediation services outside the banking sector."

Venture Investing Picks Up But Dollars Invested Still Down

The venture-capital market may be thawing after a chilly winter, investors say.

U.S. venture-capital dollars invested in the third quarter of 2016 fell sharply from a year ago, driven by a drop in massive late-stage deals, continuing a trend from the beginning of this year.

Venture capitalists poured $11.7 billion into 956 deals in the third quarter, a drop of 41.6% by dollars and 5.6% by deals from the year-ago period, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. Last year during the third quarter, there were such large deals as Social Finance's $1 billion investment led by SoftBank and Avant's $325 million "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120151015ebaf01kvo".

Venture firms aren't having trouble raising funds, so investors are ready to make investments, despite the slow down at the late stage, said Keval Desai, partner at InterWest Partners.

Investors have been shifting their attention to new hot categories such as machine learning, computer vision, virtual reality and augmented reality, he said. "Early stage has been pretty healthy and deals are getting done at the seed and Series A level," Mr. Desai said.

However, there is less uncertainty in the market than earlier this year when there was a strong pull back in the public markets and in venture capital. The number of venture deals invested in the third quarter increased 6.0% from 868 deals in the second quarter of 2016. Dollars invested dropped 27.7% from $16.2 billion in the second quarter.

Health care was one area that has remained stable. Investors invested $3.2 billion into health care in the third quarter, up from $3.1 billion in the second quarter but down slightly from $3.6 billion in the year-ago period. The number of health care deals dropped to 186 from 196 in the previous quarter and slightly up from 181 in the year-ago period.

Dollars invested into later-stage deals dropped 45.1% from $12.8 billion a year ago to $7.0 billion in the third quarter, despite the number of later-stage deals dipping slightly from 332 to 324. This indicates that the massive later stage deals of last year have become more rare.

Early this year some tech company stocks in the public markets dropped sharply and the venture market also slowed, said David Yuan, general partner at growth stage firm TCV. But that has started to shift with more reasonable valuations for private companies and with recent IPOs such as Nutanix and Twilio, Mr. Yuan said. "I think we're in a transition phase here. We've seen activity pick up considerably."

Some rationality has returned to the venture investing market, said Ben Narasin, partner at Canvas Venture Partners. "People faced a lot of headwinds over the last three quarters," said Mr. Narasin. "But now we've moved into a calm sea with an occasional gust of wind."

Some trendy sectors are seeing very competitive deals, such as artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, insurance technology and security, Mr. Narasin said.

"All of a sudden just as we're feeling a little saturated with the mobile app economy, which was the driving factor the last five years, now we've got new market segments such as machine learning," Mr. Desai said.

At the seed stage, seed volume is very active, said Josh Felser, co-founder at Freestyle Capital. But the larger top seed firms are making less investments while writing larger checks, with seed rounds averaging $2 million to $3 million. This is due to companies needing to be larger and more advanced when raising Series A rounds, he said. In addition, there are many ways for companies to raise small "pre-seed" funds before coming to institutional seed firms.

"The volume of deals is down but there's so much seed capital flowing into the market," he said.

MParticle, a startup that allows business to pull data from multiple analytics platforms into a single dashboard, has raised a $17.5 million Series B. Bain Capital Ventures led the round, and returning investor Social Capital participated.

"We had heard about the company predominantly from a bunch of very happy clients," said Bain Capital Ventures Managing Director Scott Friend, who has joined mParticle's board. He said he invested after he saw that understanding and acting on marketing data was "the number-one challenge" for consumer companies in Bain Capital Venture's portfolio, which includes Rent the Runway, Jet.com and 4moms.

Bain Capital Ventures first met mParticle around the time of the company's December 2015 Series A, though it "sat on the sidelines" for that round, Mr. Friend said.

The New York-based company will spend the new funds on international expansion and continued research and development. In particular, mParticle's development team is working on technologies to improve tracking and acting on data about how individual users interact with a product across multiple screens, said Chief Executive and co-founder Michael Katz.

MParticle's customers include Airbnb, Foursquare, Hulu, Jet.com, Postmates, SeatGeek, SoulCycle and Spotify. The new round gives it a total of $37 million raised since its 2013 founding.

Big U.S. Banks Plan To Bail Themselves Out

By John Carney 
916 words
13 October 2016
The Wall Street Journal
J

Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

Regulators want to prevent taxpayers from having to ever again bail out big banks. The latest idea: Make the banks bail themselves out.

Previously, banks had struggled to persuade regulators they had a plan -- called a "living will" -- that would allow them to be dismantled and shut down if they got into trouble without taxpayers taking a hit. Now, banks are creating new structures that would allow their most important parts to keep functioning, even if the parent company had to file for bankruptcy. The aim is to avoid the kind of market chaos that could cause economic harm.

To this end, there was a small structural change in the public portions of living wills released last week by the biggest U.S. banks. This involved the creation of a holding company to sit between the shareholder-owned parent company and its subsidiaries.

The new companies will house resources meant to support banking and brokerage units in times of crisis. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. said it had created a new entity to fill this role, while Bank of America Corp. is using an existing subsidiary. Citigroup Inc. said it has similar plans.

The new entities will be a sort of emergency backup bank within the bank, a vehicle for internal bailouts.

The Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the two agencies that must sign off on living wills, pushed the banks to pursue the new type of holding company in April guidance, according to people familiar with the matter. The suggestion came from an eight-word phrase in a 23-page memo that received little attention outside of banks, they said. The Fed and FDIC declined to comment.

The change could cause unease among regulators outside the U.S. It potentially could lead banks to keep less capital at overseas subsidiaries and make it less likely they would support all their global operations in times of trouble.

The upshot could be a push by non-U.S. regulators to require banks to provide additional support locally for subsidiaries. That would mirror the approach U.S. regulators have taken toward the subsidiaries of foreign banks.

"The best and most transparent way to deal with this would be an international agreement among regulators," said Karen Petrou of research and advisory firm Federal Financial Analytics. "But those efforts have failed. Regulators can't agree. Each, quite reasonably, wants to protect the interests and financial systems of their home country."

Critics of the new approach said the creation of new entities is a move in the wrong direction.

"They try to fight complexity with more complexity," said Cornelius Hurley, director of the Boston University Center for Finance, Law & Policy.

Moreover, to some the undertaking drifts far from the original idea for living wills, created by the Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law. "We're just lurching from one idea to the next, creating a jerry-built system of financial regulation," Ms. Petrou said. The wills were originally envisioned in the wake of the financial crisis as a way to make it possible for a big bank to fail without a taxpayer bailout.

The latest wills were drafted in response to faults cited by the Fed and FDIC in banks' 2015 plans. The stakes are high. The wills' process gives the regulators enormous power; in an extreme case, the Fed and FDIC could order the breakup of a big bank even before it runs into any trouble.

The wills now revolve around a scenario in which the parent holding company of a failing firm enters into bankruptcy. Meanwhile, its subsidiaries -- commercial banks, broker-dealers, merchant banks -- survive and are protected.

This is done by moving capital and funds to the subsidiaries, even as the parent holding company fails. That protects creditors and counterparties of the subsidiaries, a move it is hoped that prevents the kind of turmoil that followed the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.

Regulators support that general idea, but have been critical of how it would work in practice. Moving capital and funds between subsidiaries in a time of stress can be tricky.

When the parent runs into trouble, creditors and regulators may seek to prevent resources from being moved between a firm's various arms, regulators have warned banks. This is particularly problematic for global banks; foreign regulators or local creditors may attempt to protect resources to shield subsidiaries or branches in their home country.

Regulators in their April guidance told banks to keep sufficient resources in subsidiaries to deal with potential problems and be prepared for the parent company to deploy funds as needed.

Regulators cautioned this has its own problems. First, it is almost impossible to know where a problem will emerge and to have the right amount of resources at the right subsidiary. Second, keeping assets at the parent holding company increases the chance an outside creditor could try to grab them in bankruptcy.

That is where the new entities come into play. They will hold resources that can be rushed to support subsidiaries. But they won't have liabilities to outside parties, such as debt, and will be based in the U.S. That will make it harder for outside creditors or foreign regulators to try to grab assets.

The important thing is that this will happen now or in the near future, not when a crisis is a hand.

GV Leads $28M Series B in Wireless Provider Mist

GV, formerly known as Google Ventures, has led a $28 million Series B investment in Mist Systems Inc., a startup that aims to improve mobile device connections and location services.

Cupertino, Calif.-based Mist provides a kind of Bluetooth technology that can communicate with wireless devices via a virtual beacon, rather than physical beacons. "https://mist.com/" uses machine learning to improve and automate functions like tracking the location of a mobile device.

Mist's customers include Stanford Law School, University of California Los Angeles Medical Center, Bowdoin College, as well as hotels, entertainment venues and corporate offices interested in making use of location-based data as customers move around their site.

GV partner and Mist board member Karim Faris predicts just about every business will ask, "How can life be improved if location is attached to what we're doing?" He said Mist provides the kind of wireless web needed as more businesses invest in location-based internet-of-things use cases.

As policy, GV doesn't make strategic bets for Google parent Alphabet Inc. Such a service, however, could dovetail with Alphabet's business goals. For example, Google Fiber, its unit focused on high-speed web service, found that laying fiber-optic cables proved far more expensive than anticipated, and the company is "http://www.wsj.com/articles/googles-high-speed-web-plans-hit-snags-1471193165" to connecting homes in wireless efforts.

Also, Alphabet has recently upped its bets in connected devices, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/google-to-detail-amazon-echo-fighter-called-home-new-phones-1475592365" smart home device Google Home and phone Pixel earlier this month.

Mr. Faris said he wouldn't be surprised if Alphabet partnered with Mist in some fashion. "Google cares about reliable wireless networks. They care about location," Mr. Faris said.

With the new funding, the company has raised a total of $43 million. Lightspeed Venture Partners, Norwest Venture Partners and Cisco Investments also participated in the round. The Series B includes a $5 million "http://www.wsj.com/articles/cisco-backs-wireless-tech-startup-mist-1468927806" that Cisco's venture arm announced earlier this summer.

Aon Makes a Bet on Cybersecurity --- Exposure to potential hacking becomes a business opportunity for insurers, brokers

Aon PLC has agreed to acquire cybersecurity specialist Stroz Friedberg Inc., as more insurance companies and brokers aim to turn corporations' exposure to potential hacking into a business opportunity.

The companies didn't disclose terms of the deal in the announcement on Tuesday.

Stroz Friedberg was founded in 2000 by a former agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and a former federal prosecutor, both of whom worked on computer crime. The New York City-based firm, which has more than 550 employees world-wide, will augment Aon's risk-mitigation services, while also providing insights to help insurers expand and create new cyber offerings, the firms said in interviews.

World-wide, property-casualty insurers sold an estimated $2 billion to $3 billion of cyberrisk coverage in 2015, mostly in the U.S., according to industry estimates.

Cyber insurance can be obtained from about 50 insurers, with such purchases increasing by 27% in 2015, compared with the year before, on top of a 32% increase in 2014, according to a report by Marsh & McLennan Cos. earlier this year.

Aon is one of the world's biggest insurance brokerages and is a benefits consultant. Insurance brokers are middlemen who work on behalf of companies as they buy insurance, and many develop expertise in specific types of risk to make their services more valuable to policyholders.

They also work with insurers to help them design policies that address clients' needs.

Aon executives said the acquisition reflects an urgency on the part of the insurance industry to respond to clients who increasingly are worried about hacking that could damage their operations, as risk spreads far beyond the retailing industry and the credit-card data that many cyberthieves covet, to factory floors, power plants and even semiautonomous vehicles.

"There is a need front and center, in our face every day, and it is growing in magnitude," Aon Chief Executive Gregory Case said in an interview Monday.

Industry executives said there is a race within the insurance industry to find ways to help clients understand and model cyberrisk. American International Group Inc., and other insurers and brokers have made investments in or joined with cyberrisk specialty firms in recent years.

Marsh & McLennan's Marsh brokerage unit, a rival to Aon, has a collaboration with Cyence, a cybersecurity analytics firm, to help the broker's clients quantify and manage cyberrisk.

Within cyber insurance, growth was strongest among manufacturing firms in 2015, with a gain of 63% from the year before, Marsh said.

GE has agreed to pay  ¬1.5bn to acquire LM Wind Power, a Danish maker of rotor blades for wind turbines, as it seeks to expand its renewable energies unit.

The US giant is buying the company from Doughty Hanson, the London-based private equity group that has owned it since 2001.

The deal, subject to regulatory and governmental approvals, is expected to close in the first half of 2017 and GE said it should have a positive impact on earnings in 2018.

GE said it is attracted to renewables because the cost of power continues to fall and various governments are supporting low-carbon energy sources. It noted that power capacity from renewables grew by 50 per cent last year, with wind energy accounting for more than a third of the growth.

GE already uses components built by LM Wind Power. A spokesperson said the acquisition would  in-source  blade design and manufacturing for GE s Paris-based renewable energy unit, which was carved out last year when GE acquired the power businesses of Alstom for  ¬9.7bn.

 Increasingly, wind turbine innovation is driven by system design, materials science, and analytics   all elements of the GE Store,  Jrme Pcresse, chief executive of GE Renewable Energy, said in a press release.  We, along with LM Wind Power, have a deep pipeline of technical innovations that can further reduce the cost of electricity. 

LM Wind will retain its management, headquarters, and 13 production sites across eight countries. GE intends to run it as a separate business that will continue to make motor blades for other manufactures.

LM recorded  ¬750m in revenue last year and it has 1,800 employees.

Assets at Leon Cooperman s Omega shrink 25%

Assets under management at Leon Cooperman s Omega Advisors have dropped by about a quarter to $4bn after the hedge fund was ensnared in an insider trading probe by the US Securities and Exchange Commission.

When the SEC charged Mr Cooperman and Omega with insider trading on September 21, the fund managed $5.4bn. Investors, including the retirement plan for Goldman Sachs employees, have since withdrawn their money, despite Mr Cooperman s denial of the charges.

In one of the highest-profile cases since Steven Cohen s SAC Capital pleaded guilty to illegal trading three years ago, the SEC said Mr Cooperman  generated substantial illicit profits  of $4.1m by buying securities in Atlas Pipeline Partners, on the basis of inside information provided by a senior executive of the company.

Mr Cooperman, one of New York s highest-profile hedge fund managers, has been outspoken about his intention to fight the charges. The day the charges were announced, he hosted a conference call with prepared remarks, saying that he  could have settled this matter with the SEC for an amount of money that is far less than I donate to charity every year .

 But I refused to do so because of my belief that we acted appropriately and lawfully. 

Investors, including government pension plans, have publicly debated the value of their hedge fund investments in recent months, and have pulled more than $50bn from the sector this year, according to eVestment. That has brought total assets in the industry to just over $3tn.

Hedge Fund Research s HFRI Asset Weighted Composite index has risen in value by 0.5 per cent this year through September, compared with almost 7 per cent for a Barclays index of corporate and government bonds and 7.8 per cent for the S&P 500 index including dividends.

Mr Cooperman told Bloomberg on Tuesday that the SEC offered to settle the charges against him and Omega for $8m, but he declined.

Mr Cooperman has also said that the US Attorney in New Jersey s investigation of him and his firm is on hold,  pending the Supreme Court s decision in Salman v United States . Last week the Supreme Court began hearing that case, which could result in the biggest rewrite of insider trading law in decades.

The SEC has ramped up pressure on asset managers this year. The regulator said on Tuesday it recorded its most active year ever in 2015-16 for cases involving investment advisers or investment companies, with 160 such cases.

 By every measure the enforcement program continues to be a resounding success holding executives, companies and market participants accountable for their illegal actions,  said SEC chair Mary Jo White.

 Over the last three years, we have changed the way we do business on the enforcement front by using new data analytics to uncover fraud, enhancing our ability to litigate tough cases, and expanding the playbook bringing novel and significant actions to better protect investors and our market.

General Electric pays $1.65bn for LM Wind Power pays $1.65bn for

General Electric has agreed to pay $1.65bn to buy LM Wind Power of Denmark in a deal that strengthens the US industrial group s commitment to renewable energy.

LM, owned by Doughty Hanson, the London-based private equity firm, is one of the world s biggest producers of wind turbine blades, and supplies not only GE s existing renewables business but also rivals such as Gamesa of Spain and Goldwind of China.

"https://www.genewsroom.com/press-releases/ge-plans-capture-more-wind-165b-acquisition-lm-wind-power-global-designer-and" unveiled on Tuesday is the biggest since GE created a separate renewables division following its  ¬9.7bn acquisition last year of energy businesses belonging to Alstom of France. GE pledged at the time of the Alstom transaction to expand its green energy assets.

 It shows GE s strength and commitment to renewables,  said Jrme Pcresse, head of GE Renewable Energy, adding that the deal would increase efficiency in its turbine making business and ultimately help drive down the cost of wind power.

GE is in the process of a $200bn asset disposal programme as it faces shareholder pressure to slim down and improve returns, but renewable energy is one of the areas earmarked for investment by Jeff Immelt, chief executive.

GE intends to keep LM as a standalone business run by its existing management, selling to the wider turbine industry as well as supplying GE. It has 13 factories across Europe, the US, India and China.

Mr Pcresse said LM would benefit from access to GE s technology and supply chain, while the US group would gain its own blade manufacturing capability for the first time.

 Increasingly, wind turbine innovation is driven by system design, materials science, and analytics,  he added, noting that these were all areas of expertise for both companies.

GE is betting that the improving economies of scale for renewable power will continue to drive rapid uptake, reinforced by growing political support for action to tackle climate change. The US and China, the world s biggest carbon polluters, both last month ratified the 2015 Paris agreement on emissions reduction and the EU is fast-tracking its approval.

About half of all new electricity capacity added worldwide last year was renewable, according to GE. Wind represented 35 per cent of the total.

The cost of wind power has been falling quickly as volumes increase. This is increasing demand but also brings risks for manufacturers if governments conclude that green subsidies can be cut.

GE is among a group of turbine and power companies that jointly pledged in June to reduce the cost of offshore wind farms to  ¬80 per megawatt hour by 2025, close to half today s average levels.

This would bring the most expensive type of wind power closer to the cost of coal and gas power stations.

Bridge Growth Partners said it held a final close of its debut fundraising effort with $410 million of committed equity capital.

Bridge Growth Partners LP and a parallel fund, Bridge Growth Partners (Parallel) LP, closed on Sept. 30. Backers of the vehicle include insurance companies, family offices and high-net-worth individuals, according to a news release.

Although the firm didn't disclose a target in previous filings, The Wall Street Journal reported in November 2014 that the firm, which invests in the technology and technology-enabled financial services sectors, was seeking about $1 billion for its debut fundraising effort.

By January, the firm had raised at least $310.9 million combined for both the main and parallel fund, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing.

Bridge Growth also announced the appointment of Joseph M. Tucci, longtime chief executive of data storage company EMC Corp., as chairman.

Mr. Tucci has served on Bridge Growth's investment committee and advisory board since the firm's launch in 2013. He is the founder, co-CEO and co-chairman of GTY Technology Holdings Inc., a blank-check acquisition vehicle for acquiring technology companies. Before that, Mr. Tucci was CEO, chairman and president of EMC until its acquisition by computer company Dell Inc. in September.

The New York firm in the statement said it so far has invested about $330 million in three companies. In 2014, it bought CRGT Inc., a provider of software, data analytics and cybersecurity services to federal government agencies. In April, Bridge Growth acquired a majority interest in Solace Systems Inc., a company providing hardware and software for data distribution. Most recently, in September, the firm purchased educational software company Finalsite Holdings Inc. from Spectrum Equity.

E8 Security Inc. has raised $12 million in Series B funding.

A new Washington-based firm, Strategic Cyber Ventures, led the round. Existing investors March Capital Partners, Allegis Capital and The Hive also participated.

Last year, E8 Security launched its first product and brought on Matt Jones as chief executive to lead its go-to-market strategy. The Redwood City, Calif., company makes software that helps enterprises detect unknown threats inside their networks using machine learning and big data techniques.

Mr. Jones said the company has attracted customers in financial services, retail and logistics. Currently many of E8's customers are early adopters, and several are Fortune 50 companies. Mr. Jones said the company will look to market its platform down market and to government clients with the new funding, which closed last week.

With the new funding, Strategic Cyber Ventures Partner and Chief Operating Officer Hank Thomas will join E8 Security's board.

Mr. Jones said the company brought Strategic Cyber Ventures on as an investor because the firm is made up of operators.

E8 Security didn't disclose its valuation, but Mr. Thomas said the Series B was an "up round" for the company.

Zymergen Inc. has raised $130 million after selling investors on a vision for synthetic biology that includes recyclable electronics and coatings that better-protect cars and bridges from the elements.

SoftBank Group led the Series B round, which included new backers Iconiq Capital, Prelude Ventures and Tao Capital Partners. Return investors AME Cloud Ventures, Data Collective, Draper Fisher Jurvetson, Innovation Endeavors, Obvious Ventures, True Ventures and Two Sigma Ventures also participated. Zymergen closed a $44 million Series A round last year.

Synthetic biology involves genetically programming microbes to produce specifically tailored compounds. Zymergen, which uses robots and machine learning to speed this process, says its technology enables customers to improve margins on existing goods, accelerate product introductions and create novel offerings. It serves companies in markets such as chemicals, materials and flavors and fragrances.

Zymergen's financing highlights the potential investors see in synthetic biology to enable new products across various industries, including agriculture, foods, pharmaceuticals and waste management. In June Ginkgo Bioworks Inc., which designs custom microbes for customers involved in flavors and fragrances and other industries, raised "http://www.wsj.com/articles/synthetic-biology-startup-ginkgo-bioworks-closes-100m-series-c-1465385404"

Venture investors have also financed "http://www.wsj.com/articles/synthorx-raises-10m-series-b-for-novel-protein-therapeutics-1468987235" Inc., which uses synthetic amino acids to create novel biological medicines, and DNA suppliers Twist Bioscience Corp. and Gen9 Inc.

Emeryville, Calif.-based Zymergen has multiple ways to improve the economics of its customers' products, according to co-founder and Chief Executive Joshua Hoffman. The company, which can apply its platform to its clients' microbes, can improve traits in these bugs. It can improve thermal tolerance to make compounds perform better in a range of temperatures, for example.

Mr. Hoffman said Zymergen can't disclose names of clients but says it works with Fortune 500 companies and has had repeat business from multiple customers.

Zymergen also intends to bring its own internal products to market by working with its customers. They include thermoset plastic with improved degradation that would enable cellphones and other electronics to be recycled. Zymergen is also eyeing coating technology for paints used on cars, bridges and other metal objects that are exposed to the outdoor environment.

Although it isn't thinking of going public yet, Zymergen aims to build a public-quality board now, Mr. Hoffman said. Former U.S. Secretary of Energy Steven Chu is joining the board as an independent director. Deep Nishar, managing director of SoftBank Group International, is also joining the board.

Greylock Raises $1B for Latest Fund

Venture investors show little sign of easing up on their fundraising.

One of the latest indications of flush times: Greylock Partners a backer of such highfliers as Facebook, LinkedIn and Airbnb has secured $1 billion in closing the firm's 15th fund.

Despite a slowdown in the venture capital investing market that began earlier this year, venture firms have raised nearly $34 billion through the first three quarters of this year, according to Dow Jones LP Source, marking a 25% jump from last year.

That pace could make this the largest fundraising year since 2007. Venture firms raised $8.8 billion in the third quarter.

Other firms that have raised at least $1 billion in the first three quarters of the year include TCV, Accel Partners, Norwest Venture Partners, Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

Greylock, which closed the new fund in early October, raised its last previous fund in 2013, also at $1 billion.

Now with $3.5 billion under management, Greylock focuses on Series A and Series B investments, while reserving a smaller portion of the fund for growth-stage investments and doing some seed deals. In its prior fund, more than 95% of investments were involved in Series A or B rounds.

For consumer investments, Greylock has been betting on network-focused businesses, such as LinkedIn, GoFundMe, Nextdoor, Medium and Musical.ly, said James Slavet, partner at Greylock, based in Menlo Park, Calif.

On the enterprise side, the firm focuses on areas such as increasing productivity, revenue and security, backing companies like Cloudera, Okta, AppDynamics and Docker.

In addition, the firm is looking at emerging technologies and platforms, such as messaging, machine learning, robotics, virtual reality and augmented reality, to find the next Facebook or LinkedIn, Mr. Slavet said.

"The big question is, what will be the massive breakout companies in the next generation?" said Mr. Slavet. "It may look different from what we've seen before. The $100 billion question is thinking through what's next."

Greylock focuses on hiring investment partners with operating or entrepreneurial backgrounds. The firm also has in-house teams that help its startups in areas such as recruiting, public relations and customer development.

Recent Greylock exits include enterprise-software firm Apptio, which went public in September; Pure Storage, which held its IPO last October; Quip, which agreed to be acquired by Salesforce for $750 million; and TellApart, which was acquired by Twitter for $533 million last year.

Middlemen Fuel Insulin Price Rise

By Denise Roland and Peter Loftus 
990 words
10 October 2016
The Wall Street Journal

Insulin prices are soaring, creating pain for patients whose lives depend on the injectable drug -- yet most of the revenue from the increases isn't going to the drug manufacturers. It is largely the middlemen that benefit.

The major manufacturers of insulin -- Eli Lilly & Co. of Indianapolis, Novo Nordisk A/S of Denmark and Sanofi SA of France -- are collecting about the same or less than they did several years ago. The price increases -- top-selling insulins have more than doubled in price since 2011 -- reflect the growing role of middlemen known as pharmacy-benefit managers who negotiate rebates and fees based on list prices.

This convoluted payment system for drugs in the U.S. encourages high list prices and steep behind-the-scenes discounts, and is becoming a regular source of public outrage, most recently with Mylan NV's EpiPen, an emergency allergy treatment. The fragmented system offers some bill payers lower overall costs while uninsured patients and those with certain health plans pay more. Insulin, like EpiPen, is used by millions of Americans.

At the same time, higher overall costs are encouraging U.S. health insurers and employers to make patients contribute more to their health care. In part, their use of higher deductibles contributes to the cost shifting to patients. Higher drug list prices mean those patients most exposed to the price increases pay more before their plan coverage kicks in.

Drug companies have sharply boosted U.S. list prices for top-selling insulins -- Sanofi's Lantus, Eli Lilly's Humalog and Novo Nordisk's NovoLog -- since 2011, according to data provider Truven Health Analytics. Lantus, the top-selling insulin, now costs $248.51 a vial, up from $114.15 in 2011. A Sanofi spokeswoman said the company hasn't increased its list price in nearly two years.

"Prices for these products have increased," said Aaron Kesselheim, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School who has researched insulin costs. "It's also the case that there are more patients under high-deductible health plans and who may have a greater copay and coinsurance, and they're being exposed to a larger share of the prices as well."

Net prices, or what drugmakers retain after discounts, have stayed the same or fallen in the past two years as the pharmaceutical companies compete to offer ever-deeper discounts to stay on the preferred drug lists at insurers and the PBM middlemen.

The reason drugmakers sharply raise list prices without a corresponding increase in net price is that PBMs demand higher rebates in exchange for including the drug on their preferred-drug lists, said Enrique Conterno, president of Lilly's diabetes business.

Eli Lilly has raised the list price of Humalog -- to $254.80 a vial, more than double the 2011 price. After rebates and discounts, Lilly on average in the U.S. collects less for its Humalog insulin than it did in 2009, Mr. Conterno said.

PBMs get to keep a portion of the rebates off list that they negotiate -- though they pass the rest on to clients -- and the administrative fees that PBMs collect from manufacturers are based on percentages of the list prices.

However, counters Steve Miller, chief medical officer of Express Scripts Holding Co., the largest U.S. PBM, "We never tell pharmaceutical companies we want high sticker prices. We want a low net price."

He acknowledges that "certain patients get caught in the middle of this, and we have got to figure out how to put guard rails around that," such as setting a maximum pharmacy price.

About six million Americans use insulin, according to the American Diabetes Association.

For Sanofi's Lantus, the average U.S. net price fell by 17% in 2015 and is on track to fall a further 10% this year, according to estimates by equity researchers at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. The firm expects the net price of Novo Nordisk's Levemir insulin to fall 6% this year. Sanofi and Novo Nordisk have warned investors that falling prices in the U.S. will hurt profit growth.

America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry trade group, said drug companies control pricing, and when insulin prices rise, "patients end up paying more -- regardless of what kind of insurance plan they have."

Christie Tucker, a 45-year-old electrical contractor in Port Angeles, Wash., said the bill for a six-week supply of insulin for her son Preston has soared in the past two years.

When Preston was diagnosed, Mrs. Tucker paid $40 for a six-week supply. But the cost jumped to more than $600 in January because, instead of a fixed-dollar-amount copay, her insurance plan charges 30% of the pharmacy price of insulin, she said. Mrs. Tucker has saved on some prescriptions using coupons but expects to pay $650 for the next refill.

High-deductible insurance plans are causing sticker shock for many patients. About 23% of American workers with employer-sponsored health plans have annual deductibles of at least $2,000 a person, up from 7% in 2009, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

Jeff Dunlop, a 41-year-old mental-health case manager in Winter Haven, Fla., said he paid about $1,250 for a three-month supply of Lilly's Humalog earlier this year. Mr. Dunlop, who was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes as a child, paid the full cost because his family insurance plan -- offered by his wife's employer -- now has a $4,000 annual deductible.

He can handle the cost for now but said he worries about the future.

"There's a lot of people out there that just can't afford it," he said. "I'm one or two unfortunate circumstances away from being in that boat. That's scary because I need that stuff to live. Without it, I die."

Mylan Settles Medicaid Claims

By Joseph Walker

Mylan NV agreed to pay $465 million to settle allegations that it overcharged the government for its EpiPen products, the latest move by the embattled pharmaceuticals firm to quell the furor over its pricing practices.

The settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice comes after senators and federal health officials recently alleged Mylan had wrongly classified EpiPen as a generic product, when it should have been considered a brand product. The penlike injector delivers an emergency shot of epinephrine to counter severe allergic reactions.

The generic classification allowed Mylan to pay a smaller rebate on EpiPen sales to Medicaid programs, underpaying over five years by millions of dollars what it owed to the health program for the poor, Acting Administrator Andy Slavitt of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services wrote in a letter to lawmakers this week.

Drugmakers are required by law to pay rebates for sales to patients insured by Medicaid, which is funded jointly by states and the federal government. By classifying EpiPen as a generic, Mylan paid a smaller rebate of 13%, or about $163 million, when it should have been paying a 23% or higher rebate for brand-name drugs, Mr. Slavitt wrote.

On Friday, a Justice Department spokeswoman wouldn't "confirm or deny the existence of an investigation," and declined further comment.

Mylan, which moved to the Netherlands last year for tax purposes but is managed from Canonsburg, Pa., has been under fire over its repeated price increases on EpiPen. The company acquired rights the product in 2007, and has raised list prices by 550% since then to $608, according to data provider Truven Health Analytics.

Mylan hadn't previously disclosed any investigation. Settlements between pharmaceutical companies and the government aren't unusual, but typically occur after years of negotiations. The speed with which Mylan reached its rebate settlement signaled the company was eager to move past the latest controversy to engulf the company, Wall Street analysts said.

"You don't want this hanging over you, and there's a view that if you pay the fine, the public will just move on," said Ronny Gal, a Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. equity analyst.

Mylan said its agreement doesn't involve any admission of wrongdoing by the company, but that it expects to enter into a so-called corporate integrity agreement with the federal agency overseeing Medicare and Medicaid. Such agreements typically require companies to ensure they don't make similar violations again.

The company said it would record a pretax charge of about $465 million in its third quarter to cover the settlement. It also lowered its 2016 earnings forecast, largely because of previously announced changes in EpiPen access programs and the coming launch of a generic version of EpiPen.

Mylan has responded to the criticisms, in part, by saying it would introduce a generic version of the pen, priced at $300 for a two-pack. It previously blamed high patient costs for the pens on insurers who set high deductibles and drug-benefit managers who make money by negotiating bigger discounts off increasing list prices.

Shares of Mylan rose more than 10% to $39.66 in after-hours trading on Friday.

Mylan Chief Executive Heather Bresch in a statement called the agreement "another important step in Mylan's efforts to move forward and bring resolution to all EpiPen Auto-Injector related matters."

Mylan said it now expects 2016 per-share earnings, excluding items, of between $4.70 and $4.90, down from its earlier view of between $4.85 and $5.15. The company also reaffirmed its 2018 earnings target of at least $6 a share.

Ms. Bresch -- who testified at a hearing last month of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform -- has defended the price increases by blaming the current structure of the health-care system.

Mylan has cited insurers, which set high deductibles, and drug-benefit managers, which make money by negotiating bigger discounts off increasing list prices.

Elliott's Nudge Good for Samsung

When it rains, it pours. Samsung Electronics suddenly finds itself juggling multiple problems at once, yet the latest drizzle from an old-time adversary could be refreshing.

Elliott Management, Paul Singer's New York-based hedge fund, is agitating for changes at the Korean tech giant that include a one-off $27 billion dividend, a split of the company and a Nasdaq listing.

The proposal, in an open letter Wednesday, comes as the smartphone maker already is embroiled in a massive recall of its latest phone due to defective batteries. Vice Chairman Lee Jae-yong, who has been running the company since his father was incapacitated by a heart attack in 2014, was appointed to the board last month, indicating a power transition.

Mr. Singer isn't a new face to Samsung. Elliott attempted, and failed, to block a merger between two companies in the group, Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries, last year. The merger was purportedly to help the Lee family consolidate control of Samsung Electronics, the crown jewel of the corporate empire, at the expense of Samsung C&T's shareholders.

One problem for the Lee family is that it owns only about 4.8% of Samsung Electronics. Throwing in stakes owned by other companies in the group, the Lees control a mere 18%. Analysts have worried that the Lees would push for mergers within the group to cement control while destroying value for minority shareholders such as with the Samsung C&T-Cheil deal. But this would be harder to pull off with Samsung Electronics directly, since slightly more than half of the company's shares are owned by foreigners, including institutional investors who could mass against such moves.

Anyway, what Elliott has proposed is largely consistent with what Samsung said it would do, though it is doing so at a slothful pace. The company has launched a buyback plan, but compared with the $58 billion in net cash sitting on its balance sheet, more can be done. The cash that the family would receive from a special dividend could help pay the huge inheritance tax bill in case the elder Mr. Lee dies.

And a split into a holding company and an operating company, as Elliott suggested, is also where Samsung is moving, especially since Korean regulators have been pushing for the company to simplify its circular shareholding structure.

A sorting out of the Lee family's holdings and a simplified Samsung conglomerate should help erase the substantial discount at which Samsung Electronics trades to peers. Samsung may have dragged its feet in moving toward a more shareholder-friendly structure. A nudge by Elliott should hasten the process.

Salesforce Should Definitely Leave This Bird in the Bush

Always hungry for growth, Salesforce.com now seems poised to bite off more than it can chew.

The cloud software company's name emerged two weeks ago as a potential suitor for Twitter. While hardly an exclusive list, Salesforce's appearance was surprising given the lack of obvious synergies and the cost it might bear to make the deal happen.

The potential cost got even higher considering Salesforce shareholders took 6% off the stock's value after the initial report.

That was only a tease. A Wall Street Journal report late Tuesday makes clear that Salesforce is still very interested. Chief Executive Marc Benioff has reportedly been talking up Twitter behind closed doors going so far as to describe the troubled microblogging service an "unpolished gem" at one gathering. Salesforce shares fell another 5% as a result.

In all, the prospect of buying Twitter has erased nearly $5 billion in Salesforce's market value.

Considering that Twitter probably wouldn't sell for anything less than $18 billion, that is worrying. Salesforce has zero net cash and would need to fund such a deal with a mix of debt and stock. That assumes Twitter shareholders would accept volatile Salesforce shares for nearly half their consideration in the deal. It should be noted that LinkedIn chose an all-cash bid from Microsoft despite the fact that Salesforce offered a higher price as the latter included plenty of stock.

Whatever Salesforce offers, it is worth asking what exactly the company would get in return. Salesforce provides businesses with subscription-based software to run sales, marketing and other functions. It is working to expand those capabilities with artificial intelligence, which requires reams of data to work. Mr. Benioff described data as "the currency in software's new world order" in an interview with the Journal over the weekend a good indication of why he is drawn to Twitter's 313 million monthly active users.

But Salesforce is already one of the few companies to have "Firehose" access to Twitter's real-time feed, so it isn't at all clear why it needs to buy Twitter outright. And Twitter isn't without its own significant issues, including stagnating user growth. Salesforce must demonstrate it can find solutions that have eluded Twitter's current management.

The prospect of losing out on another big deal may have Mr. Benioff convinced that he simply can't let this bird fly away. Investors clearly wish he would.

Airline Price

War Proves

Cynics Right

EasyJet faces a hard winter. While U.S. airlines show signs of holding on to at least some of the benefits of cheaper oil, their European peers are proving cynical investors right by ceding them to consumers in a continuing battle for scale.

Europe's second-largest budget airline followed its June profit warning with another on Thursday. The shares nose-dived in anticipation of another raft of forecast cuts.

The problem is oversupply combined with creeping costs. EasyJet will fly roughly 8% more seats this year than last as a result of planes it agreed to buy in sunnier times and its strategy of taking market share from national flag carriers. But demand has been weak, so the airline has had to discount. Revenues per seat were 8.7% lower year over year in the quarter through September, and easyJet expects a similar performance in the current quarter.

The company didn't cite Brexit in its shopping list of excuses, beyond its currency impact. Instead it noted terrorist attacks and disruption at various airports.

One question concerns the willingness of Chief Executive Carolyn McCall to tough out the trough. But an executive thought to be her successor quit last month, suggesting she will stay.

The top five airlines account for roughly 55% of European capacity, compared with some 90% in the U.S., calculates Gerald Khoo at Liberum Capital. Everyone wants consolidation, but only through their own ongoing expansion. Time to buy a European holiday, not European airline shares.

Overheard

Surprises can sometimes sneak up on you.

Developed-market inflation still is undershooting economists' expectations, according to Citigroup's inflation-surprise indexes, which track the gap between forecasts and outcomes on a variety of price measures.

Either economists are getting more intelligent or, more likely, inflation is picking up because the undershoot has become the smallest since late 2012.

In fact, inflation is starting to be higher than expected in some surprising places: the eurozone and Japan. The former recorded the highest positive inflation-surprise reading in September since 2013. Even in the post-Brexit U.K., inflation is picking up, just not as sharply as thought.

Oddly enough, the country that is lagging behind is looking to actually raise rates. Inflation has been more buoyant in the U.S. than elsewhere -- but it still is proving lower than forecast.

Welltok Inc. has raised $33.7 million in Series E financing to fuel the growth of a technology platform that employers and other groups use to promote the health of their members.

People use tools from digital-health startups, such as Welltok's CafWell system, to improve their health and rewards for activities they undertake to achieve their goals. Welltok has more than 70 customers, Chief Executive Jeff Margolis said.

CafWell collects information about a person's health and goals and creates a personalized action plan. It also provides reminders and tips for how to follow through with the plan and connects people with resources and benefits available to them through the sponsor, such as an employer or health insurer.

Those resources could include information about nutrition, managing a chronic illness, and improving emotional well-being. Sponsors can develop reward programs that encourage people to use these resources and improve their health.

Other startups doing related work include Chrono Therapeutics Inc., which disclosed a $47.6 million venture "http://www.wsj.com/articles/chrono-therapeutics-raises-47-6m-series-b-for-smoking-cessation-tech-1473362912" last month. Chrono's smoking-cessation system combines a wearable nicotine-delivery device with a sensor that reports when the device is in use. People who wean themselves off nicotine can earn rewards.

Bessemer Venture Partners, EDBI, Emergence Capital, Flare Capital Partners, Georgian Partners, Hearst Health Ventures and HLM Venture Partners provided the capital. Other investors participating were InterWest Partners, Miramar Ventures, New Enterprise Associates, Okapi Venture Capital, Qualcomm Life Fund, Sigma Partners and Trustmark. Welltok has rounded up $163 million in total.

Software-as-a-service provider Welltok also secured a $13 million debt facility from Silicon Valley Bank.

Denver-based Welltok has grown organically and through acquisitions. It acquired consumer health-care communications company Silverlink Communications Inc. and health-care analytics startup Predilytics Inc. last year.

Elliott Management Seeks Changes at Samsung Electronics; Activist hedge fund cites  unnecessarily complex' structure of Samsung corporate empire

Corrections & Amplifications:

Lee Jae-yong faces a shareholder vote this month on his nomination to the Samsung board. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated he was nominated to become chairman. (Oct. 5, 2016) 

Elliott Management Corp. is pushing Samsung Electronics Co. to reshape and simplify its complicated ownership structure, arguing the move would put the electronics giant on equal footing with its global rivals.

The activist hedge fund said in a letter made public on Wednesday that the "unnecessarily complex" structure of the Samsung Group empire is weighing on the shares of Samsung Electronics, the world's largest manufacturer of smartphones and televisions with a market value of about $230 billion.

Samsung Electronics is the crown jewel of a conglomerate controlled by the Lee family, whose companies play a dominant role in South Korea's economy, providing everything from consumer electronics to real estate, insurance and fashion. The various entities are linked in an intricate network of cross-ownership.

Elliott's proposal would essentially extract Samsung Electronics from the web by bundling its various ownership stakes in the other Samsung entities into a new holding company. The new Samsung Electronics operating business would be listed in New York and Seoul. Founded by famed stock picker Paul Singer, Elliott also wants the company to pay shareholders a roughly $27 billion special dividend and add independent directors. Affiliates of the $29 billion New York-based hedge fund own roughly 0.62% of Samsung Electronics.

A spokeswoman for Samsung Electronics said: "We will carefully review the shareholders' proposals."

Elliott's Samsung campaign reflects a broader effort across Asia to simplify complicated family ownership structures and improve corporate governance with the aim of improving value.

Activist investor Daniel Loeb, of Third Point LLC, has argued for similar changes at Japanese retailer 7-Eleven and Sony Corp. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made governance reform a key plank of his plan to revive the country's stagnant economy.

Samsung heir apparent Lee Jae-yong, the 48-year-old grandson of Samsung's founder and a vice chairman of Samsung Group, has been restructuring the complex business and faces a shareholder vote later this month on his nomination to the board. Mr. Lee's ailing father was "http://www.wsj.com/articles/chairman-of-samsung-lee-kun-hee-hospitalized-after-heart-attack-1399792994" in May 2014.

Elliott's proposals echo some of the arguments that the hedge fund made last year "http://www.wsj.com/articles/samsung-suffers-symbolic-blow-from-seoul-court-1464679542" between another Lee-family controlled entity and Samsung C&T Corp., which holds a large stake in Samsung Electronics.

At the time, Elliott argued that the merger unfairly benefited the Lee family at the expense of smaller shareholders and urged broad governance changes at the companies.

Elliott narrowly lost the bitter proxy fight that lasted several months, though Samsung management vowed to adopt some of Elliott's suggested changes. Elliott's latest missive comes at a delicate time for the conglomerate, which is facing one of its biggest public crises in recent memory after a "http://www.wsj.com/articles/samsung-to-recall-galaxy-note-7-smartphone-1472805076" threatens to tarnish the Samsung brand. Even so, Samsung Electronics shares have continued to trade near their highest level ever.

The Seoul-listed stock has gained 45% over the past year and is 4% below its record in August. But Elliott said the shares are undervalued by as much as 70% because of Samsung Electronics' "bottom-tier" shareholder returns and "subpar" corporate governance. The firm said its proposed restructuring would bring the stock in line with that of its rivals by attracting a wider array of international investors. Samsung Electronics shares jumped as much as 5% in early trading Thursday in Seoul to touch a new intraday high of 1.7 million Korean won ($1,529). Shares closed 4% below their record high on Wednesday.

The new holding company, Elliott said, is a tax-efficient way for the Lee family to consolidate Samsung Electronics' ownership stakes in other Samsung entities. The family could then sell shares in the holding company to pay inheritance taxes in the event the chairman's death, people familiar with Elliott's plan said.

While Elliott is seeking talks with the company and the tone of its letter is complimentary of the management, it hadn't met with executives before releasing its proposed plan on Wednesday, the people said.

Early-stage venture-capital firm Metamorphic Ventures has rebranded as Compound Ventures and raised a new $50 million fund, the firm announced on its blog Wednesday.

"In science, a  compound' is a substance consisting of atoms or ions of two or more different elements joined by chemical bonds into a molecule that can't be separate by physical means," said a "https://medium.com/@compoundvc/compound-formerly-known-as-metamorphic-ventures-announces-new-fund-22c0bae613ce#.ifuvr8ta5" on the firm's blog. "Our compound is made up of our team, our founders, and our advisors which together as a whole, provides the leverage necessary to help early stage founders succeed."

Compound's third fund will invest in early-stage startups, according to the blog post. Dan Zigmond, Facebook's director of analytics, has joined as a board partner.

The firm has already made five investments out of the new fund, including Pluot and Finova, according to the post. The firm has not disclosed the other three investments.

Goldman-Backed Symphony Communication in Talks to Raise $100 Million; Instant-messaging startup had talks with Singapore wealth funds and U.S. private-equity firm General Atlantic

Symphony Communication Services LLC, an instant-messaging startup backed by Wall Street, is in early talks with potential investors to raise about $100 million in new funding.

The company has discussed investments with Singapore wealth funds Temasek Holdings and GIC, as well as U.S. private-equity firm General Atlantic, according to people familiar with the matter. Some existing investors are also expected to participate in the latest funding round.

An additional investment round could close as soon as early next year, the people said.

Symphony "http://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-joining-messaging-startup-symphony-to-tune-of-100-million-1444654805" from "http://www.wsj.com/articles/google-takes-stake-in-messaging-startup-symphony-communication-services-1444070497"Alphabet Inc.'s Google unit. That 2015 round valued the startup at $650 million.

It is unclear how the latest investment round would affect that valuation, and no final agreement has been reached.

"We are well-funded for our operations and future growth," said Symphony spokeswoman Samantha Singh, who declined to comment on the funding round.

Symphony, which is "http://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-led-group-of-financial-firms-buys-perzo-1412176909"Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and money managers such as BlackRock Inc., has yet to gain widespread use at many of the companies that helped start Symphony in late 2014. The firm's launch came as low interest rates, sleepy markets and new regulations have crimped profits across the financial-services industry, forcing firms to slash expenses.

To succeed, Symphony needs to find a home on the crowded computer screens of traders at banks and their clients.

The company "http://www.wsj.com/articles/blackrock-to-push-wall-street-chat-tool-1466722829" when BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, moved all of its internal messaging to the service and started encouraging its banks and brokers to communicate with them.

While Symphony executives have played down its portrayal as a rival to Bloomberg's popular messaging function, Wall Street backed the company in part because it took aim at one the features that binds their employees to the Bloomberg terminal.

Symphony is selling its messaging service as a platform through which users can access data, analytics, news and other sources of information.

In an effort to expand further, Symphony also recently agreed to join with Money.net, an upstart information company that offers Wall Street a cheaper alternative to Bloomberg LP's terminals, people familiar with the matter. The partnership with Money.net unites two startups that have emerged as Wall Street sought to loosen Bloomberg's grip on the trading floors of banks, hedge funds and other investors.

Bloomberg charges $22,000-$25,000 a year for each individual login, and its refusal to stray from an all-or-nothing pricing model has grated on many clients.

Symphony charges business customers $15 per user.

Money.net, which was founded by former Bloomberg executive Morgan Downey, charges clients around $1,500 a year to use its data service.

Dow Jones Newswires, a wire service of Dow Jones & Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal, is a "http://www.wsj.com/articles/symphony-communication-signs-deal-with-dow-jones-1442196262" and competes with Bloomberg.

(The following is a roundup of selected companies that have revealed securities sales in recent Form D regulatory filings. These companies are required to file a Form D notification within 15 days after the first sale of securities in an offering, which could indicate fundraising, acquisitions or other securities activity. The filings don't list the recipients of the securities being offered. However, they do list board members, so in cases where new investors have surfaced, we'll report them below.)

Blyncsy Inc., Salt Lake City, a movement analytics provider, has issued $150,000 of a $1 million debt offering. Pelion Venture Partners, Peterson Ventures and Subtraction Capital count the company in their portfolios.

Eight Sleep Inc., New York, which makes smart sleep trackers in the form of mattress covers, has sold $10.4 million of a $12.8 million equity round. In March, the company raised a $6 million seed round from investors including Azure Capital, Cota Capital, Comcast Ventures, Vast Ventures, Galvanize Ventures, Stanford University, Y Combinator and Yunqui Partners.

Nav Technologies Inc., San Mateo, Calif., a service that gives small-business owners free access to their personal and business credit data and insights, has sold $21.3 million of a $25 million equity round. The company, formerly known as Creditera Inc., received $6.5 million in Series A funding in 2014 from Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Peak Ventures.

Promentis Pharmaceuticals Inc., Milwaukee, a neurological drug developer, has sold $8.8 million in equity. In 2014, the company secured just under $3 million in Series B financing led by Black Horse Investments GmbH with participation from Golden Seeds and returning individuals.

Smart Lunches Inc., Boston, a provider of lunches for kids that parents can order online, has issued $600,000 in equity, convertible promissory notes, rights and securities. Data Point Capital is a backer.

Business News: IT Firms Look for Talent in Africa

By Kim S. Nash

A shortage of software developers in the U.S. has prompted some companies to seek talent in Africa, home to a young and increasingly tech savvy workforce.

International Business Machines Corp. has engaged young software developers in Lagos, Nigeria, to help build a data analytics business the technology giant is trying to ramp up quickly. The combination of an educated population and the proliferation of mobile technology on the continent makes Africa a good incubator of technology talent, said Leon Katsnelson, chief technology officer and director for IBM's analytic platform emerging technologies group.

IBM is building "Big Data University" to train technology professionals in its analytics tools through online training classes. Developers in Africa and elsewhere are helping write software to support the effort.

IBM isn't the only company that recognizes Africa's potential as an innovation hub. In August, Barclays Africa Group, through a subsidiary in South Africa, launched ChatBanking for Facebook Messenger, software to let local customers conduct bank transactions through the social network's chat feature. MasterCard Inc. runs a technology lab in Nairobi to incubate technology for digital payments and microloans for farmers. SAP SE has sponsored an "Africa Code Week" hackathon, and Accenture PLC is nurturing talent in Tanzania, Zambia and Rwanda.

Young technology talent can help companies create innovative products fast, Mr. Katsnelson said. "They don't have a vested interest in established technology."

Loyyal, a New York startup building a customer loyalty and rewards platform based on blockchain distributed ledgers, has hired a contract developer in Nairobi to work on its mobile app. Loyyal found developer Chris Ganga through Andela, Inc., itself a startup contracting firm with offices in Africa, New York and San Francisco.

"He has been absolutely outstanding," said Greg Simon, Loyyal's chief executive and founder.

Loyyal plans to put Mr. Ganga on core blockchain projects and may also hire two or three more Andela developers, Mr. Simon said.

He declined to say how much he has paid to Andela, but said the "cost is significantly reduced compared to a U.S.-based employee."

Andela puts applicants through aptitude tests to assess skills and problem-solving abilities, with fewer than 10% progressing to a round of interviews. Fewer still are invited to a two-week boot camp, where a series of technology challenges are laid out.

Gormley's Take: Recursion Pharma Goes Off Beaten Path, Lures Investors

Recursion Pharmaceuticals LLC's technology for discovering new treatments for rare diseases is cutting edge. But its business strategy is retro.

Having recently closed a "http://www.wsj.com/articles/recursion-pharmaceuticals-gathers-13m-series-a-for-rare-disease-therapies-1475494202" venture financing led by Lux Capital, Recursion uses artificial intelligence to find new uses for existing medicines. Instead of pursuing the conventional strategy of developing its own drugs in clinical trials, however, Recursion is using its technology to help large pharmaceutical companies convert existing compounds into rare-disease treatments.

That approach stands apart in an industry where most companies take the proven path of developing their own drug pipeline. Pharmaceutical companies are always looking to buy startups with a medicine that has shown promise in human clinical studies. Drug development is also a strategy Wall Street embraces.

In the 1990s successful biotechs such as Incyte Corp., which sold access to genomics databases, started out as service providers. More recently venture-backed antibody-discovery company Adimab LLC has revived interest in the technology-platform model, showing it can build a successful business by working with a series of pharmaceutical partners.

Recursion takes its inspiration from genomics companies of the past and modern businesses like Adimab. Through collaborations that give it a small piece of many drug programs, Recursion is betting it can do just as well as it could by owning all or most of a handful of drugs. Leaving clinical trials to collaborators also enables Recursion to concentrate on what it does best, technology and drug discovery, according to Chief Executive Christopher Gibson.

Recursion, which has alliances with three of the largest pharmaceutical companies, including one with Sanofi Genzyme, could eventually evolve into drug development as others have done before it. For now, however its focus is on using its technology and collaboration strategy to speed the introduction of new rare-disease therapies. As Dr. Gibson sees it, "We are trying to maximize overall impact."

Pinterest Names First CFO --- CEO says hiring the Twitter executive indicates the firm is 'scaling the business up'

A senior finance executive at Twitter Inc. is joining Pinterest Inc. as its first chief financial officer, signaling the image-discovery site may be laying the groundwork for an eventual initial public offering.

Todd Morgenfeld, a 44-year-old vice president of finance at Twitter, will leave the social-media service about 18 months after being recruited by finance chief Anthony Noto.

"We're really excited to bring on Todd," said Pinterest CEO Ben Silbermann in an interview on Tuesday. He said Mr. Morgenfeld's experience working at companies including Twitter, Hewlett-Packard Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. makes him well-suited to be Pinterest's first CFO.

Mr. Silbermann said Pinterest doesn't have any plans for an IPO. The hiring "reflects that we're scaling the business up," he said.

In a statement, Mr. Noto praised Mr. Morgenfeld's contributions at Twitter, calling him a talented leader. Mr. Morgenfeld in a statement complimented the company and its management, and said he would work with Twitter on a transition.

Natalie Fair, Pinterest's current head of finance since 2012, is "looking at other opportunities within the company," Mr. Silbermann said. Pinterest's finance team has about 40 people.

Pinterest is trying to become a search engine for ideas, a destination where brides, home decorators and amateur cooks can find and save images of things they like. The business goal is to enable advertisers and retailers to market and offer products related to those images.

The San Francisco company is a closely watched startup because of its immense valuation.

Investors, which include Goldman Sachs, venture-capital firms such as Andreessen Horowitz and FirstMark Capital and hedge fund Valiant Capital Partners, valued Pinterest at $11 billion last year.

Last year the company generated about $100 million in revenue, a person familiar with the matter has said.

The six-year-old company has focused on expanding its advertising offerings and building its international presence. The company said last year it reached 100 million monthly active users.

In his brief tenure at Twitter, Mr. Morgenfeld served under two chief executives, most recently under co-founder Jack Dorsey, whose return a year ago brought hope that he would be able to revive user growth and advertising revenue.

In recent weeks, companies such as Salesforce.com Inc. and Walt Disney Co. have started to consider making acquisition offers, people familiar with the matter have said.

In May 2015, Mr. Morgenfeld was hired by Twitter from Hewlett-Packard where he was senior vice president of treasury, financial analytics and corporate development. He joined a slate of other veteran finance executives to bolster the team under Mr. Noto, a former Goldman Sachs banker.

UK banks get ready to roll out robot tellers

Artificial intelligence that can mimic human empathy and learn to answer complicated questions will be employed by "https://www.ft.com/topics/themes/UK_banks" to serve customers around the clock and cut costs.

Royal Bank of Scotland is planning to unveil Luvo:  human  AI that can answer questions online, ranging from lost card queries to unblocking pin numbers and updating home addresses.

Luvo, powered by technology giant IBM, can read customer moods and respond accordingly, and RBS could switch on this ability in future.

 Like humans, Luvo has to be trained when dealing with new subject matter but, crucially, it learns from its mistakes and its answers become more accurate over time,  says RBS, which plans to unveil it at the end of the year.

The state-backed bank will be the first in the UK to launch a customer-facing service using AI after trialling it internally.

UK banks are only in the early stages of using AI but they hope it will improve customer service, because it can work consistently around the clock. AI could also allows banks to move staff from mundane to more complicated tasks, and to reduce the workforce and cut costs.

Warren Mead of KPMG said:  Of course it s about cost-cutting to an extent. Banks face a huge cost challenge as they go forward, but it can be done in a way that augments customer service. 

For example, AI could be used in call centres instead of people reading scripts. It could also learn to provide the correct answers to queries more efficiently, speeding up and improving customer service, said Mr Mead. For some processes that are  people-heavy and content-light , this could reduce costs by about 80 per cent, he said.

David Parker from Accenture said banks were already using AI for basic processes driven by human commands, such as quickly gathering customer information from multiple different pages and presenting it on one screen. Using machines that can learn from their interactions with customers is the next stage banks are exploring.

 Obviously there are some streamlining and cost-reduction benefits. What we re seeing is organisations planning to use this to move staff from dull processes to more judgment-based roles,  he said.

Technology company IPsoft has built an  AI worker , or virtual assistant, called Amelia, which can learn and hold a conversation while responding to emotions.

Accenture is working with a number of banks to help them use Amelia for certain processes, such as helping people find a mortgage adviser or open a bank account.

The London borough of Enfield announced in June that it had recruited Amelia for frontline services, responding to residents  queries and helping with licence and permit applications.

RBS is offering Luvo to a small group of customers online in Scotland, before expanding it to NatWest customers in England. The bank is keen to emphasise that customers will not be forced to interact with Luvo, and human support is still available.

Chris Withers from IBM said:  As this cognitive system continues to learn over time, Royal Bank of Scotland will be able to expand Luvo s capabilities to more complex areas such as providing increased personalisation and using predictive analytics to detect possible issues before they arise. 

Mr Parker said:  Banks realise AI will be the future. It s not that the technology isn t there, it s that banks are figuring out how best to apply AI to processes and customer interactions.

FT REPORT - THE UK'S ENTREPRENEURS
Sale of homegrown pioneer puts spotlight on tech stars' strategy

Technology The sale of UK chip designer Arm was a jolt for a sector with high ambitions, says Madhumita Murgia

When shares in chip designer Arm Holdings ceased trading on the London Stock Exchange a month ago, the leading index of UK companies lost one of its star performers. The FTSE 100 company, whose chip designs are found in the vast majority of the world's smartphones, had completed its sale to Japanese company SoftBank for 24.3bn.

"A lot of people believe the deal shouldn't have been done at all," says analyst Richard Holway, founder of research company TechMarketView. "We would have much preferred Arm to stay as a UK-quoted FTSE 100 company. It's a great shame, they could have got whatever backing to do whatever they wanted to from the government."

Arm was one of the UK's original tech start-ups, founded in 1990 in Cambridge, where it remained as a tech ecosystem developed around it. The company grew into a multinational that some believe could be the next Intel, the US-based premier chipmaker.

It is not the first UK homegrown company to have been sold: in 2011 Hewlett-Packard bought Autonomy, another Cambridge company, in a deal for $11.1bn (although HP later announced an $8.8bn writedown of the value of Autonomy). In 2014, whizz-kid Demis Hassabis's artificial intelligence company DeepMind was sold to Google for 400m. Swiftkey, whose keyboard app predicts what a smartphone user is like-ly to type next, was acquired by Microsoft for $250m in February this year, and Twitter bought artificial intelligence start-up, London-based Magic Pony , in June for $150m when it was less than two years old.

The UK has probably the best record in Europe for creating fast-growth tech start-ups: a recent report by Mayfair-based investment bank GP Bullhound identified 18 UK "unicorns" - start-ups valued at $1bn-plus. In the first quarter of this year, the UK dominated the investment landscape, with more than  ¬1bn raised across 122 funding rounds; the emerging financial technology, or fintech, sector was the preferred area for investors.

Angel investor and venture capitalist Saul Klein, who runs seed fund Local Globe, says the UK has one of the world's biggest tech economies: "After the Bay Area [in San Francisco] and China, the UK has produced more billion-dollar companies in the past 10 years and accounts for more tech M&A than anywhere else."

But the UK roll-call of success still pales by comparison with the US, which is home to more than 100 unicorns. These include powerhouses such as car-hailing app developer Uber, which in June raised another $3.5bn and has been valued at $68bn, Airbnb, which is estimated to be worth $30bn, and Snapchat, valued at $16bn. Silicon Valley can claim three of the five most valuable public companies in the world: Apple, Google and Facebook.

Despite the entrepreneurial mojo the UK is building up, it still lags behind the US on at least one important question - when will Britain finally develop a tech company to rival the best in the US?

Niklas Zennstrom, who moved from Stockholm to London to co-found Skype in 2003, argues there is a delay because the consequences of the dotcom crash of 2000 played out more harshly in Europe than the US. "It was a nuclear winter until the whole ecosystem was reborn in the early 2000s," he says. "Compared to Silicon Valley, [Europeans] have never had that many generations of entrepreneurs and ecosystem-building of companies."

For many who have been investing in British start-ups for the past decade or so, concerns about how long it will take to reach this milestone come up over and over again.

Neil Rimer, co-founder of Index Ventures, a European venture capital fund, also advocates patience. "The clock only started running on this about 20 years ago, the US has had a longer period of time to build this," he says.

The UK's tech sector needs what he calls a "two-way street". This requires investors who are willing to take big risks and allow small companies a generous leash, as well as entrepreneurs who will need to trust investors when they advise them to refuse a big cheque and the temptation to sell out too soon.

So where might the UK's next big tech company come from? So far, the sector's biggest strengths have been in so-called deep tech - truly innovative technological advances - in software and chip design. However, innovation is also strengthening in new areas, such as fintech and artificial intelligence.

In the past five years, Britain has become a leading hub for AI research. "The UK not just has a lead but arguably is the best place in the world for AI given DeepMind is here and Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Twitter have all acquired UK artificial intelligence businesses," says angel investor Mr Klein.

Though theFTSE 100 index has lost one UK technology company, it also just gained one.

Shortly after Arm's sale to SoftBank, enterprise software maker Micro Focus International entered the FTSE 100 as it engineered the absorption of the software assets of the much larger Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The deal has created one of Britain's most valuable companies, with a projected market capitalisation of roughly $10bn.

The UK's tech leaders have been cheered by the Micro Focus takeover.

Suranga Chandratillake, a partner at venture capital firm Balderton Capital and founder of Blinkx, an Aim-traded video platform, praises the "audacity and ambition" of this kind of deal.

"It's great to see a UK company do that," he says "It is exactly the inspirational role model you need."

CD&R Forms Health-Management Services and Technology Platform; The investment is the New York firm's response to the nation's changing health-care landscape

Clayton Dubilier & Rice said it launched agilon health, a health-care technology and services provider that seeks to tap opportunities arising as the nation's health-care reimbursement system shifts from volume-based, fee-for-service reimbursement to one where services are rewarded based on quality, outcomes, improved patient experience and reduced costs.

CD&R said it formed agilon health after acquiring and merging management service organizations Primary Provider Management Co. and Cyber-Pro Systems Inc.

PPMC services more than 450,000 primarily Medicaid members in California; Cyber-Pro, through its subsidiaries, manages about 24,000 Medicare patients in Hawaii.

CD&R, which didn't disclose terms of the transactions in a news release, said Ronald Williams, former chairman and chief executive of insurer Aetna Inc. and an operating adviser to CD&R's funds, has been appointed as agilon's chairman.

Agilon health offers clinical and payment infrastructure and technology, data analytics and clinical models to enable physicians to manage care delivery and provide quality and value-based health care. The company contracts with insurance companies on behalf of physicians to receive a fixed percentage of the premium dollar or a fixed per-member, per-month fee.

This contrasts sharply with the current operating model where physicians and providers are paid fees on the amount of services they provide.

According to the release, Agilon health's technology, initially developed in 1996, is tailored to help providers with quality, case and care management needs, particularly regarding the increasing Medicaid, Medicare and populations that are eligible for both government programs.

The agilon investment is the New York firm's response to the nation's changing health-care landscape, with emphasis on containing health-care expenses while bolstering the quality of care.

Ravi Sachdev, a CD&R partner, said the opportunity set available for physicians and providers as a result of the transition is going to be much bigger.

"We aren't talking about the price going up by 4% or the volume up by 3%; we are talking about a fundamentally different addressable market," he said. "Instead of the fee-for-service dollar, physicians are going after $3 trillion of insurance premium."

But there is an economic risk to such a model: Physicians and providers need to be adept at containing the costs, or else the expenses incurred may exceed the lump sum they receive, resulting in a loss.

In spite of the economic risks, Mr. Sachdev said implementing the model gives providers a fighting chance to combat declining revenue because of the increasing proportion of government-subsidized patients in the system as a result of the Affordable Care Act.

"The patient population in [physicians'] practices increasingly have a higher portion of Medicare and Medicaid patients, and the price point of reimbursement on those lives in fee-for-service is lower than what they used to get for commercial," Mr. Sachdev said. "For the really sick Medicare population, they don't make much money today and don't have the appropriate incentives to manage them in a way that can impact long-term clinical and cost outcomes."

Bearing economic risks is something that physicians and service providers aren't accustomed to currently, and where CD&R said agilon, particularly with its technology offerings, will step in and aid providers.

Mr. Williams said when physicians have a large number of patients, it is difficult for them to keep track of issues that are crucial to the delivery, as well as the quality, of care such as "which patients have what conditions" and what are the state-of-the-art treatment protocols "based on patients' conditions."

CD&R said agilon serves about 1,500 primary-care physicians and 8,000 specialists. The company expects "exponential growth in coming years," Mr. Sachdev said.

"We are far into the value-based-care transition that while the market hasn't reached the full inflection point, we are past the concept of whether they are going to accept it or not," he said.

Salesforce.com Inc. agreed to acquire San Francisco startup Krux, in a bid by the cloud-software giant to bolster its marketing-data and analytics segment.

Salesforce is paying about $700 million, split equally in cash and stock, for closely held Krux, according to people familiar with the acquisition.

Krux last raised capital in 2014, securing $35 million from existing investors Accel Partners and IDG Ventures, alongside new investors SAP Ventures, Time Warner, Singapore government-investment fund Temasek and an investment vehicle of Japanese billionaire Taizo Son. The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, reported at the time that the round valued Krux at about $150 million post-money.

Krux is a six-year-old firm that provides companies with information enabling them to hone their marketing and advertising. The company, which already has a partnership with Salesforce, mines data across the internet and analyzes it to better understand and target customers.

Krux will supplement Salesforce's increasing artificial-intelligence capacity in its so-called marketing cloud, Salesforce product head Alex Dayon said in an interview.

Krux uses artificial intelligence to analyze trillions of signals to better identify audience segments for targeted marketing and advertising by its clients, which include big names from Ticketmaster to L'Oral, Krux founder and Chief Executive Tom Chavez said in a separate interview.

Salesforce, whose annual Dreamforce customer conference takes place this week in San Francisco, is known for providing cloud-based services for sales, service and marketing. In June, it "http://www.wsj.com/articles/salesforce-to-buy-e-commerce-platform-demandware-for-2-8-billion-1464781833" to buy another existing partner, Demandware Inc., for $2.8 billion. The deal added e-commerce to Salesforce's portfolio and was the largest acquisition to date for the company, which has stepped up its hunt for acquisitions as competition in the industry intensifies.

Ten fintech start-ups that are causing a stir in insurance

For a long time, the fintech start-up scene took little interest in the seemingly sleepy world of insurance. Payments, foreign exchange and peer-to-peer lending grabbed the headlines, plus the funding.

But over the past couple of years, all that has changed. Insurtech   or instech   is now attracting entrepreneurs and the investors that back them.  Quite a few entrepreneurs who have been in other areas of fintech have moved over to insurance,  says Matthew Wong of research company CB Insights.

Funding for insurance technology companies rose from $740m in 2014 to $2.7bn a year later, according to CB Insights. This year has also been busy.  Deal pace is higher than it was last year,  says Mr Wong.  There s a lot more enthusiasm, especially at the early stage. 

The start-ups are targeting all parts of insurance. Many are focusing on distribution, using new technology to reach consumers that traditional insurers miss. Others are looking at analytics, helping insurers to use data to make better underwriting decisions. Blockchain   the technology that underpins bitcoin   is increasingly popular, while health insurance has been a big area of start-up activity in the US. Nor have start-ups ignored the potential of the  internet of things    the growing use of data-collecting devices in everyday items, from cars using telematics systems to connected homes.

Few start-ups have become full, risk-bearing insurers. Analysts say that the capital requirements, regulatory burden and complexity required, combined with the desire of investors for short-term returns, means that very few of them underwrite their own policies. The result is that for most start-ups, partnerships with existing insurers are critical. Without them, many would struggle to make the business model work.

Insurers tend to be willing partners, seeing start-ups as a way to win business in normally out-of-reach markets. But Nigel Walsh, partner at Deloitte, warns of drawbacks.  The risk is that the insurers will have no interaction with their clients,  he says.  They ll just be product manufacturing. 

Cuvva

Founded: 2014

Founders: Freddy Macnamara and James Billingham

Shareholders: Angel syndicate

Funding: 500,000

Based: UK

Activity: Cuvva takes a fresh approach to car insurance. While most insurers cover customers  vehicles for a full year, Cuvva breaks it down into smaller chunks. Its first product allows policyholders to insure themselves on a friend s vehicle for as short a period as an hour via an app. Its second, to be launched this autumn, will allow drivers to buy an hour of coverage for their own vehicles, which is designed to suit people who do not drive frequently. While Cuvva is still at an early stage of development, some analysts say that insurers will increasingly have to follow its model of offering more flexible products than their current range of fixed, year-long contracts.Cuvva uses data provided by the UK s Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority to help verify policy requests, a process that it says takes about 10 seconds.

Cyence

Founded: 2014

Founders: Arvind Parthasarathi and George Ng

Shareholders:New Enterprise Associates, IVP and Dowling Capital Partners

Funding: $40m

Based: US

Activity: Demand for cyber insurance has been growing rapidly over the past few years, with high-profile attacks on companies such as Target in the US and TalkTalk in the UK persuading companies that they need cover. For insurers, cyber offers plenty of potential growth but also lots of uncertainty. How likely is it that any given client will be hacked   and, if they are, how much damage could there be? San Francisco-based Cyence is developing a system that can model these risks in financial and economic terms. It has already won its first customers, including Brit Insurance, AM Best and Marsh. In September it raised $40m from investors in one of the largest insurtech fundraisings of the year.

Lemonade

Founded: 2014

Founders: Daniel Schreiber and Shai Wininger

Shareholders: Sequoia, Aleph and XL Innovate

Funding: $13m

Based: US

Activity: Lemonade has been the subject of speculation. It first billed itself as a peer-to-peer insurer, but was coy about exactly what that meant or its business model. It has since raised money, signed partnerships with the likes of Berkshire Hathaway, Lloyd s and XL Catlin, and recruited high-profile executives. It even hired behavioural economist Dan Ariely, author of bestseller Predictably Irrational, as chief behavioural officer. In September the company, which unlike many other insurtech start-ups is licensed as an insurer, revealed it will sell home insurance in New York. It will group its customers together and, at the end of each year, any premiums that have not been paid as claims will be given to a charity of the group s choosing.

Oscar

Founded: 2012

Founders: Mario Schlosser and Josh Kushner

Shareholders: Fidelity Investments, Google Capital, General Catalyst, Founders Fund, Lakestar, Khosla Ventures and Thrive Capital

Funding: $750m

Based: US

Activity: Oscar is one of the older and more developed insurtech start-ups. Focused on health insurance, Oscar uses technology and data to improve the care it offers to its customers. It was created after the introduction of the US Affordable Care Act, known as "http://lexicon.ft.com/Term?term=Obamacare", and its services are available in New York and New Jersey. Among the benefits it offers are phone lines to its doctors and systems that help healthcare professionals manage members  care. It has some big-name backers, including Fidelity and Google, and a fundraising earlier this year valued the company at almost $3bn. According to Deloitte it has annual revenue of $200m.

PolicyGenius

Founded: 2014

Founders: Jennifer Fitzgerald and Francois de Lame

Shareholders: Revolution Ventures, Karlin Ventures, Susa Ventures, Transamerica Ventures, Axa Strategic Ventures and MassMutual Ventures

Funding: $21m

Based: US

Activity: Price comparison sites have been in the UK for many years, regularly assaulting potential customers with TV ads featuring meerkats, opera singers and other outlandish characters. But the US market has been slower to take off. Analysts blame a reliance on brokers for distribution, state-by-state regulation and wariness from customers and insurers. PolicyGenius is hoping to help change that, arguing that more and more Americans would rather organise their insurance online than via an agent. It offers a range of products including life, health and pet policies. With backers such as big insurers Axa, Transamerica and MassMutual, it could make a dent in the market.

Safeshare

Founded: 2015

Founders: Alexander Steinart and Christiano Pizzocheri

Shareholders: Founders and Z/Yen

Funding: 200,000

Based: UK

Activity: "http://video.ft.com/4584674442001/The-blockchain-Wall-Streets-latest-buzz/Companies" is one of the buzzwords of the fintech world, and this is no different among insurers. The technology allows transactions to be recorded securely in multiple locations. How exactly it can be used in insurance is the subject of much discussion within the industry. Safeshare is one of the few companies to have launched a blockchain-based product. It describes its market as  insurance for the sharing economy , and its first product illustrates what it is trying to do. In March it announced it had teamed up with Vrumi   a website that allows people to rent out their spare rooms for use as offices   to launch property insurance. The policies are underwritten at Lloyd s and the use of blockchain should, in theory, allow the parties involved in the policy to be linked securely and cheaply.

Simplesurance

Founded: 2012

Founders: Robin von Hein, Joachim von Bonin and Ismail Asci

Shareholders: Rheingau Founders, Assurant, Route 66 and Allianz SE, Route 66 and

Funding:  ¬20m

Based: Germany

Activity: One of the big hopes for insurtech is that it will break insurance down from the catch-all policies insurers have traditionally offered into more specific coverage for individual needs. Simplesurance is one of the companies aiming to do that by allowing people to buy insurance for products at the point of sale. Although smartphones, laptops and tablets dominate, it can be used for a much wider range of items. Founder Robin von Hein says the company has almost 2,000 ecommerce providers using its system, and that it launches in a new country every four weeks. Like other start-ups, Simplesurance is not a risk-bearing insurer itself. Instead it acts as a broker, passing on the risk to traditional players such as Allianz and Assurant.

SPIXII

Founded: 2016

Founders: Alberto Chierici, Renaud Million and Alberto Pasqualotto

Shareholders: Founders

Funding: Under 50,000

Based: UK

Activity: A relatively new start-up, SPIXII was founded by a group of former actuaries and computer scientists, one of whom used to be a consultant for high-frequency trading firms. Like many insurtech start-ups, its target is the way insurers interact with their customers. SPIXII is developing a chatbot   software that allows insurers, brokers and price comparison sites to talk to customers via programs such as Facebook Messenger and Skype. It is still early days, but SPIXII s founders say that within four months of launching it had a pipeline of more than 60 companies that were interested in its technology. It has also caught the attention of Germany s Allianz, which has put SPIXII into a five-month accelerator programme at one of its bases in France.

Synerscope

Founded: 2011

Founders: Jan-Kees Buenen and

Danny Holten

Shareholders: Mangrove Capital Partners, 5 Park Lane and Tiketitoo

Funding:  ¬5m

Based: Netherlands

Activity: Synerscope is one of a clutch of companies focused on helping insurers make better use of their data. Its chief technology officer, Jorik Blaas, has a background in MRI scanning and equipment used to look beneath layers of paint on old masters  artwork. The company aims to take the growing volumes of data that insurers collect   such as data produced by in-car cameras and drones   and turn them into something insurers can use. It has had some success in its home market, with insurers including Delta Lloyd and Achmea using its systems. Achmea used Synerscope to find out which road junctions had more accidents than others. That information can be used not only to reduce claims but also to prevent accidents.

Trov

Founded: 2012

Founders: Scott Walchek

Shareholders: OAK HC/FT, Anthemis Group, Guidewire and Suncorp Group

Funding: $46m

Based: US

Activity: Trov is another company aiming to break insurance down into easily digestible chunks. It sells item-by-item insurance policies for personal possessions, for whatever duration customers choose, via an app. Trov also hopes to improve the claims experience, using a chat service to automate the process. Despite being based in the US, its first market was Australia, where the service has been most popular with 18- to 34-year-olds. Like other start-ups, Trov does not do underwriting itself, preferring to partner with established companies. In Australia, where it launched in May, Suncorp is the underwriter. In the UK Trov s imminent launch will be Axa, while in the US   where it plans to launch next year   Munich Re will provide the underwriting, it announced in September.

FT REPORT - RISK MANAGEMENT: TECHNOLOGY
Insurers rush to grab hold of start-ups with potential

Traditional players hope to take advantage of innovators' tech know-how, writes Oliver Ralph

Autumn started with a rush of deals. As August turned to September, a clutch of big insurers announced investments in start-ups. Allianz put funds into MoneyFarm, a digital wealth manager. Munich Re partnered with Trov, which is developing a range of on-demand insurance products. Axa backed Gasolead, which is creating a virtual assistant to help insurance agents generate more digital leads.

If this is an industry playing catch-up on tech, it is playing hard. "[Insurers] are working closely with start-ups rather than seeing them as a threat," says Nigel Walsh, a partner at Deloitte.

For others, however, there is a long way to go. Tom Butterworth of Silicon Valley Bank, which finances early-stage companies, describes the sector as archaic. "It's seen as the laggard in adopting new technology," he says.

The September deals showed the breadth of technologies in which insurers are dabbling as they look for new ways to help customers - both retail and corporate - manage risk.

Telematics is particularly popular. What started as the ability to assess how well young people drive via a black box in the car is quickly expanding into a range of similar ideas. Health insurance linked to fitness devices is one. Home or factory insurance policies linked to various types of sensor are another.

Data analysis is a hot topic. "The insurers are probably a bit more mature than the banks in using big data to drive value," says Roy Jubraj, managing director at Accenture. The idea is that, by analysing data, insurers can assess risk more accurately. This is not always straightforward. UK regulators recently looked at whether insurers' use of data could harm consumers, although it eventually decided that the issue did not merit a full investigation.

Meanwhile, blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin, is never far from the discussion. Insurers are investigating how it could make insurance contracts cheaper and more secure. "Blockchain has the opportunity to fundamentally change the way we interact with insurers," says Mr Walsh. He adds that smart contracts - which pay out automatically if something happens, without the policyholder needing to make a claim - are one way in which the technology could change the industry.

Yet there are limits to how far big, traditional insurers can go when it comes to making the most of new developments. "Legacy systems are holding them back quite a bit," says Mr Jubraj. "That's why major players are embarking on new platforms, modernising what they have."

Old technology, says Mr Jubraj, hinders insurers' ability to create new products quickly. "Today most insurers push digital services based on the products they are [already] selling. Not many are looking at you as a customer and driving a proposition around that, as Amazon has in retail," he adds.

That is where a lot of the start-ups come in. New entrants are selling variations on traditional policies - car insurance by the mile, for example, or cover for specific possessions. By combining with these start-ups, insurers win some underwriting business (very few start-ups are fully licensed insurers) and get an early peek at which sorts of products might work well.

"For the foreseeable future, barriers to entry are so huge that you'll see this layer added to the top of the industry," says Mr Butterworth. "It is the [insurers] most willing to integrate with the early-stage companies that will come out on top."

Cyber insurance is one exception. Multinationals including AIG, Munich Re, Allianz and Beazley have pushed into cyber. Analysts say it is one of the few areas of commercial and wholesale insurance that offers much growth. Adoption is much higher in the US than Europe, but EU rules coming in 2018 are expected to boost take-up.

However, customer demands are changing in cyber. While cyber policies traditionally cover companies for financial and operational problems caused by data loss, industry surveys suggest that policyholders have a wider range of worries, such as what happens if a cyber attack causes physical damage, or the consequences of a hack that affects products. The question for insurers is how quickly they can model and price those risks.

Innovation Links between traditional insurers and new players are critical for both. By Oliver Ralph

For a long time, the fintech start-up scene took little interest in the seemingly sleepy world of insurance. Payments, foreign exchange and peer-to-peer lending grabbed the headlines, plus the funding.

But over the past couple of years, all that has changed. Insurtech - or instech - is now attracting entrepreneurs and the investors that back them. "Quite a few entrepreneurs who have been in other areas of fintech have moved over to insurance," says Matthew Wong of research company CB Insights.

Funding for insurance technology companies rose from $740m in 2014 to $2.7bn a year later, according to CB Insights. This year has also been busy. "Deal pace is higher than it was last year," says Mr Wong. "There's a lot more enthusiasm, especially at the early stage."

The start-ups are targeting all parts of insurance. Many are focusing on distribution, using new technology to reach consumers that traditional insurers miss. Others are looking at analytics, helping insurers to use data to make better underwriting decisions. Blockchain - the technology that underpins bitcoin - is increasingly popular, while health insurance has been a big area of start-up activity in the US. Nor have start-ups ignored the potential of the "internet of things" - the growing use of data-collecting devices in everyday items, from cars using telematics systems to connected homes.

Few start-ups have become full, risk-bearing insurers. Analysts say that the capital requirements, regulatory burden and complexity required, combined with the desire of investors for short-term returns, means that very few of them underwrite their own policies. The result is that for most start-ups, partnerships with existing insurers are critical. Without them, many would struggle to make the business model work.

Insurers tend to be willing partners, seeing start-ups as a way to win business in normally out-of-reach markets. But Nigel Walsh, partner at Deloitte, warns of drawbacks. "The risk is that the insurers will have no interaction with their clients," he says. "They'll just be product manufacturing."

Cuvva

Founded: 2014 Founders: Freddy Macnamara and James Billingham Shareholders: Angel syndicate Funding: 500,000 Based: UK Activity: Cuvva takes a fresh approach to car insurance. While most insurers cover customers' vehicles for a full year, Cuvva breaks it down into smaller chunks. Its first product allows policyholders to insure themselves on a friend's vehicle for as short a period as an hour via an app. Its second, to be launched this autumn, will allow drivers to buy an hour of coverage for their own vehicles, which is designed to suit people who do not drive frequently. While Cuvva is still at an early stage of development, some analysts say that insurers will increasingly have to follow its model of offering more flexible products than their current range of fixed, year-long contracts. Cuvva uses data provided by the UK's Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority to help verify policy requests, a process that takes about 10 minutes.

Cyence

Body Founded: 2014 Founders: Arvind Parthasarathi and George Ng Shareholders: New Enterprise Associates, IVP and Dowling Capital Partners Funding: $40m Based: US Activity: Demand for cyber insurance has been growing rapidly over the past few years, with high-profile attacks on companies such as Target in the US and TalkTalk in the UK persuading companies that they need cover. For insurers, cyber offers plenty of potential growth but also lots of uncertainty. How likely is it that any given client will be hacked - and, if they are, how much damage could there be? San Francisco-based Cyence is developing a system that can model these risks in financial and economic terms. It has already won its first customers, including Brit Insurance, AM Best and Marsh. In September it raised $40m from investors in one of the largest insurtech fundraisings of the year.

Lemonade

Body Founded: 2014 Founders: Daniel Schreiber and Shai Wininger Shareholders: Sequoia, Aleph and XL Innovate Funding: $13m Based: US Activity: Lemonade has been the subject of speculation. It first billed itself as a peer-to-peer insurer, but was coy about exactly what that meant or its business model. It has since raised money, signed partnerships with the likes of Berkshire Hathaway, Lloyd's and XL Catlin, and recruited high-profile executives. It even hired behavioural economist Dan Ariely, author of bestseller Predictably Irrational, as chief behavioural officer. In September the company, which unlike many other insurtech start-ups is licensed as an insurer, revealed it will sell home insurance in New York. It will group its customers together and, at the end of each year, any premiums that have not been paid as claims will be given to a charity of the group's choosing.

Oscar

Body Founded: 2012 Founders: Mario Schlosser and Josh Kushner Shareholders: Fidelity Investments, Google Capital, General Catalyst, Founders Fund, Lakestar, Khosla Ventures and Thrive Capital Funding: $750m Based: US Activity: Oscar is one of the older and more developed insurtech start-ups. Focused on health insurance, Oscar uses technology and data to improve the care it offers to its customers. It was created after the introduction of the US Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, and its services are available in New York and New Jersey. Among the benefits it offers are phone lines to its doctors and systems that help healthcare professionals manage members' care. It has some big-name backers, including Fidelity and Google, and a fundraising earlier this year valued the company at almost $3bn. According to Deloitte it has annual revenue of $200m.

Policygenius

Body Founded: 2014 Founders: Jennifer Fitzgerald and Francois de Lame Shareholders: Revolution Ventures, Karlin Ventures, Susa Ventures, Transamerica Ventures, Axa Strategic Ventures and MassMutual Ventures Funding: $21m Based: US Activity: Price comparison sites have been in the UK for many years, regularly assaulting potential customers with TV ads featuring meerkats, opera singers and other outlandish characters. But the US market has been slower to take off. Analysts blame a reliance on brokers for distribution, state-by-state regulation and wariness from customers and insurers. Policygenius is hoping to help change that, arguing that more and more Americans would rather organise their insurance online than via an agent. It offers a range of products including life, health and pet policies. With backers such as big insurers Axa, Transamerica and MassMutual, it could make a dent in the market.

Safeshare

Body Founded: 2015 Founders: Alexander Steinart Shareholders: Founder and Z/Yen Funding: 200,000 Based: UK Activity: Blockchain is one of the buzzwords of the fintech world, and this is no different among insurers. The technology allows transactions to be recorded securely in multiple locations. How exactly it can be used in insurance is the subject of much discussion within the industry. Safeshare is one of the few companies to have launched a blockchain-based product. It describes its market as "insurance for the sharing economy", and its first product illustrates what it is trying to do. In March it announced it had teamed up with Vrumi - a website that allows people to rent out their spare rooms for use as offices - to launch property insurance. The policies are underwritten at Lloyd's and the use of blockchain should, in theory, allow the parties involved in the policy to be linked securely and cheaply.

SPIXII

Body Founded: 2016 Founders: Alberto Chierici, Renaud Million and Alberto Pasqualotto Shareholders: Founders Funding: Under 50,000 Based: UK Activity: A relatively new start-up, SPIXII was founded by a group of former actuaries and computer scientists, one of whom used to be a consultant for high-frequency trading firms. Like many insurtech start-ups, its target is the way insurers interact with their customers. SPIXII is developing a chatbot - software that allows insurers, brokers and price comparison sites to talk to customers via programs such as Facebook Messenger and Skype. It is still early days, but SPIXII's founders say that within four months of launching it had a pipeline of more than 60 companies that were interested in its technology. It has also caught the attention of Germany's Allianz, which has put SPIXII into a five-month accelerator programme at one of its bases in France.

Synerscope

Body Founded: 2011 Founders: Jan-Kees Buenen and Danny Holten Shareholders: Mangrove Capital Partners, 5 Park Lane and Tiketitoo Funding:  ¬5m Based: Netherlands Activity: Synerscope is one of a clutch of companies focused on helping insurers make better use of their data. Its chief technology officer, Jorik Blaas, has a background in MRI scanning and equipment used to look beneath layers of paint on old masters' artwork. The company aims to take the growing volumes of data that insurers collect - such as data produced by in-car cameras and drones - and turn them into something insurers can use. It has had some success in its home market, with insurers including Delta Lloyd and Achmea using its systems. Achmea used Synerscope to find out which road junctions had more accidents than others. That information can be used not only to reduce claims but also to prevent accidents.

Trov

Body Founded: 2012 Founders: Scott Walchek Shareholders: OAK HC/FT, Anthemis Group, Guidewire and Suncorp Group Funding: $46m Based: US Activity: Trov is another company aiming to break insurance down into easily digestible chunks. It sells item-by-item insurance policies for personal possessions, for whatever duration customers choose, via an app. Trov also hopes to improve the claims experience, using a chat service to automate the process. Despite being based in the US, its first market was Australia, where the service has been most popular with 18- to 34-year-olds. Like other start-ups, Trov does not do underwriting itself, preferring to partner with established companies. In Australia, where it launched in May, Suncorp is the underwriter. In the UK Trov's imminent launch will be Axa, while in the US - where it plans to launch next year - Munich Re will provide the underwriting, it announced in September.

Insurers rush to grab hold of fintech start-ups with potential

Autumn started with a rush of deals. As August turned to September, a clutch of big insurers announced investments in start-ups. Allianz put funds into MoneyFarm, a digital wealth manager. Munich Re partnered with Trov, which is developing a range of on-demand insurance products. Axa backed Gasolead, which is creating a virtual assistant to help insurance agents generate more digital leads.

If this is an industry playing catch-up on tech, it is playing hard.  [Insurers] are working closely with start-ups rather than seeing them as a threat,  says Nigel Walsh, a partner at Deloitte.

For others, however, there is a long way to go. Tom Butterworth of Silicon Valley Bank, which finances tech companies, describes the sector as archaic.  It s seen as the laggard in adopting new technology,  he says.

The September deals showed the breadth of technologies in which insurers are dabbling as they look for new ways to help customers   both retail and corporate   manage risk.

Telematics is particularly popular. What started as the ability to assess how well young people drive via a black box in the car is quickly expanding into a range of similar ideas. Health insurance linked to fitness devices is one. Home or factory insurance policies linked to various types of sensor are another.

Data analysis is a hot topic.  The insurers are probably a bit more mature than the banks in using big data to drive value,  says Roy Jubraj, managing director at Accenture. The idea is that, by analysing data, insurers can assess risk more accurately. This is not always straightforward. UK regulators recently looked at whether insurers  use of data could harm consumers, although it eventually decided that the issue did not merit a full investigation.

Meanwhile, "http://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Blockchain", the technology behind bitcoin, is never far from the discussion. Insurers are investigating how it could make insurance contracts cheaper and more secure.  Blockchain has the opportunity to fundamentally change the way we interact with insurers,  says Mr Walsh. He adds that smart contracts   which pay out automatically if something happens, without the policyholder needing to make a claim   are one way in which the technology could change the industry.

Yet there are limits to how far big, traditional insurers can go when it comes to making the most of new developments.  Legacy systems are holding them back quite a bit,  says Mr Jubraj.  That s why major players are embarking on new platforms, modernising what they have. 

Old technology, says Mr Jubraj, hinders insurers  ability to create new products quickly.  Today most insurers push digital services based on the products they are [already] selling. Not many are looking at you as a customer and driving a proposition around that, as Amazon has in retail,  he adds.

That is where a lot of the start-ups come in. New entrants are selling variations on traditional policies   car insurance by the mile, for example, or cover for specific possessions. By combining with these start-ups, insurers win some underwriting business (very few start-ups are fully licensed insurers) and get an early peek at which sorts of products might work well.

 For the foreseeable future, barriers to entry are so huge that you ll see this layer added to the top of the industry,  says Mr Butterworth.  It is the [insurers] most willing to integrate with the early-stage companies that will come out on top. 

Cyber insurance is one exception. Multinationals including AIG, Munich Re, Allianz and Beazley have pushed into cyber. Analysts say it is one of the few areas of commercial and wholesale insurance that offers much growth. Adoption is much higher in the US than Europe, but EU rules coming in 2018 are expected to boost take-up.

However, customer demands are changing in cyber. While cyber policies traditionally cover companies for financial and operational problems caused by data loss, industry surveys suggest that policyholders have a wider range of worries, such as what happens if a cyber attack causes physical damage, or the consequences of a hack that affects products. The question for insurers is how quickly they can model and price those risks.

Amino Capital, a firm focused on artificial intelligence and big data startups, has raised $50 million for its second fund.

Previously known as zPark Capital, Amino Capital has also brought on Huican Zhu, who formerly was an early Google executive and a chief architect at Tencent, as a general partner. Mr. Zhu, who has a Ph.D., from University of California, Santa Barbara, is a specialist in image search and Asian language search technology.

Palo Alto, Calif.-based Amino previously raised a $4.4 million first fund from among its general partners. Amino Capital II LP includes large Chinese technology companies as limited partners. The first fund made 39 seed investments, while the second fund will also invest in some Series A and B deals.

Exits include Orbeus, which was acquired by Amazon in 2015, Assemblage, which was acquired by Cisco in 2014, and Contastic, which was acquired by SugarCRM in 2016. Other investments include drone startup Skycatch, genetics firm Human Longevity Inc. and block chain startup String Labs.

The firm seeks to be the first check into a startup and often looks for companies that are spinoffs from university research. The firm looks for startups in artificial intelligence or big data because that is the expertise of its general partners, said Larry Li, a founding partner of Amino who was co-founder and chief executive at Cauldron Technologies Inc.

The firm also is interested in startups building on hard science, since its general partners have deep science backgrounds with Ph.D.s or other experience, said Sue Xu, a founding partner at Amino.

Besides its technology and business focus, the Amino team has strong connections with China companies and contacts and can assist startups in China. This can include anything from research and development in China to gaining customers and market position in China, said Ms. Xu, who was the founding scientist at GlycoMira.

The four general partners in the fund are Mr. Li, Ms. Xu, Mr. Zhu and Jun Wu, a former Google search executive and Tencent vice president.

Recursion Pharmaceuticals Gathers $13M Series A for Rare Disease Therapies

Recursion Pharmaceuticals LLC has raised $12.9 million in Series A financing on the promise that it can convert drugs idling on pharmaceutical companies' shelves into therapies for rare diseases.

Lux Capital is leading the round, which also included AME Cloud Ventures, Data Collective, Epic Ventures, Obvious Ventures and Wild Basin Investments. Recursion has raised $17 million in seed and Series A funding since forming in 2013.

Drug companies often stop developing products for strategic reasons or because the compounds were unsafe or ineffective in patients with a given disease. But a drug that fails in one disorder might still prove effective in another, and Recursion aims to uncover those indications.

By starting with a known compound, Recursion intends to cut the time and cost of finding new rare-disease therapies. There are about 7,000 rare diseases, or conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 Americans, according to the National Organization for Rare Disorders.

Recursion genetically manipulates human cells to create models of disease. Then it images the cells and uses machine learning to see how this manipulation affected the cell. This is like facial recognition, but applied to images of cells, Chief Executive Christopher Gibson said.

Mutating a specific gene might cause the cell's nucleus to become elongated and lead to certain other changes. Recursion examines about 1,000 parameters per cell, Dr. Gibson said.

Then it exposes the cells to thousands of chemical compounds to find ones that restore them back to their original, pre-manipulation state. Through imaging and machine learning, Recursion can also tell what cellular changes the drug induced.

Salt Lake City-based Recursion, formed to advance University of Utah technology, says it has partnerships with three of the largest pharmaceutical companies, including a deal with Sanofi Genzyme.

Other startups using artificial intelligence to repurpose medicines include NuMedii Inc., which has joined Astellas to identify new indications for undisclosed Astellas compounds. Some corporations are also interested in using Recursion technology to better-understand novel therapies in development, Dr. Gibson said.

Recursion has its own drug pipeline, including a treatment for cerebral cavernous malformation, which in severe cases can lead to brain hemorrhages. Instead of advancing them into clinical trials, Recursion intends to license these compounds out or create spinoffs that would move them into human studies. This enables Recursion to target many diseases and concentrate on its strengths in technology and drug discovery, Dr. Gibson said.

Tracy's Take:  Living Wills' Are In What's Next? The Wall Street Journal's financial regulation newsletter for Monday, October 3, 2016.

Tracy's Take:  Living Wills' Are In What's Next?

Deutsche Bank, U.S. DOJ Continue to Discuss Mortgage-Securities Settlement

Current and Former MPS, Deutsche Bank, Nomura Executives Charged in Italy

Taiwan's Top Financial Regulator Steps Down Over Mega Financial

Sam Wyly to Pay $198.1 Million to Settle SEC Legal Battle

 Living Wills' Are In What's Next?

Saturday was a big day for a handful of U.S. megabanks: the deadline for filing revised "living wills" to the Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. "http://www.wsj.com/articles/regulators-reject-living-wills-of-five-huge-u-s-banks-1460548801" have been under orders since April to fix "deficiencies" in the documents, or else face sanctions.

Now the clock is ticking for regulators to judge whether their perceived deficiencies are fixed and the path ahead is a political minefield with huge implications for the future of America's largest financial institutions.

Living wills are supposed to describe how firms could go through bankruptcy without a bailout. Since keeping banks from being "too big to fail" has been a crucial goal of policy makers since 2008, these documents are more than just regulatory minutiae. Regulators' determination about whether the wills are credible, expected months from now, could dent the case for big-bank breakups, or bolster it.

The living-will process kicked off under the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial-overhaul law, which required banks to show that they could feasibly go through bankruptcy without taxpayer help. Big banks filed their first drafts in 2012, and new versions every year since.

In mid-April, the Fed and the FDIC said living wills filed by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Wells Fargo & Co., Bank of America Corp., Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and State Street Corp. weren't credible or didn't facilitate an orderly bankruptcy. That finding triggered a provision of Dodd-Frank that requires banks to fix regulators' perceived problems or face sanctions, which can include higher capital requirements and eventually forced divestitures i.e., breakups. Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen"http://www.wsj.com/articles/yellen-calls-for-regulatory-relief-for-small-banks-1475071213" the Fed is prepared to impose higher capital requirements if it isn't satisfied.

The five banks were given until Oct. 1 to refile their plans. The timetable of less than six months left banks in a mad dash to fix regulators' concerns.

Some regulatory watchers have speculated that banks are playing a rigged game, where the Fed and FDIC won't ever be satisfied unless the firms massively shrink. But there is evidence regulators want banks to pass this test.

One very large bank, Citigroup Inc., "http://www.wsj.com/articles/citigroups-living-will-receives-passing-grade-from-regulators-1460548808" in April showing "http://www.wsj.com/articles/citigroup-wells-fargo-swap-bad-boy-role-1460577938". Unlike in the past, when regulators didn't give banks much feedback about the living wills, staffers from the two agencies held regulatory "office hours" this summer, as often as weekly, where banks could ask about topics such as derivatives and liquidity, according to people familiar with the matter.

There is also a political dynamic: If the five firms make significant improvements, senior regulators appointed by President Barack Obama may be able to cite those results as proof of progress before they follow him out of office.

On the other hand, giving all the banks a passing grade would open regulators to a credibility test of their own. The Wells Fargo"http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-wells-fargos-high-pressure-sales-culture-spiraled-out-of-control-1474053044" has "http://www.wsj.com/articles/lawmakers-take-more-swings-at-wells-fargo-ceo-john-stumpf-1475171906" just how massive these firms are, with millions of accounts and sprawling operations. Living wills contemplate the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-next-dodd-frank-headache-for-banks-living-wills-1456781482" of a huge, complex, interconnected megabank filing for bankruptcy, and ask whether that scenario would lead to economic mayhem. Imagine being the regulator trying to explain to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) that the answer is "no."

Money-market funds and other eligible investors poured $412.5 billion into the Fed's overnight repo program Friday, its second-highest balance since the record was set Dec. 31 last year with $474.6 billion, Fed data show. That sapped dollars away from traders and securities dealers who tend to use cash from money-market funds to finance their day-to-day activities..

Chicago's Struggling Schools Made Wall Street $110 Million

Morgan Chase & Co. and Chicago-based Nuveen Asset Management have made realized and paper profits exceeding $110 million on purchases this year of $763 million in Chicago Public Schools bonds. The school system has said it needed the money to replenish its dwindling coffers before the new school year and to build and repair facilities.

The terms of the bond sales highlight the choices the school district faces after years of pension shortfalls and relying heavily on borrowing. The 397,000-student school district struggled to sell municipal bonds in February until Nuveen bought about one-third, and the district decided in July to borrow directly from J.P. Morgan for fear that investors might balk again, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Board of Education said.

But don't expect the Chinese currency to overtake the U.S. dollar any time soon as the dominant currency when it comes to reserve management or portfolio investment. Near-term concerns about China's slowing growth and rapid credit expansion, along with lingering doubts over its legal and regulatory framework, would keep many overseas investors from converting into the yuan, also known as renminbi.

Why Capital Standards Should Account for Operational Risk

The focus on stress-test capital has shifted attention away from the operational risks that banks face and begs the question whether U.S. regulators are taking an "overly-simple approach to regulatory capital," according to a "http://www.fedfin.com/images/stories/client_reports/FedFin. "Operational risk-based capital aligned with improved safety and soundness creates incentives to reduce risk   no capital charge no matter how high can prevent risks like natural disasters," FedFin managing partner Karen Petrou wrote.

The Fed Needs to Act Faster on Payments

The Federal Reserve has an opportunity to change how the payment system works by making it faster, easier, and cheaper to process debit card and check transactions. But because they have not acted quickly, it is more likely that financial technology firms will act on their own, "https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/why-dont-checks-clear-instantly-ask-the-fed/". Mr. Klein articulates many of the problems with the existing payment system it disadvantages those who do not have credit cards and it prevents people from getting their payments processed in a timely manner.

 Investing' in Public Infrastructure

The U.S. and Europe are lowering capital standards for "investments" in public infrastructure ignoring the lessons from 2007-08, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-subprime-superhighway-1475445396". He cites the EU's "attempt to  incentivize' more insurance investment in public infrastructure as part of its  Solvency II' regulatory regime." And the U.S., he says, "seems set to follow Europe's lead."

ON WALL STREET
Worries intensify that Silicon Valley's debt binge has gone too far

If debt is your game, Silicon Valley is not your natural playground. This is a land of equity. Daring venture capitalists are looking for the next Google - and a tenfold return on their money. They do not want security, just a cut of the upside. In truth, though, the technology sector is not averse to borrowing when it can. Now it is on something of a debt bender - and there are some worrying signs that it might have gone too far.

Across the leveraged loan market , investors' desperation for yield has been great for companies: borrowing costs have hit record lows. Technology, though, is especially hot. Loans have grown more than a fifth in the past four years, faster than the broader market. Barclays notes that tech now accounts for almost 20 per cent of the S&P LSTA Loan Index, double its share of 10 years ago.

It looks likely to be getting bigger still. Eric Gross, analyst at Barclays, points out that a big proportion of the growth is tied to riskier activity, with the share of loans used for acquisitions and buyouts growing by a factor of six. This might be benign if profits had risen in lockstep. But they have not. For loans to software companies, the ratio of total debt to earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation has risen from 4.2 before the crisis to 5.3 today.

Lenders used to be put off by the "soft" aspect - there are few hard assets to seize and sell if the company hits the skids. Now, there is much more attention on recurring revenues - the sticky subscription model of "software as a service" that is supposed to prove reliable even in a worsening economy. It is not battle-tested, however. "That, in my opinion, is what is worrisome about this whole thing, that relaxation," says Mr Gross. "Even though those recurring revenues are a real thing, it's very difficult to quantify. Things change quickly in tech."

Part of the issuance is linked to private equity firms roaming beyond their traditional targets. Buyouts used to focus on tech companies that generate plenty of cash. Now, two private equity firms in particular - Thoma Bravo and Vista Equity Partners - are going after faster-growing, less profitable tech companies.

There is proportionally less debt but there is a good reason for that: the cash flows are so small. Thoma Bravo acquired data analytics firm Qlik Technologies for $3bn this year with a loan of $1.1bn. That is a lower debt-equity mix than a typical LBO that might use 75 per cent debt. Yet the company has just $13m in ebitda. It is a big bet on revenue growth, not the typical buyout thesis.

Even outside of an acquisition, some fast-growing companies are leaning more on debt markets. Uber is somehow considered big and stable enough for a $1.15bn leveraged loan at a mere 5 per cent yield, even though it makes no profits. If they are smart, more so-called unicorns will get in on the act. It saves the pain of another equity fundraising round: even the most desirable private tech companies, such as Uber, will find it increasingly difficult to find enough new investors willing to write ever bigger cheques to support a higher valuation. Going for debt rather than equity also spares early investors from further dilution, and buys more breathing room before a listing.

Even among earlier-stage companies, bank debt is featuring and showing signs of overheating. Silicon Valley Bank , which focuses on start-ups, is the de facto lender. It might add a $5m term loan at the same time as a young company does a $20m equity fundraising.

"As companies stay private for longer, they start to have business metrics - you're willing to lend more money," says Craig Becker, chief executive of SVB. Yet there are unnerving signs, too. For the past three quarters, SVB has reported an elevated level of charge-offs on loans, blaming "continued softness in early-stage venture funding".

Start-ups count on equity investors to give them more money to burn. Now, those venture capitalists are guarding their wallets a little tighter and entrepreneurs are burning through their bank loans instead. Mr Becker said SVB had reduced the portion of loans made to early-stage companies to about 6 per cent of its $18bn loan portfolio, down from 35 per cent in 2001.

The jitters in that part of the market, though, should be heeded up and down an increasingly debt-fuelled Silicon Valley.

Transcript: Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf's House Testimony; Wells Fargo executive faces repeated attacks over the bank's sales practices from members of the House Financial Services Committee

John Stumpf, chairman and CEO of Wells Fargo & Co., "http://www.wsj.com/articles/lawmakers-take-more-swings-at-wells-fargo-ceo-john-stumpf-1475171906" on Thursday, Sept. 29, 2016. The hearing focused on problems with Wells Fargo's sales practices, including how unauthorized customer accounts and meddling in customer business snowballed over five years. Here is an unedited transcript from Federal News Service:

Chairman Jeb HENSARLING (R., Texas): The committee will come to order.

Without objection, the chair is authorized to declare a recess of the committee at any time.

The hearing is entitled "Holding Wall Street Accountable: Investigating Wells Fargo's Opening of Unauthorized Customer Accounts."

I now recognize myself for five minutes to give an opening statement.

We are here today because millions of Americans were ripped off by their bank and seemingly let down by their government. Fraud is fraud. Theft is theft. And what happened at Wells Fargo over the course of many years cannot be described any other way.

In fact, a whole host of federal laws were potentially violated, including the Truth in Savings Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Securities and Exchange Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

All charges must be thoroughly investigated and all culpable individuals must be held accountable.

And while the fine Wells Fargo will pay, roughly 3 percent of the bank's second quarterly profits, is tiny by Wall Street standards, the harm caused to consumers and employees is not. To the factory worker who just had her credit score dinged because of the fraud Wells Fargo perpetrated, the cost is big. To the waiter at the local diner, living paycheck to paycheck, who had to pay fees associated with a fraudulent account, the cost is big. To the Wells Fargo employee with kids to support, who lost her job because she refused to participate in the scheme, the cost is big.

HENSARLING: We will make sure those who were betrayed by Wells Fargo are not forgotten. It is in their behalf that our committee has launched an in-depth investigation, Mr. Stumpf, of your bank's activities. And let me be clear, today's hearing is just the beginning of our investigation. It is not the end. And as I speak our committee is gathering thousands of pages of records and documents from both Wells Fargo and the relevant federal regulators.

In the coming weeks we will be questioning Wells Fargo executives. If necessary, I will not hesitate to issue subpoenas because we will do what is necessary to get to the bottom of the matter.

Mr. Stumpf, we don't yet know what you knew when you knew it and what -- and what you chose to do about it. But we know it happened on your watch and we hold you accountable for the answers to why this happened.

At last week's Senate hearing you were uncertain of many matters. In the intervening days we trust that you have had a chance to refresh your recollection, to review your records, therefore we hope and expect you'll provide more complete answers today.

We need to know exactly when and how you and other executives at Wells Fargo found out about this endemic fraud. We need to know today what you directed others to do about it when you found out.

We need to know today who in management is being held accountable. We already know that as far back as 2009, former Wells Fargo employees started filing wrongful termination lawsuits, alleging fraudulent accounts, and improper sales tactics were taking place.

Approximately 5,300 Wells Fargo employees were fired over a five- year period for these improper sales practices, and perhaps as many as two million unauthorized accounts were fraudulently opened.

Based on these facts, we will also be asking serious questions of our regulators in the course of this investigation. If OCC had examiners on site at Wells Fargo during the time when these fraudulent accounts were open, and the CFPB was conducting regular examinations, why did it seemingly take "The L.A. Times" to expose the fraud? And once exposed, why did it take almost 18 months for the CFPB to initiate a supervisory review?

Today I don't know the answers to the questions. Perhaps our federal regulators deserve a pat on the back, but perhaps they deserve a swift kick on the backside. We'll find out which.

But we launched this investigation ultimately because it is our -- ultimately because it is both our job to hold both Wall Street and Washington accountable and to protect consumers from the excesses of both.

True consumer protection is the preservation of competitive, innovative, free markets that are vigorously policed for force (ph), fraud, and deception.

Mr. Stumpf, I know that Wells Fargo represents an iconic brand. I know that your bank has a very rich and proud heritage. I also know that you have hundreds of thousands of good employees who had nothing to do with this sordid affair, who do good work in building their communities.

But this sordid affair does remind me why I trust markets and I do not trust individual companies. And Mr. Stumpf, I regrettably have a mortgage with your bank. I wish I didn't. If I was in the position to pay it off, I would, because you have broken my trust and you have broken the trust of millions of others and it will be a long, long time to earn that trust back.

I now recognize the ranking member for five minutes.

Ranking Member Maxine WATERS (D., Calif.): Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And I thank you for agreeing to hold this hearing so that we can examine the fraudulent activity that occurred at Wells Fargo.

Mr. Stumpf, the word games stop today. Borrowing a customer's money without permission is not a sales practice violation, it's stealing. Using customer Social Security numbers to open credit cards without their consent is not wrongful sales behavior, it is identity theft. So let's call it what it really is.

Some of the most egregious fraud we have seen since the foreclosure crisis. For at least five years, Wells Fargo pushed aggressive sales goals for low-wage employees that were so unrealistic and so unattainable that some felt pressured to commit crimes just to keep their jobs.

It may have happened over two million times. Two million times. In fact, we have two former Wells Fargo workers, Julie Miller and Ruth Ladranverde (ph) today in the audience, who have borne the brunt of your choices.

Meanwhile, your senior management, board of directors encouraged, even bragged about behavior amounting to widespread fraud.

Today I hope you came to -- prepared to explain both how and why. While you personally told me you were prepared to take full responsibility, we have seen your testimony in front of the Senate Banking Committee and there are still answers that need to be given.

The testimony that we have witnessed in the Senate trying to explain what happened is not satisfactory, and we still do not have all of the information we need to understand how this happened, when the sales culture turned toxic, and who knew about it and when. Despite your statements to the contrary, any legitimate investigation shows that executives at Wells Fargo knew -- either knew or should have known much earlier than 2013 that these practices were taking place.

I think that executive conduct at Wells Fargo deserves a thorough investigation by the Department of Justice. Someone is responsible for the broken culture that led to this behavior, and (ph) needs to be held responsible; not the lower-level employees that have been left to bear the weight of the mistakes that have been made. This issue is personal for me. The size of Wells Fargo -- Wells Fargo's footprint in California means that many, if not most, of the employees and customers who were victimized by this are my constituents and neighbors. They don't deserve to have their trust violated by Wells Fargo, no one did.

I'm still receiving calls in my office complaining about Wells Fargo now and one caller described how he went into the bank, complained about excessive accounts that he knew nothing about, the employees called the police on him, and he was arrested; and yet violating the public's trust to drive up profits is exactly what Wells Fargo did. In the Senate hearing, it was revealed that even you benefit from that, Mr. Stumpf, your own bank account benefited from that deception. Now I know that you said you take responsibility for these practices and that you're conducting your own investigations, and that you and other managers are forgoing some of your compensation. That is welcomed, but let me be clear, it's not enough.

Unfortunately, this is not the first time we have seen abusive practices at Wells Fargo. We thought that you were working on these practices six years ago. Your mortgage executives said right here in this very chair, reassuring my subcommittee that you were committed to fixing Wells Fargo's forgery of mortgage documents, and yet we haven't seen the problem fixed, we have just seen it migrate to another part of your bank. So I hope today we can hear from you, Mr. Stumpf, because the American public deserves to know what happened at Wells Fargo and why customers are ripped off so blatantly and repeatedly. You can also rest assured that this is just the beginning and that we will be demanding more information until we get to the bottom of this.

And of course, I urge your cooperation and I must tell you that I have known you for a while, I have communicated with you. At times you have been very helpful to my constituents, so I'm very disappointed and we must get to the bottom of this.

And I want to be able to receive the documents and information that we requested from you, I'm told that they have been refused. I think it is to your best interest to come forward with those documents.

Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.

HENSARLING: The gentlelady yields back. Today we'll receive the testimony of Mr. John Stumpf, who is the Chairman and CEO of Wells Fargo and Company. Mr. Stumpf has held a number of senior management positions at Wells and its predecessors where he has worked for 34 years.

Mr. Stumpf, would you please rise and raise your right hand.

Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?

Wells Fargo CEO John STUMPF: (OFF-MIKE)

HENSARLING: Thank you, please be seated.

Let the record reflect that the witness has answered in the affirmative. Without objection, the witness' written statement will be made part of the record.

Mr. Stumpf, you are now recognized for five minutes to give an oral presentation of your testimony.

STUMPF: Chairman Hensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to be with you today. I'm the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Wells Fargo, where I have worked for nearly 35 years.

It is my privilege to lead this company, which was founded over 164 years ago, and played a vital role in the financial history and development of our country.

I am deeply sorry that we failed to fulfill our responsibility to our customers, to our team members, and to the American public. I am fully accountable for all unethical sales practices in our retail banking business and I'm fully committed to fixing this issue, strengthening our culture, and taking the necessary steps and actions to restore our customers' trust.

We should have done more sooner, but we will not stop working until we get this right. This morning, I will update you on a number of steps taken to address our retail bank sales practices problem and make things rights for customers who may have been harmed. At Wells Fargo, we have new leadership in our retail banking business, focused on ensuring that all team members in our retail bank provide the best service to our customers.

Secondly, we recently announced the elimination of product sales goals for everyone in retail banking, effective January 1. Today, I am announcing that we are accelerating this process and ending all product sales goals effective at the end of this week. We want to make sure nothing gets in the way of doing what is right for our customers.

Also, we now send out to all customers a confirmation e-mail approximately one hour after opening a savings or checking account, and an acknowledgement letter after a customer applies for a credit card. We're also making it right for customers. We have begun contacting the customers with open credit cards identified by PriceWaterhouseCoopers to determine whether they wanted these credit cards.

It's early in the process, but so far we have reached more than 20,000 of these customers and talked to them about their credit card accounts. Fewer than 25 percent have told us they either did not apply for the card or they cannot recall whether they applied or not for the card. For those customers who want the card, the card will remain open. For any customer who does not want their card, we are closing the account and informing the credit bureaus. Any fees these customers may have paid already have been refunded and we are developing a process to deal with any other forms of harm.

For deposit customers, we have refunded fees and are contacting every single one of them across the country to ensure that we have a full understanding of every customer affected by this problem. In addition, we are voluntarily expanding the scope of the reviews we have done, to go back in time to 2010 and 2009.

While these issues we will discuss today are deeply disappointing and will take time to repair, they do not represent the true culture and nature of Wells Fargo. Some have suggested the problem was cross- selling, but that is not the case. At its core, cross-selling is all about deepening customer household relationships with products they want, they use and they value. It is not about improper sales practices used to create unwanted accounts. That's not good for our customers and not good for Wells Fargo.

If we take care of our customers, they will deepen their relationships with us and trust us more with their business. That is good for customers who benefit from lower costs we pass on, and that is cross-selling done the right way.

In closing, I'd like to talk about my commitment to accountability. When I say I am accountable, I'm referring to the actions our board took at my recommendation to forfeit the stock awards that are the largest part of my compensation for the past three years, and any bonus this year, as well as my agreement to work without salary until the board completes its investigation. I respect and accept the board's decision.

And when I say I'm accountable, I also mean accountable for leading Wells Fargo as the company restores the trust of customers, team members, and investors.

Thank you for this opportunity to testify today.

HENSARLING: The chair now yields himself five minutes for questions.

Mr. Stumpf, to the American people, this kind of feels like deja vu all over again. Some institution is found engaging in terrible activities. There's a headline, fine. And yet no one seems to be held accountable. I mean, let's face it; the fine that's been assessed to you is probably a rounding error again, in your quarterly earnings report.

So my question is, you know, with almost perhaps as many as 2 million fraudulent accounts over the course of five years, 5,000 dismissed employees, it's just beyond credibility that somebody up the food chain didn't either order this, condone it or turn a blind eye to it.

So my question to you is who is the highest ranking official at Wells, who's the highest person in the management team who's been dismissed because of these activities?

STUMPF: Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for that question. As you know within -- or maybe you don't know -- but within the 5,300, there were managers and managers and managers of a manager. We are doing a full review...

HENSARLING: But were these branch managers?

STUMPF: Yes about 10 percent or more...

HENSARLING: And nobody above the branch manager level?

STUMPF: No there was managers of the branch manager and a manager of those within the line of business. But we're doing a full review of other control functions within the company. That process has already begun.

The board is going to be involved. Management will be involved. As I mentioned, we...

HENSARLING: And when will this be complete? When will your own internal investigation be complete to hold management accountable?

STUMPF: I can't give you a specific time frame, Mr. Chairman. But I will tell you, we're moving in that directly and we're going to get to the bottom of this.

HENSARLING: OK well, is anybody at the bank holding company level being held accountable?

STUMPF: People will be reviewed across the board at holding company, activities, corporate activities. Anybody who is involved in -- in promoting or supporting this behavior will be help accountable.

(CROSSTALK)

HENSARLING: OK but holding people accountable, isn't it true Mr. Stumpf, in the settlement agreement that Wells entered into with the OCC, the CFPB and the L.A. city attorneys office, no individual admits guilt. Is that correct? Is that part of that settlement agreement?

STUMPF: I -- I believe we either did not admit or deny. So -- so the facts there are the facts that we agreed to.

HENSARLING: Mr. Stumpf, let's go back to 2011 which I think is the first year we know for a fact that these fraudulent activities were taking place.

The records that I believe your bank has shared with us show that 939 employees were terminated from the retail banking sector for improper sales practice in that year. Does that comport with your memory?

STUMPF: Yes it does, Mr. Chairman.

HENSARLING: OK so in 2011, isn't it true that Wells Fargo entered into a consent order with the Federal Reserve that required wells to cease and desist from certain practices in the mortgage lending department?

And that you paid an $85 million civil penalty is that true?

STUMPF: Mr. Chairman, that's true. That was in a different business area. But that is a true statement.

HENSARLING: It was in a different business area, but I will read from the consent order, quote, "Wells Fargo's internal controls were not adequate to detect and prevent instances when certain of its sales personnel, in order to meet sales performance standards and receive incentive compensation altered or falsified income documents and inflated perspective borrowers' income to qualify them for loans that they would not otherwise have been qualified to receive.

This sounds eerily like the retail banking division. Also as I understand it, the Fed required Wells Fargo to submit a plan to investigate and to change policies and procedures. So I think you testified on the senate side that you were not personally aware of the problems in the retail banking division until 2013.

Surely, you are aware of the problems in the mortgage lending division in 2011, correct?

STUMPF: That is correct. And chairman, Mr. Chairman, we shut that division down. That -- that was even shut down...

HENSARLING: But if you solve the problem in one area of the business, why didn't you thoroughly investigate in the other?

STUMPF: There is no question Mr. Chairman, we should have done more sooner.

HENSARLING: It just seems, Mr. Stumpf that five years later your bank is being fined for exactly the same transaction. And again, it just feels like deja vu all over again. And I hope and trust. But please tell me, that these fines are not simply a cost of doing business for Wells.

STUMPF: Mr. Chairman, it's not a cost of doing business. This has -- this is a serious you know, trust issue with our customer. But I also want to say there's 268,000 people who came to work this morning at Wells Fargo.

Trying to do their very best to serve customers and they do it wonderful every day. And I don't want our culture to be defined by these mistakes. And we take accountability.

HENSARLING: I understand that, Mr. Stumpf. But it appears to be a little late and particularly when you get caught doing it five years ago, you get caught doing it once again. Somebody has to be held accountable.

I now yield to the ranking member.

WATERS: Thank you very much.

Mr. Stumpf, you had said repeatedly that you were not aware of this widespread fraud in your bank until late in 2013. And it appears that there were activities going on that indicates you may have known much earlier than that.

For example, in 2007 just months after you became CEO, the sales quality manual for the community bank and division was updated with your executive guidance. As them manual states, that sales guide reminded employees what should have been obvious.

That they needed to obtain a customer's consent before opening an account. And so, am I to understand that you discovered that there was something going on and there was a need for you to do this?

The manual also said that sales practices that show quote, "Questionable activity," unquote, would be sent via high priority to bank executive. So it appears that, you knew something in 2007 that unauthorized accounts were a big enough problem that you had to correct your employee manual.

And as early as 2008, I have documents from court filings showing your employees we're contacting your ethics hotline, reporting bank fraud and complaining to managers over unauthorized accounts.

And so, it looks as if you certainly knew in 2008. What's more, I have here a consent order with the Fed from 2011 that puts your company on watch for sales quotas and compensation schemes that pushed employees to break the law. Does this sound familiar?

STUMPF: Ranking Member, I -- I acknowledge that we had a 2011 order from the Federal Reserve. And I think we've always known, any sales organization you're going to half to be diligent because not every team member will do everything right, every day.

So we have controls built in, we have ethics lines and I knew -- and I still know that you know, you put people to work every day and mistakes are going to happen. It was not until 2013 when I learned that this problem had been growing, it had been more prevalent and in a certain part of the country which happens to be in -- in -- in the wonderful part of California in which you live.

So these are -- these are things we're been working on. All of our strategies around training team members which get two weeks of classroom training before they go out into a branch is about -- about doing things right, about ethics.

And I'd also just wanna remind the committee that there are the vast majority of our people who had same opportunities, the same training (ph), the same goals who get it right everyday for our customers.

In fact, our customer and loyalty scores now are the highest they've ever been in our company's history.

WATERS: Let me just point out some other activities that should sound familiar to you. While you were under the consent order for the mortgage arm of Wells Fargo, this fraud was surging in the retail arm of Wells Fargo.

But you didn't connect the dots on these high-level trends across the bank. Do you or didn't you know in 2011 that perhaps your sales incentive were -- were driving this fraud?

STUMPF: Congresswoman, I -- I knew that -- at least I know today -- that we should've done more soon. But maybe -- and not only maybe -- some of our people and again it's one percent. But that's a big number for a big organization.

Any time -- any one time we have 100,000 people in our branch network and if 800 people for whatever reason either misunderstood or use this as a way to be dishonest and break our code of ethics and do something wrong for a -- for a customer and something wrong for us.STUMPF: That's why we're removing sales goals. They'll be gone as of this weekend. In fact, we don't even think they're an important requirement anymore for us to continue to grow.

WATERS: Mr. Stumpf, some people assume that you changed your customer agreement to add forced arbitration clauses for checking accounts and that these clauses proved to be incredibly helpful when you use them to dismiss multiple customer lawsuits. Is that true?

STUMPF: That's not true. Actually, I think arbitration does make sense. But in this case, for any customer that might have been harmed in this situation, we're also paying for a mediation process so they have a mediator.

WATERS: All right, thank you very much. My time is up and I'll get to this later on if I can, thank you. I yield back.

HENSARLING: time of the gentlelady has expired. The chair now recognizes the gentlemen from Texas, Mr. Neugebauer, Chairman of our Financial Intuition Subcommittee.

Rep. Randy NEUGEBAUER (R., Texas): Thank you Mr. Chairman. You serve as both the Chairman and CEO of the Wells Fargo, is that correct?

STUMPF: Congressman, that is correct.

NEUGEBAUER: And as you're aware, section 972 of Dodd-Frank requires an issuer of securities to disclose the annual proxy statement, the reason why the issuer has chosen to allow the same person to serve as the Board Chairman and the CEO. Fisher Wells states that your dual role is a result of your extensive experience and knowledge regarding the company and provides the most efficient leadership of the Board and the company.

Mr. Stumpf, do you think it's a good idea for the Chairman and to be the Chairman of the Board and the CEO?

STUMPF: Thank you Congressmen for that question. In our company, we have 14 outside directors. We have a Lead Director. All Directors are New York Stock Exchange, independent by their standards. I'm not a member of any standing committee of that Board. The independent Directors and the Lead Director help set the agenda for the Boards. They always have meetings that are Executive Session without me. And you as you probably read about what happened this weekend because we filed an 8-K yesterday about actions that they took as an independent Board and I was not part of that. So the Board acts quite independently.

NEUGEBAUER: So the current situation is that you've recused yourself from Board decisions on this situation?

STUMPF: Congressman, you're right. I have either recused or I've not been invited. I'm' not part of that. I serve at the pleasure of the Board.

NEUGEBAUER: So, give me a good idea of how your Board is structured, but the original question was, do you think that's a good idea for the CEO to be also the Chairman. Would the board and stock shareholders, customers, be better served if there was some separation in that area?

STUMPF: Thank you, for our company I believe we have the right structure. But again, I serve at the will of the Board and the Board can make a decision on that.

NEUGEBAUER: Mr. Stumpf, you testified that you learned of these violations some time in 2013. When did you inform the Board that this was an issue?

STUMPF: Yes. So the Board had high-level ethics, line, comments or questions, or high-level kinds of activities around people who left the company, involuntary, terminations, really through the 2011 through 2013 time frame. After we learned...

NEUGEBAUER: I want you to repeat that. You said the Board was having some discussions as early as 2011 about this?

STUMPF: I was saying that the Board, from 2011 to 2013, would get reports at a Committee level, at a high-level about ethics, lines, requests, or information at not a granular but maybe at the company level.

NEUGEBAUER: But you didn't find out about it until 2013?

STUMPF: In 2013, I became aware there was an issue in the Southwestern part of the country and by 2014 then -- this was late in the year -- by 2014, we started to provide more information to more Committees of the Board. And then by 2015 the Board had a -- the Risk Committee Board had a complete report on that issue.

NEUGEBAUER: As Chairman of the Board, the CEO, when did you tell the board we have a problem?

STUMPF: It was in 2015 that we had a full report. Again, as I've already said in my testimony to the Senate and here today, 2014 we were starting to get more granular information that this was a risk area for the company to focus on.

NEUGEBAUER: Did you ever disclose this issue on a 10-K filing?

STUMPF: Our 10-K or all of our K or Q filings are facts and circumstances, what we knew at the time. As recently as our second quarter Q this year, when we use our disclosure teams and compliance teams to look at this issue, the facts and circumstances, we believe we're not material.

NEUGEBAUER: I think that's just -- I'm not for Congress setting the corporate structure, but I do think there is some question, whether the company would have been better served with those roles being separated. I yield back.

HENSARLING: Time Mr. Gentlemen has expired. The Chair now recognizes the gentlelady from New York, Ms. Maloney, Ranking Member of our Capital Markets Subcommittee.

Rep. Carolyn MALONEY (D., N.Y.): Mr. Stumpf, we know now that whistleblowers first contacted the Consumer Financial Control board about the fraud at Wells Fargo in mid-2013. And you said in your Senate hearings last week that you first found out about the fake accounts in late 2013. And the L.A. Times article about the scandal was published in December 21, 2013.

I have right here your form for filing, which I'd like to submit to the record that shows...

HENSARLING: Without objection.

MALONEY: That shows that on October 30, 2013, you sold $13 million worth of Wells Fargo stock on the open market. That is by far, the largest open market sale of Wells Fargo stock that you made in your 9 years as CEO. So my question is, did you dump $13 million of Wells Fargo stock, which you did through your family trust, right after you found out that your bank had been fraudulently opening hundreds of thousands of scam accounts ripping off your customers?

STUMPF: Thank you for the question. First of all, the vast majority of our people go to work every day...

MALONEY: Excuse me, that was not my question.

STUMPF: But I'll get to the...

MALONEY: Excuse me, excuse me. My question was, did you dump the stock after you found out about the fraudulent accounts, because it seems that the timing is very, very suspicious and it raises serious questions.

STUMPF: I did not sell shares at the time because anything related to...

MALONEY: But your form 4 said you sell the shares.

STUMPF: I sold the shares. Today I hold four times as many shares as I'm required. I want to...

MALONEY: Did you sell these shares or not?

STUMPF: I sold those shares and I sold them with proper approvals, with no view about anything that was going on with sales practices or anything else.

MALONEY: Well, it seems very, very suspicious that your largest sale was right after your $1.8 trillion bank was turned into a school for scoundrels. You acknowledge that your bank fired over 5,300 people who got caught willfully defrauding your customers.

And a recent lawsuit alleges you fired even more people because they refused to willfully defraud customers. And then, then you blame the low-level people, you fire them. You make profits, then you dump the stock.

So, I just have to say that it seems that when you found out about the fake accounts, instead of helping your customers, you first helped yourself. So moving right along to the next question.

Mr. Stumpf, you've said that Wells Fargo is conducting a review of all accounts going back to 2009 in order to identify any scam accounts. But last week in the Senate hearings, you were asked if you would extend the review period to before 2009? And you refused to commit to extending the review period back to even earlier.MALONEY: So, if you were -- if you were presented with hard core evidence that Wells was engaged in some of these practices, these illegal scams prior to 2009, would you change your mind about extending the review?

STUMPF: Thank you for that question. We have agreed with our regulators to go back to 2011. We voluntarily said last week that we'll go back to 2010 and 2009, I told our team to leave no stone unturned, and if we find a situation where a customer is harmed that goes back prior to that, we will make it right for that customer.

MALONEY: Thank you, because I have the evidence right here, and I'd like to submit for the record a court case in Montana in which six Wells Fargo employees were fired. Among other things, ordering debit cards for customers without their permission, which is clearly illegal, and according to the court documents, these illegal sales go back to 2007.

HENSARLING: Without objection.

MALONEY: So now we have evidence of illegal sales practices going back to 2007. Will you agree to extend the review period back to 2007 to cover this evidence that we're submitting today?

STUMPF: Again, Congresswoman, we're going to go back to 2009, if we can find -- and we're going to contact every customer...

MALONEY: But this is evidence that it went back to 2007. My question is -- and we thank you for going back to 2009 -- my question is, we have clear evidence that it goes back to 2007. Will you live up to your commitment of helping your customers that were defrauded with clear evidence back to 2007?

STUMPF: We will go back and if we find any evidence of any customer that was harmed to 2007 through our review through 2009, we will take care of each customer.

HENSARLING: The time of the gentlelady has expired. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. McHenry, Vice Chairman of our committee.

Rep. Patrick MCHENRY (R., N.C.): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So I have the honor of representing the suburbs of Charlotte, North Carolina. North Carolina had an incredible banking culture over decades, yet in Charlotte, First Union, homegrown bank, great reputation, went through challenging times in the economic crisis as you well know. But before that time, they teamed up with a bank based in Winston-Salem, Wachovia, and as you know in acquiring what was then called Wachovia, which was really First Union and Wachovia, the pitch was that your culture from California was very similar to this North Carolina culture -- this banking culture.

You know -- you -- and as you well know, John Grimes Medlin, who was a great Chairman of Wachovia, sort of imbued in Wachovia this culture that a banker is a civil servant as well. There is this obligation to society they have in their community, you eulogize him.

STUMPF: Yes.

MCHENRY: Paid tribute to that culture.

STUMPF: Yes.

MCHENRY: So I want to think about that culture, because what -- what is so sad to me is that pitch of culture doesn't conform with my experience with my constituents in North Carolina. It doesn't conform what I know about First Union, what I know about Wachovia, and this cultural pitch that you had in acquiring them in the financial crisis. I know you have a huge head count in North Carolina, we're grateful for it, but what's sad to me is the impact of this on them and those employees you have in North Carolina. So, I wanted to look at your code of conduct, the (inaudible).

So, let's look at your code of ethics and business conduct. You said in your message as CEO, "we are all responsible for maintaining the highest possible ethical standards and how we conduct our business and serve our customers." The code of ethics in fact says, "our code applies to all team members, including officers, as well as directors of Wells Fargo and Company and its subsidiaries."

It also says "we are all accountable for complying with the code as well as all company policies and applicable laws." And finally, "it's critical that all team members have a solid understanding of our Company's code of ethics and business conduct and understanding that noncompliance with the policy may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment."

You clearly have failed. You've clearly failed in your own ethical standards internally, you have broken and your company has broken long-standing law. You have broken long-standing ethical standards that you have within your company. This has nothing to do with this debate about Dodd-Frank or anything else. You have broken a long-standing law and you have defrauded your customers, how can you rebuild trust? How can you rebuild trust and how can you get through this thing?

What standards are you holding yourself to that sends a message to the rest of these folks in your organization that look to you for leadership and guidance? What are you doing to restore that?

STUMPF: Well thank you, Congressman. The culture of the company is strong. I don't -- I know... MCHENRY: It's really hard to say that when you're before Congress for the second time and -- and behind you was all the settlements you've had for problematical -- problematic relationships you had with your customers by taking their money, right, counter to the law, counter to your ethical standards. So it's great that you say you have a strong culture, but why are we here today? How are you addressing that?

STUMPF: We are addressing it, first of all with respect to culture, you know we have 268,000 people who have made their life's work and careers out of helping customers. There is people today who are...

MCHENRY: And that's why I raise this in the way that I do, by severe disappointment -- severe disappointment. That's all. You broke the law. We make the law in Congress, this is not new stuff, that all of a sudden Congress changed some rules. And you can't have your employees create fake accounts and take fees from customers unknowingly, unwittingly. That is - that is -- there is never in human history when that has been an ethical OK, right?

So for you to say the culture is OK, this seems to me that you're just tone deaf to this. The final thing you need to think about and your Board of Directors needs to think about is this, the impact you have is not simply on your institution, but the wider conversation on how my consumers can access credit. And the implications on what you've done, and your leadership has done has this broader societal impact that is very negative.

HENSARLING: Time of the gentleman has expired. The Chair now recognizes the gentlelady from New York, Ms. Velazquez.

Rep. Nydia VELAZQUEZ (D., N.Y): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Stumpf, now that you were on the Senate side and you testified and we -- the Senators asked you whether or not the 5,300 Wells Fargo employees that were fired for their misconduct, how many of them were fired because they failed to meet sales quotas? At that time you say you didn't know, now that a week has passed and you have had a chance to consult your records and speak to your staff, are you prepared to tell us how many employees were fired for failing to meet their sales roles?

STUMPF: Thank you, Congresswoman. Of the 5,300, which is about 1,000 people per year out of our team, and I don't want to minimize it, it was 1 percent, equals about 100,000 people in our branch at any one time, all of those people through our investigation were terminated because of their unethical behaviors. We found them -- we decided we don't -- we can't have them here, they are not consistent with our culture and ethics.

VELAZQUEZ: Out of that 5,300 employees, were there any employee that was fired because they didn't meet their sales quota?

STUMPF: There were -- my understanding...

VELAZQUEZ: I'm not talking about the 5,300. Outside of that...

STUMPF: Outside -- outside of that, my understanding is that people should not be fired -- terminated, for missing sales goals. I'm not saying it didn't happen in...

VELAZQUEZ: How should I trust that that was the case?

STUMPF: And we're doing a review of whatever -- whoever might have been terminated for that.

VELAZQUEZ: OK, so my next question is, if your review shows that there were employees that were fired because they didn't meet their sales quota, would you be rehiring those individuals?

STUMPF: First of all, we don't have sales quotas, we have goals, and there's other goals that our people also have as part of their performance management. We're reviewing that and we're going to try to make it right for every team member.

VELAZQUEZ: Mr. Stumpf, I'm sure you're aware that Wells Fargo is the most active SBA 7A lender in the country.

STUMPF: Correct.

VELAZQUEZ: As ranking member of the House Small Business Committee I am very concerned about the illegal practices uncovered by the CFBB on the consumer side may have spread to the small business side. Were you front-line employees under similar pressure to cross sell products to the banks SBA 7A clients.

STUMPF: First of all thank you Congresswoman. We are the nations largest small business lender. I am very proud that we do a lot of work helping men and women across this country start businesses and so forth. That's a very different business and I don't know of any product sales goals, which again we've eliminated in our retail bank in that business. It's a very different business.

VELAZQUEZ: So the 7A program is just a fraction of your overall small business lending portfolio. Can you provide us today with assurances that these illegal practices did not affect any of your small business clients at Wells Fargo.

STUMPF: I don't have that information in front of me. I'm happy to work with my staff or team and get back to your staff and cooperate on that best I can.

VELAZQUEZ: Well, so given the fact that you lack the leadership to give us assurances that this was not the case, I'll be writing to the SBA administrator so that they could review all the 7A portfolios to make sure that we protect small businesses as well as tax payers.

My next question to you is, now that you have decided to end product sales goals and financial rewards, have you considered raising the salaries of your retail banking employees in order to make up for this loss in compensation?

STUMPF: Yes we are working on a new incentive program, it'll be out by the first of the year, and we want to make sure that our team members are totally aligned with our customers. And we want to make sure that compensation for our team again, through the vast majority do it right, are not hurt in this process.

VELAZQUEZ: I know you're not aware, but it is very difficult for any person in this country to live with a $25,000 salary.

HENSARLING: Time of the gentlelady had expired. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Garrett, chairman of our Capital Markets Subcommittee.

Rep. Scott GARRETT (R., N.J.): Thank you Mr. Chairman.

So Mr. Stumpf let me start by making a few observations then I'll end with a couple questions. First and foremost I find it, as we all do, extraordinarily troubling as I look through the history timeline of the scandal, timeline that stretches over years. You see as we've already been testified to, 5000 Wells Fargo employees were dismissed for their involvement opening unauthorized accounts. It was also interesting and troubling that the firings did not happen all at one time.

My understanding as we've heard already today is that roughly 1000 employees per year,  11,  12,  13,  14,  15. It's extraordinary how Well Fargo managed to not actively and decisively move to stop those activities after the first 100 or 500, 750, or 1,000 employees were fired is beyond me. The fact that it was allowed to go on and on and on and on for years is apparently a failure of corporate governments and a failure, quite candidly of your management.

Your management to what is foremost and that is to protect the customers who have trust in you. It concerns me even more over that it appears that most of the 5000 employees that were fired were low- level or mid-level employees. I think the Chairman just found out the highest level was a branch manager. And it doesn't even include those that resigned due to the culture at Wells Fargo. As I say, meanwhile no -- to the best of my knowledge -- senior executives have been held accountable in the same manner that the lower-level employees were.GARRETT: I would not be surprised if a number of those people ended up losing their homes, going into massive debt after they were dismissed. No I'm not defending their actions, just making a point that we have a problem in this country where it would seem, as we've seen previously, that the well connected and the well connected on Wall Street, or the well connected here in Washington, the elite if you will in Washington and on Wall Street seem to play by a different set of rules while everyone else has to play by another.

Yes, I know you just lost, reportedly I hear, $41 million of your salary but if I understand that correctly that's only a quarter of your pay over the last decade or so and so you will forgive all of us if we don't really feel that sorry.

Second point I'd like to make is that under Dodd-Frank, Wells Fargo remains fully eligible for taxpayered (ph) bailout going forward under Title II of the law should you run into trouble going forward. Taxpayers have already spent a lot of money bailing out poorly run Wall Street firms over the last decade.

Mr. Stumpf, I hope you're aware that anger now directed at you by my constituents and others around the country isn't just over the actions of the employees, it's a fact that they seem forever on the hook to underwrite whatever kind of risky, or in this case, fraudulent activities Wells or other large banks engage in.

Fortunately, earlier this month, I'll just make a side note, we passed a bill out of this committee, the Choice Act which will ensure that if Wells Fargo does run into trouble again, it's only its shareholders and its management that would pay the consequences and the taxpayers will no longer be on the hook.

Third and final point I'll make, I know they are not here, but once again, the financial regulators apparently were -- more than apparently completely asleep at the wheel as this massive fraud was occurring.

If you look at one of those, the CFPB, the CFPB has one job. CFPB has only one job in a regulatory framework and they completely blew it. It took a reporter from the L.A. Times to uncover what was going on at Wells Fargo and so I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will keep that in mind as they may pat the CFPB on the back for a job well done.

So, in the time remaining, to get to the security point -- questions, the Securities Exchange Act require a company to keep a disclosure in place that's under socks (ph) require the CEO and the CFO to -- to attest to financial statements.

You referred to some of that. Are you saying that all those quarterly reports that you were following, that the information you had in 11 and 12 and 13 and 14, none of that material was -- none of that information was material?

STUMPF: At the time, through the facts and circumstances, we filed accurate reports and we did not believe it was material.

GARRETT: And when you got the PricewaterhouseCoopers analysis, when was that by the way?

STUMPF: That was late in 2015 -- early  16.

GARRETT: And was -- as soon as you had that, has that been filed as a material statement?

STUMPF: We consider the facts and circumstances and we believe that not to be material.

GARRETT: It's not material? Why not?

STUMPF: Remember -- or at least this -- the PWC material looked at 93 million accounts that we opened over four years. They could not rule out through a large data analytics about 1 1/2 percent of those accounts. That's still a lot because of the size of the organization.

GARRETT: Well, that -- that, to me, Mr. Chairman, if that's not material, this occurring over a five-year period of time, a systemic problem in the organization, I don't know what is.

I yield back.

HENSARLING: Time of the gentleman has expired. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. Sherman.

Rep. Brad SHERMAN (D., Calif.): Mr. Chairman, the American people need an assurance that this cross-selling mania that has afflicted Wells Fargo is not to be found at the other Behemoth banks. And I would urge you to have hearings where we hear from the CEOs of B of A, Citi, of the others.

And until then, I hope that you would join with me in a letter of inquiry to ask what account -- new account opening quotas they had for their bank tellers, how many people they fired for not meeting their quotas, or how many people they fired for opening phony accounts.

We have Wells Fargo before me but I don't think, Mr. Stumpf, that you should be alone in this joyous experience. Your colleagues should at least come forward with some assurance.

We're now engaged in an important national ritual where the CEO comes before the representatives of the American people to apologize, to take full responsibility, to do so humbly. Mr. Stumpf, welcome to Washington. What plane did you fly in on? What airline?

STUMPF: Virgin American.

SHERMAN: And when you came to the Senate?

STUMPF: I think it was United but it was one of the two.

SHERMAN: It shows Wall Street's learned something. Thank you.

STUMPF: Thank you.

SHERMAN: Now, you've -- you've got these forced arbitration clauses in your agreement with your customers. You've said "Oh, they can have mediation too." Some of them want their day in court.

Are they going to hold them to these forced arbitration clauses and screw them again out of their day in court, or are you willing to waive those clauses and say if you're caught up in this you get your choice whether you have arbitration or not?

STUMPF: Thank you, Mr. Congressman.

I believe in arbitration. I think it's a fair way to...

(CROSSTALK)

SHERMAN: But your customers may want something else. Are you going to -- are you going to deprive them of that?

STUMPF: No, we're not. You're going to have them -- we're going to pay for a mediator and...

(CROSSTALK)

SHERMAN: Would they want their day in court are you going to screw them out of that?

STUMPF: This is not -- we're -- we're taking this very seriously. I told our...

(CROSSTALK)

SHERMAN: Will you let them to go to court if they want to go to court, yes or no?

STUMPF: No but with an explanation...

(CROSSTALK)

SHERMAN: No, but -- OK thank you.

That's a no. This sham was not an attempt to steal a few million dollars in fees from your customers, although that's important. Because you could say that few million dollars wasn't material.

What was material is the price of your stock. You opened 2 million phony accounts and then went and told -- and had to be material because you were bragging about it to the people investing in your stock that you had higher penetration rates, more accounts per customer, that the number of banking customers that had credit cards had grown from the mid 20 percent up to 42 percent.

So it had to be material, you were -- you were talking about it. The peak firings, according to your own documents, was in 2013. So you knew you had a problem then.

STUMPF: Correct.

SHERMAN: Why didn't you tell shareholders, our penetration rates are phony, our new accounts are phony accounts and when we tell you we're deepening our relationship with the customers we're putting them through the ringer?

What internal audit system did you have that assured you that you didn't have a material problem?

STUMPF: Congressman, I have -- I have to push back here. The -- this is the behavior of people that we found that we did not want. And the vast majority of everything we do is right by our team members and customers...

(CROSSTALK)

SHERMAN: Mr. Stumpf, you were -- you -- you were firing according to your own documents, the highest number of people in 2013 but bragging about your penetration rates, the number of accounts opening in 2014.

So you knew it was material to shareholders and you knew it was a phony number that you'd fired people from -- for falsifying.

STUMPF: Congressman, may I just have a second? Because we've gone back and looked. The 2 million accounts could not be ruled out. We don't know if those are good accounts or not good accounts because we already looked at 20,000 credit cards...

(CROSSTALK)

SHERMAN: Reclaiming my time, sir. You fired 5,300 people. You took 5,300 good Americans and turned them into felons with a system that you created, benefited from and drove your stock price up by bragging about your levels of new accounts.

STUMPF: Congressman, I...

(CROSSTALK)

SHERMAN: We know that the...

(CROSSTALK) STUMPF: ...have to disagree with that.

SHERMAN: I -- I'm not surprised. The two -- we have institutions that are too big to fail. In 2008, we found that they were too big not to bail. The -- Eric Holder has told us they are too big to jail saying he fears for putting them -- for bringing a criminal indictment.

We now learn they're too big to manage, too big to regulate. It's time to break them up.

HENSARLING: Time of the gentleman has expired.

The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Luetkemeyer, chairman of our Housing and Insurance Subcommittee.

Rep. Blaine LUETKEMEYER (R., Mo.): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Today, we're here to confront, in my judgment, a total travesty in the financial market. The consumers in this case were failed on all accounts. Their financial institution, with whom they trusted their family's finances, failed them.

The federal regulators who were charged with overseeing their protection failed them. The federal regulators in charge of Wells Fargo failed to stop the ripping off of consumers and the consumers lost.

And slapping a bank with a fine isn't going to make that go away. Only five percent of that fine is going to go back to consumers who were harmed. Mr. Stumpf, giving back your bonus isn't going to make that go away.

More rules and regulations are going to make this go away. The fact is, regulators sat in that bank for years and did nothing. Meanwhile, thousand employees were being fired for these bad practices, yet nothing was changed to address the issues.

The regulators need to be doing their job as well from day one. Instead, the institution pushed forward the whatever it takes approach to meet sales targets and regulators sat idly by even either oblivious or uncaring these bad practices, even after reported in the news.

To top it off, regulators neglected to fill their enforcement obligations after the fact. Instead, they opted for a quick settlement and waived their right to pursue additional action for other violations so they wouldn't be views as late to the game.

Wall Street needs to be held accountable but so does Washington. That's what we're here today, for. So my question to you Mr. Stumpf first is how many regulators do you have in your bank on a daily basis?

STUMPF: I don't have precise account...

(CROSSTALK) STUMPF: I think there's -- maybe the OCC our prudential (ph) regulator picked 80, for example.

LUETKEMEYER: OK the CFPB, they have some folks in their pre- regulator as well, do they not?

STUMPF: I -- I don't know the number on that.

LUETKEMEYER: OK just kind of curious you know, as a former bank regulator as well as a banker, this is a really, really disappointing situation for me.

STUMPF: I couldn't agree more...

(CROSSTALK)

LUETKEMEYER: From the standpoint that I tell people I'm shocked and dismayed. I'm dismayed that the bank allow this to happen because you did have a culture in place that allowed this to happen.

And I'm shocked that regulators sat on their thumbs this long and did nothing. And while you're being fined, which I think is appropriate, the regulators ought to be fined as well. For them to take the fine and keep it is a travesty.

They need to be fined as well and let that money go back to consumers because they were asleep at the switch, as well. There's so much to blame to go around on this, it's unbelievable.

A while ago, you made the comment that there was -- that you have a good culture in your -- in your institution. That this shouldn't be happening. Well, Mr. -- Mr. Stumpf, your own testimony says that you're firing a thousand people a year.

A thousand people a year, the only one way that that can happen and that there's a culture there that allows it to happen year, after year, after year. There's a laissez-fair approach to what you're doing in your bank.

Somewhere along the line, somebody's -- call a time out and say enough is enough. This can't continue. And yet, year after year you're firing people, trying to hope this thing goes away and that regulators are watching it and still sitting on their thumbs.

These actions much have consequences and for not only you, but they need to have consequences for the regulators, as well.

STUMPF: Thank you for that question because I -- I wanna tell you that we did do things. In 2011, within the business, they moved the -- the -- compliance or -- or the concern for this issue into a compliance area.

By 2012, they were reducing goals and doing more ethics training. By 2013, corporate resources were brought in. And we -- and we worked with the OCC. In 2014, more reductions in goals.

In 2015 and the OCC also was in 2013 we get (ph) our study. This does not represent the culture. In fact, we do an outside company...

(CROSSTALK)

LUETKEMEYER: I respectfully disagree with you, Mr. Stumpf. I -- I've been in business like this all my life. You can't tell me that when you have to fire people year after year after year after year after year, that there isn't a problem.

You know, for a year or two that's one thing. But four or five years? Listen, your own testimony says this. I have another question, I need to go one, one -- one more -- I got to -- in my examining days, there was a -- I examined a bank and found a teller skimming money out of her -- out of her cash drawer.

Took it to the president and he said well, you know she's a good employee, as long as she keeps it to a minimum I think we're going to be OK. My floor -- my -- my jaw hit the floor. That -- this reminds me of that situation.

As long as they can keep it to a minimum I think we're going to be OK. My comment back then (ph) with that point was, have you reported this to your blanket bond insurance company that has a dishonesty clause on it? Do you have a blanket bond or are you self insured?

STUMPF: We have a -- we have a Fidelity bond and that's where we draw a very bright line. When people do the wrong thing, they cannot be...

(CROSSTALK)

LUETKEMEYER: ...when did you report this action of your employees to your blanket bond company?

STUMPF: I don't -- I don't -- do we have a group that does that, our corporate relations with our legal team and I can assure that and we can have our people get...

(CROSSTALK)

STUMPF: ...very bright line.

LUETKEMEYER: This -- this is a really, really big question because if you didn't report that immediately when you found this going on and you allowed for year after year to have a thousand people...

STUMPF: We do that.

LUETKEMEYER: Your blanket man -- bond company is going to be going bonkers over this. We will have a request for that and I hope you will answer that...

(CROSSTALK)

STUMPF: We'll work with your team.

LUETKEMEYER: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

HENSARLING: Time of the gentleman has expired.

The chair now recognizes the gentleman from New York Mr. Meeks.

Rep. Gregory MEEKS (D., N.Y.): I can't believe some of what I'm hearing, here. So let me -- let me understand, you've been the CEO since 2007. You've been the chair of the board and the CEO since 2010, is that correct?

STUMPF: That is correct, Congressman.

MEEKS: And in the time that you have been that chair, I have a chart here that shows you've been penalized almost systematically every year since you have been in charge. Every year, $1.2 billion in April of  16, $53 million in October of  15, $4 million in June of  15.

MEEKS: Another $24 million in January  15, $5 million in September of  14 I mean -- and I can go on and on, $869 million in September  13 while you were the CEO, right? And you're going to tell me that there's not a culture of something wrong at Wells Fargo when you are the head -- you get credit. You get credit as CEO when you bring in all this money because that's how you get your bonuses, is that not correct?

You get a bonus from your board because X amount of dollars come in. But yet, are you telling me that you don't have the responsibility of losing your position when you have a culture of being fined and costing the bank year after year, month after month, there's no responsibility.

You can just stay to be the chairman and the CEO? Is that what you want us to believe?

STUMPF: Congressman, that is not the case. I serve at the pleasure of the board. I'm willing -- I told you...

MEEKS: Then the whole board needs to go if they're going to allow someone to be in charge when time after time -- you just talked about you fired 5,300 employees when you found out that they were doing something wrong. They were fired because they were doing something wrong. Well something is going wrong at this bank and you are the head of it so shouldn't the board then turn -- from your own admission.

If the buck stops with you, as you came out here and said, I apologize, the buck stops with me, and you have to also admit that criminal activity was going on in your bank then you should be fired because it stops with you.

STUMPF: Again, congressman, the board has that power. That's their -- and my energy right now is to lead this company forward. I also want to remind...

MEEKS: So you came here and you started out by saying, I apologize, et cetera. If somebody walked into Wells Fargo tomorrow and robbed your bank or defrauded your bank and then after they're caught they said, well, I'm sorry. I'm going to take full responsibility for robbing this bank and I am sorry that I robbed this bank. So please, don't prosecute me because I am sorry now that I robbed this bank.

Would you allow the person just to walk out after robbing your bank because he is now sorry that he robbed this bank after he took the money already?

STUMPF: Congressman, I see something very different between being honest and breaking our code of ethics and taking advantage of...

MEEKS: You didn't break code of ethics?

STUMPF: And -- I...

MEEKS: Does your bank -- do you realize that you have not only given -- would you admit this? That not only did your bank have a black eye that your bank, Wells Fargo, has given the entire financial service industry a black eye. Your responsibility. You heard Mr. Sherman, now he wants -- and I agree with him. He wants everybody to come in here.

Why? There's only one reason why. Your bank, you, CEO, chairman -- basically for me, was on top of what basically has been a criminal enterprise.

Because when I look at consistency, time after time after time and time again, you have to get fines. Now, it must mean that you're making a lot of money because it's easier to pay the fine because you know that nothing else is going to happen to you. So, you pay the fine, you get away, you make a lot of money. Now, I'm upset. I'm from New York. I -- a lot of times, you know, I believe in financial institutions.

That's why I'm so mad. I believe that they make our country better until they rip us off and they ripped us off tremendously, taking advantages of customers and consumers when we had the financial crisis.

I've got individuals right now who are on the street -- on the street, they're not back in their homes. They had these fraudulent mortgages. Nobody has said, I'm sorry that we gave you these fraudulent mortgages. We're going to put you back in your home and we're going to make sure that everything is OK. No one has done that for them. You haven't volunteered to do that.

Will Wells Fargo put people back in their homes?

STUMPF: Congressman, if I could just respond for a second, please. There's no question we don't do everything right and we've made mistakes. We're upping our game...

MEEKS: So who should pay for it? If you're not doing everything right, who's accountable for it?

STUMPF: We're going to make it right for every one of our customers...

MEEKS: Your V.P. made $125 million bonus package. Your institutions making over $22 billion yearly. Who is paying for it? Who's taking responsibility for it? Don't come tell me your sorry.

STUMPF: We're -- we're taking care of every one of our customers who was impacted.

HENSARLING: Time of the gentleman has expired. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin, Mr. Duffy, chairman of the Oversight Investigations Subcommittee.

Rep. Sean DUFFY (R., Wis.): Good morning, Mr. Stumpf. I want to tell you I'm a 20 year customer of Wells Fargo. I actually started at Norwest.

STUMPF: Thank you.

DUFFY: My wife was with Wells Fargo. We got married and it made it easy to join our accounts. I've had a pretty good experience with your bank. That's why I've been there for 20 years. The people I've dealt with have treated me incredibly well and that's why I'm there. But what I'm hearing today is incredibly disturbing. And so, I just want to make sure you and I are on the same page.DUFFY: How do you classify what Wells Fargo did with this potentially 2 million account holders?

STUMPF: Well, the 2 million account holders were accounts, was about -- the PWC looked at 93 million accounts, the 2 million are -- I'm sorry.

DUFFY: Was this -- was this -- was this fraud? Was this just a H.R. problem, was this theft, how do you see this?

STUMPF: The 2 million accounts could not be ruled out...

DUFFY: I'm not asking about accounts. I'm asking about -- well, how do you classify when you took $22 to $25, from whatever the number is, maybe it's one million, maybe it's 2 million, how do you classify that?

STUMPF: Well, I think it was dishonest; it broke our code of ethics and the people who are responsible...

DUFFY: Was it theft?

STUMPF: Pardon me?

DUFFY: Was it theft? Did you steal?

STUMPF: Our people did not do what was right.

DUFFY: That's not my question. Did you steal? I want to know if you and I are on the same page. Did Wells Fargo employees steal from a million to 2 million other customers, yes or no?

STUMPF: In some cases they did.

DUFFY: They did.

STUMPF: Yes.

DUFFY: And so as Wells Fargo, back to 2011 is stealing from their customers and by the way, banking is based on trust...

STUMPF: Correct.

DUFFY: Right? So I don't care if it's 10 percent or 1 percent or half a percent of the people that you do business with, if you're stealing from them -- in 2011, 1,000 people are fired for stealing, and what do you do? You don't fix the problem. And 1,000 people are fired in 2012 and you don't fix the problem. And in 2013, 1,200 people are fired and we still have a problem. And you're stealing from people.

So how do you -- how is it -- I guarantee you that any bank in my community, if they were stealing from someone at the lower level, fired and fixed the problem on day one.

STUMPF: Well that's what we're trying to do, in fact...

DUFFY: No. Trying to do, we're five years on.

STUMPF: Well let me just say as we about -- as we understood this problem, we didn't -- when somebody would open an unauthorized account, a savings account or checking account, it was not until -- and when an account gets opened and not funded, it's really important, please. When they open and not funded, it gets auto closed. We didn't -- we didn't believe, as we looked at that, until sometime in 2015 that there could be the possibility of a zero account that could affect a customer.

DUFFY: You got to be kidding me. You have got to be kidding me.

STUMPF: No, that is absolutely our analysis.

(CROSSTALK)

DUFFY: ...the Board members. You are not saying that knew, but Board members knew in 2011. They were looking at this and if they are looking at a thousand people fired, that they don't know why they're being fired, that they don't look in to say, what were these people doing that caused them to be canned? And they look -- just pull the curtain back a little bit and they go, man, whether you want to call it defrauding our customers or stealing from our customers, Wells Fargo has a big problem.

So that you tell me it took one year, 2 years, three years to 2015, I don't buy it. What I think is Wells Fargo was making a lot of money off what you were doing, and I think you were hoping that you wouldn't get caught, and so it's a risk of doing business. You know what, we're willing to fire a few people so I can come in here and go, weren't we great? We fired a couple of people, we were trying to make it right, but we kept the practice in play because we were making big profits.

Did you win the practice? Is this over?

STUMPF: And yet we're stopping all of our sales. Let me...

DUFFY: How could you stop it? How could you stop it now but not in 2011 or 2012 or 2013 or 2014 or 2015?

STUMPF: Well we should have done more earlier -- we should have done more earlier. But it's really important I make this point, please. The $2.6 million of fees that were on accounts -- that these 2 million accounts that we could not rule out, it cost us $10 million to open those accounts and close them; forget even the cost of the team member and the dismissal. This is a loser for us, it only helps when customers uses it.

DUFFY: It's a loser for you, I guarantee that.

STUMPF: It only helps when customers -- I would rather have a customer have 2 products they use, than four they don't. This is what we align with...

DUFFY: The concern we have Mr. Stumpf -- and I told you I like Wells Fargo, I've been there 20 years. That -- that you were turning a blind eye to your customers who were being stolen from, people who couldn't afford $22, people who couldn't afford $25, and that you didn't fix that problem. In an institution that's based on trust with your customer, that you didn't take this seriously, that you didn't remedy it, that it's taken this long, shame on Wells Fargo.

And I didn't get to my question, I would hopefully at one point, hear you testify to how many CFPB employees were embedded at Wells Fargo.

HENSARLING: The time of the gentleman has expired. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Capuano.

Rep. Michael CAPUANO (D., Mass.): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Thank you, Mr. Stumpf. I want to thank you, particularly, for doing something here today that no one other person has been able to do in the last four years. You have brought true bipartisanship to Congress. We're all together on this, we are not happy. Last -- they already started, but the last few minutes they have been running a graphic in the back and my colleague had went through some of them. I think it's important to know what some of the other things you have done, what they were.

They weren't just fines, you screwed student loan holders, credit unions, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, mortgage holders, African-Americans, Hispanics, health care workers, on and on and on. And by the way, I understand this isn't material, just five months ago, you paid $1.2 billion in a fine, this is only 15 percent of that. Who cares? We'll pretend to be sorry, we'll fire some workers and we'll get through this.

You know when I heard that before? The guys who ran Enron, the guys who ran Arthur Anderson, thought the same thing. We're not your problem, we can't criminally prosecute you, you can keep -- hell, you're your own boss, you are the CEO and the Chairman. Hold yourself to accountability, my God, you've been bad -- no, you haven't. That's ridiculous, your problem is coming, it's not today. You think today's tough, it's coming. When the prosecutors get a hold of you, you're going to have a lot of fun.

So I want to thank you for that. I want to ask you, you got the graphic up here. You know this guy? See, I'm not a real good researcher, I'm not a prosecutor. This is simple internet research, that's all I'm capable of doing, Google it -- Wells Fargo, boom. Whole bunch of stuff shows up. This is Mr. Robert Holmes who apparently robbed your bank in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. He did not use a weapon. He got caught; they got all the money back. He's in jail as we speak on a $750,000 bail.

You on the other hand have run an enterprise that has a culture of corruption. You encourage subordinates to abuse existing customers by opening fake bank accounts. You charge those victims illegal fees, interest and late charges and then you send some to collection agencies because they didn't pay them. Then, you fired 5,300 workers, as if you care, to cover everybody's tracks.

In my opinion, you and your entire leadership team are clearly and unequivocally guilty of at least conspiracy to commit fraud, conspiracy to commit identity theft, clearly racketeering which is something a lot of my friends know something about, and probably a dozen other crimes.

Only simple question, what the heck's the difference between you and Mr. Holmes? Why shouldn't you be in jail? He didn't use a gun, you got the money back, I understand at his arraignment he said he was sorry. What's the difference? Why shouldn't you be in jail right along with Mr. Holmes?

STUMPF: Congressman, I think that when you do something unethical or dishonest, which I've tried to exercise my duties as leader and our senior leadership team...

CAPUANO: You haven't done a real good job, you have had 16 violations in five years. That's a good job, this is a minor fine, you've had a lot of -- this is only the seventh largest fine that you've had, you've had six others that are a lot bigger. That's a good job? I guess I forgot, you're the one judging yourself because you are also Chairman of the Board.

I actually think I'm the greatest Congressman in the history of the world, I should be Speaker, President and maybe Emperor of the world, that's my judgment of myself. Sound good to you?

STUMPF: There is no question that we had done things that we need to improve on and we've paid fines and we're trying to get better at every one of our...

CAPUANO: So if Mr. Holmes pays a little fine, you know, a few bucks based on the amount of money he stole and the victims he had, you think he should be let out and have no criminal record?

STUMPF: Again, being dishonest and breaking the law is something very...

CAPUANO: So it's not breaking the law, stealing my identity and opening an account that I didn't ask for?STUMPF: And our culture is about not doing that. We train for that not to happen.

CAPUANO: I don't know how -- what kind of a culture you have (ph) you have 16 violations...

HENSARLING: ... Time -- time of the gentleman...

CAPUANO: ... you have 5,300 employees that you say did it but you don't know (ph)...

HENSARLING: ... time -- time of the gentleman has expired. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. Royce, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.

Rep. Edward ROYCE: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Stumpf, the idea of a cross-selling target of at least eight products clearly is part of a long term practice at Wells Fargo going back at least to your predecessor because in 1998 Fortune Magazine quotes "doubling the average product purchase to eight" as your predecessor's quote "current obsession." You know, morphing the goal to a mandate here seems to be a big part of the problem and I say mandate because if people are fired for not hitting that goal, it's a mandate.

And that seems to be at the center of a toxic sales culture that you've overseen. But I'd ask you was the goal of eight cross-sold products something understood and embraced by management and by your sales force?

STUMPF: It was a rallying cry to help work together. The average consumer household has about 14 financial products...

ROYCE: ... I understand but I'm going to ask you a question. In retrospect, do you think that that target contributed in some way to the negative change in your sales culture?

STUMPF: We never had a target of eight. Again, it was an aspirational. We had team members who would work with customers on need-based selling and when they did that right, they -- the customer won and it was good for us.

ROYCE: Did you read the L.A. Times article when it came out in 2013?

STUMPF: I don't -- I'm sure I did, I just -- I can't recall it right now.

ROYCE: Was it something discussed at the board level?

STUMPF: We did discuss the L.A. article.

ROYCE: Well, here's my question. Did the information in that article give you pause about reporting cross-selling metrics or ratios in your annual reports, in your quarterly reports, in the analyst conference calls that were clearly inflated here by fake accounts generated by your sales force?

STUMPF: We love cross-sell because it helps -- helps define...

ROYCE: ... I -- look, I understand your argument about that. Here's the question. If you know fake accounts are going into that ratio, why would you keep reporting that ratio?

Because I've got a copy here of your investor day. I've got a copy of what is in your quarterlies and you know, you turn to Mr. Duffy here, when he was asking the question and you were saying "Well, it isn't that material in terms of our bottom line, in terms of the fee income from these fake accounts."

But what you're reporting on your products per household is a constant upswing quarter by quarter by quarter. It certainly is material in terms of the stock price.

What you were doing in constantly reporting these ever-increasing numbers was driving your stock price up and the point I'm making is you have this story in 2013 that shows how much of that was based upon fraudulent behavior. That becomes material, right?

STUMPF: Well, let me just talk about that specifically. The cross-sell ratio -- even if you include all 2 million accounts in that -- and we know we can't because we're already finding out in credit card that 75 percent -- or less than 25 percent either did not order or not remember.

We've looked back for all the quarters going back to -- I can't remember. It's 2010 or  11 and it has a, I think, one 200ths of one product impact. It's absolutely immaterial.

ROYCE: Look, Mr. Stumpf. This is a California company. You've got a lot of California customers. You've got people all over the world dependent upon this company. You've got your employees, and from what I understand, a thousand of them being fired a year connected to this.

I believe rebuilding that -- the trust and righting the wrongs are going to take a course of action here that I've yet to see you set and through opening unauthorized accounts or playing the shell game with a person's money, your employees and your company negatively impacted the credit of many people in this country.

And I just want you to think for a minute about what that meant in terms of their ability maybe to qualify to get that home or maybe to qualify to get that car or maybe in terms of the student loan to send that son or daughter to university.ROYCE: Not to mention, again, working Americans wrongfully terminated by your company for what? Refusing to break financial laws, refusing to break ethical laws, that's what we have to come to grips with here. And this is at the very least the result of actions over the last five years. That didn't happen by accident.

HENSARLING: The time of the Gentleman has expired. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts Mr. Lynch.

LYNCH: Thank you Mr. Chairman. I have a unanimous consent request to enter to the record a letter sent by ranking member Cummings, Gentleman from Maryland of the Oversight committee to Mr. Stumpf requesting related documents by October 13th.

HENSARLING: Without objection.

Rep. Stephen LYNCH (D., Mass.): Thank you Mr. Chairman. I would also like to ask the Chairman to consider doing a hearing at a later time with a Member of the Employees, both whistleblowers who were fired and others who were fired for retaliatory attempts to provide information on the fraudulent conduct being conducted at Wells Fargo. I'm aware of at least three U.S. attorney's that have also issued subpoenas in this case. So I'm hopeful that we may eventually get to the bottom of this.

And while the City of L.A., the city attorney there and the CFPB and OCC have done good work in this case, the fines thus far are pathetic really. Totally inadequate to try to bring Wells Fargo into compliance with the law. And that is certainly reinforced by the way Mr. Stumpf, you have diminished the offenses that have gone on at your bank.

It is really proof positive that whatever the OCBF or -- excuse me -- the OCC has done, is not adequate to make you realize the level of your offenses hear. Again the 5,300 employee were fired. Up to 2 million fraudulent accounts. And this has gone on for at least five years. And I want to point out here, and Mr. Duffy has hit on this, this is the banking industry. It exists based on trust. And what your employees did at least -- well, as many as 565,000 fraudulent credit cards were secretly opened by your employees using the social security numbers of your customers.

So they opened fake credit cards so they could charge them for that. They assigned fictitious pin numbers when the customer didn't even know that that was going on they put pin numbers and then they assigned e-mail addresses so they could comply with it and get the bonus so that the account was opened, and these are your customers.

Now we've had credit card companies up here who have sent credit cards to non-credit worthy borrowers and seniors who didn't understand what they were getting. But in this case these are your customers. These are the people that -- they became victims because they did business with your bank, that is unbelievable. And I know that Mr. Meeks and Mr. Capuano before me have made comparisons to criminal activity, but I do want to note that under the Racketeer Influence and Corruption Act, you've satisfied that.

You've satisfied all the elements of that. Two of the predicated offenses under RICO. Number one, is fraud and there's no question about that, mail fraud, securities fraud, you've done it all, you've covered basically every aspect of fraud in your bank over the last five years. And secondly, in many cases these employees -- these whistle blowers were intimidated or fired in some cases. You've got an H.R. employee here who says you had a system to retaliate in your bank against whistle blowers. And that's another predicate offense under RICO.

So let me ask you, as the CEO and Chairman of the Board you had a responsibility to file SAR -- Suspicious Activity Reports.STUMPF: Correct.

LYNCH: Right. You have up to 2 million separate accounts being opened. Up to 565,000 bogus credit cards being opened by your employees in secret, against your customers. And yet, when we asked FinCEN -- we asked the Treasury Department for the suspicious activity reports that you filed, they don't match up you know in compliance.

STUMPF: Well, let me just say a couple of things. We filed -- we did everything that was necessary to abide by every regulator and regulation issue...

LYNCH: Are you saying you -- you filed a sector report on...

STUMPF: I can't say on that because that's...

LYNCH: Well, it's your responsibility. Let me read you the law...

STUMPF: I know...

(CROSSTALK)

LYNCH: I'll close with this.

STUMPF: It's a response (ph) but I -- that there's actually a -- a -- a -- prohibition I mean I have -- I have to do what's right according to the law.

(CROSSTALK)

LYNCH: This is my time, I'm claiming it back. The board of directors, this is out of the Bank Secrecy Act in anti-money laundering stature. The board of directors acting through senior management is ultimately responsible for ensuring that the bank maintains an effective bank (inaudible) act, AML, internal control structure including suspicious activity reporting and monitoring.

STUMPF: And we do that.

LYNCH: It's your responsibility...

STUMPF: And we do that.

HENSARLING: The time of the gentleman -- the time of the gentleman has expired. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma, Mr. Lucas.

Rep. Frank LUCAS (R., Okla.): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Stumpf, while my day job is that of a Congressman, I am a farmer by trade. And my university degree is in agricultural economics and looking at your resume, about the time you were entering into the banking industry 30 some years ago, I can remember taking a class on money and banking at Oklahoma State.

And we had a professor who was very enthusiastic about the market economy and we discussed how the banking model we use now went back essentially 500 years to Italy. And the concept that under a market economy, bankers were the individuals who determined what savings were worth can pull those (ph).

And by the same token, made risk determinations, figured out what the cost of money should be and allocated that out through loans. A glowing example. And he would compare Western Europe at the time, North America -- much of the rest of the world, how effective that was compared to the demand economy model of the old communist countries at the time, China, Russia, all of those sort of places.

A very glowing discussion. I don't know that I have a particular question for you about what's going on. I think between the other committee and my colleagues here, they've done an exceptional job with getting to the facts.

And I suspect as a number of my colleagues have discussed quite straightforwardly, this has legal implications far and beyond the activities of this -- of this committee or the other committee in the other body.

But I'd say, Mr. Chairman, the most challenging thing you've done is, by the actions of your company -- by your management of the company, you made it hard for those of us who are defenders of the market economy to continue to maintain the system that has helped drive this -- this successful enterprise called the United States of America and the free market system.

That's probably the most tragic thing about this. Now, in those econ classes used to lecture us about the concepts of enlightened self interest. That's the nature of any consumer, that's the nature of any business person.

But then there are the responsibilities that we used to talk about of good corporate citizenship, about self-restraint, about not pursuing greed. I guess I just simply note to you sir, whatever ultimately legally comes out of this process, and clearly, a number of my colleagues thinks something will or whatever your stock holders determine or your fellow board members, you've just made it really hard.

Really hard for those of us who want to maintain that concept of a market economy who want to continue to make sure that bankers -- not some bureaucrat somewhere -- are the arbitragers of capital to effectively make this country move forward.

I don't know how you correct this. But I suspect sir, when you interact with your peers within the industry, you're going to have some challenges for a long time to come, because the brush with which you will be painted will stroke all of them, too.

And I suspect that's blatantly unfair and it's unfortunate. But then you know, I'm just a farmer by trade. Multi-generation bidder, working hard to service my debts every -- every year. You have to think about that. You have to think about that.

What this episode has done to your industry and ultimately to me and all of my fellow consumers out there. It's just very unfortunate.

STUMPF: May I make a comment?

LUCAS: Please.

STUMPF: Thank you and I -- we take this very seriously and I also come from a farm. I understand what its like to be on a small farm, or at least ours was small with a large family. I know right from wrong.

I know we have a lot of wrongs to right here. But I also wanted to tell you that Wells Fargo is a great corporate citizen. We employ 268,000 wonderful team members across the country. We have a -- a culture based on ethics and do what's right. Not everyone does that.

We've made mistakes, we're one of the nation's largest tax payers, we're one of the largest philanthropic organizations, we're involved in our communities and we have a lot of work to do. There's no question about that.

But I stand with our -- the people who are doing the right thing, who honor our culture and our ethics. They are terrific people and they're out there with our customer's everyday and we have work to do, I understand that.

LUCAS: This disservice has been under them.

With that, Mr. Chairman I yield back.

HENSARLING: The time of the gentleman has expired.

The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Scott.

Rep. David SCOTT (D., Ga.): Yes Mr. Stumpf, this is one of the most outrageous acts that any banking executive has done in my lifetime that I know of. How in the world could you in good conscious set up these fraudulent accounts?

What was going through your mind when you were doing this?

STUMPF: Congressman, I didn't set up any of these accounts. I -- our team, worked together at the business level then at the corporate level to finding... (CROSSTALK)

SCOTT: Wait a minute, Mr. Stumpf...

(CROSSTALK)

STUMPF: ...we found these accounts and we found these people and we said that behavior is not possible.

SCOTT: Mr. Stumpf, you took advantage of unsuspecting, loyal customers. People in almost every single district is represented on this financial services committee. You did that and you are the chief executive officer, you set the tone and you should be downright ashamed of yourself.

And you should apologize right now. If you have any strain of respect for the people of the United States, for the customers that you have defrauded with this, for the rancid example that you're setting and not only that. For the damage that you yourself with your action is being done to the entire banking industry.

Because you know what? All this cross selling now you have caused an extraordinary spotlight to be focused on every bank in this country. You have done that.

STUMPF: Congressman...

SCOTT: And you should apologize.

STUMPF: Congressman, I have said in my opening testimony, I am sorry. I am accountable for this. I'm very sorry that we broke trust with our customers, our communities, the American people.

I am deeply sorry for that and do everything that I can to repair that.

SCOTT: And you know what hurts me so much? I'm one of your customers. I have an account in Wells Fargo in the bank, in Atlanta, Georgia. I was on the phone with my district director about this.

And she has told me that -- and our constituent services, when it comes to the mortgages systems particularly with the bill that we pass here, the Hardest Hit Bill in which we're offering and helping those people with mortgages to be able to pay up to 24 months of free mortgages.

And she says, we have no better cooperation from the staff of banks than we have from Wells Fargo.

STUMPF: Thank you.

SCOTT: I'm your customer and (inaudible).

STUMPF: Thank you.

SCOTT: But the example that you set -- is just absolutely terrible. Now, what I wanna ask you is -- because my number one concern is my constituents in Georgia. Lemme ask you, could you tell us exactly how many customers of yours in my home state of Georgia, had fraudulent accounts set up in their name without their consent? How many in Georgia?STUMPF: I can get that for you if I have the right -- sorry, I know I'm using up your time here.

SCOTT: Well, maybe the Chairman will give me a little extra here but it's important for us to know. How many...

STUMPF: In Georgia...

SCOTT: Yes sir?

STUMPF: We had 55,579 accounts that -- that we could not rule out as possible. Again, now I just...

SCOTT: Fifty five thousand?

STUMPF: I -- I need to -- if you may let me -- we're finding out that on the credit card side, less than 25 percent did not want those but here's my commitment to you, Congressman. We're going to work with every one of these accounts and make it right for every customer. That is our commitment. I'm interested in results, not in process here. Each account we're going to take care of it and I don't care whether there was, you know, I mean -- and the biggest thing here is secondary harm.

I want to make sure that -- I think it was asked by another Congressman or woman about that issue. We take this very seriously.

SCOTT: My time is scratching down. Here's the fundamental question I want to ask you. Do you think what you did was criminal?

STUMPF: I'm not a criminal...

SCOTT: No, but do you think -- do you think that?

STUMPF: I led the company with -- with courage and -- and with...

SCOTT: If another bank president had done this or chief executive officer, would not you say it's criminal?

STUMPF: I didn't break our code of ethics and I didn't do anything dishonest.

SCOTT: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

HENSARLING: Time of the gentleman has expired. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico, Mr. Pearce.

Rep. Stevan PEARCE (R., N.M.): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Thank you sir, appreciate you being here. I suspect it's not all fun. The -- so, you've talked about the 5,300 that were terminated. Is -- how big a percent of the people in the company that were terminated -- surely out of 268,000 people, you'd get more than 5,300.

So what percent of the terminations did that actually represent?

STUMPF: You know, I don't have that. I can work with our team and see but it's...

PEARCE: Don't worry about it. That's OK.

STUMPF: I don't have that.

PEARCE: So -- so, just looking at this from the 30,000 viewpoint and keep in mind I'm like Mr. Lucas. Grew up on a small five acre farm. Dad was a sharecropper before he went to work as a roustabout. We have a blue collar company just working there in oil fields of Southeast New Mexico so all the numbers that get thrown around here are a little bit big but I can't fathom, somewhere in the process that you got 5,300 people terminated and that doesn't come to your attention as a CEO.

You get calls on the ethics line saying, hey, we're doing unethical stuff. 2008, according to one of the other people. According to your comments, people inside your company are breaking the law. They're creating criminal acts and that doesn't come to your attention. You get $10.8 billion in settlements and that doesn't come to your attention. So what is -- I mean, if I'm sitting here thinking about this stuff just coming in a clear -- just quiet room, bored. Seeing these things at some point, somebody's going to say, Houston, we've got a problem.

But it doesn't appear that anybody ever said, Houston, we've got a problem. L.A. city attorney brings charges and nobody on the board says, Houston, we've got a problem. What in your assessment looking back, what was it that would cause all those things to go under the radar and not be recognized, not be seen.

STUMPF: Thank you for that question. As -- as we learned more about this issue, we made investments. We made investments in training, we reduced sales goals, we brought in a regulator, we tried...

PEARCE: I understand. You've already -- you've been through that. What kept you from seeing -- what kept this from rising to the -- I'm sure that today that you probably consider the problem somewhat different than you did in 2011,  12,  13,  14,  15.

Why did not you see the importance that you would attribute to it today at any stage of the process?

STUMPF: Congressman, it's a good question. I've said in my testimony, I've said...

PEARCE: I read your testimony, I did not see the answer, what. So, since you appear not to want to see it, I'm sitting here on a balanced scale as a business manager is always there.

Do we want to take that job cleaning out that well, and when we can't clean it out, we get a bad reputation? Well, that's worth a lot -- maybe we will. Or maybe we won't. Are we going to overlook the numbers of terminations?

We're getting the calls. Do we really want to investigate? The stock price is doing OK. My compensation is OK. You get the balance is there. Your compensation in that period of time is approximately $200 million. That would cause one to say, "I think things are running OK/ yeah, maybe we got that little problem over there."

But another thing on the side of the scale that says, I don't want to look at this or I can't see $10 billion in settlements -- that -- it just doesn't come to my attention; 5,300 terminations doesn't come to my attention because my -- we've got 260,000 employees. Obviously we're doing things 99 percent right. Forget the 2 million people that we defrauded. Mostly we're doing OK.

And so I see size and complexity being a great problem when you can't see 5,300 being terminated; when you can't see $10.8 billion in settlements, then you've got a problem in size and complexity.

And I would say there is no community banker in this country that would not have seen people doing illegal acts. And so maybe it was your stock compensation; maybe it was size and complexity. But sir, I think today listening to things that everyone has said, you have proved that you did not offer leadership in this.

You have kind of shirked around and said the board can do anything it wants at any time. I, sir, think you ought to submit a resignation and your board cannot hold off action on that.

Thank you. I yield back.

STUMPF: Mr. Chairman, may I just make a comment about that?

HENSARLING: Witness may comment.

STUMPF: We -- we did take accountability. We did invest in things to help reduce this. And -- and we saw the numbers coming down. PEARCE: The problems continued, sir. The problems continue right on through your actions. In 2011, you did this; 2013, you did that, and the problems continued.

HENSARLING: The time -- the time of the gentleman has expired.

The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, ranking member of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee.

Rep. Al GREEN (D., Texas): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

I thank the ranking member as well.

I'm grateful that you have given us a very positive response, and we are holding this hearing.

Mr. Chairman, with $5.6 billion in earnings in the second quarter, Wells Fargo is not in this because of need. This is about greed. It's about the same kind of greed that created credit default swaps; that created negative amortization; that created no-doc loans; that created prepayment penalties that coincided with teaser rates.

The same kind of greed called exotic products that created the housing bubble. This greed has caused this cross-selling to become the equivalent of an exotic product, a product that has now created a cross-selling bubble for Wells Fargo. The cross-selling bubble exists because you were marketing yourself as a company in a growth mode by virtue of the new products you were having with your customers. You had customers that were coming in and you were growing.

This enticed investors. It enticed consumers to buy your stocks. When your stocks were bought, it benefited you and top-level executives to the detriment of lower-level entry employees. They get fired; top-level executives get golden parachutes, and it's business as usual. Well, Mr. Chairman, this will not end by simply having some lower-level employees go to jail. If top-level executives go free and lower-level employees go to jail, it doesn't end it because there is no reason for this to cease and for top-level employees to be more mindful of what's going on.

So we've reached a point now where the public expects to see more than lower-level people punished; 5,300 -- 5,300 working people who, by what I seem to read, were encouraged to the point of having themselves coerced to engage in this activity. These were people who were trying to make a living, not trying to make a big bonus and a big payday. These people deserve a fair day, not just an exit from your company.

And what do I mean by a fair day? I think they deserve an opportunity to be heard in terms of what happened at Wells Fargo to cause them to do what they've done. I think that they ought to be given an opportunity to come before Congress. They ought to be able to explain.

And I would also add this. We have to find out how pervasive this bubble is. We have to. We do have to bring before the Investigations Committee, Oversight and Investigations, other CEOs, top-level executives and let them tell us.

And I think we have to start with you. So tell me, please sir, how commonplace is this cross-selling in the banking industry?

STUMPF: Thank you, Congressman.

For our company, cross-sell is a good thing because it represents the depths of...

(CROSSTALK)

GREEN: If you would, I'm going to have to intercede. I have to intercede because I'm asking you about the industry now.

STUMPF: I have no idea what...

GREEN: You have no idea of how pervasive the product is?

STUMPF: I don't know what other companies use.

GREEN: Well, are they using cross-sell? You -- are you saying you have no belief or no idea that other companies are cross-selling?

STUMPF: I do not have that.

GREEN: I must tell you, I cannot believe your answer. You're telling me that you have no idea that -- as to whether or not they even engage in cross-selling?

STUMPF: I -- I don't know their -- their performance standards.

GREEN: But do you know they engage in it?

STUMPF: I -- I -- every bank -- every retailer out there has some motivation, some way to make sure they recognize their people.

GREEN: Do they engage in cross-selling?

STUMPF: Well, I don't know -- I don't know their situations. I'm honest...

GREEN: You -- you don't talk to your colleagues? You don't talk to other bankers? You have no idea as to whether they engage in cross-selling?

STUMPF: I don't know what they use.

GREEN: Well, listen, I thank you for your answer. Let me finish, because, Mr. Chairman, this is the evidence that we need to bring the others in. We have to ask them what they're doing, given that this gentleman refuses to give us what I believe to be a correct answer.

HENSARLING: The time -- time of the gentleman has expired.

The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Posey.

Rep. Bill POSEY (R., Fla.): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Stumpf, members of this committee have already expressed outrage that we all feel that this atrocity was able to happen. It's absolutely deplorable that your customers were subject to this practice. And I'm sure the fine that Wells Fargo will pay will be insufficient to comfort the customers or adequately compensate them.

At best, at the very best, you and our federal regulators were asleep at the switch. You know, at worst, it's almost, if not a criminal enterprise. My biggest concern -- and I think it's the biggest concern of every member on both sides of the aisle here, is that we need to ensure that it doesn't ever happen again. That means we have a shared interest in understanding what caused and what perpetrated the unprecedented level of fraud. And I have just a couple of questions that I think will help drive us in that direction to understand it.

First, Mr. Stumpf, I understand Wells Fargo sets goals for new banking products each employee was expected to sell daily. Is that correct?

STUMPF: I -- I don't believe that's the case. I know as part of our reward system and our performance management that products was part of their -- their performance management, along with customer service, customer loyalty, doing things right. But again, as of this Friday we're getting rid of those goals.

POSEY: OK. I've read a range of reports that puts these sales goals somewhere between eight to five new sales each day, compared to the reported industry standard of three to five per day.

Briefly, I was going to ask you if you could give us an idea of how the goals were determined.

STUMPF: Determined with -- within our business? I wasn't part of that process and I don't know if that's an -- I don't, you made a reference to industry standard and what ours is. I -- I wouldn't have specifics. I can try to get back to you on that.

POSEY: Are you aware that the expected targets vary between bank branches of different size, location, or constituencies?

STUMPF: I believe that is the case, yes.

POSEY: You think they did?

STUMPF: I -- I -- I believe that was -- I don't know when that was introduced but I believe in the past, you know, locations that would have more activity, we'd either have more bankers or more goals.

POSEY: Thank -- thank -- thank you for the straight answer. As a follow up, did the bonuses associated with those goals vary between those branches, or did Wells Fargo use a single uniform system?

STUMPF: Again, that's a level of detail I don't know. I can try to get back to you on that.

POSEY: OK. Now, so far in the investigation of bad actors, you've -- have you found any correlation between the likelihood of employees committing fraud and the demographic or socioeconomic characteristics of the people being served?

STUMPF: Yeah, first of all, I don't know, I'm not trying to be careful on words here. I don't know what fraud exactly -- I mean I know what's right and know what's wrong, and I don't know what the intent of all these people were.

But to answer your question specifically there was no -- that I understand, racial or ethnicity difference other than what the communities are, because we try to have people in our banks that represent the communities.

POSEY: All right, so we'll take racial and ethnicity (ph) offs the table here. As someone who also represents district heavily populated by seniors I'm worried that Wells Fargo may have intentionally preyed upon those they saw as vulnerable. Do you believe seniors were purposely targeted as a result of employees stretching to meet their sales goals?

STUMPF: In fact, we've looked at -- because we actually capture date of birth that so we can tell that, and no, there was no disproportionate -- it did not -- in fact it was, younger people; not seniors. If there was any emphasis at all or any...

POSEY: OK. To be clear, I don't think sales goals are inherently evil. Anyone who's owned a business understands the need to incentivize employees to succeed and reward their successes.

Unfortunately your company forgot the most important part of any business, more important than sky-high stock prices, year-end bonuses, or fat retirements. It's the people that you serve.

I'm increasingly concerned that this misguided idea of success that puts actual customers in a category of least concern is perpetrated more than just Wells Fargo by the way. To the best of your knowledge, was this practice of creating fake accounts exclusive to Wells Fargo?

STUMPF: You know, again I don't know and I only know that, what I know about our company -- but I'd also like to make, if I just -- in your few seconds left, the investment -- reason people buy Wells Fargo -- invest in us, is a whole lot more, it's about our broad product model. It's about our -- our -- distribution in the United States --

POSEY: One quick question --

(CROSSTALK)

POSEY: Can you tell me any action the CFPB has taken that would stop something like this from happening again?

HENSARLING (?): Brief answer from the witness.

STUMPF: We worked with the CFPB. We made an agreement and we're going to continue to work with them on this issue.

POSEY: But any action that they've taken that would stop it from happening again?

HENSARLING: Time -- time of the gentleman has expired. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Cleaver, Ranking Member of Our House and Insurance Subcommittee.

Rep. Emanuel CLEAVER (D., Mo.): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stumpf, thank you for being here. I know you -- you're not -- this is not one of your better days, but, and hopefully you understand -- I have a plane to catch, I may not finish my -- my -- my time and I dare not get on a plane and go back to Kansas City and conduct myself in a way that everything is fine and we'll all join hands and sing kumbaya and fix the problem.

One of the reasons that everybody in this place is upset, we -- each of us represents about 840,000 people; and probably every one of them is angry, especially those who had problems, you know, getting loans and people who were ripped off during the crisis from 2008 and 2009.

And so I think many of them think that they had a preview of this Gordon Gecko. Greed is good, greed is right, greed works in the movie "Wall Street," and I think that's one of the problems we have here. Now, you have already been "Warren'ed" before I had my opportunity, so I'm not going "Warren" you, but I do need to ask you a couple of questions, maybe just one.

There were $2.6 million in overdraft charges that incurred on linked accounts and late fees, that were thousands of consumers on fire figuratively and your bank had tubs of water, but the people there decided to drink it and let the people burn, including the people who had gotten fired.

My question is how far up the chain have you been able to determine that this scheme, this fraud occurred?

STUMPF: We are -- we know that 5,300 people broke our trust, did -- were not honest, and we know that we're going to do a complete review of anybody who would have been part of this.

And if they were dishonest and -- and -- and broke our code of ethics and took advantage or our customers, they will be held accountable, and we have returned that money with interest with an apology.

CLEAVER: Yes, I know, but -- but I'm -- I'm trying to find how far up the chain have you determined thus far that this -- this game went?

STUMPF: First of all, it was -- most of our people do it right and -- and I -- this was just the opposite of what we train for; just the opposite of what we -- we talked about. So when I -- when I say it's a scheme.

I mean it -- it -- it's -- again, 1 percent of our people. I know that's a lot of people given our size of our company, but -- and we'll do a full review and we're going to do a review of that.

CLEAVER: Well God bless you, but what I'm -- what I'm trying to find out is how far up the chain?

STUMPF: We're not going to let the chain impede -- we're not going to let the chain impede -- the Board's going to do a review and the company to make sure everybody is held accountable.

CLEAVER: OK so, OK, I appreciate that. How far up the chain?

STUMPF: So far of the people that we have found is branch managers, their manager in some cases, and a manager of a manager. So that's the work we have done so far.

CLEAVER: So the manager of manager would be what? A vice president?

STUMPF: Yeah, I -- I -- I don't know exactly the title, but it's -- I think it's called an area president.

CLEAVER: Area?

STUMPF: Yeah, I think it was an area president.

CLEAVER: OK, so have any of those folks been fired? STUMPF: Pardon me?

CLEAVER: Have any of them been fired?

STUMPF: Yes.

CLEAVER: All the vice presidents?

STUMPF: Well I don't know again -- I don't know if this person was a vice president -- I don't know what the title was. But I know it was banker, then branch manager, manager of the branch managers -- I think they're called district, and then an area manager.

CLEAVER: So, no -- so -- so no matter how high it goes, they are going to be fired.

STUMPF: They are going to be held accountable. I can't say what -- I don't want to prejudge...

CLEAVER: I understand -- I understand, so no matter how far it goes up they'll be fired?

STUMPF: As far as it goes up, they'll be held accountable, whatever that means.

HENSARLING (?): Time of the gentleman has expired.

CLEAVER: That's why everybody's beating you up.

STUMPF: Pardon me?

HENSARLING: The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Fitzpatrick.

Rep. Michael FITZPATRICK (R., Pa.): Thank you Chairman. Mr. Stumpf, I want to -- I want to follow up on Mr. Cleaver's questions.

First of all I represent a district outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and I, like probably most of my colleagues here have received letters from customers, from our constituents, from former employees of the bank, and they have a lot of questions of their own which we have to help them try to answer.

First I want to ask sort of a foundational question, this is a question that you have been asked many times already, today, last week in the Senate, about when you first heard of this situation, this so- called situation with your customer accounts.

You have given us approximate dates, which we appreciate, but first and foundationally, if you could tell the Committee, tell the American people, when you first heard about the problem where were you? Who told you? What did they say to you? What did you do about it? At the first moment?

STUMPF: Yes, OK. So I'll answer your question and thank you for that. I have always known as I think most Americans know, that not every bill due (ph) everything right (ph) every day and we have you know, 100,000 different people in this business.

So we knew and I knew that this had to be managed, it was being managed in the business. Sometime later in 2013 before the L.A. story came out, because that did not surprise me because heard that we were seeing an acceleration of this activity in a certain marketplace.

And I can't recall if my -- if chief legal counsel told me, I can't remember if it was in a meeting with the business leader at the time, or compliance, and that's when I first knew that this was becoming a bigger issue.

So resources were brought in to -- to bring corporate resources in to assist the business line and then we spent -- or the business and the corporate group called CORE (ph), spent time working on that issue and we saw the issue come down. It was not until 2015, and we should have learned earlier, we should -- we did...

FITZPATRICK: Mr. Stumpf, you're not answering the question. When you -- when you first heard where you were? Who told you, and what did you do about it when you first heard?

STUMPF: Again I -- I don't remember where I was sitting, what I was doing, where I -- but I recall hearing it sometime in the summer- fall timeframe of 2013. I can't -- I don't ember the exact minute or the person.

FITZPATRICK: Mr. Stumpf, there have been so many people who have been hurt by what we know right now. Not just your customers, you're going to lose many customers, never get them back. There have been lower level and mid level employees who have been injured.

You mentioned earlier in your testimony, 268,000 people went to work today at Wells Fargo to do the right thing and for the most part we all believe that. You also mentioned there were some 5,000 employees who lost their positions.

As employers, we're responsible, when you bring somebody young into an organization, somebody perhaps right out of high school or right out of college; you have a special responsibility to that employer -- employee to train them, to make sure they are being trained in the ways of ethics in banking.

How many of those lower-level employees were part of the 5,500 who lost their jobs?

STUMPF: Yeah, the vast majority -- and I don't have exact numbers, but I believe about 7 percent or so would have been at the teller population.

And the remainder, the other 93 percent were someplace, as my understanding, were banker, senior banker, branch manager, and so forth. And incident (ph) we do give two weeks of training for all our team members before they go out into the -- because you -- you're right.

We have a special responsibility to help them understand our culture. They sign a code of ethics and -- and -- and we

FITZPATRICK: They're they being told in those employee trainings about the so-called goals? Quotas?

STUMPF: They are told about all the responsibilities of their job, including, I've done town halls which I do every quarter, I did one in Philadelphia just couple months ago and I have been talking -- in every one of those, generally I talk about doing the right thing -- putting customers first.

FITZPATRICK: Mr. Stumpf, there have been reports from multiple whistle blowers from the bank, that they provided information up the chain of command and were ignored; as a matter of fact, some were fired. Are you familiar with those cases?

STUMPF: I have heard about those. Those are regrettable. We have a non-retaliation policy on whistleblowers.

FITZPATRICK: You know being fired in the Federal Government for being a whistleblower is a very serious matter. Hopefully you are taking it as seriously as anybody would?

STUMPF: We are -- we're taking that very seriously. We have a non-retaliation policy.

HENSARLING: Time of the gentleman has expired. The Chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Wisconsin, Ms. Moore, Ranking Member of our Monetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee.

Rep. Gwen MOORE (D., Wis.): I thank you so much Mr. Chairman and -- and want to welcome our witness here today. I have learned so much here and I know when you go to the Wells Fargo website, there your picture is, John G. Stumpf, the vision and values of Wells Fargo. And it features you -- you say that you started with Wells Fargo in 1981?

STUMPF: In 1982.

MOORE: In  82, Ok my math is not that good. And you succeeded Mr. Kovacevich, and they had already started a -- so you -- you were you trained and you knew the culture of this Norwest Company, I guess that was a merger of Wells Fargo and Norwest.

And so did you receive trading or do you know if the employees were -- received trading on this Going for Great program that you -- we've talked about here today where you know, most of your customers only had five accounts in your bank and that there was an effort to get at least eight -- sort of accounts, for the customers. Was that part of the culture?

STUMPF: Thank you for the question, as I mentioned before that was an aspirational (ph) goal. Most of our customers have -- most households have 14...

MOORE: All right, OK, because I don't have much time. And so as your predecessor noted, there is just abundant growth potential in the Wells Fargo customer base. And that one of sayings around that place was, hey, "we inspect what we expect."

So were there constant monitoring to see if people were meeting these goals? "It said that we inspect what we expect." What does that statement mean?

STUMPF: Yeah, that statement means that we expect our people to live according to our vision and values, our ethics and our culture, and...

MOORE: Well, good. I am so happy; I'm going to congratulate you on draining the swamp of these 5,300 low-level employees and -- because they almost brought down one of the greatest companies that our country has ever known; I remember Wells Fargo, the old wagon train days.

I'm happy that you got rid of those employees. And I am sorry for your loss, your $41 million, and I'm sorry for the loss of the investors whose stock dropped, but I am wondering what the relief is for one of my constituents, and I have her letter and I want to enter it into the record, she worked at Wells Fargo...

HENSARLING: Without objection.

MOORE: OK, thank you. And she started making $13 an hour and ended making $15 an hour and she was one of those whistle blowers who complained to the manager, and then they changed her performance numbers and pushed her out.

And so she's the person that kind of lost her job, and other stuff that happens to you when you make $13 an hour -- $15 an hour, I'm sorry. And you're pushed out by people because you don't want to -- because you don't fit in with the expectations and the -- and the culture.

What is the remedy -- is there a fund for these employees; the good ones, not these 5,300. What is it $12 an hour, $13 an hour employees? What is the remedy for my constituent at Wells Fargo? I know...

STUMPF: We want to know about everyone and we're going to review their files for anyone who had anything to do --if they were...

MOORE: She has a case with Wisconsin Equal Rights Division. How come she couldn't just come to you and tell you...

STUMPF: And -- and -- and we have people she can talk to.

MOORE: No, see (ph) the people she talked to, fired her.

STUMPF: If -- we'll have corporate resources here. If you could give me that name, Congresswoman, let our people know...

MOORE: OK, I want to ask a question (ph), I have 49 seconds. I was very disturbed to hear about -- you said the numbers were just not large enough to ride to the level of being material for security law purposes; I don't really -- I don't understand that.

Would you as an investor invest in sort of the Bernie Madoff-type enterprises? It seems it was these huge dividends; would you make this kind of investment yourself?

STUMPF: This is not a (ph) -- this is a quality company who made some mistakes, but our investment basis is all about our capital, our growth --

MOORE: I've got nine seconds left, but I just want to ask this one question. You have stated previously that you think the Dodd- Frank over regulates. Do you believe that?

STUMPF: I -- I never said that.

MOORE: Really?

STUMPF: I don't -- I don't recall saying that.

HENSARLING: Time of the gentlelady has expired.

MOORE: Thank you so much Mr. Chairman.

HENSARLING: The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from Indiana, Mr. Stutzman.

Rep. Marlin STUTZMAN (R., Ind.): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Mr. Stumpf, I -- I'll tell you, I'm a -- I got my first loan from Norwest bank for a motorcycle when I was 20 years old and I've been a happy customer of Wells Fargo for over 20 years.

STUMPF: Thank you.

STUTZMAN: And I have been frustrated with Wells Fargo as of late, because of the new website. And I have voiced that, and I think part of this -- I think you need to do something about it, because the transparency on the website right now -- I can't find some of my accounts.

I think that there needs to be at this point, a time where you can give customers confidence through the website to make sure that every account can be seen, because I got notices all of a sudden of accounts that I didn't recognize because I didn't see them on a daily basis. I found them after I called Wells Fargo and talked to them, but what my question is to you, and I -- your story is remarkable.

You came from a dairy farm I believe in Minnesota, correct? And if you'd have taken a different choice -- I grew up on a dairy farm, still part of our family farming operation, I'm curious to know what you would do today if you would have taken a different path.

And these (ph) a dairy farmer in Minnesota and you had been trying to buy land and you were trying to buy some more cows and you realized that your credit score, something's wrong with it, and you have not been able to get your credit score up and all of a sudden you find out that maybe your credit score was dinged because your bank was opening accounts. I mean when accounts are opened, it dings your credit score, correct?

STUMPF: That is correct.

STUTZMAN: That's right. So 2 million people, potentially, had their credit score dinged because someone else was opening accounts in their name, is that correct?

STUMPF: That is not correct. There is about 565,000 credit cards which we already now have contacted 20,000 of those and less than 25 percent saying, and I don't want to minimize the numbers, these are still big numbers, even one is too many, but we're going to go back and my instruction is make it right for every one of those customers.

STUTZMAN: Here's what I was surprised to just watch a little bit ago when Mr. Cleaver was asking you, what was the highest level officer at Wells Fargo to be fired, and he didn't really know, he kind of said area manger...

(CROSSTALK)

STUMPF: Excuse me, I know the title, I know the functional title, I don't know if that person is a vice president, a senior vice president, I just don't know that. I do know that that's a manager -- it's a branch manager's manager's manager and we're also not done with our investigation.

STUTZMAN: I understand but you know this broke for the public within the past month. You apparently knew about it, what 2012, 2013?

STUMPF: We knew that not everyone does it right. It was sometime in 2015 we did our PWC study and those results came in early in  16.

STUTZMAN: But you're the CEO. When 939 employees are fired for improper sales in 2011. In 2012 another thousand. All you have to do is stand up in front of your company, and I know it's a large company, and say this is going to stop and it should've -- it should be stopping. I'm curious to hear from employees who were fired, what their experience was and I hope we do a hearing with some of those.

But let me ask you this, I mean Wells Fargo, it's a huge company. Is it too big to manage?

STUMPF: No it is not. This was a focus problem. We -- and we do a lot of areas really, really well like model risk and market risk and capital liquidity. We know we have work to do in operational and compliance risk. We should invest in more, today I've told our folks, no stone unturned, no dollar unspent, get this right and we're getting rid of sales goals.

STUTZMAN: I know you've said that today but where was the outrage from you a couple years ago when you first heard about it?

I mean there's outrage on this committee, and rightly so, I'm outraged about it, but I don't sense the same outrage from you when you have -- when we're seeing your -- the lady here, her name is Ms. Tolstedt I believe, she's walking away with millions of dollars. The American people and your customers are going to be very upset when they see exactly what happens here.

Final question and I hope that you will -- I didn't hear the question from this committee but will you get the number to this committee of CFPB regulators that were embedded at Wells Fargo bank?

STUMPF: I can talk to our team and we'll be as cooperative as we can. I don't know whether that's covered under confidential supervising but I'll be as helpful as I can be on that issue.

STUTZMAN: Please do that. I think not only have you and Wells Fargo let customers down but so have CFPB and people across this country are mad at both.

STUMPF: Thank you.

STUTZMAN: Thank you Mr. Chairman. HENSARLING: Time of the gentleman has expired, the chair now recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota, Mr. Ellison.

Rep. Keith ELLISON (D., Minn.): Mr. Chairman, I ask for unanimous consent to enter into the record a report entitled, Banking on the Hard Sell, Low Wages and Aggressive Sales Metrics Put Bank Words and Customers At Risk," I'd like to enter it into the record.

HENSARLING: Without objection.

ELLISON: I'd also like to enter into the record an op-ed I wrote in the Daily Beast just the other day entitled, "John Stumpf's Wells Fargo Wreck It Shows Why Bank Workers Need a Union."

HENSARLING: Without objection.

ELLISON: And I'd also just like to note for my colleagues, Progressive Caucus held a June 10th briefing listening to the workers that we've been talking about today. We'd be happy to do another one.

But on June 10th we had workers come in and testify to the very thing we've been talking about today which is these high pressure sales techniques. Mr. Stumpf, if you're a worker and you're at Wells Fargo and you are expected to seek out and reach sales goals, you mentioned that right?

STUMPF: We had sales goals...

ELLISON: That's a yes or no sir. Yes or no sir because I don't have a lot of time. I'm not trying to be unkind to you but I'm not going to let you waste my time. OK so yes or no.

STUMPF: Yes we had sales goals.

ELLISON: OK thank you so could you tell me, do you all have something known as prospecting calls that were expected for bankers to make?

STUMPF: I don't know that level of detail.

ELLISON: OK you don't know whether there was prospectors. Would you be surprised -- do you deny that there were prospecting calls?

STUMPF: I do not know that level of detail in our retail bank.

ELLISON: Were you aware that each banker was expected to make at least 100 prospecting calls a day? Are you aware of that?

STUMPF: That -- I had -- that's the first time I've ever heard that.

ELLISON: Mr. CEO Chairman, are you aware that there were weekly meetings held by -- no, morning huddles to talk about these sales goals, are you aware of that?

STUMPF: I realize -- I know that some...

ELLISON: You've got to answer yes or no sir.

STUMPF: It's yes with an explanation.

ELLISON: Well, OK. Morning huddles or not? Yes or no? Did they occur?

STUMPF: Yes with an explanation.

ELLISON: All right at these morning huddles, were there questions asked of workers, how are they going to sell more credit cards and were they given goals for specifically selling a number of credit cards?

STUMPF: I don't know that (ph) everyone holds -- I have to give you an explanation, sir...

ELLISON: Home equity loans. Were they given goals...

STUMPF: I don't know that. I don't know that every branch held a morning huddle. I know our team works together.

ELLISON: Were there publishing of charts on who sold how many products in your bank?

STUMPF: That's a level I do not know that...

ELLISON: Were they publishing charts on who did not make their sales goals?

STUMPF: Again, I don't have that level of detail.

ELLISON: Workers say that there were.

STUMPF: OK.

ELLISON: Now if a worker did not reach their sales goals, were they put on initial written warnings?

STUMPF: I don't know the process..

(CROSSTALK)

ELLISON: Excuse me. If they did not -- if workers did not meet second -- sales goals again, were they given second warnings?

STUMPF: I don't know that level of detail.

ELLISON: OK if they were not reached second warnings, were they written up? Given written admonishments for not making sales goals?

STUMPF: Congressman you're asking a question I can't answer.

ELLISON: OK, so yes you're the CEO and you don't know this. And were they given performance improvement plans if they did not make the sales goals. STUMPF: Congressman I don't know that level of detail.

ELLISON: All right and did -- how did you generate these lists for workers to have to make calls? How were the lists generated?

STUMPF: Congressman I don't even know if there were lists, I just don't know that level of detail.

ELLISON: OK so you're the CEO and you don't know if there were sales -- if there were prospecting lists that each worker was made to make calls (ph) on?

STUMPF: I don't know that level of detail Congressman.

ELLISON: OK and if sales weren't important, why were workers given credit card and home equity loan goals to meet?

STUMPF: Yes, I don't know what their goals were.

(CROSSTALK)

ELLISON: Why were workers encouraged to open numerous accounts for customers?

STUMPF: Our team members are encouraged to stell (ph) at a customer, talk about their financial journey and help provide the right products and services.

(CROSSTALK)

ELLISON: So if a worker got a person to open up an account, isn't it true that that account, let's say a debit account, that there has to be a certain minimum balance in that account and there is a fee to hold that account if there's not the minimum balance met? Am I right about that?

STUMPF: I don't believe you are right about Congressman. I don't believe that's correct.

(CROSSTALK)

ELLISON: If there's an account, does there have to be a certain number of uses of that debit account per month?

STUMPF: I believe that's one way...

(CROSSTALK)

ELLISON: And if it's not met, is there a fee associated with that?

STUMPF: I believe there's a minimum balance...

ELLISON: What is that fee? What is the minimum balance fee?

STUMPF: I don't know what those numbers are.

HENSARLING: Time. Time of the gentleman has expired. Chair now recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina, Mr. Mulvaney.

Rep. Mick MULVANEY (R., S.C.): Thank you Chairman. Just some (ph) from over here. I don't know I can't tell you how disappointed I am to even have to be here today as one of the many members of this committee who, every single day in here, defend the banking system.

Defend capitalism, defend free markets, to sit here and have to watch you essentially validate everything that the other side has said about you and your business and your industry, I don't know for the last three or four generations, is extraordinarily disappointing to me and the damage that you have done to the market, to your industry far exceed the damage that you've done to your own business, but again, there's nothing I can do about that.

I want to ask you I think just one question. I know a little bit about this, not nearly as much as you do. What little I do know I didn't learn from college or business school. I learned from my dad, who was actually raised very similar to you. He was from Minnesota, born into a lower middle class family went to Winona, went on to the university, a little bit older than you, but not much.

And I remember him telling me one time when I was first getting into business, he said, "You know what? You can learn a lot about an enterprise, about an organization, by looking at the leader. And the organization will take on the personality of the leader or the owner or the person in charge. If you walk into a lobby and you're received nicely by the young man who's sitting there answering phones, it's probably a really good indication that the lady that owns the place is a really good person.

Conversely, if you walk in and you get treated like crap and disdain it probably says a lot about the people at the top of the chain. I happen to think that the folks that work with me in my office reflect and you come to my office you get treated well, because that's important to me.

The place that you ran, Mr. Stumpf, and I don't know that much about Wells, I knew a little about Wachovia and Wells being the First Union (ph) because of where I grew up -- you all were rotten.

We've heard some stories today that everybody's heard about -- I'm sitting here looking at the story from 2009 about the lawsuit that got filed. It says, "Wells Fargo," Ms. Jacobs, (inaudible), New York Times, "saw the black community was fertile ground for sub-prime mortgages as working class blacks were hungry to be part of the nation's home growing mania. Loan officers," she said in an affidavit, "stated that employees referred to blacks as mud-people, and to sub- prime lending as ghetto loans."

I can't tell you how hard it is for me to even say that. You all targeted black churches -- I'm not gonna defend that. That doesn't deserve defense. I'm gonna ask you one question. Does this organization reflect you?

STUMPF: I am deeply sorry and I read that article that you just said, and that has no place in our culture, no place in what we've done, and we are today the largest lender to low and moderate income people in housing. We make more loans to African-Americans, Latinos, persons of color and we're proud of that, and that kind of language and that kind of behavior is not who I am.

I've learned my life lessons also from my parents. My dad is 94 and he's still a wonderful guy and is still a big influence on my life and so is my mother. And I try to lead with courage and conviction.

Our company is based on those values, of ethics, of doing what's right and the company -- of course we've made mistakes. Not everybody lives up to our vision and values but the vision and values -- our 286,000 people aspire to, and do every day, is consistent with what I want to live my life and what our culture is of our company.

MULVANEY: Thank you Mr. Stumpf, I appreciate that. With the minute I have left I want to say something to my Democratic colleagues, who I know will see this, and believe me if the roles were reversed I might see this as an opportunity to try and push a political initiative, a political agenda, to bang the drums for more heavy regulation -- everything that we're talking about here today, including what I just read, which I won't read again, happened since CFPB and Dodd-Frank.

It happened after we supposedly fixed all of this with regulation. And maybe I would suggest this -- you can't fully regulate bad actors. I'm not here in a position to say if Mr. Stumpf is a bad person or not.

That's not up to me, I'm trying not to be in the position of judging other people, that's for his board. I know how I would vote if I were the board. In fact you wouldn't even be here if I were on the board of that company.

But you're never going to be able to fully regulate bad actors, and I hope we look at this with a certain level-headedness as we move forward. Thank you.

HENSARLING: The time of the gentleman has expired. The Chair now recognizes gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Perlmutter.

Rep. Ed PERLMUTTER (D., Colo.): First Mr. Chair I'd like to introduce into the record the reports, the Community Banking Report, May 24, 2016 from Wells Fargo ...

HENSARLING: Without objection.

PERLMUTTER: ... and the report from May 20, 2014. HENSARLING: Without objection.

PERLMUTTER: Mr. Stumpf, about eight years ago you were before this committee and I was so proud of you and proud of Wells Fargo and the fact that I thought that the guy's operated as a bank.

And really looked after me, a customer, somebody who's been with the bank -- I mean all these young guys, I've been with one of the predecessor banks for 40 years. And I represented some of the predecessors -- First Interstate, Security Pacific, United.

The culture is what I want to talk about. Because that really is you and it is your board of directors. And I've heard terms today that I don't really align with the banking business, if you will. I look at banks as something different.

We came in with $800 billion to save the banking system when it was collapsing because it's something different. But I hear you use words today, and this is where I think the root of this problem is -- sales organization. Retail sales. Stores.

I never, ever in my life referred to my branch bank in Applewood, Colorado as a store. You don't sell Veg-O-Matics. You don't sell grapefruit. You take people's money, you safeguard it, and you lend it out to people who may need it for interest. Maybe me.

And to get in -- this is where Mr. Green was going with the products -- I don't know how many products you've got. I looked at my account -- I do like the online banking, by the way, because I can look at all my accounts. I turn out, as Mr. Royce says, I have eight accounts with you. How I have eight, the great eight, I don't know. But I do.

So talk to me about why you're calling these things stores. Why you use words like retail sales and cross-selling. You're a bank.

STUMPF: We are a bank, and the idea here is that we want to make sure our team members, when you come into a bank, or any one of our customers do, that we treat them with respect, and that we provide products and services that help them. When they do more with us we can give them a better deal.

They get more value, it helps them and it helps us. And whether we call them a store, a branch or a location, it's what is in the hearts and minds of the people who are inside there.

PERLMUTTER: And I'll accept that. But I still think you're a bank. And we treat banks differently than we treat grocery stores. Because you're the heart of the financial system. But here's where I want to go.

I go into my bank. There's been some turnover there, but they always treat me well, they're nice young people, sometimes they're saying, "Do you need this, do you need that?" I generally am saying, "No." When you talk about these goals that are established, why are you even setting goals? I mean the goal should be -- if your customer needs something, try to help him.

STUMPF: Correct. We're getting rid of product sales goals and the ...

PERLMUTTER: Why did you have the goals in the first place?

STUMPF: It was an idea that for people to make sure that they used the right way of sitting down so they have a conversation with a customer. I don't want our people in our branches, our banks, to be apathetic and just not care when people come in.

I want them to sit down and have a conversation with about where that customer is in their financial journey, so they can meet a need with a product. And when it works well it deepens relationships, everyone wins.

No one should be ever, whatever the goals are, should be forcing a product or saying, "Why don't you do this? Or why don't you buy this?" It doesn't -- that's not the way we train, that's not the way we incent for, but even today, we have taken that off the table because we're learning that customers grow with us when they're happy. When they're satisfied. When -- our satisfaction scores, our loyalty scores have never been higher. That's a better way of doing business.

PERLMUTTER: Look. I'm just here as a member of Congress who has worked with banks before. But I'm just telling you, you got to stop, "Our stores. Our stores generate more deposits than our competitors."

You know you've got Denver up here on your chart -- that creates the wrong culture. And I yield back.

HENSARLING: The time of the gentleman has expired. The Chair now recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Pittenger.

Rep. Robert Pittenger (R., N.C.): Thank you Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stumpf, good afternoon. Mr. Stumpf I'm from Charlotte.

STUMPF: Great. We love Charlotte.

PITTENGER: Well, you have very major presence in our community. That I think are some 23,600 employees...

STUMPF: Correct.

PITTENGER: ...that work there. They are my constituents.

I do have deep respect and appreciation for the corporate citizenship that you all have -- have been in Charlotte. You have been exemplary in terms of what you've done in our community.

You take active roles -- your employees do in many non-profit organizations. And that leadership is commended.

And of course we cherish the Wells Fargo golf tournament. And so, you have a -- a major presence in our community.

And that's why today is such a sad day. I know it is for you.

STUMPF: Mmhmm.

PITTENGER: I'm sure as you look back on these 35 years, and where you are today, you think what if. What if I had done this?

STUMPF: Mmhmm.

PITTENGER: What differences could I have made? Where was I blindsided? What mistakes -- what -- where did I err?

STUMPF: Mmhmm.

PITTENGER: And so I think I'm asking you to look as if you were sitting in our seat. We represent these people. We say there (ph) are (ph) some 750 to 800 thousand plus people.

And you have a lot of outrage, a lot of righteous indignation because we haven't seen what I've -- what we've all expected.

You know, in the SouthPark, Wells Fargo facility that you have, there's writing behind the tiller station -- the counter -- the statement by Mr. Wells. It came from I believe 1864. Do you recall that statement?

That -- I think it's -- it's very prominent. And maybe perhaps it is another Wells Fargo -- it seems to be the motto of your -- of your bank.

STUMPF: Are you asking me a question?

PITTENGER: Yes, sir.

STUMPF: Yeah, I -- I don't -- he's made a lot of statements. But treat every customer with respect. And -- -and I -- I -- I can't recall the...

PITTENGER: Well it's -- what we have there at the SouthPark, it says, "We have one very powerful business rule. It's concentrated in one word, courtesy."

So, I think as you look at all of -- there's a lot embedded in that word courtesy. But I think that that's the challenge that we had today.

What could have been done different? Certainly the regulators were there. Yet, this was reported by a news agency.

What would you have done different today? As you look back in the changes, in the mistakes that were made as the CEO, what happened in that corporate culture that did not allow that information to come to you in a more timely fashion that would of caused you to take even greater direction in leadership?

STUMPF: Yeah. I -- I think that's a great question. I've already asked myself that if a thousand times, a million times.

And -- and while you know I want to defend our culture and our people, I recognize that we could've done more, earlier. And I don't know there's any one point.

STUMPF: But surely we should have got a -- we should have realized earlier that product sales goals could illicit behavior that's inconsistent with our culture. Even if it happened, like this case with 1 percent of our team, it's way too much. It's simply not worth it.

And frankly, it's not even consistent with -- with where we're going, given the business today. So, you know I don't -- I don't know if I can be clearer than that. And there's a lot of people doing a lot of introspection within the company today to make sure that we never, ever put a customer, or a team member -- we want always customers to be foremost of what we do.

And if courtesy is the right word -- we think of relationship. We love long-term, mutually-beneficial relationships with our owners, our team members, and most importantly, our customers.

PITTENGER: Yes sir, I think those of us who understand free markets -- I was on a bank board -- small bank -- but we understood the customer.

We understood the importance of the financial industry and what it does to facilitate economic growth and that's why we're so challenged today, because we see, there's been a strangling of regulations on financial industry and yet with that we're having to deal with you and with this bank, and with this problem.

It's going to have ripple effects. And the messaging is going to be there that there needs to be even more oppressive regulations.

STUMPF: Thank you.

HENSARLING: Time of the gentleman has expired, the chair now recognizes the gentleman from Connecticut, Mr. Himes.

Rep. James HIMES (D., Conn.): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stumpf, we've focused a lot today on accountability.

I want to go back to something that like Congressman Lucas' concerns troubles me which is kind of the focus on culture and the materiality of what happened here. We're hearing that there's not a problem with the culture and you're hearing an awful lot of disagreement up here and we're hearing, certainly, in the senate hearing that this wasn't material.

And I guess if you sort of exquisitely, finely define materiality, the way maybe the SEC defines it, maybe $185 million in fines is not material.

But this is - this is about much more than a legal definition of materiality and we need to hear you say that you understand the magnitude of what has occurred here. It's more than $185 million. It's about the trust and the faith and the belief in the system.

It's not about the ups and downs of one company. It's about people's faith in the banking system. It's about their faith in the market economy. It's about whether competition is perceived as a good thing by the American public or a bad thing.

It's really about people's faith in organizations like yours and like the one that you're testifying with - in front of today. But let me start with the numbers quickly here.

What matters to an investor, of course, is the value of the company they own and your shareholders have already paid out $185 million including, by the way, the State of Connecticut's pension funds. Mr Stumpf, do you know what the market cap, the value of your company is today?

STUMPF: I didn't look this morning but I think it's 200 or 230...

HIMES: ...$228 billion. On September 7 when this all started, it was $253 billion and there's been no other material impact so just this event has cut $25 billion off of the value of Wells Fargo. That's a big number. Do you know what the value of Ford Motor Company is, Mr. Stumpf?

STUMPF: I do not follow Ford.

HIMES: It's $50 billion. So, just since the 7th we have - you have and your organization and the culture have obliterated a full half of a Ford Motor Company. That has to be material, doesn't it?

STUMPF: Congressman, I take this as much more than the $185 million. I don't want to diminish this. I am deeply sorry that we didn't do the right thing and I understand that re-earning the trust of our customer and the American people is going to be our biggest challenge.

HIMES: I appreciate that and I do want to get away from the numbers because, again, I'm troubled by this whole culture thing. Do you think that you can fully measure Wells Fargo's value with the hard assets, the dollars and cents, the number of accounts? Let me ask it another way. Are intangible things like Wells Fargo's reputation and brand an important part of the company's value?

STUMPF: There's no question. I think the most important...

HIMES: ...The answer is yes. Do you believe that Wells Fargo...

STUMPF: ...With an explanation, though, may I?

HIMES: Yes, yes, OK, go ahead.

STUMPF: I think, frankly, what is in the hearts and minds of our people and the trust with our customer is by far the most important thing because they make all the rest happen.

HIMES: Do you think that Wells Fargo's reputation has been damaged in a material way by this?

STUMPF: I think there's been damage, yes.

HIMES: OK. What I worry about is bigger than Wells Fargo. It's the fact that the system comes apart if people don't have faith and trust. Mr. Stumpf, can you see what I'm holding up right here?

STUMPF: I'm near-sighted but I think it's a dollar (ph).

HIMES: It's - it's a one dollar bill. It's the almighty dollar.

STUMPF: Yes.

HIMES: It's a piece of paper with some green ink on it.

STUMPF: Yes.

HIMES: Does this thing have any intrinsic value? Can I eat it if I'm hungry, can I use it to cut wood if I...

STUMPF: ...No.

HIMES: Does it have any intrinsic value at all?

STUMPF: It represents a promise.

HIMES: It's a promise.

STUMPF: Yes.

HIMES: So it relies on the faith and the belief in the American people that this has some value otherwise it's a piece of paper with green ink on it. Is that not correct?

STUMPF: I totally agree with you, congressman.

HIMES: And can I not expand that point to the banking system? If Americans really started getting anxious about the fact that you don't have enough money in your banks on any given day to cover their deposits, we'd have a problem, wouldn't we?

STUMPF: There's no question about that.

HIMES: And the only thing standing between us and this meaning - being meaningful - meaningless and between them believing that the banking system doesn't work is trust and faith in the fact that it does.

STUMPF: Congressman, you are absolutely right. Trust is the absolute critical element here and we have a lot of work to do to work on that.

HIMES: So - so your investors are equity investors. They accept risk including the possibility that something like this could happen. If you don't want this kind of risk, you buy bonds or treasuries or whatever it is.

I would implore you as somebody who I think understands that the market economy is important and that the financial services industry is important, I would implore you to please don't continue to focus on this idea that this is not material. I think we're now agreeing that it is material.

STUMPF: I never said - go ahead.

HIMES: And please work with your colleagues to repair some of the damage that has been done to the faith and the trust that we both here today have acknowledged is the only underpinning of the system that has done so well by you, sir.

STUMPF: Thank you for your comments and I couldn't agree more. This is bigger than the 185. In fact, I don't even think in those terms regaining trust.

HIMES: Thank you.

I yield back, Mr. Chairman.

HENSARLING: Time of the gentleman has expired.

The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Missouri, Ms. Wagner.

Rep. Ann WAGNER (R., Mo.): Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

Mr. Stumpf, you've some before this committee today to answer for the appalling actions taken by your company, Wells Fargo. I have a number of questions but I want to start by expressing my outrage.

Outrage, that your company was taking advantage of your customers, our constituents for years and years and years. I don't understand how your employees could create millions of unauthorized accounts without someone raising a red flag.

And if that happened, how you failed to act on that knowledge. You had a responsibility to your customers and you failed big time. Placing one's money and wealth in the custody of an organization like Wells Fargo is one of the biggest displays of what are we talking about?

Public trust. And you sir, and your company, have betrayed that trust and taken advantage of consumers in order to meet sales performance goals and fraudulently improve earnings in share prices. This is wrong. This is immoral. And this may even be criminal.

And as you state sir, the buck stops with you. Not only did Wells Fargo and your employees fail these customers, but our regulators failed, as well. They neither identified nor prevented this malpractice from occurring in the first place.

It wasn't the OCC or the CFPB that first uncovered these deceptive sales practices that were taking place. But it was in fact the L.A. Times. The media that first brought your company's shameful practices to light.

And while it is the regulator's job to prosecute the banking institutions that break the law, it is our job as members of Congress to prosecute the regulators who were in fact, asleep at the wheel.

From what we know, and there is a lot that we don't know, sir, this widespread abuse was occurring as long ago as 2011. Some have -- have said maybe back as far as 2007. With 1,000 employees being terminated every year for creating fraudulent accounts.

Yet, this behavior persisted for years without management intervening. And even when regulators began to investigate, Wells Fargo did nothing to notify customers and shareholders.

Your company abused its customers. While you have apologized, that apology carries no weight with me, sir. You still have a lot to explain to this committee and frankly, to my constituents.

Mr. Stumpf, how many of your customers have been impacted by your fraudulent activities?

STUMPF: Well, I don't know -- I know what the WPC numbers showed...

(CROSSTALK)

WAGNER: What is that number?

STUMPF: It was -- it's -- there was 2 million accounts that they could not rule out and now we're going back and contacting those customers. Within our credit card business, as I mentioned, we already talked to 20,000 of them...

WAGNER: How many in Missouri, Mr. Stumpf?

STUMPF: I can get you that.

WAGNER: Quickly as you can, please. How many customers have been abused in my home state of Missouri?

STUMPF: There were 1,191 accounts.

WAGNER: What course (ph) do these customers were defrauded after you became aware of the fraudulent activities?

STUMPF: I don't know what -- I don't have a timeline on that. I just know it (ph) was broken out by credit card...

(CROSSTALK)

WAGNER: So over 2 million customers, you're going back to even find out there are more and you don't have a timeline -- you have a timeline for the -- for the employees that you fired year after year after year. But you have no timeline of the number of fraudulent accounts?

STUMPF: I don't -- I -- I -- I can work on that and get that to you. I don't happen to have it in my book right now, here...

(CROSSTALK) WAGNER: You keep saying sir, that you're going to make it right.

STUMPF: Correct.

WAGNER: Those are your words. You're going to make it right. I'd like to know when, when will these customers be made whole, Mr. Stumpf? When will we know and when will they know whether their credit scores have been affected, when?

STUMPF: Yes well, we're starting to work on that right now and we've already talked to 20,000 of our customers and we're hearing that 75 percent or 20 -- less that 25 percent either didn't want the card or didn't know they had the card and then we're gonna...

(CROSSTALK)

WAGNER: Twenty thousand out of 2 million plus customers, you're just getting started now?

STUMPF: No...

(CROSSTALK)

WAGNER: You took five years sir, just to identify and begin rectifying the problem and Wells Fargo only just announced their sales incentives will eliminate in October. When will customers -- will they have to wait five years sir? Or longer in order to get relief?

STUMPF: Twenty thousand we've talked (ph) so far is out of the 565,000 -- the other ones did not have, from my understanding, a bureau involved. But we're gonna talk to all of our customers. We're gonna contact all of them...

(CROSSTALK)

HENSARLING: Time -- time of the gentlelady has expired.

The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Delaware, Mr. Carney.

Rep. John CARNEY (D., Del.): Mr. Stumpf, I represent the whole state of Delaware, it's over 900,000 people, one of the bigger districts here in the Congress. We are a banking center. As you may know, we don't have a huge Wells Fargo presence.

But could you look in your book please and find out how many fraudulent accounts were attributed to people who live in the state of Delaware so I know what we're talking about.

STUMPF: I can tell you how many accounts that the PWC analysis could not rule out, I'm -- these aren't...

(CROSSTALK)

CARNEY: And your commitment is to make right each of these accounts in some way or another?

(CROSSTALK)

STUMPF: Exactly right. And in Delaware, let me see if I have this number right.

CARNEY: So while you're looking at it...

STUMPF: Yeah one -- 100 and -- excuse me, 4,255 accounts.

CARNEY: So my responsibility is to make sure and your commitment is to make sure that each of those accounts will be -- you will make right by those people?

STUMPF: We're gonna -- we're gonna go contact every deposit account, we're gonna talk to every credit card customer that we -- that -- that we can make contact with. We'll try to contact all 565 in your district -- or in your state.

There looks like there's 1,793 cards and again, I don't know how many of those won't be wanted versus wanted and we're gonna look for the secondary harm.

CARNEY: Thank you very much. So part of our responsibility as members of Congress in this hearing is to figure out what went wrong, whether people are being held accountable and most importantly, what we should be doing going forward.

And the thing that I'm struggling with is how long this went on before you were able to stop it. And you've heard that question on and on again.

STUMPF: Correct.

CARNEY: And it does for me, as Mr. Stutzman asked from the other side of the aisle -- by the way, I agree with Mr. Capuano, there are very few issues in the six years that I've been here where both sides of the aisle are on the same page.

When Mr. Meeks and Mr. Capuano and Mr. Posey and Mr. Duffy are outraged on the same subject, you know that something really is going on, here. So does -- what about that question about whether this is -- whether this is an institution that's too big too manage?

STUMPF: You know again, as I mentioned to another...

CARNEY: Mr. Stutzman asked the question.

STUMPF: Yes and I think this is a focused problem. We -- we can get our arms (ph) around this and we will. We have...

CARNEY: So how -- so how can you manage such a large organization with 260 whatever thousand employees and not be able to answer the questions that Mr. Ellison posed to you about things that were happening on the front lines.

How do you control that activity which was really what was going on, here? STUMPF: Again, we have leaders in those businesses that could answer those questions. I don't have that level of detail. I can surely get that.

CARNEY: I would -- I'd appreciate it if you would (ph). One of the things that I've worked (ph) here and I'm not gonna be here after this next election. And one of the things that I've worked here since -- since coming is on mortgage finance reform.

And entered into the record by Mr. Meeks was a list of Wells Fargo settlements for state and federal -- state and federal regulators and there's a whole list of these $5 billion plus related to mortgage fraud, if you will.

Could you explain to me how your chain in control got out of hand with respect to these violations?

STUMPF: Let me -- regarding the...

(CROSSTALK)

CARNEY: Much more impactful on the economy frankly than these fraudulent accounts although the fraudulent accounts are really important.

STUMPF: I don't want to minimize any of our mortgage settlements. But we are by far the largest mortgage originator. In fact...

CARNEY: Hence (ph) it's why I asked the question, right? If you have these -- the level of fraud that was going on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

STUMPF: We've made settlements with a number of agencies as other companies in our industry have. Our settlements have been -- we've had far fewer issues, even though it was the largest mortgage originator (ph).

And I'd like to make this point...

CARNEY: Well, the settlements were over warnings (ph) represented and representations made to Fannie and Freddie which basically indicated that the mortgages are -- were what you said they were, correct?

STUMPF: I -- I believe what you're referring to as an FHA issue that -- that we settled in the last six months about...

CARNEY: That was $1.2 billion...

(CROSSTALK)

CARNEY: No the Fannie and Freddie settlements were $869 million to Freddie and $591 million to Fannie Mae and essentially as I understand, these settlements they're over information that was misrepresented to -- to the GSE's.

STUMPF: You know, I don't have that level of detail right now, but I know this, since 2009, we've made 11 million mortgages in America to help people get lower rates or buy homes and that's been very important to our customers.

CARNEY: So with an institution that large and that difficult to manage, how do you make sure these kinds of things don't happen on the mortgage side as well?

STUMPF: You know we have a terrific team on the mortgage side. We've done a lot of work to improve there and - and we have great leaders in those businesses and we're trying every day to get better.

CARNEY: Well, I'd like to have some additional information if you can provide it. My time has run out on the basis of these settlements.

STUMPF: OK, I'd do what I can with our team to get back to you. Thank you

HENSARLING: The time of the gentleman has expired. The gentleman from Kentucky, Mr. Barr is recognized for five minutes.

Rep. Andy BARR (R., Ky.): Thank you. While I share in my colleague's outrage over the unethical and illegal sales practices at Wells Fargo which opened up over one and a half million fake bank, credit card and web service accounts in the names of real customers, costing those consumers millions of dollars in fraudulent, overdraft and inactivity fees, potentially hurting their credit scores through no fault of their own.

And while Wells Fargo does not have a major retail presence in Kentucky, it's likely, it's very likely that many of my constituents in the sixth congressional district in central Kentucky were defrauded through Wells Fargo's credit card programs. And if you could reference your materials again and identify the number of my constituents who may have been impacted.

STUMPF: OK, let me get that, and while I'm getting that, I'd like to make clear the 1.5 million deposit accounts, very few, if any, had any credit impact. We didn't report that to the credit bureau.

(CROSSTALK)

STUMPF: But let me...

BARR: ...Potentially the accounts in Kentucky.

STUMPF: There are - there were 629 accounts that could not be ruled out. We didn't know...

BARR: You - for those 600 of my potential constituents, you testified today that what happened at your institution over the last several years was not consistent with your culture and ethics.

STUMPF: Correct.

BARR: But I have to think about those 600 Kentuckians.

STUMPF: No question.

BARR: And my constituents who may have had an account opened without their knowledge, without their consent, middle income, hardworking Kentuckians, and that may have resulted in overdraft fees, in activity fees, and could very well damage their credit score and, again, no fault of theirs.

So you've said that you want to make this right, but I would say that my constituents who have been damaged by your conduct would say that that culture that allowed that to happen, that's a rotten culture.

So my question to you is, let's not lose focus on these victims. Let's not focus -- let's not lose focus on those defrauded Wells Fargo customers. And you said your bank will make this right for your customers and this committee's job is to hold you accountable to make this right.

So will you commit to me - and we all have caseworkers and it won't surprise me at all if we get a call from a customer who's been wronged. Will you commit to me and your government relations team commit to me on the record that you will work with us and our constituents to make this fully right for them?

STUMPF: Yes. So let me -- the answer is, yes, with an explanation. We are committed to making it right for every one of our single customers. In fact, we are working with -- we're going to have a consultant that the CFE has to approve. We're going to have mediation, we're going to go back, and I'm interested in results, I'm not interested in...

BARR: Thank you.

STUMPF: I'll have our teamwork with your team.

BARR: I appreciate that because clearly there was a lot that went wrong with your bank. No one did enough -- no one did enough fast enough to fix it.

Secondly, I want to tell you who I also think about in addition to those constituents who have been harmed. I think about the community banks and credit unions in my district.

And I've talked to many people who worked for small institutions in rural Kentucky who are your competitors, and the fact that this scandal has painted a bad picture for the entire banking sector, and frankly, the institutions in my district that all those community banks and credit unions, they don't have your culture.

But now they have a tarnished reputation because they've been swept into this with you.

And we've been fighting for regulatory relief for these small community banks and these credit unions that frankly represent competition to big banks like you. So what I worry about are these small community banks and credit unions that are now going to have to deal with the ramifications of the bad acts of your institution.

Can you comment on your colleagues in the banking sector that now are going to have to live with the regulatory onslaught that is likely going to sweep them into this when they - they are not at fault? Frankly, they don't have a culture like yours.

STUMPF: Well, again, I'm sorry for what we did, I'm sorry that we didn't move fast enough. Again, the vast majority of our people, even in our regional bank, especially our regional bank did exactly what was right; they followed our culture.

This is about people who did not do the right thing or at least about -- behavior that was not right and I accept responsibility for that and I'm sorry about what happened.

BARR: And one final question is, is you testified today you that should have known sooner that product sales goals should've - would've have elicited bad behavior. Was it your policy at the time that this was going on to notify customers when an account was opened?

STUMPF: You know, when an account was opened that was not funded, we had an automatically within 90 days remove from the account file. It was not until 2015 that we finally put it together that there could be a fee during this, so that's when we did the full-blown study back to 2011.

BARR: Well, I would think best practices going forward at least, and in the past is to notify a customer when you open an account. I yield back.

STUMPF: In fact, we do that today. Within one hour of an account being opened today, they get a notice that an account has been opened and we won't pull up credit bureau until we have a signature.

HENSARLING: I now recognize the gentlewoman from Alabama, Ms. Sewell, for five minutes.

Rep. Terri SEWELL (D., Ala.): Thank you Mr. Chairman. So it looks as if Wells Fargo has done somewhat of a deep dive on the one - I guess it's 1.5 million checking accounts and half a million credit cards?

STUMPF: Correct.

SEWELL: So can you tell me with any specificity what demographics were most affected? Was it California? I represent Alabama? Can you tell me how many folks in the state of Alabama were affected by this?

STUMPF: OK. I can tell you. It does not -- it was more in the west and the southwest, but let me get to my numbers here.

SEWELL: And while you're looking, I also want to know whether or not you have identified any commonality between those folks that were affected? Either geographical, demographics, race, ethnicity, income level? Have you sort of isolated as to who was most affected by the fraudulent action?

STUMPF: That's a good question. Of the two million accounts that we could not identify, we couldn't rule them out, there was - there was no -- in fact, the deposit side skewed to younger people, not older people. And we don't take -- we don't use race or ethnicity. We don't capture that information. Only age is what we capture, but I do have a number for...

SEWELL: What about income? I mean obviously when you -- when people are opening up credit cards they have to tell -- say what range of income. Any of those identifiable commonalities between those?

STUMPF: I should have mentioned that. On the deposit side, I don't think we do that. On the credit card side I don't have that information but I can surely get back to you on that, or at least have our team talk to you about that.

SEWELL: And you were looking up Alabama, to see the state of Alabama, how many customers from affected.

STUMPF: Yes. And Alabama had 22,795 accounts. Accounts, not necessarily customer accounts that they could not rule out. I don't know how many of those are going to be...

SEWELL: So 22,700?

STUMPF: And 95.

SEWELL: And 95. And I can assume from all your testimony repeated here today that my -- that the customers in my state will be made whole or made right, as you like to say?

STUMPF: That is our goal for every customer and...

SEWELL: Now my real question is this, being made right includes more than just being made whole for the damage that was done personally to the customer. The reality is that you violated the public trust.

It seems to me being made whole also should go to all of the bonuses that were received off of fraudulent information over the time period that has been identified.

Now, how much money have you made over the five years of 2009 to - to - to 2015 in just bonuses? I'm not talking about your compensation. Just bonuses.

STUMPF: I don't recall exactly but let's say - let - let's say it's in the...

SEWELL: Would it surprise you to know that you were paid $12 million in bonuses for at least the last three years?

STUMPF: Let's say its $18 million or $20 million. I don't recall exactly the number.

SEWELL: So I guess my frustration is that being made right is not just about the personal damage that was done to the customer base.

It really is about the public trust and that to me goes to every level of your company being unjustly enriched by a fraudulent scheme such as this. And I'd like to know what your thoughts are about how Wells Fargo plans to make right to the public on such a magnitude.

STUMPF: Yes, thank you for that. First of all I think it's important to note that fraudulent or unused accounts hurt customers and they hurt us. In fact the $2.6 million of fees that we found for this four years cost us $10 million to produce. That's a losing operation.

There was -- people invest in our company for a whole lot of reasons and one is about deep relationships of customers who use products so an unwanted product, an unused product is just...

SEWELL: Well, with all due respect sir, I understand that it hurts you but I'm here to tell you that the customer base and the 22,000 folks in Alabama are much more egregiously hurt than you and I just want to...

(CROSSTALK)

SEWELL: ... my -- to the comments of my colleague Mr. Ellison who was really trying to capture the bad business practices of your sales force. Now do you still have that line of business? Is that line of business still a part of the portfolio of Wells Fargo?

STUMPF: We have a great retail banking business. We love it and we're getting rid of sales goals. In fact, our customer...

SEWELL: What else are you doing to make sure that this does not happen again?

STUMPF: Yes, if I can just quickly answer that. For any credit card opened or any deposit account opened, there has to be a signature today. If there's not a signature by a customer, it can't get opened. We're also doing mystery shopping to make sure our people are doing the right thing...

SEWELL: What's to stop a fraudulent signature?

STUMPF: It'd be because you have to put in your pin. Only the customer knows that.

HENSARLING: Time of the gentlelady has expired. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Rothfus.

Rep. Keith ROTHFUS (R., Pa.): Thank you Mr. Chairman and Mr. Stumpf. These charges against Wells Fargo violate any legal or ethical standard. We know that Wells Fargo employees (AUDIO GAP) years opened 2 million accounts for customers without authorization.

To hit sales targets and draw additional fees, bank employees falsified accounts and engaged in egregious deceptive practices. This was theft, plain and simple. That the offending Wells Fargo employees did and what they did in a systematic way represents a gross violation of trust. When I first heard about these activities, my first thought was this falls into the, you've got to be kidding me, category.

One's left asking, how does this happen? Over the course of the last 5 years, Wells Fargo was firing 1,000 lower level employees each year. We learned in last week's testimony that it was not until 2014 that various committees on Wells Fargo's board were informed.

It's incredible that this did not rise to the attention of the board immediately and it's incredible that it did not end sooner. By any standard, these actions were wrong, 5,000 people, perhaps more, lied, cheated and stole from customers who they thought would trust them. How many people in Pennsylvania were affected by this?

STUMPF: I'll take a look at that. As I'm doing that, I just want a couple of comments. Many of these people, over 10 or 15 percent, were bankers, or bank managers. These weren't all lower level people, they were in their mid-30's...

(CROSSTALK)

ROTHFUS: How many levels in the organization chart at Wells Fargo are there?

STUMPF: It depends on the operating business. So there could be...

ROTHFUS: Are there 10 layers?

STUMPF: It could be eight or nine or 10 layers.

ROTHFUS: Eight or nine or 10 so a third level employee wouldn't be considered a lower level employee?

STUMPF: These were...

ROTHFUS: How many people in Pennsylvania?

STUMPF: In Pennsylvania, 79,918 accounts we could not exclude, again that's about the 2 million. There's -- you know we're looking at -- we're also understanding right now in credit card, only 20 -- not only, but 25 percent could not remember or did not order...

ROTHFUS: How many branches does Wells Fargo have?

STUMPF: In our total company?

ROTHFUS: Across the country.

STUMPF: Six thousand two hundred.

ROTHFUS: How many branches are identified as being involved in this scandal.

STUMPF: I don't have that number. I don't know if there was a team member...

ROTHFUS: Is this a coast to coast scandal?

STUMPF: This is -- well, first of all it's exception -- it's behavior that we did not want and I don't know if it affected every state or every region. I just don't happen to have that...

ROTHFUS: In the last five years, how many branches you visited personally?

STUMPF: You know I don't keep a count of that but I'm -- pick a number of maybe 1,000?

ROTHFUS: Do you make it a practice to go behind the counter and work...

STUMPF: Absolutely.

ROTHFUS: And work as a teller or as a...

(CROSSTALK)

STUMPF: To work as one?

ROTHFUS: Yes.

(CROSSTALK)

ROTHFUS: Did you ever the see the show about the undercover boss? Where the CEO comes in and does the frontline work?

STUMPF: Yes, I'm not trained or allowed to do that but I walk behind the teller line and I meet our people. I talk out in front with our bankers.

ROTHFUS: So you wouldn't have waited on a customer and maybe stood in the shoes of one of those frontline employees and..

(CROSSTALK)

ROTHFUS: And have you tried the cross-selling practice?

STUMPF: I've talked with them and the vast majority of people are excited. Our culture and our -- in fact, we have engagement scores. Every year we do about 93 or 94 percent of our people participate in the regional bank in a gallop score that brings into account, are you happy at your job? Do you get rewarded? Whatever. And our people are 14 to one, 15 to 1, engaged...

(CROSSTALK)

ROTHFUS: Some of those employees had an issue. How many whistle blowers are there? Do you know?

STUMPF: I do not have that number.

ROTHFUS: Do you appreciate the kind of courage that it takes? Do you appreciate the kind of courage it takes to be a whistleblower?

STUMPF: Well, I absolutely -- our people can call an ethics line and they can do it...

ROTHFUS: You have no idea how many -- you'd have no idea how many whistleblowers...

(CROSSTALK)

ROTHFUS: CNN's reporting dozens. Do you think that's accurate?

STUMPF: I don't know and we're going to work on -- every name that we get, we're going to work on.

ROTHFUS: Do you have any idea of how many of these people are no longer employed at Wells Fargo?

STUMPF: I don't have that number for you.

ROTHFUS: And any idea would've been demoted?

(CROSSTALK)

ROTHFUS: Any idea how many may have been demoted, if any?

STUMPF: I don't have that number for you sir.

ROTHFUS: I would suggest that that -- again, given the courage it takes for somebody who's found (ph) something like to this, to speak and the historic protections that should be attributable to whistleblowers, that this would be a top priority.

STUMPF: And we have an anti...

(CROSSTALK)

ROTHFUS: Well now how many people at Wells Fargo are now working on the whistleblower issue?

STUMPF: I don't know that issue. I could have my team work with your staff and tell you.

ROTHFUS: Do you have any idea how many honest Wells Fargo employees may have lost out in a race with some of the fraudsters?

STUMPF: I don't have that answer for you. Well we've got 268,000 terrific team members.

ROTHFUS: Thank you.

HENSARLING: Time of the gentleman has expired, the chair now recognizes the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Foster.

Rep. Bill FOSTER (D., Ill.): Thank you Mr. Chairman for holding this hearing so we can examine the abusive and fraudulent practices that were so pervasive at Wells Fargo.

I'd like to start by reiterating what many of my colleagues have said in that this corporate malfeasance is exactly why we need a strong and independently funded CFPB. As Director Cordray testified in the Senate last week, the CFPB learned about the fraud at Wells Fargo through its whistleblower line.

It's my understanding that he offered to be here today but it appears that his testimony was not needed to understand the role that his agency played in bringing the fraud to light and I supposed that we don't need his testimony because the CFPB has returned more than $12 billion to 27 million Americans and this case adds to that record.

The CFPB did not learn about the fraud because Wells Fargo self reported. In fact, the record suggests that you, Mr. Stumpf, were informed about the fraudulent accounts anywhere between two and four years before self-reporting by Wells.

In the wake of this incredibly egregious institutionalized conduct, you've now come to Washington to say you're sorry. Well, of course your (AUDIO GAP) compensation but that does not address the core problems in the culture of the institution and the governance rules that allowed it to develop.

As someone who started a manufacturing business and served on its board, I understand that corporate culture starts at the top and eventually permeates the entire organization but your response to the gross misconduct that drove results that you've prided yourself and the bank on, has been underwhelming to say the least.

Because it's clear that the simple motivations of keeping the trust of customers, of shareholders and the jobs of 5,300 front-line employees has not been enough incentive to drive a culture of compliance among management.

So my first question to you, Mr. Stumpf, given this situation, which actually should be a case study for corporate mismanagement in every business school and law school in the country, what specific governance rules should have been in place that would have prevented these abusive practices?

STUMPF: Thank you for question. I've acknowledged before that we should have done more earlier. We should have brought our corporate resources in earlier and we should have, obviously, got rid of sales goals earlier because we were misunderstood or misrepresented by some of our team members. I think that would have been good governance.

STUMPF: Thank you for question. I've acknowledged before that we should have done more earlier. We should have brought our corporate resources in earlier and we should have, obviously, got rid of sales goals earlier because we were misunderstood or misrepresented by some of our team members. I think that would have been good governance.FOSTER: OK. Well I think I'd like to actually focus on specific proposals. I think we've all been impressed by this list of settlements and penalties that have been imposed on Wells since the financial crisis that's been scrolling on (ph) the monitors and without objection I'd like to enter that in the record.

HENSARLING: Without objection.

FOSTER: And one specific proposal that's been made is regulators' penalties for illegal practices should be paid first out of the bonus pool for top executives.

So that you and every one of your top executives would have your bonuses at risk for any malfeasance in any corner of the organization rather than having the regulatory fines being taken largely out of the hides of shareholders.

So my question to you is, if everyone knew that the regulatory fines were to be paid out of the bonus pool, would that have helped change the corporate culture that led to these abuses?

STUMPF: You know, I can't speculate on that. I know that in my case, the Board is independent and the Board actually took my recommendation and - and -- and passed that. We filed a AK (ph) on that yesterday, and I'm going to do all I can to lead this company going forward.

FOSTER: And we all can speculate on what fraction of that compensation club act (ph) would have happened without the attention and the press and by Congress on this.

So I mean, for example, if you knew that the bonus pool would take a hit for any regulatory fines, wouldn't that actually create an incentive not to develop a bank which was effectively too big to manage?

STUMPF: First of all, I disagree we're too big to manage. We need to focus more on this issue, on operational issues and on compliance issues, but again, we do many, many areas really well and I'm sorry we didn't get everything right along the way, and we've made settlements.

We tried to make it right for customers. But recognizing also we're - we -- we do a lot of really good things, we're a great corporate citizen and 268,000 team members really try to get it right every day for all of our customers.

FOSTER: OK, well as we look for bipartisan solutions to try to prevent this sort of thing from happening, again, I find that a very interesting suggestion. And just a last quick question.

The -- many of the actions that were taken here hurt the credit scores which may -- of customers which made it difficult for them to buy mortgages. And are you specifically looking to find out if any of your customers have been denied mortgages because of actions you've taken?

STUMPF: We're going - we're going to dig into that and make it right.

FOSTER: We will. Thank you

HENSARLING: The time of the gentleman has expired. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Hampshire, Mr. Guinta.

Rep. Frank GUINTA (R., N.H.): Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Stumpf, for being here. I share in the frustration and the anger and the displeasure of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle relative to this particular issue.

I have listened over the course of this -- of your testimony, and there are a number of what I would consider inconsistencies either based on what you said today, what was in your oral testimony or what you had stated in the Senate hearing last week, so I want to clarify a few things.

In your oral statement you said that you made a recommendation to the Board that it takes certain actions regarding your salary and other pay.

STUMPF: That is - that is -- my testimony and that's accurate.

GUINTA: When did you make that recommendation?

STUMPF: I -- it was -- today is Thursday, it was sometime before -- the independent Board met without me, I don't recall. It might have been -- it was before or during the Board meeting. But I - but I referred -- I made comments about that to our lead director that I wanted to do that.

GUINTA: Are we talking about last week or this month?

STUMPF: No, last week.

GUINTA: Last week. Before or after the 20th?

STUMPF: What day is today?

GUINTA: 20th is Tuesday, today is the 29th.

STUMPF: It was sometime after -- it was sometime on the weekend, I believe, to the best of my recollection.

GUINTA: So it was after the Senate...

STUMPF: It was after the Senate hearing.

GUINTA: So before you had said to the Senate Banking Committee that you didn't want to prejudice the compensation committee where (ph) the Board process.

STUMPF: Correct.

GUINTA: Since the 20th, you did exactly that, so what's changed from the 20th to today, and the 29th?

STUMPF: I felt that it would not prejudice them - I didn't want to prejudice them, but I thought it was - and they can do more if they want to. They can - they have all the rights and responsibilities...

GUINTA: No, I understand that. What I don't - what I don't understand is on the 20th you said to the Senate you did not want to prejudice them and then four days later, the 24th, which is the Saturday over the weekend, you did a reverse course. So what happened between the 20th and the 24th for you to change your mind on that issue?

STUMPF: I decided that this was a good way to show at least a step - a start to show my level of - of commitment.

GUINTA: Why was that not important then before the 20th?

STUMPF: I was preparing for other things. It didn't cross my mind at that time, I -- I developed that thinking sometime over the weekend.

GUINTA: That's a pretty big compensation hit, right?

STUMPF: It - it was - it -again, it's - it's what I thought was right for me to do to recommend to the board at that time and - and -- and they can do more. They have all the independence and -- and I didn't believe that -- I thought that was the right thing for me to do.

GUINTA: what about the claw back of Ms. Volstead's pay, when did you make that recommendation?

STUMPF: That recommendation -- she does not report to me, that recommendation was made by her boss.

GUINTA: When were you aware of that recommendation?

STUMPF: I was aware of that sometime...

GUINTA: Before the 20th?

STUMPF: It was sometime over the weekend also, I believe -- I don't recall the exact days, maybe...

GUINTA: Was it before or (ph) after the 20th? STUMPF: Yes.

GUINTA: OK. I want to go to a different issue. Do you currently have sales goals at Wells Fargo today?

STUMPF: We have - they end at our regional bank tomorrow. Because - and the reason we didn't take them out before - we have - you know, the vast majority of our people do the exact right thing. We don't want to hurt them from a compensation perspective.

And we - and we thought we would do this, you know, and do it right and - and put other goals like customer loyalty and other things that customers really appreciate by January 1, we now know that we can do it by October 1. So we don't want to hurt them, and we also want to make sure our customers get treated well.

GUINTA: Let me move on to the CFPB. You've been asked several times how many employees of the CFPB were embedded at Wells Fargo and I think you said something to the effect that you will do your best to work with us, but you didn't say clearly whether you would actually provide us that number.

So I'm curious, would you provide us with that number when you - when you get it?

STUMPF: Again, I don't know that answer, I'll work with our team. The best I can do is promise you that I'll work - I'll consult my team.

GUINTA: I understand you don't know the number today. I'm saying when you work with your team to identify the number, will you then share it with Congress?

STUMPF: Again, I don't know if that's a confidential supervisory matter of (ph) information.

GUINTA: CFPB employees are public employees, aren't they or are they not?

STUMPF: I don't want to make a promise to you I can't keep. So I will promise that our team will look at it.

GUINTA: Speak with your leadership and try to get us something in writing as to whether you can provide us with that answer.

STUMPF: I will - I will - I will work with them as soon as -- one of things I said I'd get done.

GUINTA: Thank you sir.

HENSARLING: The time of the gentleman has expired. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Delaney.

Rep. John DELANEY (D., Md.): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, sir, for being here. A lot of focus has been on your cross-sells or your cross-sell culture at the institution. It's something that the institution has been very proud of, when you acquired Wachovia back in 2008, your former chairman, Dick Kovacevich, who I think was probably the architect of your cross-sell program, said "we're combining the industry's number one ranked customer service culture of Wachovia."

And I was a very substantial Wachovia customer in my prior life in business and I had nothing but a terrific experience.

STUMPF: Thank you.

DELANEY: With the industry's number one sales in cross-selling culture of Wells Fargo -- this is 2008.

Analyst reports across the last decade, we talk about the cross- sell culture of Wells Fargo, but several analysts -- analysts also pointed out there was risk inherent in this and in fact this culture might be undermining the customer experience, including a well-known banking analyst who said, "Wells Fargo suggests that a successful bank is one that keeps seeking new customers and selling as aggressively as possible more products to them and not getting bogged down in customer service."

So the question I have is, your board of directors -- because when you have a very large enterprise like you do, the governance process is incredibly important. Did the board of directors ever discuss at the board level whether the cross-sell culture had gotten out of control at the bank?

Because you were clearly outperforming did the board of your peers, and you were proud of that, and you bragged about it and you had a swagger about it, and the law of large numbers just leads us all to believe it's very hard to significantly outperform your peers particularly when they're very big and they're also sophisticated operators like your competitors are.

Did your board ever talk about this issue? Did they ever actually sit around and - and examine whether this culture had gotten out of control, particularly after four, five years of having to let go so many people?

STUMPF: You know I -- Congressman, I don't know all of the things that our board talks about because I'm not in all the meetings but I will say this, cross-sell is our shorthand for depth of relationship. We love that. When customers do more, they get more value, it helps everyone --

DELANEY: Right, but you also make more money when you cross cell. I mean there's two ways of looking at cross cell. It's either really good for you or it's really good for the customer depending upon whether they actually needed the product or not. I'm really getting at the board's responsibility because your board is responsible to make sure that your setting the right tone at the top.

STUMPF: Correct.

DELANEY: You're also responsible for that, I'll come back to that in a second. But the board is responsible for actually examining the business practices of the bank. So did your board -- you're the chairman of your board.

STUMPF: Correct.

DELANEY: So you may not be there -- they have executive session where they may ask you to leave. You're certainly not there when they discuss your compensation but for most of the meetings you're there.

You set the agenda, you probably sit in on most of the committee meetings. I chaired a public company board for many years. Did you ever -- did the board ever talk about whether the culture in retail banking business and all of the accolades you were receiving for your cross cell success?

And the fact that several analysts had focused on the fact that you were overly aggressive with respect to this, did they ever actually ask the question, should we look into this? Did they ever exercise their fiduciary responsibilities around this issue? In other words, ensuring that your customers were getting an appropriate service, which they obviously weren't?

STUMPF: Yes and yes, the answer is yes.

DELANEY: So you can get us evidence that the board actually has examined this issue across the last several years?

STUMPF: Yes, I can do that. DELANEY: Did you ever give speeches where you said it is as important to make sure we're putting our customers' interests first, as it is to achieve our cross cell objectives?

STUMPF: I don't recall. I give lot's of speeches but I always talk, when I'm with team members or out in the public, I try to talk about the fact that what's good for customers, good for us. And I think it's really important because you're asking some really good questions here, that the idea that somehow having customer have more products that they don't use helps us, is absolutely wrong.

(CROSSTALK)

DELANEY: If they pay for them, it helps you.

STUMPF: Virtually all of them are free.

(CROSSTALK)

DELANEY: Can you find any evidence to share with us where you actually said it is as important to make sure we put our customer's interest first as it is to achieve the sales goals we've set for this institution.

STUMPF: In fact I don't know -- I can't recall all my words but I do know this. Every time I talk about, it's about customers and putting them first.

DELANEY: Now your largest shareholder has a famous expression where he says, takes your whole life to build your reputation and you can lose it in five minutes. Do you think you and your institution have permanently lost its reputation?

STUMPF: We have a lot of work to do to build it back and I'm committed to do all I can to make that happen, thank you.

HENSARLING: Time of the gentleman has expired. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Williams.

Rep. Roger WILLIAMS (R., Texas): Thank you Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stumpf, just like many hardworking Americans and members of this committee, I am really angry and I also am a customer of your bank. But I am amazed at what you do not know about your business. I am really amazing and I have heard more I don't know's from a CEO than I think I've ever heard in my life.

You know I came to Congress to deregulate and because of your actions, it's really making it extremely difficult for me to advocate for Main Street or community banks. So I've got one simple question for you, when are you going to resign?

STUMPF: I serve at the pleasure of the board. I am giving them all my energy now to leading this company through this.

WILLIAMS: But you can resign without the board telling you but so -- I just wanted to know that answer. I'm also angry because by a large number of Wells Fargo employees who opened accounts for existing customers without their knowledge, which is pure wrong, it's just wrong, and I'm angry because Wells Fargo agreed to pay $190 million in collective fines and restitutions, which we talked about today.

You don't even have to admit any wrongdoing and I've got news for you. People don't care about your hurt. They care about their hurt and I'm tired of hearing about that today.

And I'm angry because under the Dodd-Frank Act, Wells Fargo would still be eligible for taxpayer funded bailout. And I'm angry because I'm a strong supporter of banks, both big and small, but today you really make it hard. What you've done has really hurt Main Street. And finally Mr. Stumpf, I'm angry because I own -- I'm a business owner.

I own a business right now. I'm a borrower, I've been in debt more than I've been out of debt in my life. For 44 years I've owned my business and it sickens me to think that you took advantage of customers in the manner that you've done. Customers are important, they don't make that many customers. And Mr. Chairman I have also learned, if I've learned anything over the last 44 years, it's two things.

The customer is always right and you've tried to teach us your business today. We don't need to hear that. And reputation, which we've already talked about, is all you have when you go to bed at night. And when you lose your reputation, you've got nothing.

And frankly, it's going to take Wells Fargo a long time before they can restore customer confidence in that reputation we're talking about. So let me start off with this, in the past I've been part of a banking board like many have in here.

Big banks, small banks. So I understand what that entails. I certainly understand the charge that is given to that board to make the bank successful but ultimately you answer to the shareholders.

But as we heard you discuss with the Senate Banking Committee and earlier today, top executives knew about the fraud under your watch in 2013. So again, as someone who has sat on a board, I find it troubling that no action would be taken at all. So we've established that no action was taken by you or your board in 2013.

But what about your outside auditors which we've talked about? Can you tell this committee again, and you've touched on a little bit, who they were and if you advised them of this two year old systematic fraud?

STUMPF: Yes, so I'll get to your question. Our outside auditor is KPMG, they do a wonderful job and this is on us. We should have done more earlier and there's no question about that and I don't in any way want to minimize whatever portion of those 2 million accounts were unauthorized. We take that seriously and they are the ones we put first.

WILLIAMS: So, let me move on. As CEO and chairman of the board at Wells Fargo, how often did you meet before the directors?

STUMPF: We have eight board meetings a year.

WILLIAMS: Did anyone on your board tell you to stop the incentive program, that they didn't like it, they didn't think it was good?

STUMPF: There is a committee of the board that is human resources and compensation and that's not chaired by me, I'm not a member of that committee.

WILLIAMS: So you don't know?

STUMPF: I do know that we have incentive programs and we have controls and we have so forth and I don't -- that's what I know about that committee and about our business.

WILLIAMS: Did anyone on the board raise any concerns with the incentive program?

STUMPF: There was people, as we start to understand this issue, the board took direct action to make sure that, along with management, we understood where the customer harm was and to make sure that the sales process -- that we did not have unethical behavior going on.

WILLIAMS: Running short of time, I'm from Texas.

STUMPF: I lived in Texas for six years.

WILLIAMS: How many people in Texas were affected by your mismanagement?

STUMPF: There were 149,857 accounts that we could not rule out as a possibility of being unauthorized.

WILLIAMS: Thank you Mr. Chairman, I yield back.

HENSARLING: Time of the gentleman has expired. Pursuant to Clause D4 of Committee Rule 3, the gentleman from Washington, Mr. Heck, will be recognized for an additional five minutes upon the conclusion of the time allotted to him under the five minute rule. The gentleman from Washington is recognized.

Rep. Denny HECK (D., Wash.): Thank you Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stumpf after sitting here patiently for nearly four hours, my takeaway frankly sir is that you are in denial. And I say that because I can't reconcile much of what you have said with the known fact pattern. You have said, I didn't know, in essence.

You have said a very small percentage of our dedicated workforce was actually engaged in this behavior. You've said you're sorry, in fact you're very sorry and you've said, we're going to fix it.

But the facts are that 5,300 of your employees were fired for inappropriate behavior and they were fired because they in effect, misappropriated millions of dollars in fees without the agreement of your customers. An act, which you yourself agreed with Congressman Duffy, constituted stealing. And all of this and the publicity surrounding it led to a $25 billion reduction in the market capitalization of your company.

HECK: I cannot reconcile what you said with those facts and conclude -- and I can therefore only that you are in denial. Some here, several, have said you should resign. Frankly, I don't personally see how you'd survive.

I don't know this but I too have been on a board of directors and it's virtually inconceivable to me that your board of directors would see fit to claw back $41 million in bonus and incentive pay without also concluding you're no longer the correct person to lead this organization. But the truth is it's not your survival that I am concerned about.

I'm concerned about your company, your bank, your institution, the 268,000 people that you employ and more importantly, the millions and millions of depositors. I'm more concerned about the trust level in Wells Fargo and in the financial sector. Banks and credit unions.

Because it is in fact, vital and the heart beat of a market-based and capitalist economy and I'm very concerned about what you and the company have done in the way of damage to that.

I'm not going to suggest that you resign. I don't think it'd do any good because I think you are in denial, but I am going to remind you of some things that you have said. I know right from wrong. I try to lead with courage. I'm going to make it right. You also said that you feel privileged to lead Wells Fargo, and on that sir, I'm going to take you at your word.

And so my hope, my request, and this is not a question. In fact I would suggest that it's beyond a hope, it's a prayer. That in the quiet and solitude of your home and in discussions with your family, you ask yourself, what's in the best interest of Wells Fargo?

What's in the best interest of Wells Fargo, sir? Not you. I do have a quick question. I think some other people have noted that it looks like you're repeating some mistakes and the facts of this case, falsified applications, consumers being pushed in products they don't want and all driven by aggressive sales goals are almost identical to your practices that led to a record fine against you in 2011.

In fact, in 2012, you paid violations for violating the Service Member Civil Relief Act for foreclosure of homes in violation of federal law. I privilege beyond measure to represent 20,000 uniformed personnel at Joint Base Lewis-McChord.

You're under investigation again sir, for violating the Service Member Civil Relief Act. For foreclosing on cars, also prohibited. We don't want men and women in uniform worrying about that when they're putting their life in harms way.

And I'm going to predict. I'm going to predict you're going to pay another fine for violation of SCRA in the millions of dollars. So rather than ask a question, I'll just say, this pattern just keeps repeating itself. You pay a fine, you promise to fix it and then lo and behold, a few years later, we're back at it, the same thing again. And with that, Mr. Chair, I would like to yield the balance of my time to the ranking member from California.

WATERS: Thank you very much Mr. Heck for yielding this time to me. As you know, as ranking member, I have the responsibility for some kind of leadership here and I'm very pleased that I was able to work with the chair of this committee, Mr. Hensarling, today to get this hearing.

But as I have sat here recognizing the size of Wells Fargo, $1.9 trillion in assets, with over 6,200 bank branches, 268,000 employees, it's really striking me how huge this bank is.

I'm also concerned about whether or not, as chairman and CEO, you can really know what is going on at the bank. I am concerned about the length of time it took you to know what's going on and I'm concerned that maybe you don't have a handle on your management and what the reporting process is that would make you aware of what's going on.

You praised Ms. Tolstedt for her management of the division even though she had fired 1,000 employees for this fraud in 2011 and yet supposedly it took you two years to know about what had happened.

She didn't tell you, she withheld the information and you indicated in her glowing (ph) retirement that she had gone a great job.

I'm really concerned about whether or not, in fact you understand that we have been sitting here fighting to implement Dodd-Frank and trying to work out some of the problems that have been identified with Dodd-Drank but you on the board of directors of the Financial Services Roundtable, it's an advocacy group for the banking industry that has worked to defund the CFPB, hobble its structure and remove its ability to curb abusive practices.

Now I want to know, perhaps what you think, now that Wells Fargo has been caught by the CFPB for all of this fraud and I wonder if you denounce the Financial Services Roundtable's actions to gut the CFPB.

In addition to that, while we have been sitting here, I have learned that maybe not only is Wells Fargo too huge to manage, but maybe the reason you don't know some of the detail is because you also sit on a number of big boards. You're sitting on the board of Chevron with $375,000 in total compensation per year.

And you're on the board of Target Corporation for $272,000 in total compensation per year. You have a responsibility to them, you have a fiduciary responsibility and in addition to that, during this hearing, Bloomberg sent out an alert that you would be facing a $20 million penalty for improperly repossessing cars from members of the military.

It appears that the company just can't make it through even this Congressional hearing without us learning more and more information about what is going on at Wells Fargo.

I appreciate your apology. I appreciate the claw back and all of that, but Mr. Chairman, and members who are left, I have come to the conclusion that Wells Fargo should be broken up. It's too big to manage. You know I served on the conference committee for Dodd-Frank.

We talked a lot about the living wills and how to learn more about how these banks are put together and how they operate. And of course the five largest banks in this country have failed the living will's test, including Wells Fargo.

And so I'm looking at living wills and the inability to pass the test. I'm looking at stress testing, I'm looking at size, I'm looking at this particular fraud that has gone on and I'm worried for the whole banking community that the public cannot and will not continue to trust our banks, who we need in this economy in order to do the business to make the economy work and run.

But they're looking at us and they're saying for all of you, particular those of you who serve on the Financial Services Committee, you're letting us down.

You're not protecting us. And so with that, Mr. Chairman, I'm going to be talking with you and the members of this committee who showed their outrage here today. I'm moving forward to break up Wells Fargo bank.

STUMPF: May I respond to that please?

HENSARLING: We'll give the witness an opportunity to respond.

STUMPF: As I said before, I'm sorry that we didn't get this right. I take this very seriously. I'm not in denial and we will get this right. We will fix this. We do a lot of things really great. California is our home state. We've been for 164 years, we are a major employer, a major philanthropic and we are privileged to serve so many great customers there and we'll do that the best way possible.

HENSARLING: Time of the gentleman from Washington has expired. Pursuant to Clause D4 the Committee Rule 3, the gentleman from Arkansas, Mr. Hill will be recognized for an additional five minutes upon the conclusion of the time allotted to him under the five minute rule. Gentleman from Arkansas.

Rep. French HILL (R., Ark.): Thank you Mr. Chairman. Thank the ranking member for holding this hearing. Mr. Stumpf thank you for being willing to appear today. Appreciate your forthright testimony.

You know I've been a customer of your company and I've admired your company and I have used your company as an example for my own businesses in the past 20 years in developing what I thought were best practices and goal setting for retail bankers across the businesses that I was associated with in the 1990's and the 2000's.HILL: And during that period of what's happened recently, I've recommended your company as a company to do business with and a stock to own so that comes with a pretty heavy burden for me. I have the same knot in my stomach that you probably have.

Because in my view as a former person who has worked in finance on and off for 35 years, this just isn't a one off situation down in the Los Angeles Basin that Wells Fargo is struggling with. It really is a systemic, a compliance failure inside the, I assume, principally the retail portion of the bank.

And I know that it's a huge frustration for those of us on this committee and for your members of your board and your management team and very hurtful to the customers that have been damaged by their reputations, their credit potentially, including the 933 people in Arkansas that have been affected by this, that resulted in four people who apparently worked for you in Arkansas that were fired as a part of the sweep across your company.

So you told us today about line management between you and the branch manager, many layers, branch managers, regional managers, area managers that were forwarded up, I assume, to Carrie Tolstedt who's been discussed today. Is that generally right?

STUMPF: Yes. There's a new leader now in that retail banking business, her name is Mary Mack, and they have -- and she's now in charge of that organization.

HILL: And did Carrie report to Tim Sloan or report to you?

STUMPF: She reported to me until maybe about a year ago or so, I don't recall the exact date but then she reported to Mr. Sloan after that.

HILL: And the credit card issue, I assume, doesn't report to her. Does that report to the consumer lending executive or to the community bank?

STUMPF: That's -- that -- the -- there's a relationship that reports in someplace else.

HILL: Okay.

STUMPF: That's right.

HILL: So it's matrix management to the retail side but through the consumer lending channels where credit cards --

STUMPF: Yeah. I would describe it this way, that the retail bank would talk to customers and then they would send their request over to the credit card group where they would the underwriting and fulfillment.

HILL: And all those people that I named all sat on your operating committee of management. And how often does that group meet and is it by teleconference or is it face to face?

STUMPF: It's largely face to face, it's every Monday.

HILL: Every Monday. And so, unrelated to the board, which is board's meet just -- I think you said nine -- in 2015, you had nine meetings with the board, you had -

STUMPF: I thought it was eight, but it might have been nine but -

HILL: Yeah. And you had 14 meetings at the audit committee during 2015, according to your proxy.

But operating committee meets every Mondays, so the one question I have is, when was -- do you remember this being talked about at that operating level when line managers bring their top concerns to you and was it in this same time frame, it wasn't until maybe two years after this really manifesting itself in Los Angeles?

STUMPF: Yeah, it was being managed within the business.

HILL: Yeah.

STUMPF: In 2011, it -- there's -- each business has their own corporate or their own compliance, their own sales efficacy and so forth. So it was brought out of the sales part into the line's control function.

And then by 2012, they were producing goals. By 2013, is where we brought the corporate resources in, like corporate human resources, corporate investigations and so forth because we had saw a spike in that behavior.

HILL: Right. So now, your Lead Director, Steve Sanger, is the former CEO of General Mills is conducting an independent investigation that he is hired independent of the corporation, he's hired his own resources. It's -- and that's commenced recently. Is that right?

STUMPF: As I understand it, the -- Steve Sanger is our lead director along with the other independent directors have higher council and they are doing their investigation.

HILL: When do you expect they'll finish their work?

STUMPF: I'm not part of that process. So I don't know. But I know they're going to do a full comprehensive review. HILL: I hope that that gets released to the public once the board has seen it and reviewed it and that it could be posted on your website because I think that sort of independent view news confidence in the corporate government system and I would encourage that to be done.

You know, when I was at the Treasury Department in 1990,  91, we had a little problem in the government securities business and your largest shareholder, Mr. Buffett, became the CEO of Solomon Brothers in that midst of that crisis and Solomon Brothers was found guilty of manipulating the US treasury market at that time.

Have you talked with Mr. Buffett about this or sought his advice on this matter you're facing?

STUMPF: You know, I have talked to a lot of our investors and I have had one conversation with Warren Buffett.

HILL: Because Warren Buffett in two minutes before the Senate Banking Committee in 1991 probably did the best job, I think, on behalf of Corporate America. Do you remember what he said at that time?

STUMPF: I've read a lot of his things. I think it was something about, you know, I better make less money and about integrity and -- but go ahead and read it to me. I don't remember that testimony.

HILL: Well, I'm going to paraphrase it. He said -- first of all, he wanted every employee to be their own compliance officer, his or her own compliance officer, and he wanted every employee, every day when they came to work to think about the actions they took on behalf of customers if they could read that in their own hometown newspaper written by a critical journalist.

But he summarized it, and what I think you need to summarize if you're going to be successful in this endeavor, he made this quote, which I think people have quoted now for 25 years, "Lose money for the firm and I will be understanding. Lose a shred of reputation for the firm and I will be ruthless."

STUMPF: Yeah, that's what I was trying to refer to and that's what I remember from that and I agree with him.

HILL: Well, that's where we are because I agree with my colleagues, this is hurting the ability of the banking industry to do consultative selling, something that we all pride ourselves on in financial services is that we seek to understand the needs of our customers and try to meet them.

And this damage about what's happened at Wells Fargo is going to hurt that effort on behalf of community banks all over this country and cause sweep investigation of incentive sales programs and cross selling programs. We're consultative selling, which is really what we're talking about.

But I hope that we will also ask our regulators where they were at this time. The OCC clearly had a need to improve rating for you and compliance and some intensive work you were doing over those two years, but I see no evidence so far at the CFPB which actually is the statutory obligation to be engaged here was taking action.

So the last thing I'll ask you about is Mr. Himes talked about materiality. And in any one quarter, accountants and lawyers and bean counters in companies in your finance department tell what's material and what's not.

But we see that sometimes that trees for the forest in that situation and you've got the ability and your board has that ability to address that in the chairman's letter to your shareholders, you don't need a lawyer to tell you what to write in your chairman's letter, and when you spend 50 percent in fines and penalties of your net income over a three, four, five-year period, that's material, 10 billion compared to 22 billion. It's a big deal.

No matter how many small bites at the apple that it comes, and I hope in your 2016 letter to shareholders, that you and your lead Director, Mr. Sanger, will address what I think is a systemic failure in a few areas of Wells Fargo that's tarnished this beautiful three -- almost two century reputation of your country -- of your company.

And with that, I yield the balance of my time to Mr. Guinta, from New Hampshire.

GUINTA: Thank you gentleman from Arkansas. Mr. Stumpf, I want to follow up a little bit on the regulators. OCC, how many onsite did they have at the time?

STUMPF: I didn't hear the question. Please -

GUINTA: OCC. OCC, how many examiners did they have in -- at Wells Fargo at the time?

STUMPF: I think -- just about earlier, I think it's around 80.

GUINTA: Okay. And how many do they have at Wells Fargo today?

STUMPF: I don't have that number, but I think it's about the same number.

GUINTA: The same number?

STUMPF: Yes.

GUINTA: How about the Federal Reserve?

STUMPF: I don't know that number.

GUINTA: And how about the CFPB today?

STUMPF: I don't know that number.

GUINTA: Did anyone at the CFPB instructs you or your team or advice you not to share those numbers with Congress?

STUMPF: I have not spoken with the CFPB on that.

GUINTA: Is anyone in your team, to your knowledge?

STUMPF: Nobody in my team has said anything to me about not sharing any numbers.

GUINTA: I asked that because -

STUMPF: I'm not as sure.

GUINTA: I asked that because it seem -- you seem very reluctant to share the information with us as to how many examiners from CFPB either were or are currently at Wells Fargo and that concerns me.

STUMPF: I want to make sure I'm very clear at this. I happen to know the OCC number because I was talking to some (inaudible) but I don't know the other ones.

HENSARLING: The time of the gentleman from Arkansas has expired. Now, the gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Tipton is recognized.

TIPTON: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stumpf, I have a letter from someone who's never had an account with Wells Fargo, had an account fraudulently opened and was getting sent back from your compliance department, the Wells Fargo Financial Crimes manager, telling someone who wasn't your client that he needed to be able to provide a complete signed notarized return affidavit of identity theft, provide documentation, collection letters he may have received, request the letter of verification for Social Security number from this Social Security administration, send a copy of a police report stating he was a victim of identity fraud, send a copy of his driver's license, send proof of address, send a copy of previous bills, statements, invoices during the time frame of fraud.

He didn't even have an account with you. Isn't that a little burdensome and what are you doing to be able to respond to people who had no connection with Wells Fargo but yet are now swept up in the net of the challenges that your organization is creating?

STUMPF: Yeah. And so on that issue, I would like to see it so our people could take a look at it. I don't know that issue specifically but that sounds to me a lot like identity theft by someone else.

Most of what we saw, and I can't say exclusively, but of the 2 million accounts that could not be excluded, those were accounts that people already had at the bank and one of your bankers improperly opened a second account that our system closed.

So I -- this sounds a lot like identify theft to me, but I don't know that situation in particular. I'd like to look at it.

TIPTON: I'd like to be able to get a little personal assessment by you of you.

STUMPF: Okay.

TIPTON: Would you label yourself as CEO, Chairman of Wells Fargo as aware and engaged?

STUMPF: Well, I believe I am. I love this company. I've been here a long time and I spend most of my waking hours thinking about this company.

Rep. Scott TIPTON (R., Colo.): So you know, I'd like to be able to follow up a little bit, maybe I (inaudible) in regards to the board. You said you think about a lot, all of your waking hours, when did you make the broad aware of the issues?

STUMPF: The board was made aware, generally, of issues by -- in committees, at high levels in the 2011,  12 time frame. By 2013, we had talked about maybe in one -- I can't remember which committee it was, surely by 2014, and then when we finally connected the dots on customer harm (ph) in  15, the board was very active on this.

TIPTON: So you discovered in 2013, you were aware, you were engaged, we are now in 2016 and now rapidly starting to respond. You know, there seems to be a little bit of a disconnect in terms of the response mechanism that you're having there.

Mr. Hill had just brought up and you gave a response saying that you had a sense of urgency. Who have you fired?

STUMPF: As I mentioned, we fired managers, managers -- manager, managers and another manager and we're doing a full review of anybody who was responsible for any behavior of any kind that would not put customers first.

TIPTON: So you're -- are you trying to be able to say really that these were just kind of lone wolfs acting independently or were they following policies that came from the engaged urgent manager who is the CEO and chairman of Wells Fargo?

STUMPF: These -- they were doing exactly the opposite of what a CEO wanted them to do. Everything I've talked about, everything that we train, everything that we publish -

TIPTON: So do you have a problem with monitoring from the top down?

STUMPF: We should have done it more early. It was our monitoring that found this behavior. We should have done more sooner. I give you that, Congressman.

TIPTON: What -- all right. You have an infrastructure that is set up, a chain of command in terms of your organization chart. Somebody was overseeing the manager over the manager over the -- however you -

STUMPF: Yes.

TIPTON: -- want to be able to describe that. Are there going to be any consequences of that level?

STUMPF: We're going to let the facts take us where they are and people will be held accountable. I can (inaudible) that.

TIPTON: Do you have any kind of time frame for that?

STUMPF: You know, I don't want to make -- you know, foreclose anything that we do to make sure we do it right and people are held accountable.

TIPTON: You know, there was a report that came out at Wall Street Journal that said the person in charge of creating the yearly sales claim for the community banking unit didn't know that the numbers were exaggerated. Can you identify exactly though when you're looking at this, where the breakdown did first start?

STUMPF: You know, I don't -- I didn't read that article. I don't know what that's referring to but I know that a lot of us, including myself, should have done more earlier.

TIPTON: Thank you. Mr. Chairman, my time is up. I yield back.

HENSARLING: Gentleman yields back. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Maine, Mr. Poliquin.

Rep. Bruce POLIQUIN (R., Maine): Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Appreciate it very much. Mr. Stumpf, you're the CEO and the chairman of the board of Wells Fargo. Is that correct?

STUMPF: That is correct.

POLIQUIN: How long have you had that position?

STUMPF: I was named CEO in December of 2007 and I was -

POLIQUIN: Okay. So -

STUMPF: -- named chairman in -

POLIQUIN: Right.

STUMPF: -- okay, beginning of 2010.

POLIQUIN: Okay. So six, eight, nine years in that -

STUMPF: Yes.

POLIQUIN: -- roughly in that position. How long have you been at the bank?

STUMPF: I've been at the bank -- it'll be 35 years in -

POLIQUIN: Okay. So you've been at the bank a long time and one could conclude, and I think you would agree with me, is you know the bank pretty well.

STUMPF: I -

POLIQUIN: Yeah.

STUMPF: -- love this company.

POLIQUIN: Okay.

STUMPF: Yes.

POLIQUIN: You know what really bothers me, Mr. Stumpf, along with other things, is it I'm looking at this pattern of you folks ripping off your customers, getting caught, paying a fine and going the damn thing all over again.

Now, we just had on the board a minute ago 13 instances of this in the last six years and you paid a total of $11 billion in settlement fines. Now, you just stood here before us and told us several times you know the difference between right and wrong.

You're the head banana over there. I look at you I look at Wells Fargo. I know it's a big organization, 268,000 employees, 268,000 jobs. Thank you for that, sir.

But you know something, I don't think management, which means you, knows the difference between right and wrong. And I'll you who does, the people I represent, Maine. I represent 650,000 of the most honest hardworking people you can ever find anywhere. They know the difference between right and wrong.

And one thing I want to just throw out in your lap right now, be very clear, I don't know where this is going but I will not support in any way, shape or form any kind of bailout using tax payer money for Wells Fargo. You're going to get through me, through a lot of other people on this committee.

Now, here's what I worry about. I don't worry about Wells Fargo. You have 268,000 employees. How many attorneys you got over there?

STUMPF: I don't have that number.

POLIQUIN: Okay. You have more than ten?

STUMPF: Yes.

POLIQUIN: You have more than a thousand?

STUMPF: I don't know. I don't think so.

POLIQUIN: Okay. You get a lot of attorneys, right?

STUMPF: Yes.

POLIQUIN: I don't worry about you folks. Somehow, someway, you're going to make your way through this. You know who I worry about? I worry about our 31 community banks, local banks in the district that I represent. Highly (inaudible), Mr. Stumpf. Thirty- one community banks, 500 branches, 9,200 employees.

Good paychecks, good jobs with good benefits. We also have 58 credit unions with 196 branches and 2,250 employees. These folks are relied upon in their communities. They take their paychecks and they trust the teller and they trust the bank manager. But you know what happens? Is when this happens, it flows downhill.

And that's exactly what happened in the fiscal -- excuse me, financial meltdown seven, eight years ago.

Is that all of a sudden because of a handful of -- a small handful of big money center banks that took too much risk with the problem with the regulators, I understand this, everyone was comfortable, but all of a sudden we have this very smothering set of financial regulations that are choking off home loans, mortgages to the folks of my district, they can't get a small business going to put it in diesel in large (inaudible). Now, you come along.

I don't know where this is going to go but I will tell you this, the probability will be high that your organization and the actions of you in your organization, this systemic pattern of misbehavior and gross mismanagement and it looks like fraud is going to find its way to the community banks and the folks that rely on them in Rural Maine.

You ought to be ashamed of yourself. What do you tell a family -- so what do you tell a family that is -- that was looking to add their fourth child to their family and then you (inaudible) put a new bathroom on their house in Ellsworth, Maine and they can't get along because of the regulations and now it's going to get worse? What do you tell them?

STUMPF: Senator, I'm -

POLIQUIN: Congressman.

STUMPF: Congressman -

POLIQUIN: You're asleep over there.

STUMPF: I am so sorry, Congressman. There -- I'm sorry for what we've done. Our people also live and work in these neighborhoods, in these communities and we're trying to do the right thing. I can't -

POLIQUIN: You should have been trying to do the right thing, Mr. Stumpf, during these 13 settlements, fines, call them what you want, over six years totaling $11 billion. That's the pattern that I see.

STUMPF: Well, there's no question that we've had a lot of settlements. And that everyone we've learned from and we're trying to do a better job. Thank you much.

HENSARLING: The time of the gentleman has expired. There are no members in the queue. I wish to thank our witness for his testimony today. Without objection, all members will have five legislative days within which to submit additional written questions for the witness to the chair which would be forwarded to the witness for his response. Mr. Stumpf, we will expect you and your organization to respond promptly and to fully cooperate with our ongoing investigation.

Without objection, all members will have five legislative days within which to submit extraneous materials to the chair for inclusion in the record.

This hearing stands adjourned.

Amid diminishing returns from an unprecedented era of easy-money policy, some economists feared the shift in lending from banks to other financial institutions such as insurers, pension funds and asset managers may have blunted central banks' efforts. On the contrary, "http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/gfsr/2016/02/index.htm" in a new report. "The increasing importance of nonbanks for financial intermediation has, if anything, strengthened monetary policy transmission over the past 15 years," the fund says in an analytical chapter of its semi-annual Global Financial Stability Report. "The potency of monetary policy appears to have risen in various countries and seems to be, on average, stronger in countries with larger nonbank financial sectors."

The multimillion dollar clawbacks from executives' compensation at Wells Fargo & Co. and the $185 million fine levied by watchdog agencies fall short of proper punishment, "https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2016/09/29/wells-fargo-still-getting-off-too-easy/lwZjia0gOmaK2L33ybSNnI/story.html". The Wells Fargo board cleared the clawbacks after public pressure and political outrage against sales practices that led bank to employees open some two million unauthorized accounts. "The punishment may sound sufficiently severe, but it doesn't fit the scope of widespread wrongdoing that was scarily similar to the banking industry's bad behavior preceding the 2008 financial crisis," the newspaper says.

Wells Fargo Complicates GOP Calls for Deregulation

For Republicans eager to use their congressional majorities to unwind postcrisis financial regulations, the Wells Fargo scandal has come as a major disappointment.

"I came to Congress to deregulate, and because of your actions it's really making it extremely difficult," Rep. Roger Williams (R., Texas) told Wells Fargo & Co. Chief Executive John Stumpf at a "http://www.wsj.com/articles/lawmakers-take-more-swings-at-wells-fargo-ceo-john-stumpf-1475171906" on Capitol Hill on Thursday.

Other lawmakers echoed Mr. Williams's grievances. Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R., S.C.), one of the most conservative members of Congress, said the bank's actions "essentially validate" the criticisms that Democrats make about the financial system and added he worried that they would use the scandal to "bang the drum for more regulation."

Mr. Stumpf's appearance before the House Financial Services Committee, much like "http://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-ceo-testifies-before-senate-banking-committee-1474390303"of the CEO by a Senate panel, brought out a strikingly bipartisan display of anger over the bank's "http://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-to-pay-185-million-fine-over-account-openings-1473352548". But for Republicans the scandal comes at a particularly awkward time. At the urging of Speaker Paul Ryan, the House GOP has been working on plans to roll back Obama administration policies and replace them with Republican alternatives. Earlier this month, the Financial Services Committee passed one of those plans, Chairman Jeb Hensarling's answer to the 2010 Dodd-Frank regulatory-overhaul law, called the Financial Choice Act.

Mr. Hensarling, for his part, dished out plenty of blame not only to Wells Fargo but to the regulators who settled with the bank. The Texas Republican questioned why it had taken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, one of the regulators involved in the investigation, so long to take action. (Questions remain about "http://www.wsj.com/articles/political-fight-over-cfpb-heats-up-after-wells-fargo-scandal-1474582741" and how they interacted with each other and with Wells Fargo.)

"If they were accountable to the people, maybe they wouldn't have waited so long to investigate this matter in the first place," Mr. Hensarling told The Wall Street Journal in an interview after the hearing. He said it wasn't clear yet whether regulators deserved a "pat on the back" for their work, or a "swift kick in the backside" for not acting sooner.

Mr. Hensarling's legislation would transform the CFPB into a five-member commission rather than an entity led by a single director, a structure that Republicans frequently criticize as the "definition of tyranny."

But for the Democrats, the Wells Fargo scandal has put a new spring in their step to defend postcrisis regulations and in some cases, to go further.

Rep. Maxine Waters of California, the committee's top Democrat, told the hearing she had come to the conclusion that Wells Fargo should be broken up. She later clarified that she hadn't started working on any legislation to that effect.

Given the deep divisions in Congress virtually guaranteed to remain after the November election neither Mr. Hensarling's bill nor Ms. Waters's idea stands much of a chance of becoming law. But there's no doubt the Wells Fargo scandal has tipped the scales in favor of keeping a close eye on banks.

Lawmakers Take More Swings at Wells Fargo CEO

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/lawmakers-take-more-swings-at-wells-fargo-ceo-john-stumpf-1475171906"John Stumpf struggled to mount a defense Thursday in the face of repeated attacks over the bank's sales practices from Democratic and Republican members of the House Financial Services Committee.

In his second Capitol Hill appearance in as many weeks, Mr. Stumpf again expressed regret for his company's actions and said Wells Fargo's board was working to investigate how problems with sham accounts and unauthorized meddling in customer business snowballed over five years.

IBM to Buy Promontory Financial Group

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-plans-to-buy-promontory-financial-group-1475161201", one of the best-connected and most powerful financial consultancies, is selling out. The Washington-based firm has agreed to be bought by International Business Machines Corp., which plans to set up a new unit combining Promontory's consultants with its own artificial-intelligence technology to advise clients on financial regulation.

Privately held Promontory was founded in 2001 by Eugene Ludwig, a former U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, and has hired a small army of former senior regulators and government officials.

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-financial-policy-makers-rap-basels-bank-safety-plan-as-too-burdensome-1475177658" about new global bank-safety rules have found allies in two of Europe's top financial policy makers, who echoed their complaints that the plans would impose costly new burdens on banks' finances.

Andrea Enria, chairman of the European Banking Authority, said new rules issued this year by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision "excessively altered" requirements in ways that are "not justified," and "that's a balance which is, for me, not acceptable." And Valdis Dombrovskis, Europe's financial-services chief, said he felt some of the Basel changes could put Europe's banks at a competitive disadvantage, and the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, wouldn't support such changes. Mr. Dombrovskis's comments were his first explicit criticism of the Basel plan since he took his position in July.

Deutsche Bank Clients Take Steps to Cut Exposure

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/deutsche-bank-clients-take-steps-to-cut-exposure-1475179586" of Deutsche Bank AG are increasingly concerned about their exposure to the German lender, prompting them to pull assets and bank executives to step up their broader reassurances about the bank's stability, according to people close to clients and the bank.

Deutsche Bank has been under pressure all year, the epicenter of continent-wide worries about European banks' performance and resilience in the face of a weak economy, low interest rates and flagging business. The concerns picked up two weeks ago when The Wall Street Journal reported that the U.S. Justice Department floated the idea of Deutsche Bank paying $14 billion to settle a series of high-profile mortgage-securities cases. The bank responded by saying it had no intention to pay "anywhere near" that amount, and said its negotiations with the Justice Department were just starting.

R.I.P.: Japanese Bank Tower That Embodied Nation's Industrial Might; Building that housed lender at heart of Japan's economic rise to be felled years after it fell victim to global forces

TOKYO A bank tower that once stood at the center of Japan's postwar industrial power will start to be demolished Saturday, one of several boom-era structures being torn down against the will of architectural preservationists.

The Industrial Bank of Japan opened its headquarters in 1974 in the heart of Tokyo's financial district and overlooking the Imperial Palace, a symbol of another bygone era overtaken by global forces.

The bulk of the building, constructed with South Dakota granite, spoke to the bank's role in the economy of an industrial powerhouse that exported steel and ships globally and was studded with monopolies in rail, telecommunications and electric power. The bank financed the biggest companies and their grandest plans.

But Japan's economic woes in the 1990s and changes in finance ended its rationale. And on Saturday, its last remnants will begin to come down.

As a company, IBJ itself is long gone, swallowed up in a three-way merger completed in the 2000s. Many of its former clients shrank, its brightest banking stars gone.

Tokyo is tearing down other remaining architectural landmarks that symbolized the industrial boom of the 1960s and 1970s. Hotel Okura Co. last year demolished the 1962 main building of its flagship hotel over the protests of some Western architecture lovers who admired its jet set-era lobby with Japanese motifs such as shoji paper windows. A taller hotel will replace it.

Japanese law protects ancient landmarks like temples, but puts few restrictions on demolishing postwar landmarks.

"They're like a species of bird in danger of extinction," said Hiroshi Matsukuma, a professor at the Kyoto Institute of Technology who specializes in postwar architecture. "It's really unfortunate that they can be destroyed so easily."

Mizuho Financial Group Inc., the company that absorbed IBJ, says it would have cost hundreds of millions of dollars to bring the 15-floor building up to modern standards. It is planning a 29-story tower on the site.

The building was among the final works of Togo Murano, one of Japan's most distinguished architects for decades until his 1984 death, although he was little-known abroad. Mr. Murano had visited Manhattan's CBS Building after it opened in 1965 and admired the dark granite triangular columns that give it a heavier feeling than all-glass towers, Prof. Matsukuma said.

Not everyone was a fan. Hironori Aoi, a Mizuho manager who is leading the demolition project, said when he began working in the IBJ building as a freshman banker in 1988 he found it "old and gloomy." A 1990s renovation raised the floors to add wiring, making the space even more oppressive, he said.

Still, nostalgia surrounding the building is bubbling up ahead of its demolition.

Former IBJ employees have stopped by in recent weeks to pay final respects. Four women who worked on the ninth floor in the 1970s and  80s recalled how male colleagues would take them to expensive Japanese restaurants or discos.

"It's a shame," said one of those women, 54-year-old Kiko Kawamori. "Compared with foreign countries, we tend to rush ahead and construct new buildings. I wish we also valued old things.''

A pasta restaurant across the street has enjoyed brisk business with a $65 dinner special for former IBJ employees to gaze out the window at their former workplace, said Jun Kawai, a restaurant executive there who used to work at the bank. A memorabilia company is taking pre-orders for commemorative chunks of the South Dakota granite to be preserved after the demolition, starting at $70 a pop.

Even Mizuho's Mr. Aoi, despite his dour assessment of the building's interior, said he felt nostalgic for it and has been besieged with commiserating phone calls from other former employees there.

Mr. Kawai, the restaurant executive, said that when he began working at the bank in 1987 people felt a sense of pride about leading the big projects that would shape Japan's economic future.

The bank's longtime leader, Sohei Nakayama, was almost mythical in his stature, helping to create Nippon Steel and other industrial giants. Special regulations protected the bank by ensuring it could lend long-term funds at a profit.

By the 1990s, the rules changed, and IBJ was saddled with huge bad loans from the 1980s real estate bubble. "We struggled to raise funds," recalled Mr. Kawai. "It inevitably dealt a big blow to profitability."

Talented IBJ bankers left to form new ventures. One of them, Hiroshi Mikitani, founded Japan's biggest internet retailer, Rakuten Inc. Heavy industry moved abroad to China and South Korea. Today, Nippon Steel's successor doesn't even rank in Japan's top 40 companies by market capitalization. Mizuho's fortunes are less tied to industry; its latest venture involves using artificial intelligence to make consumer loans.

Yet a wistfulness remains for the old bank building, once known as the IBJ battleship.

"It created the image of a bank with true gravitas, one with a long history," said Prof. Matsukuma.

Japan rethinks GDP data on accuracy fears; Official statistics

BoJ report suggests growth was greatly underestimated in 2014

Japan has begun a revamp of its gross domestic product numbers because of rising concern about their accuracy, following a Bank of Japan report that suggests a huge understatement of growth in 2014.

An official Cabinet Office study group met for the first time yesterday, and separate groups in other ministries are examining the figures, amid fears that data problems could affect economic policymaking.

The overhaul highlights growing issues with GDP data around the world because of declining response rates to official surveys. Unreliable numbers leave central banks and finance ministries flying blind as they try to set economic policy.

"My feeling is the official data are getting worse and worse," says one Japanese policymaker who uses the GDP figures. "We have to rely more and more on qualitative data in order to assess the business cycle."

According to an experimental index prepared by the BoJ, Japan's economy expanded by 2.4 per cent in 2014, rather than falling by 0.9 per cent as the official data showed.

The official figures suggest Japan's economy was hit hard by an 8 per cent rise in consumption tax that year, prompting a fall into recession , which helped to damp both wage demands and corporate investment plans for the following year. But the alternative numbers suggest that recession never happened.

BoJ economists grew concerned because the official GDP figures showed that households had spent more than they saved and the operating surplus of companies had fallen. That clashed with other data suggesting more cash in consumer bank accounts, rising tax revenue and record corporate profits.

Using comprehensive data from tax returns, instead of the surveys underlying the official GDP numbers, BoJ economists calculated an independent figure for gross domestic income - adding up all the earnings in the economy, which should, in theory, be identical to GDP.

Those estimates suggest that, not only did the economy grow, but real output was significantly higher at 556tn compared with 525tn in the official figures for 2014.

"It's hard to say whether the Bank of Japan estimate is right or the official data are right or whether they're both wrong," says Tsutomu Watanabe, professor of economics at the University of Tokyo, and a member of the cabinet office group looking at reform. "But the wide gap certainly makes things very difficult for policymakers."

There are several theories to explain the gulf in the figures. One is that young companies are not answering the official economic census, so those growing fastest are missed by the GDP numbers, but covered when they file their tax returns.

Another possibility is that companies misreported their sales in 2014, using the old consumption tax rate of 5 per cent rather than the new figure of 8 per cent, the numbers downwards for that year.

But the explanation almost certainly rests with a single underlying problem: fewer and fewer people willing to answer official surveys.

The central bank has identified a separate issue with Japan's household survey, which struggles to sample young dual-income households. That affects both inflation numbers and the consumption data that is part of GDP.

"The BoJ estimate uses tax data and its certainly more comprehensive than the GDP sampling. But it takes a year to become available," says Yoshimasa Hayashi, a member of parliament who is leading a separate project within the ruling Liberal Democratic party to propose improvements to Japan's economic data.

Mr Hayashi says he wants to see efforts to use "big data" and new technology to try to capture economic numbers directly, instead of relying so heavily on surveys. His LDP group will also look at changes to the GDP standards themselves, to better capture the growing services sector.

Promontory Financial Group Signs Up With IBM; Promontory's expertise combined with Watson, IBM's artificial intelligence  computer system, would help banks meet ever-rising regulatory expectations

Promontory Financial Group, one of the best-connected and most powerful financial consultancies, is selling out.

The Washington-based firm has agreed to be bought by International Business Machines Corp., which plans to set up a new unit combining Promontory's consultants with its own artificial-intelligence technology to advise clients on financial regulation.

Privately held Promontory was founded in 2001 by Eugene Ludwig, a former U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, and has hired a small army of former senior regulators and government officials. Banks and government agencies use the firm as an adviser, but also as a sort of outsourced regulator, which sometimes performs jobs the government doesn't have the resources to do. Regulators, for example, might hire Promontory to monitor a financial firm's compliance with the terms of a settlement.

The sale comes a year after a run-in with New York regulators who alleged Promontory watered down reports about potential sanctions violations by British bank Standard Chartered PLC. The New York Department of Financial Services said the firm exhibited "a lack of independent judgment in the preparation and submission of certain reports" from 2010 to 2011. Promontory admitted it didn't meet certain standards and agreed to pay $15 million to settle the matter.

IBM hopes to combine Promontory's financial regulatory expertise with Watson, the technology company's artificial-intelligence computer system, to help banks meet ever-rising regulatory expectations in areas such as anti-money-laundering detection systems, consumer-complaint databases and so-called stress tests.

"There is no way that professionals can keep up with critical information growing at these rates," IBM Senior Vice President Bridget van Kralingen said in an interview. "Watson is going to learn &by continuously ingesting this regulatory information as it is created."

IBM has run technology systems for financial institutions for decades, but this acquisition represents a new foray into financial regulatory compliance work.

Ms. van Kralingen said the increasingly data-driven world of financial regulation is a logical expansion of its Watson cognitive computing technology, which the company also is applying in cancer research and other areas.

With anti-money-laundering compliance, for example, banks are expected to track millions of customers and financial transactions, looking for suspicious activity and reporting it to the government. If they miss activity such as terrorism financing or sanctions evasion, they can face multimillion-dollar or even billion-dollar fines.

Promontory's experts and IBM's Watson team are looking to create a smarter system for catching suspicious transactions and customers, which then could be sold to banks, executives said Thursday.

Promontory previously drew criticism from members of Congress for pay it received when regulators tapped it to search for errors in mortgage foreclosures at big banks after the financial crisis. Promontory was paid more than $900 million for the work, it disclosed in 2013. The company said at the time that it put in several million hours on the project and stood by the quality of its work.

In recent years, Promontory hasn't attracted a piece of business as sizable as the foreclosure review, according to people familiar with the company.

Mr. Ludwig, 70 years old and deeply involved in day-to-day operations, has a "multiyear commitment" to the company and remains its CEO, said Promontory spokesman Todd Davenport.

Promontory last year had briefly explored a sale to Boston Consulting Group, according to a person briefed on the matter, but both sides walked away. David Fondiller, a spokesman for BCG, had no immediate comment.

Mr. Davenport said Promontory "has regularly received indications of interest and has on occasion discussed potential strategic opportunities with various entities."

He said the company didn't proceed "until IBM approached us with a transformational opportunity that stands to benefit our clients, their customers and the financial system."

Mr. Ludwig, in an interview, said formal discussions with IBM had been going on for about the past six months, although he first approached the company with the idea of a joint venture a decade ago. "To get [regulatory compliance] right for large institutions takes tremendous computing power, but it also takes domain expertise" that Promontory has, he said.

The new venture, to be called Watson Financial Services, will be part of IBM's Industry Platforms unit, Ms. van Kralingen said.

The companies didn't disclose financial details of the deal, which they said is subject to regulatory approvals and expected to close by the end of the year.

Thoma Bravo to Acquire T2 Systems; Investment is the firm's fourth out of its new $1.7 billion Thoma Bravo Discover Fund

Thoma Bravo LLC said it would acquire parking management technology company T2 Systems Inc. from Pamlico Capital.

Founded in 1994 and based in Indianapolis, T2 provides both software and hardware for parking management. Its products include permit management, enforcement, citation services, vehicle counters and multispace pay stations.

The company is one Thoma Bravo knew for years at the periphery, said A.J. Rohde, a partner at the firm. He added that the acquisition, terms of which weren't disclosed, was the result of an auction process run by William Blair & Co.

Mr. Rohde said Thoma Bravo previously was interested in the company but until recently didn't have a fund that would invest in deals of this size. He said the timing lined up with T2's decision to explore a sale and Thoma Bravo's roll out of its new midmarket vehicle, the software-focused Thoma Bravo Discover Fund, which raised $1.7 billion in February.

T2, which originally sold parking enforcement software to universities, expanded into providing parking services and technology to municipalities and commercial operators, said Mr. Rohde. He said the company is likely to make acquisitions in its existing product areas and invest in the payments area and around the "connected city concept" of using data to alert customers of the times that transportation will arrive, for instance.

"The market is not well covered by PE," said Mr. Rohde. "This is one of the last frontiers of fragmentation that I have seen." He said there are a number of smaller niche and regional players in the space.

Thoma Bravo retained Goodwin Procter LLP as its legal counsel. Carlyle Group LP and Madison Capital Funding provided debt financing for the deal.

Charlotte, N.C.-based Pamlico Capital"http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJLBO20111003234825"in T2 in 2011 alongside management. T2 announced in November 2014 that it had acquired CASE Parking, a parking data services provider. The acquisition expanded T2's parking and infrastructure services offerings with real-time parking data technology, according to a news release at the time of the purchase.

Pamlico makes investments in communications, health-care and business and technology services, according to the firm's website. The firm makes investments of $20 million to $100 million in equity in companies with annual revenue between $15 million to $200 million.

The sale of T2 marks Pamlico's second exit of a portfolio company this month. Earlier in September, the firm announced it had sold Daxko Inc., a member services software company, to GI Partners. Pamlico originally invested in that company in 2014.

The acquisition of T2 is Thoma Bravo's fourth investment from its new Discovery Fund. Purchases made by the vehicle include cybersecurity company Bomgar Corp., analytics company Infogix Inc. and supply-chain operating network Elemica Inc., according to the T2 release.

Thoma Bravo, which has offices in San Francisco and Chicago, makes investments in software and technology-enabled services. Its Discover fund makes equity investments of up to $150 million and targets companies with revenue between $30 million to $150 million.

The firm earlier this month closed its seventh flagship fund, Thoma Bravo Fund XII LP, which collected $7.6 billion of capital.

Falfurrias Capital Partners said it acquired a majority interest in Marquis Software Solutions Inc., a software company that caters to financial institutions.

Marquis, of Plano, Texas, provides data-analytics software and services, such as marketing, customer-relationship management and compliance offerings to more than 400 financial institutions, including midtier banks and credit unions.

Susan R. Faulkner, who worked with Falfurrias to find investments in the technology-enabled financial services space, will take the helm as Marquis's chief executive, according to a news release. Ms. Faulkner will succeed Jay Kassing, whose father, Les Kassing, founded the business in 1987.

Ms. Faulkner said she aims to help the company expand its digital marketing and develop new products around customer relationship management. Mr. Oken said that Marquis will serve as a platform for acquiring additional companies with similar customers or products.

Mr. Kassing, the exiting chief executive, said the company's customers include banks- such as IberiaBank Corp., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Wells Fargo & Co. and credit unions.

Marc Oken, a co-founder and managing partner at Falfurrias, said the acquisition is the firm's fifth investment that plays in the financial services space.

Founded in 2006, Falfurrias invests in companies with $3 million to $25 million in annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the consumer and retail, food and beverage, business-services, energy, health-care and financial-services sectors, among others.

The Charlotte, N.C., firm in August said it bought a controlling stake in Green Distribution, a Secaucus, N.J., company that makes and distributes printed apparel and heat transfers.
