Health-care venture capitalists are placing some of their largest bets on startups formed by star entrepreneurs able to win investor confidence despite being years away from putting a drug on the market.

Top health-care venture rounds in the first half included Human Longevity Inc .'s $220 million Series B, Aptinyx Inc.'s $65 million Series A, and a $51.5 million Series A for Morphic Therapeutic . Well-known entrepreneurs formed all three and amassed the funds despite a general slowdown in health-care venture investment.

J. Craig Venter , who sequenced the human genome early last decade through Celera Genomics , which he formed in 1998, now runs a large-scale DNA-sequencing operation at Human Longevity. Combining genomic, clinical and other data with large-scale computing and artificial intelligence, Human Longevity aims to tackle cancer and other diseases amid a quest to extend the human lifespan. Investors such as GE Ventures and Celgene Corp . are bankrolling this vision, supplying the company with $300 million in Series A and B financing since its formation in 2013.

Venture firms also took aggressive approaches with Morphic Therapeutic and Aptinyx, betting it was best to enable them to concentrate on drug development instead of fundraising. Morphic Chief Executive Praveen Tipirneni said some investors wouldn't discuss a deal unless he was willing to raise a large round, one that would enable it to prove the concept of its approach in clinical trials.

Morphic, which aims to treat inflammatory-bowel disease and other conditions through drugs targeting integrin receptors, was founded by integrin-research pioneer Timothy Springer. Drug companies have brought six integrin medicines to market but have also seen several failures in clinical trials. Morphic formed last year to use Dr. Springer's research to clear technical hurdles that felled previous efforts.

The company, whose backers include Polaris Partners and venture arms of Pfizer Inc ., GlaxoSmithKline PLC and AbbVie Inc ., intends to develop an oral version of the Entyvio, an infused inflammatory-bowel disease therapy from Takeda Pharmaceutical Co . that earned U.S. regulatory approval in May 2014.

VCs spun Aptinyx out of venture-backed Naurex Inc . after selling the neurological drug developer to Allergan PLC in a $560 million deal in August 2015. Allergan bought Naurex to secure antidepressants that may deliver rapid relief by modulating a receptor known as NMDA. Aptinyx, led by former Naurex CEO Norbert Riedel , plans to develop NMDA modulators for other conditions with the $65 million round he raised in May. Aptinyx, which launched initial clinical trials in July in healthy volunteers, could pursue conditions such as PTSD and traumatic brain injury.

Aptinyx was somewhat of a departure for investor Longitude Capital , which typically finances clinical-stage drug companies. But the firm was confident the Aptinyx management could use the same technology platform from Naurex to develop new products quickly, Managing Director Patrick Enright said.

Raw startups weren't the only ones closing large rounds in the first half. Acutus Medical Inc . rounded up $75 million in March from Deerfield Management , Xeraya Capital and others to fund the launch of tools to enable better detection and treatment of atrial fibrillation, an irregular heartbeat that can lead to stroke and other illnesses.

Similarly, PanTheryx Inc . collected $53 million from Pegasus Capital Advisors in March to release a medical-nutrition product for traveler's diarrhea and infectious diarrhea. The product, DiaResQ, delivers nutrients to the small intestine to promote the repair of damage caused bacteria or viruses. Although traveler's diarrhea is a good-sized market, the larger opportunity lies with infectious diarrhea, according to Chief Executive Mark Braman . Diarrheal disease is the second-leading cause of death in children under age 5, according to the World Health Organization .

ANALYSIS
Rise of the DIY algo traders; FT BIG READ: INVESTMENT

Online platforms that 'crowdsource' trading strategies are attracting tech-savvy amateurs keen to develop winning algorithms. But will they be able to consistently beat the market and take on the hedge funds? By Robin Wigglesworth

By day Dan Houghton helps run Chilango , a Mexican restaurant chain in London that he co-founded. By night, he is an algorithmic stock trader, coding complex, automated investment strategies once his children are in bed.

In 2013 Mr Houghton sold an online texting company that he founded while studying mathematics at Cambridge university. The proceeds were ploughed into his restaurant and a new family home, but rather than deposit the remainder in a staid mutual fund he decided to use his maths skills to try to beat the market.

After reading books on finance and scouring the internet for articles on "quantitative" investing, he stumbled over a company tailor-made for people like him: Quantopian, an online trading platform and "crowdsourced" hedge fund. The company is designed for a new breed of do-it-yourself algorithmic traders who develop automated investment strategies. Each month, the best "algos" win trading money from Quantopian and a select few are included in its embryonic hedge fund.

"My wife thought I was crazy," Mr Houghton says. He had to learn Python - a programming language popular among quantitative analysts, or "quants" - from scratch, and after experimenting with the platform for a few months is trying to get one of his algorithms included in Quantopian's hedge fund.

So far he has made $7,971 after trading commissions, but making money is not the main driver. "It's primarily intellectual curiosity but I'm fairly competitive and the chance of getting included [in Quantopian's fund] makes me stay up for the extra hour working on a strategy," he says.

"Burrito-Dan", as he is known at Quantopian, is one of a swelling number of mathematicians, programmers, data engineers and physicists who are taking advantage of cheap, powerful computers and the availability of financial data to code their own trading strategies. These DIY algo traders are an updated version of the army of day-traders that emerged during the 1990s stock market boom.

Some analysts believe this new wave of amateur algo traders can be harnessed using crowdsourcing techniques to disrupt one of Wall Street's elite professions - the hedge fund manager.

"If our model is successful there will be no need for hedge funds any more," says Martin Froehler, an Austrian mathematician who created Quantiacs , one of several online platforms for DIY algo traders. "A smart guy with a laptop will be able to start his own hedge fund. It will be very challenging to the big incumbents. A very simple idea can prove very powerful."

Most day traders are ultimately unsuccessful - many were wiped out when the dotcom bubble burst - and are often derided by professional money managers as "dumb money". The new DIY algo traders may be smarter and more computer-savvy than the average day trader but many experts warn they will find it just as hard to consistently beat the market. They scoff at the idea that their industry will face any threat from nerds coding in their basement.

But Quantiacs and its rivals are emerging as the classic hedge fund model is showing signs of strain . Investors have been pulling billions of dollars from hedge funds after a long period of underwhelming performance. And the fact that some technologists scent an opening underscores the sense of a looming industry shift, as more scientific, computer-driven approaches to investing gain favour.

Monetising pure data

Khaled Sharif, a young Jordanian computer engineer, arrived in the US in June to work at Nasa's Ames Research Center, the space agency's Silicon Valley outpost. Mr Sharif is a research assistant who specialises in deploying artificial intelligence techniques such as "machine learning" to crunch data on satellite images, weather patterns and earthquakes. But on the side he has an avid interest in another data-intensive area: the stock market.

He started using Quantopian a few years ago, attracted by a platform that allowed him to deepen his interest in using computer-based forecasting methods on the stock market. More recently, he found something that suited his expertise even more: Numerai, a small San Francisco-based hedge fund founded by Richard Craib, a South African mathematician.

Numerai provides users with encrypted, raw financial data to develop models using approaches like machine learning - Mr Sharif's field - to help them make stock market predictions. They submit their predictions to Numerai , which awards prize money for the best models and incorporates them into automated trades for its hedge fund.

The prize money idea is similar to Quantopian's but Numerai differs in that it offers a "pure" data challenge, leaving how to solve it up to users.

In this respect it is similar to Kaggle, a data science website popular among computer scientists, where people post challenges and offer rewards for solutions.

The concept is esoteric and ambitious but in April Numerai raised $1.5m from investors led by Howard Morgan, one of the founders of Renaissance Technologies, a computer-powered hedge fund group. Numerai represents an intriguing return to his past and a pointer to a possible hedge fund model of the future, Mr Morgan says.

"Numerai could be disruptive because you can get a lot of people doing this part-time at home," he told the Financial Times. "We're very excited about the democratisation of problem-solving."

Institutional pressures

The hedge fund industry could be ripe for disruption, as investor dissatisfaction is rife. While the money trickling out is modest compared with the industry's $3tn size, even insiders admit that the old band of iconoclasts, including people such as George Soros, Michael Steinhardt and Julian Robertson, has been replaced by a far larger, institutional industry where the sheer number and size of hedge funds hit returns.

Tony James, president of Blackstone, the US asset management group, has predicted "a day of reckoning" that will contract the hedge fund industry by as much as a quarter. "There will be a shrinkage in the industry and it will be painful," he told a conference in May .

However, quantitative hedge funds such as Two Sigma, Renaissance, DE Shaw and Winton Capital, which eschew the gut feelings of human traders in favour of the logic of computer programs and mathematical models, have generally performed much better. As a whole, the quant hedge fund industry is on its seventh straight year of client inflows, with total assets going from $407.7bn in 2009 to $878.7bn this year, according to data from Hedge Fund Research, accounting for almost a third of the overall industry.

Talent has emerged as the leading challenge, with an intense battle among funds to recruit from rivals and Silicon Valley. But many people with the requisite skills have little interest in working for a big, established hedge fund in New York or London. Some merely want to dabble on the side of a full-time job.

This is where the new platforms - like Numerai, Quantopian, Quantiacs and QuantConnect - come in. They want to enable a new generation of iconoclasts who will help upturn the traditional hedge fund model.

Quantiacs is a good example of this vision. Like Quantopian and Numerai, it attracts computer scientists to its platform by awarding trading funds to strategies that perform best in its tests. The Silicon Valley company invests some of its own money in the competition winners, but Quantiacs is primarily focused on becoming a "marketplace" for automated investment strategies, and plans to open up the platform to individual and institutional investors to invest in algos directly.

While hedge funds traditionally charge "2 and 20" - a 2 per cent management fee and 20 per cent of profits - Quantiacs does not charge management fees and the 20 per cent of profits are split equally between the company and the quant. It hopes to funnel millions of dollars directly from investors to quants in their basements, dorms or research departments.

"There are a lot of people that don't want to work at a big hedge fund," Mr Froehler argues. He set up Quantiacs after working for a hedge fund in Switzerland and becoming disillusioned with the industry. "It is elitist, closed to outsiders and wastes a lot of talent. I would have loved to do this myself when I was studying mathematics."

These attempts at harnessing the talents of these DIY traders are nascent, and the new platforms may never attain the scale of the quant industry, let alone the broader hedge fund world. Most money is invested by pension funds, endowments and insurers that want a more traditional, institutional set-up.

Many hedge fund managers are also sceptical, arguing that DIY algos often underestimate the differences between financial theory and practice. An algorithm that might do well in a simulated test environment can swiftly unravel when exposed to the chaos of real markets. Even strategies that work with a modest amount of money can turn into duds when they are scaled up.

"We've seen very little evidence that lone geniuses sitting in their living room will be successful. There are some examples but very few," argues one quant hedge fund manager. Even superficially successful ones are vulnerable to sudden reversals. "These guys might not understand the risks that they're taking. They might be doing well but they might be exposed to a huge tail risk they're just not seeing."

Powerful tools

However, some of the industry's leading names think the idea has potential. This year Steven Cohen, the head of Point72 - a family office set up after SAC Capital, his former hedge fund, pleaded guilty to insider trading, and the Securities and Exchange Commission banned Mr Cohen from managing client money until 2018 - invested in Quantopian and promised up to $250m for its embryonic crowdsourced hedge fund.

"The tools can now be put into anyone's hands around the world to do very sophisticated quantitative investing. That is very different, and very powerful," says Matthew Granade, chief market intelligence officer at Point72 and a board member of Quantopian.

Numerai's Mr Craib admits that the concept is "hard to get your head around but I think this is the future". He is convinced that the crowdsourced alternative hedge fund models will supplant the dinosaurs that have lumbered around markets.

"Will the hedge fund of the future really be lots of people sitting in a big office? I think that in the post-artificial intelligence, post-internet world it will be far more democratised and diverse."

Recruitment

Mainstream asset managers step up hunt for tech talent

As banks, asset managers and hedge funds become dependent on technology, the demand for data scientists and programmers has become intense. Many hedge funds have been scouring Silicon Valley to attract some of the best minds in tech.

This year, Citadel, a Chicago hedge fund run by Ken Griffin, poached Microsoft's chief operating officer Kevin Turner to be the chief executive of its securities arm, while Bridgewater Associates, the world's biggest hedge fund manager, hired Apple's Jon Rubinstein to be co-chief executive.

Bridgewater had already hired IBM's David Ferrucci - the man behind the Watson supercomputer - to lead its new artificial intelligence unit, and Two Sigma, a quantitative hedge fund, last year hired Alfred Spector, formerly Google's vice-president of research and special initiatives, as its chief scientist.

"What is an absolute certainty is that the asset management sector is set to become even more of a technology industry than it already is," Rick Lacaille, chief investment officer at State Street Global Advisors, wrote this year . "Those firms that have made the necessary investments in data and technology will have the edge."

This is a prime driver behind the establishment of online platforms for amateur or part-time quantitative traders. While a top quant hedge fund might employ several hundred mathematicians, physicists and programmers, these start-ups hope they can gain an edge by harnessing the skills of potentially tens of thousands of tech-savvy people from the US, Europe and Asia.

Withdrawals Plague Once-Mighty Hedge-Fund Firms Brevan Howard and Tudor; Brevan Howard fund suffers first-half outflow of more than $3 billion; Tudor's head count falls by 15%

A growing exodus from hedge funds extended to two of the biggest names in the industry Tuesday, Tudor Investment Corp. and Brevan Howard, as disenchanted investors increasingly shun what was once the hottest place to put money.

The funds' problem is clear: They just aren't performing.

Hedge funds and actively managed mutual funds have been underperforming since financial markets began their rebound in early 2009. The average hedge fund is up 3% this year through the end of July, according to researcher HFR Inc., less than half the S&P 500's rise, including dividends.

Funds in the $2.9 trillion hedge-fund sector have now experienced three consecutive quarters of withdrawals for the first time since 2009, according to HFR.

Brevan Howard's master fund was one of the star performers during the credit crisis, but is now on pace for its third straight calendar year of losses. Investors withdrew more than $3 billion from its flagship fund in the first half of this year, according to letters sent to investors and calculations by The Wall Street Journal based on the fund's asset levels and performance.

For the year through August, two key Tudor hedge funds were down about 3%, according to investors, well below the overall market. On Tuesday, the firm reduced its workforce by about 15%, or about 60 employees, including money managers as well as other staff, according to people familiar with the matter.

Faced with the declining performance, Paul Tudor Jones's firm had been contemplating for several months the shift to quantitative strategies, which rely on algorithms to make investing decisions, according to people close to the matter.

The move toward computer-driven investing and away from traditional investing is a sign of how even hedge-fund giants are feeling pain lately amid a growing shift to these so-called quant strategies.

The money-management business is increasingly becoming bifurcated with institutional investors choosing low-cost exchange-traded and index funds, then adding hedge funds that focus on quant trading, such as such as Renaissance Technologies and Two Sigma Investments LLC.

One Two Sigma fund was up almost 14% this year through the end of July, though another was down a bit.

Mr. Jones, who became a billionaire thanks to prescient "macro'" trades that anticipated moves across financial markets, has watched Tudor's assets shrink to approximately $11 billion from $13 billion last year and $14 billion in 2014, a person said. Now the firm is cutting underperforming traders who rely on a traditional, fundamental approach and focusing resources on its best moneymakers.

In a meeting last September with the firm's portfolio managers, he tried to motivate and prepare his team for the new era, according to the people close to the matter.

"No man is better than a machine," he told the team, "and no machine is better than a man with a machine."

The new quants won't replace departing traders. Instead, Tudor hopes to emphasize so-called big-data strategies those that use powerful computers and the internet to crunch mountains of raw data to uncover previously invisible insights in the market, an approach already emphasized at a number of hedge funds that are performing well lately, the people said.

Bloomberg News first reported the staff reduction.

The withdrawals at Brevan, which is headed by billionaire Alan Howard, mean the firm's assets have now more than halved in the past two years, from around $42 billion to $19.4 billion. It has shut commodities and emerging-markets funds in recent years, and spun out its credit-funds unit.

Brevan was long regarded as the most influential hedge fund in Europe with, until two years ago, the enviable record of making money every calendar year, even during the credit crisis and the Greek debt crisis.

However, the decision in 2009 to move top traders from London, including Mr. Howard, to Geneva was seen by some in the industry as a misstep, while the firm has also suffered the loss of several key traders, most notably co-founder Chris Rokos.

A spokesman for Brevan declined to comment.

Like most so-called global macro hedge funds, which trade bonds, currencies and stocks, Brevan has struggled in recent years to cope with markets dominated by central bank money-printing. This has flattened yield curves and suppressed volatility in bond markets, making it harder for such funds to profit.

Macro funds overall are up 3.7% this year on average, but lost money in four of the five past calendar years, according to Hedge Fund Research.

Staff numbers have dropped from around 460 in 2014 to around 350 currently, said a person familiar with the firm.

Like Brevan, Mr. Jones, 61 years old, has largely been defined as a macro oriented investor who makes bets in various global markets.

Mr. Jones, who helped launch high-profile charity The Robin Hood Foundation, began his career as a cotton trader. He first rose to fame on Wall Street after making an estimated $100 million on Black Monday, the day in October 1987 the Dow Jones Industrial Average dove 22%. He also made money when the market tumbled after the terrorist attacks in 2001, due to bearish positions.

A wildlife enthusiast with properties in Colorado, Africa and elsewhere, Mr. Jones in recent years generally has let his traders make their own investment decisions while spent most days at his firm's Greenwich, Conn., trading floor.

Five years ago, Tudor cut some fees charged by its largest hedge fund after years of grumbling by some clients, but raised other key fees and maintained overall charges that topped most hedge funds and other investment vehicles, a sign of the heated interest at the time for brand-named fund. At the time, Tudor's key BVI fund had averaged annual gains of 21% during its 25-year history.

But the fund has delivered uneven returns in recent years, including a gain of about 1% last year, investors say, and clients have withdrawn cash, leading to the decision to shift its trading.

La Defense Office District Rallies in Paris

Cheap rents have companies flocking to La Defense, the Paris business district that became a symbol of France's weak economy in the years following the financial crisis.

In the first half of 2016, more office space was rented in the area than any other six-month period since 2000, according to property broker CBRE.

The uptick is a reverse of fortunes for La Defense, the largest business district in continental Europe, sitting about six kilometers west of the Eiffel Tower.

In the years following Europe's debt crisis, the district struggled as economic growth sputtered. Companies looking to cut costs moved out to the suburbs. Development projects were abandoned. Entire towers sat vacant.

With offices empty, rents fell. Average prime rents in La Defense fell to 466 euros a square meter a year in 2015 from 529 euros a square meter a year in 2010, CBRE data show. Meanwhile, prime office rents in central Paris remained far higher, averaging 709 euros a square meter a year last year.

Lower rents have become enticing to companies looking for space. Construction-materials firm Saint-Gobain SA, accountancy company Deloitte and health-care data company IMS Health Holdings Inc. are among the firms that signed up for office space in the area this year.

Saint-Gobain chose to gather all the headquarters of its different units in La Defense this year partly because of the rents, according to its Chief Executive Pierre-Andre de Chalendar. "We wouldn't have chosen it otherwise," he said in an emailed statement.

Another draw: La Defense offers the types of large office spaces where companies can install thousands of workers. In downtown Paris, where skyscrapers are forbidden, buildings are far smaller, requiring some big firms to rent multiple spaces. That makes rents in La Defense appear even cheaper.

In La Defense, development projects during the financial crisis stalled. But as firms move back, real-estate investors are building new towers, betting on continued demand.

Unibail Rodamco SE, the biggest listed property firm in Europe, is aiming to complete the 33-story Trinity Tower in the second half of 2018 and the much larger Sisters towers due after 2020.

The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority bought the 39-story Alto tower development that is due to be finished in late 2019.

"There is very little space being built in the next few years," said Karim Habra, head of France at LaSalle Investment Management, which advised ADIA on the Alto sale and is spearheading the development. "There is a window of opportunity."

A series of developments in other areas in the Paris periphery are likely to compete with La Defense. In the traditional areas close to either La Defense or downtown Paris -- like Boulogne-Billancourt, Neuilly-sur-Seine, Issy-les-Moulineaux or Levallois-Perret -- demand is rising at the same pace as in La Defense, said Philippe Depoux, the CEO of Gecina, another real-estate firm present in La Defense.

"These are the areas where we seek to focus on, beside intramuros Paris. Transactions are rising there, too," he said.

More daring developers have set their eyes on noncommercial areas such as Aubervilliers, Fontenay-sous-Bois or Ivry-sur-Seine, where land is cheap and the distance to Paris short.

French banks BNP Paribas and Societe Generale have recently installed some offices in Fontenay-sous-Bois and water utility Veolia Environnement is planning to move its headquarters to Aubervilliers.

More developments are coming. Chicago-based LaSalle in July bought an office development in Clichy, a northern suburb of Paris, and plans to complete another deal as soon as September, said Simon Marrison, CEO for Europe at the firm.

After Britain's vote to leave the European Union, office markets in Paris and other European capitals like Frankfurt and Dublin could benefit should companies, especially those in the financial-services sector, decide to relocate some operations away from London.

That isn't the reason LaSalle is pursuing development projects, but it would be the "icing on the cake," Mr. Marrison said.

Mr. Depoux at Gecina doesn't see developments outside La Defense as a threat. Public transportation to La Defense is far better, and many peripheral projects may not come to fruition because builders typically wait for tenants before starting any work, he said.

European real-estate investment dropped 30% to 107.5 billion euros in the first half of the year compared with the same period in 2015, according to real-estate consultant firm Real Capital Analytics. Political risks, including Brexit, and years of rising prices were among reasons global investors held back.

But Paris held up better than other major markets like London, Berlin and Madrid. Transaction volumes in the French capital were down 17% to 7.8 billion euros, the second-most active market behind London, RCA data show.

A number of headwinds are expected to weigh down the French economy in the coming months, such as the weakness in the U.K. after the vote to leave the EU and the spate of terror attacks in Europe.

For La Defense, swings should be expected, analysts said.

"Vacancy and occupancy rates there have always swung much more than other parts of Paris," said Francois Blin, head of international investment in France at broker JLL.

SingTel Revives Talks With Temasek

SINGAPORE -- Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. has restarted discussions to buy a portion of Temasek Holdings Pte. Ltd.'s $2.4 billion stake in one of Thailand's largest telecommunications companies, according to people familiar with the situation.

SingTel has revived talks to purchase a stake in Intouch Holdings PCL, founded by former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, from state-investment firm Temasek, after exploring a similar deal in 2013.

The stake purchase would further boost SingTel's presence in Thailand as Intouch owns a 40.6% stake in the country's largest mobile operator Advanced Info Services PCL. SingTel already holds a 23.3% stake in Advanced Info.

SingTel, Southeast Asia's largest telecom firm and the biggest company in Singapore by market capitalization, has chased growth around the globe to expand beyond its saturated local market. It snapped up U.S. managed-security services specialist firm Trustwave last year. In 2012, it bought Amobee, a digital advertising firm. SingTel owns substantial stakes in several Asian telecom firms, including India's Bharti Airtel Ltd. and Telkomsel in Indonesia.

Thailand is an attractive growth market for telecom companies. The country is experiencing increased mobile usage as incomes rise and the economy grows at a steady clip. Mobile phone and data subscribers are expected to increase to more than 88 million this year, which is up 4.4% from a year earlier.

SingTel is in discussions with Temasek over the exact size of the Intouch stake that it could buy, according to people familiar with the talks. Intouch, which trades on the Thai stock exchange, has a market cap of $5.9 billion and Temasek owns a 41% stake. The people cautioned that the discussions haven't been completed and could still fall apart or change.

Thai regulators cap foreign ownership of local telecom firms at 49%.

Intouch has been a lightning rod in local politics after being founded by Mr. Shinawatra. Temasek led a consortium that bought control of the firm, then known as Shin Corp., from Mr. Thaksin and his family in 2006.

A stake sale of Intouch would give Temasek more cash to invest in technology and newer industries, such as artificial intelligence and life sciences.

 Burrito-Dan , as he is known at Quantopian, is one of a swelling number of mathematicians, programmers, data engineers and physicists who are taking advantage of cheap, powerful computers and the availability of financial data to code their own trading strategies. These DIY algo traders are an updated version of the army of day-traders that emerged during the 1990s stock market boom.

Some analysts believe this new wave of amateur algo traders can be harnessed using crowdsourcing techniques to disrupt one of Wall Street s elite professions   the hedge fund manager.

 If our model is successful there will be no need for hedge funds any more,  says Martin Froehler, an Austrian mathematician who created "https://www.quantiacs.com/", one of several online platforms for DIY algo traders.  A smart guy with a laptop will be able to start his own hedge fund. It will be very challenging to the big incumbents. A very simple idea can prove very powerful. 

Most day traders are ultimately unsuccessful   many were wiped out when the dotcom bubble burst   and are often derided by professional money managers as  dumb money . The new DIY algo traders may be smarter and more computer-savvy than the average day trader but many experts warn they will find it just as hard to consistently beat the market. They scoff at the idea that their industry will face any threat from nerds coding in their basement.

But Quantiacs and its rivals are emerging as the classic "http://www.ft.com/topics/themes/Hedge_funds?ft_site=falcon&desktop=true" model is showing signs of strain. Investors have been pulling billions of dollars from hedge funds after a long period of underwhelming performance. And the fact that some technologists scent an opening underscores the sense of a looming industry shift, as more scientific, computer-driven approaches to investing gain favour.

Monetising pure data

Khaled Sharif, a young Jordanian computer engineer, arrived in the US in June to work at Nasa s Ames Research Center, the space agency s Silicon Valley outpost. Mr Sharif is a research assistant who specialises in deploying artificial intelligence techniques such as  machine learning  to crunch data on satellite images, weather patterns and earthquakes. But on the side he has an avid interest in another data-intensive area: the stock market.

He started using Quantopian a few years ago, attracted by a platform that allowed him to deepen his interest in using computer-based forecasting methods on the stock market. More recently, he found something that suited his expertise even more: Numerai, a small San Francisco-based hedge fund founded by Richard Craib, a South African mathematician.

Numerai provides users with encrypted, raw financial data to develop models using approaches like machine learning   Mr Sharif s field   to help them make stock market predictions. They submit their predictions to "https://numer.ai/", which awards prize money for the best models and incorporates them into automated trades for its hedge fund.

The prize money idea is similar to Quantopian s but Numerai differs in that it offers a  pure  data challenge, leaving how to solve it up to users.

In this respect it is similar to Kaggle, a data science website popular among computer scientists, where people post challenges and offer rewards for solutions.

The concept is esoteric and ambitious but in April Numerai raised $1.5m from investors led by Howard Morgan, one of the founders of Renaissance Technologies, a computer-powered hedge fund group. Numerai represents an intriguing return to his past and a pointer to a possible hedge fund model of the future, Mr Morgan says.

 Numerai could be disruptive because you can get a lot of people doing this part-time at home,  he told the Financial Times.  We re very excited about the democratisation of problem-solving. 

Institutional pressures

The hedge fund industry could be ripe for disruption, as investor dissatisfaction is rife. While the money trickling out is modest compared with the industry s $3tn size, even insiders admit that the old band of iconoclasts, including people such as George Soros, Michael Steinhardt and Julian Robertson, has been replaced by a far larger, institutional industry where the sheer number and size of hedge funds hit returns.

Tony James, president of Blackstone, the US asset management group, has predicted  a day of reckoning  that will contract the hedge fund industry by as much as a quarter.  There will be a shrinkage in the industry and it will be painful,  he told a "http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-05-25/hedge-funds-may-lose-quarter-of-assets-blackstone-s-james-says".

However, quantitative hedge funds such as Two Sigma, Renaissance, DE Shaw and Winton Capital, which eschew the gut feelings of human traders in favour of the logic of computer programs and mathematical models, have generally performed much better. As a whole, the quant hedge fund industry is on its seventh straight year of client inflows, with total assets going from $407.7bn in 2009 to $878.7bn this year, according to data from Hedge Fund Research, accounting for almost a third of the overall industry.

Talent has emerged as the leading challenge, with an intense battle among funds to recruit from rivals and Silicon Valley. But many people with the requisite skills have little interest in working for a big, established hedge fund in New York or London. Some merely want to dabble on the side of a full-time job.

This is where the new platforms   like Numerai, Quantopian, Quantiacs and "https://www.quantconnect.com/"   come in. They want to enable a new generation of iconoclasts who will help upturn the traditional hedge fund model.

Quantiacs is a good example of this vision. Like Quantopian and Numerai, it attracts computer scientists to its platform by awarding trading funds to strategies that perform best in its tests. The Silicon Valley company invests some of its own money in the competition winners, but Quantiacs is primarily focused on becoming a  marketplace  for automated investment strategies, and plans to open up the platform to individual and institutional investors to invest in algos directly.

While hedge funds traditionally charge  2 and 20    a 2 per cent management fee and 20 per cent of profits   Quantiacs does not charge management fees and the 20 per cent of profits are split equally between the company and the quant. It hopes to funnel millions of dollars directly from investors to quants in their basements, dorms or research departments.

 There are a lot of people that don t want to work at a big hedge fund,  Mr Froehler argues. He set up Quantiacs after working for a hedge fund in Switzerland and becoming disillusioned with the industry.  It is elitist, closed to outsiders and wastes a lot of talent. I would have loved to do this myself when I was studying mathematics. 

These attempts at harnessing the talents of these DIY traders are nascent, and the new platforms may never attain the scale of the quant industry, let alone the broader hedge fund world. Most money is invested by pension funds, endowments and insurers that want a more traditional, institutional set-up.

Many hedge fund managers are also sceptical, arguing that DIY algos often underestimate the differences between financial theory and practice. An algorithm that might do well in a simulated test environment can swiftly unravel when exposed to the chaos of real markets. Even strategies that work with a modest amount of money can turn into duds when they are scaled up.

 We ve seen very little evidence that lone geniuses sitting in their living room will be successful. There are some examples but very few,  argues one quant hedge fund manager. Even superficially successful ones are vulnerable to sudden reversals.  These guys might not understand the risks that they re taking. They might be doing well but they might be exposed to a huge tail risk they re just not seeing. 

Powerful tools

However, some of the industry s leading names think the idea has potential. This year Steven Cohen, the head of Point72   a family office set up after SAC Capital, his former hedge fund, pleaded guilty to insider trading, and the Securities and Exchange Commission banned Mr Cohen from managing client money until 2018   invested in Quantopian and promised up to $250m for its embryonic crowdsourced hedge fund.

 The tools can now be put into anyone s hands around the world to do very sophisticated quantitative investing. That is very different, and very powerful,  says Matthew Granade, chief market intelligence officer at Point72 and a board member of Quantopian.

Numerai s Mr Craib admits that the concept is  hard to get your head around but I think this is the future . He is convinced that the crowdsourced alternative hedge fund models will supplant the dinosaurs that have lumbered around markets.

 Will the hedge fund of the future really be lots of people sitting in a big office? I think that in the post-artificial intelligence, post-internet world it will be far more democratised and diverse. 

Recruitment: asset managers search for tech talent

As banks, asset managers and hedge funds become dependent on technology, the demand for data scientists and programmers has become intense. Many hedge funds have been scouring Silicon Valley to attract some of the best minds in tech.

This year, Citadel, a Chicago hedge fund run by Ken Griffin, poached Microsoft s chief operating officer Kevin Turner to be the chief executive of its securities arm, while Bridgewater Associates, the world s biggest hedge fund manager, hired Apple s Jon Rubinstein to be co-chief executive.

Bridgewater had already hired IBM s David Ferrucci   the man behind the Jeapardy-beating Watson supercomputer   to lead its new artificial intelligence unit, and Two Sigma, a quantitative hedge fund, last year hired Alfred Spector, formerly Google s vice-president of research and special initiatives, as its chief scientist.

But the flurry of high-profile hires is just the tip of the iceberg, with a war for technology talent building across and at every level of the finance industry.

 What is an absolute certainty is that the asset management sector is set to become even more of a technology industry than it already is,  Rick Lacaille, chief investment officer at State Street Global Advisors, "http://www.institutionalinvestor.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=3568697#/.V5lgkDkrI0Q".  Those firms that have made the necessary investments in data and technology will have the edge. 

This is a prime driver behind the establishment of online platforms for amateur or part-time quantitative traders. While a top quant hedge fund might employ several hundred mathematicians, physicists and programmers, these start-ups hope they can gain an edge by harnessing the skills of potentially tens of thousands of tech-savvy people from the US, Europe or Asia.

Ford Developing Fully Driverless Car; Auto maker acquired Israeli firm SAIPS and invested $75 million in Velodyne

Ford Motor Co. plans to release a fully driverless car without a steering wheel or pedals in the next five years, the latest salvo in a "http://www.wsj.com/articles/detroit-battles-for-the-soul-of-self-driving-machines-1465782698" engulfing the global auto industry.

The Dearborn, Mich., auto maker on Tuesday said it would initially target ride-sharing fleets and package-delivery services with the unnamed model, underscoring the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/ceo-mark-fields-maps-fords-future-1460502908" many car companies are taking before offering vehicles to consumers that don't require humans behind the wheel.

Ford expects the first of its driverless cars to be used by commercial-fleet operators looking to cut the costs of employing human drivers, company executives said. The vehicles largely will be confined to cities with pre-mapped zones designed for autonomous vehicles.

Separately, Ford said it had acquired an Israeli machine learning firm, SAIPS, which has 12 employees, and invested $75 million in Morgan Hill, Calif.-based laser sensor maker Velodyne Inc. Both are aimed at boosting Ford's autonomous-vehicle know-how, with the latter working on sensors to help autonomous cars successfully recognize objects and navigate traffic. Chinese web-service provider Baidu Inc. invested in Velodyne alongside Ford.

The nation's No.2 car maker also plans to double the staff at its Silicon Valley office to 260 by the end of 2017, hiring researchers and business-development staff in an effort to expand into new transportation services.

Ford's forays mark the latest attempt to keep up as traditional car companies and Silicon Valley upstarts race to deliver automated-driving technologies. But those endeavors have come under increased scrutiny after the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-draws-scrutiny-from-regulators-after-autopilot-feature-is-linked-to-a-death-1467319355". car driving itself. Questions also remain over regulations and legal liabilities arising from the advancements.

General Motors Co. punched the accelerator earlier this year, taking a "http://www.wsj.com/articles/gm-invests-500-million-in-lyft-plans-system-for-self-driving-cars-1451914204" in ride-hailing startup Lyft Inc., with which it plans to soon start "http://www.wsj.com/articles/gm-lyft-to-test-self-driving-electric-taxis-1462460094" of driverless Chevrolet Bolt taxis. The Detroit car maker also has said it expects next year to roll out its SuperCruise feature that allows for hands-free driving on the highway. It this year acquired the Silicon Valley autonomous-driving startup Cruise Automation Inc. to aid development efforts.

Other global giants including Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG have committed to putting self-driving cars on the road. Nissan pledged it would roll out 10 new models within the next five years with a range of self-driving features aimed at individual buyers, including a fully autonomous car. Tesla, which released its driver-assist Autopilot system last year, says it will be the first to put a fully driverless car on the road, although it hasn't set a specific date.

Google parent Alphabet Inc. recently said it was pairing with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV to "http://www.wsj.com/articles/alphabet-fiat-chrysler-in-self-driving-cars-deal-1462306625" self-driving technology in minivans.

Ford's driverless car won't be made available for sales to individual customers until later in the decade, Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields said in an interview.

"We've done a lot of work reducing the cost on the technical components, but at the outset, it is still going to be a relatively expensive vehicle," he said.

Ford declined to say whether it plans to operate its own robo-taxi fleet or sell its forthcoming driverless car to independent ride-hailing services such as Uber Technologies Inc.

Like other major auto makers, Ford is allocating significant resources to developing self-driving cars, viewing the technology as a way to reach consumers who live in large, congested cities and don't own a vehicle. Earlier this year, the company established a separate division, Ford Smart Mobility LLC, to explore new business models that will cater to that growing market.

But Mr. Fields said Ford isn't interested in being the first auto maker to put a fully autonomous car on the market, noting "we're not in a race to make announcements."

Many car companies, including Ford, are installing semiautonomous features such as automatic emergency brakes and adaptive cruise control in vehicles. But Ford remains keenly focused on fully driverless cars, with product chief Raj Nair expressing concerns over whether drivers can take over quickly enough when driverless systems are disabled.

Other hurdles also remain. Regulators are still trying to sort out what rules and guidelines need to be in place before driverless cars start hitting roadways in large numbers.

"The regulators are being very forward leaning on this," Mr. Fields said. "Our desire is to get a 50-state national framework" on operational standards for driverless cars, he added. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration plans this summer to release guidelines for local rules on driverless cars.

Ford and Baidu's investment in Velodyne also is aimed at helping the tech firm lower the costs of its sensors to between $300 and $500 a unit, inexpensive enough for mass adoption. The first Velodyne laser device cost $75,000 and was large and obtrusive, sitting on the roof of the car.

Rubrik Inc., which helps corporate customers manage and protect data whether it is in the cloud or on their premises, has raised $61 million, nearly doubling its total funding.

The funding was an up round. Rubrik's share price nearly tripled, to $6.85, after the company did a 4-to-1 stock split that valued its Series B shares at $2.45.

Chief Executive Bupal Sinha declined to comment on the funding. He said Rubrik is growing, with about 160 employees and an average deal size of about $250,000. He also said Rubrik could have raised more money than it did and turned away as much as $40 million.

"We want to be the data management platform for modern businesses &and feel there's an opportunity to build a large business and be an independent public company," Mr. Sinha said.

Rubrik consolidates data backup and recovery software with de-duplicated storage, functions that have historically been separated into different products.

The company was cited by analysis firm Gartner in April as a "cool vendor in storage technologies." Gartner noted that other startups offer similar backup architectures and that more established vendors were also adding features to their products.

Valuations for some private companies have fallen this year, and other companies that sell technology to businesses have "http://www.wsj.com/articles/martins-take-an-investor-market-leads-to-more-down-rounds-1471001400". Big-data software company MapR Technologies Inc. last week raised $50 million in a round that cut its share price by more than 26%. In March, database company Couchbase Inc. saw its share price cut by 41%, while security startup Bromium Inc. saw its price fall by 58%.

Rubrik's funding was led by Khosla Ventures, with current investors Lightspeed Venture Partners and Greylock Partners participating. The company has now raised more than $112 million and said it would invest the money in sales, marketing, support and engineering.

Correction: Rubrik raised an up round. A previous version of this article incorrectly stated that the company had raised a down round.

Strong Yen and Weak Oil Hit Asia Stocks; Shares mixed, with record gains in the U.S. offset by a dip in oil prices and a much stronger yen

Shares in Asia were mixed on Tuesday, with record levels seen in the U.S. market overnight offset by a dip in oil prices and a much stronger yen.

The yen moves drove the Nikkei Stock Average down 1.6% for the day. Taiwan's Taiex ended down 0.4%, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.1% as a downswing in oil hit commodity producers. The Hang Seng Index was last up 0.1% and Korea's Kospi closed 0.1% lower.

A paper released by Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco President John Williams said U.S. central bankers should either raise the U.S. Fed's inflation target from the current 2%, or move to a new target based on price levels or economic growth. The suggestion could give the Fed more room to keep rates at current levels, and the greenback softened against a range of currencies Tuesday, including the yen.

The firm Japanese currency, last up 1% and pushing up against the 100 level versus the dollar, hit the share prices of local auto makers. Toyota Motor Corp. closed down 1.3%, Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. was off 1.7%, Honda Motor Co. Ltd. was 0.7% lower and Mazda Motor Corp. lost 3.4% of its value.

The market had earlier attempted to shrug off Japan's disappointing gross-domestic-product data for the April-June quarter released on Monday, which weighed in at 0.2%, below an expected 0.7% expansion.

"On the one hand, the economy is not doing well, which doesn't look good for domestic profits of Japanese firms," said Marcel Thieliant, senior Japan economist at Capital Economics. However, the weak figures increase the chance of more easing by the Bank of Japan, he said.

Late on Monday, the S&P 500, Dow Jones Average and the Nasdaq Composite all reached record highs on the back of hopes for production cuts in the oversupplied oil market.

Brent crude oil eased back from a one-month high in Asian trade, though, and was last down to $47.94 a barrel.

"I don't think that [the U.S. highs are] too significant," said William Ma, chief investment office at Noah Holdings Ltd. The muted impact on Asian stocks was due to the small gains involved, he said.

The Shanghai market erased earlier gains as investors took profits in financial blue-chips. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index closed down 0.5% to 3110.6, after trading up as high as 0.5% after the opening. Banking, car manufacturing and insurance stocks retreated the most as investors took profits in blue-chips.

Hong Kong stocks clawed back some of their early gains after losses in the afternoon session, with persistent talk that the Shenzhen-Hong Kong Connect trading link would be launched before the end of the year having a bullish impact. But banking stocks remained in the red, with HSBC PLC down 0.6% and Standard Chartered PLC 0.7% lower.

"The market was reaching...overbought conditions because of yesterday's moves, especially the Hong Kong market," said Hao Hong, chief strategist and co-head of research at Bank of Communications Co. Ltd. "Some people want to lock in gains."

Elsewhere, China Evergrande Group's Hong Kong shares rose 1% after it increased its stake in China Vanke Co. Ltd to 6.8% from 5%. According to Lucror Analytics, Evergrande's accumulation of Vanke shares was puzzling, given that the developer is heavily indebted, having aggressively used debt capital to fund recent expansions and acquisitions. Vanke was last trading up 2.7%.

The FTSE Bursa Malaysia Index climbed Tuesday lifted by expectations of more monetary easing around the globe. The Malaysia 30-stocks benchmark index increased 0.5% to 1,699.1 points in early trade, and was up 0.5% year-to-date.

In other commodities, London Metal Exchange copper futures were up 0.3% and nickel fell 0.9%, while gold rose 0.8% to $1,348 a troy ounce.

XYLEM

Sensus to Be Bought

In $1.7 Billion Deal

Water-technology company Xylem Inc. said on Monday that it would buy smart-meter company Sensus for about $1.7 billion.

Sensus makes smart meters, network technologies and provides data analytics services for the water, electric and gas industries. It generated $837 million in adjusted revenue for its fiscal year ended March 31, Xylem said, and is owned by investment funds affiliated with Jordan Co. and GS Capital Partners 2000.

Sensus has about 3,300 employees in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Slovakia, and China and generates nearly 70% of revenue in the U.S. Last year, Xylem had revenue of $3.7 billion and about 12,700 employees.

The all-cash deal will be financed by about $400 million of Xylem's non-U.S. cash, new and existing credit facilities and a combination of short- and long-term debt. There is no change to Xylem's 2016 adjusted earnings outlook, but the deal is expected to add to 2017 earnings.

Voice recognition and fingerprints are replacing pin numbers and passwords at Standard Chartered as the UK-listed bank becomes the latest lender to introduce biometric technology.

StanChart, which operates mostly across Asia, the Middle East and Africa, will roll out the new service to some 5m mobile and telephone banking customers this year, allowing them to check bank balances and access investments without needing to remember multiple passwords.

The move comes as many of the world's biggest banks expand digital investments in order to meet the rising demand for mobile banking, as the number of customers visiting branches declines.

Earlier this month, Barclays announced that all personal phone banking customers in the UK would be able to use their voice as a form of secure ID instead of answering security questions or remembering passwords. HSBC is planning to launch voice recognition and fingerprint ID in the summer while Royal Bank of Scotland is launching artificial intelligence to interact with staff, to help them assist their small business customers.

In Singapore, local banks have gone one step further and are collaborating on a service that will allow customers to make payments using their social media ID and mobile phone numbers instead of account numbers and sort codes.

StanChart's moves are part of a plan unveiled by chief executive Bill Winters last November to invest $1.5bn in technology over three years and bolster the bank's retail banking division.

Last month, StanChart rolled out video banking for customers who wanted to speak to consultants about finding a mortgage, for example, without visiting a branch. The bank also plans to pilot "robo-advisers" before the end of the year to provide basic investment services.

Karen Fawcett , Standard Chartered's chief executive of retail banking, said the shift to fingerprint and voice biometric technology aimed to provide more efficient and secure services for customers, who are increasingly using smartphones to access their accounts.

With fingerprint recognition technology, customers will be able to use "touch login" on smartphones or iPads.

The bank will also introduce voice recognition for customers using phone banking in India and the UAE this year before rolling the service out across more markets in 2017.

StanChart has set a target of generating 30 per cent of sales and 40 per cent of payments online by 2018 "to improve the customer experience and make the bank more efficient." Private banking and wealth management is one target area for growth.

StanChart aims to increase its $60bn of assets under management to more than $100bn by 2020.

The bank has closed about 200 branches over the past 18 months, but Ms Fawcett denied that it planned to axe physical services in favour of online and said: "We don't think branches will disappear, they will change."

StanChart is developing new cost-efficient branch formats. In Korea, it has struck a deal with retail group Shinsegae to offer banking services in department stores, supermarkets and other outlets.

XYLEM

Sensus to Be Bought In $1.7 Billion Deal

Water-technology company Xylem Inc. said on Monday that it would buy smart-meter company Sensus for about $1.7 billion.

Sensus makes smart meters, network technologies and provides data analytics services for the water, electric and gas industries. It generated $837 million in adjusted revenue for its fiscal year ended March 31, Xylem said, and is owned by investment funds affiliated with Jordan Co. and GS Capital Partners 2000.

Sensus has about 3,300 employees in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Slovakia, and China and generates nearly 70% of revenue in the U.S. Last year, Xylem had revenue of $3.7 billion and about 12,700 employees.

The all-cash deal will be financed by about $400 million of Xylem's non-U.S. cash, new and existing credit facilities and a combination of short- and long-term debt. There is no change to Xylem's 2016 adjusted earnings outlook, but the deal is expected to add to 2017 earnings.

The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter and is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory review, including by the Federal Communications Commission related to certain spectrum licenses.

SYSCO

Food Distributor Posts Higher Results

Sysco Corp. said profit, revenue and volumes all rose in its latest quarter.

Results easily beat expectations, and shares rose 4.4% to $54.50 in premarket trading.

In its fourth quarter, Sysco's domestic case volume grew 10.2% as sales volume rose 10.3% among smaller, local restaurants. It has faced competition recently from smaller, specialty distributors and wholesale stores.

Sysco is one of the largest food and supplies distributors and serves restaurants, hospitals and schools in the U.S.

In all for the quarter, Sysco, one of the largest food and supplies distributors, earned $215.7 million, or 38 cents a share, up from $73 million, or 12 cents a share, a year prior.

Excluding restructuring costs and other items, adjusted earnings rose to 64 cents a share from 52 cents. The number of shares outstanding fell 5.2% in the quarter, boosting per-share earnings. Revenue rose 10% to $13.7 billion.

Analysts had projected 61 cents in adjusted earnings per share on $13.68 billion in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters.

Gross margin improved to 18.34% from 17.90%.

Food deflation was 1.2% with deflation in meat and dairy being partially offset by inflation in other categories.

NEWCREST MINING

Dividend Returns After Three Years

SYDNEY--A big reduction in Newcrest Mining Ltd.'s debt pile has prompted the Australian gold miner to bring back a dividend for the first time in three years.

Miners including Newcrest have cut or scrapped payouts entirely in recent years as global commodities markets slumped, sending them racing to protect their balance sheets. Gold producers were some of the first to act, after an abrupt end of a 12-year bull run in gold prices earlier this decade on expectations of rising interest rates.

Newcrest, one of the world's top gold producers, said on Monday it will pay a final dividend of 7.5 U.S. cents a share for its fiscal year through June. The miner suspended dividends in 2013 as it posted its largest-ever annual loss.

Newcrest, whose mining operations span Papua New Guinea to Ivory Coast, has faced a slew of challenges in recent years, including weak commodity markets, safety incidents and large writedowns. As the downturn in gold prices deepened, Newcrest, like many miners, prioritized paying down its debts, aided by deep cuts to production costs.

The company said reduced net debt by 27% last fiscal year to US$2.1 billion.

"This strengthening financial position and outlook has provided the basis for the directors determining to pay a final dividend, whilst also preserving the capacity to fund future growth," Chairman Peter Hay said in a letter to shareholders.

On a call with reporters, Chief Executive Sandeep Biswas said he is keen for Newcrest to now hand investors consistent returns. Shares in the company have more than doubled over the past year.

"A sustainable dividend is very important for us, the quantum determined by the circumstances at the time," he said.

He pointed out Newcrest has repaid almost all its bilateral bank debt, reducing those borrowings to just US$25 million from US$975 million a year ago. "Once that disappears we will probably end up accumulating cash" and can then look at options for further capital management, he said.

Newcrest isn't the only gold miner looking to fatten payouts to investors.

Newmont Mining Corp. Chief Executive Gary Goldberg said in an interview last week the U.S. gold producer will likely mull a higher dividend after cutting its own debt levels quicker than expected.

Newcrest on Monday reported a net profit of US$332 million for the year through June, down from US$376 million in the same period a year ago. The miner said profits were weighed by lower gold and copper prices and the temporary suspension of operations at its Gosowong site in Indonesia earlier this year.

Newcrest produced slightly more gold last fiscal year, at 2.4 million troy ounces, as record output at the Lihir mine in Papua New Guinea offset the multi-month shutdown of Gosowong. Production was suspended there after a "geotechnical event" in February trapped a worker roughly 300 meters underground for eight days.

Newcrest said its gold output could rise in the year ahead, forecasting production in the range of 2.40-2.65 million ounces.

Mr. Biswas said the company is seeking to expand in the coming years, both by exploring land it already controls and by teaming up with small explorers in the industry.

Gold prices have been stronger than expected this year, fueled by expectations that the Federal Reserve will hold off from tightening monetary policy while other central banks continue to ease. Newcrest said it is expecting a gold price of roughly US$1,200-US$1,250 an ounce in the coming years. On Monday, spot gold traded at roughly US$1,338 an ounce.

On the call, Mr. Biswas said he was optimistic about the long run prospects for the price of copper, which Newcrest also produces, although said that, in the short term, "it is a bit of a lottery." Copper on the London Metal Exchange trades at US$4,775 a metric ton, up marginally on the start of the year.

ROSNEFT

Weak Oil Prices Weigh on Revenue

MOSCOW--Russian state-controlled oil giant PAO Rosneft said Monday that its net profit for the first half of the year nearly halved compared with the same period of 2015 as weak oil prices dragged down revenue despite a slight recovery in prices the second quarter.

Rosneft said net profit for the first half of the year was down 45.8% at 103 billion rubles ($1.6 billion), as revenue fell 14.2% to 2.28 trillion rubles. Net profit increased more than sixfold in the second quarter to 89 billion rubles compared with the first three months of the year on revenue that was up 17.6% to 1.23 trillion rubles.

"With remaining volatility, the commodity markets showed some improvements in 2Q 2016, and average ruble crude oil price went up by 20% against 1Q 2016," Rosneft Chief Executive Igor Sechin said in a statement. He said the priorities are control over operating and selling, general and administrative costs, as well as raising the quality of the investment program.

Rosneft's earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, fell 7.3% in the first half of the year to 621 billion rubles. Ebitda in the second quarter was 27.5% higher than the previous quarter at 348 billion rubles.

HENNES & MAURITZ

Retailer's Sales

Increase by 10%

STOCKHOLM--Sweden's Hennes & Mauritz AB said Monday July sales including value-added-tax increased 10% in local currencies compared with the same period a year earlier.

This follows the 8% sales rise the clothing retailer posted in June, and the 16% rise it posted in July last year.

The company had 4,105 stores at the end of July, compared with 3,649 on July 31 last year. It has previously said it plans to add around 425 stores this year, mostly in China and the U.S.

Shares closed Friday at SEK271.60.

Voice brokers answer call for liquidity; Analysis: Trading room

Deal negotiators in demand again after retreat of banks favours electronic platforms

So much for the long-predicted demise of voice brokers at the hands of ever- more sophisticated technology.

In recent months BGC Partners and Tullett Prebon, the interdealer brokers, have been scooping up hundreds of brokers who negotiate deals between buyers and sellers over the phone for illiquid assets in fixed income, energy and currency markets. Even Citadel, the US electronic market maker, has recruited voice brokers as it pushes into the European swaps market.

The voice business, as it is known, is one of the City of London's strengths. Though global in nature, both Tullett and BGC have some of the largest interdealer floors in the UK capital and expect to base operations there even after Britain leaves the EU.

A revival of voice trading seems odd when some hedge funds are experimenting with artificial intelligence . But the resurgence of human activity is part of a land-grab for business across financial markets that are being transformed by post-crisis regulations.

Transacting in fixed income, currencies, commodities and derivatives has reached an inflection point. Incumbent trading platforms, voice brokers and automated traders are looking to take advantage of opportunities as tougher capital standards weaken the role of global banks.

In the new ecosystem brokers will increasingly compete against Tradeweb (backed by Thomson Reuters), Bloom-berg and MarketAxess as these make inroads into electronic trading.

Shaun Lynn , president of BGC, says it is not a case of one or the other. "The market is going electronic but it's going with the brokers. The exchange itself is electronic, but the broker executes for you on a range of other related products, from asset swaps to basis trades, that come off it," he says.

BGC has spent more than $2bn on technology since 1998. Tullett plans to upgrade its systems after a deal to take hybrid technology from CME, the US futures exchange.

Their confidence arises from market idiosyncrasies. Despite years of technological innovation, big operational issues endure. Institutional investors have long been wary of flagging their intentions for fear of having the price move against them. This is why many big investors have long chosen to trade directly with a bank, which completes the transaction with other banks in the interdealer market via a voice broker.

Some investors are altering course as the banks retreat, and want to deal with only their 10 largest customers, leaving dozens of smaller ones looking for ways to buy and sell bonds, derivatives, commodities and currencies.

Jim McCaughan , chief executive of Principal Global Investors, an asset manager with more than $400bn of assets, says the days of simply handing over his market orders to a bank are long gone. Investors have a greatly improved understanding of how information from their orders can be exploited, he says.

Dozens of potential traders can be sourced via a broker's contacts book or an electronic venue that takes trades from asset managers, hedge funds and high-frequency traders.

John Phizackerley , chief executive of Tullett, says there are "big opportunities" with these "all-to-all" markets.

But the voice market faces a challenge. While Bloomberg, Tradeweb and MarketAxess employ teams of people to bring parties together, their incentives are not the same as those of interdealer brokers. Their bosses see them more akin to "trade facilitators" even though the job appears similar.

"Voice is fundamentally different," says an executive at a European trading platform. "In order to make money, brokers have to derive it from the spread."

Interdealer brokers are confident they can thrive. Anthony Perrotta, a former broker and head of research at Tabb, says banks are turning to riskless principal, or agency, trading, for profit. And liquidity requirements, both to meet Basel capital rules and for customers' trades, create a need for human intervention.

"Even listed futures markets, like energy, need a voice element," says Mr Lynn.

Google's Venture Capital Chief Heads for Exit

The founder of Google's venture capital arm, Bill Maris, is leaving the company, the latest in a series of high-level departures from parent Alphabet Inc.

Mr. Maris, chief executive of GV, which was formerly known as Google Ventures, is being succeeded by Google veteran and GV Managing Partner David Krane, effective Friday, according to a person familiar with the matter.

No explanation was immediately given for Mr. Maris's departure.

It follows word last week that Chris Urmson, chief technology officer and former director of Google's self-driving car effort, had left the project at a crucial juncture as the company tries to transition its driverless-car technology into a commercial product. He gave no clear reason for his departure or a hint of his destination.

In June, Tony Fadell stepped down as CEO of Alphabet Inc.'s home-automation unit, Nest.

Mr. Maris has no new career plans yet and plans to spend time with his family before starting something new, the person familiar with the matter said. Mr. Maris's departure and the installation of Mr. Krane to the role, which were reported earlier Wednesday by Recode, were scheduled to be announced to the GV staff on Thursday.

Mr. Krane, who has been with Google for 17 years, led the first public relations role at the search giant. He had already been effectively running the day-to-day activities of GV, with Mr. Maris somewhat stepped back in the role.

The GV venture-capital funds manage $2.4 billion and have placed over 300 bets on startups across U.S. and abroad.

Tapping Mr. Krane, a gregarious leader, could lead to a different focus on investments but would unlikely change the overall mix of investments GV makes, the person familiar with the thinking said. Mr. Krane was behind GV's investment in ride-hailing giant Uber Technologies Inc., as well as Nest and coffee maker Blue Bottle.

Mr. Krane's influence in the new role could lead to an increased focus on consumer-related technology investment, the person said.

GV's overall focus on five sectors -- life sciences, enterprise, data and artificial intelligence, robotics, and consumer -- will remain unchanged under the new chief.

Delivery Agent has laid off employees from the dot-com era e-commerce company.

San Francisco-based Delivery Agent has let go of 39 employees, according to a person familiar with the matter. The layoffs, which began in June and affected employees based in Charlottesville, Va., come a year after the company had dismissed 20 employees, the person said.

Representatives for Delivery Agent didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

Delivery Agent provides e-commerce, advertising and analytics services. The company's services include e-commerce over TV and merchandising services for bands. The company has offices in Los Angeles, New York and Colorado.

Venture-backed Delivery Agent's investors include Bessemer Venture Partners, Intel Capital, Liberty Global Ventures, Pinnacle Ventures, Newbury Ventures, Coral Group and Focus Ventures.

The company has secured about $127 million in total funding. In December, it raised an $8 million Series G down round at a $168 million post-money valuation, according to market researcher PitchBook. That compares with the $191 million valuation set at its previous financing.

Economists in Survey Say Election Will Factor in September Fed Decision; More than half say the election will weigh on Fed officials at their next meeting Sept. 20-21

More than half the economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal in August said November's presidential election is one of several factors that could make the Federal Reserve less likely to raise short-term interest rates in September.

Fed officials have long maintained they don't consider political developments such as elections as they debate monetary policy. Policy makers repeatedly have said their decisions are "data-dependent," meaning they will strive to do what is best for the economy based on the most recent figures.

But 36 of the 60 survey respondents said the election would weigh on Fed officials at their next meeting Sept. 20-21. The fear of startling financial markets and setting off an economic shock that could affect the outcome of an election causes central bankers to hold off in the immediate run-up to the vote, some observers said.

Although economic data would be "far more important" in determining whether the Fed takes action next month, the election "cannot be ignored entirely," said Sean Snaith, an economist at the University of Central Florida.

The two major party candidates have proposed "http://graphics.wsj.com/elections/2016/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-on-the-economy/". While both propose more government spending, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton has called for raising taxes on high earners and overhauling the corporate tax system to generate more revenue, while her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, wants to cut taxes across the board.

A Moody's Analytics report found that "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/07/29/hillary-clintons-policies-would-boost-growth-and-budget-deficits-new-analysis-says/" would boost employment by 3.2 million jobs while spurring economic growth and adding slightly to the national deficit. "http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2016/06/20/u-s-economy-would-be-diminished-under-trumps-economic-plan-new-analysis-says/" would cause a prolonged recession and lead to big deficits, the firm said in a separate report.

"From a monetary policy perspective, this is the most problematic presidential election in modern history," said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group. "When faced with such a glaring unknown, the Fed should lie low until December."

Earlier this month, New York Fed President William Dudley took the unusual step of recognizing that the uncertainty around the election could have an effect on the economy.

"Although I expect business fixed investment to begin to grow again in the second half, it will likely remain soft as profits have stagnated and election year uncertainty could act as an additional depressant," he said.

Other Fed officials, though, have stuck by their contention that the election plays no role in their assessment of the economy.

"We are very focused on assessing the economic outlook and making changes that are appropriate without taking politics into account," Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen said in a June 15 press conference.

Fed Vice Chairman Stanley Fischer echoed that sentiment two weeks later.

"We will do what we have to do in accordance with the law," he said. "We are not going to get into,  Oh, it's the elections, we can't do anything.'"

History shows the central bank will adjust policy even in presidential election years. The Fed raised rates "http://www.wsj.com/articles/feds-john-williams-says-election-wont-stop-central-bank-from-acting-on-rates-1463933622" of 1984, 1988, 2000 and 2004 and cut interest rates in 1992 and 2008. In 2012, the central bank launched the third round of its controversial bond-buying program known as quantitative easing.

In the past 30 years, 1996 is the only election year during which the Fed made no major policy moves.

Quants are so hot right now.

Goldman Sachs  money management has poached a senior BlackRock fund executive to lead its quantitative strategist group, highlighting the demand for fund managers that use more computer-driven approaches to managing money, reports Robin Wigglesworth in New York.

According to an internal memo seen by the FT, Goldman Sachs Asset Management has appointed Michael Turok to head its 25-strong  QIS Strats  group, where he will focus in particular on developing GSAM s  Big Data  applications, and boosting its efforts in artificial intelligence fields like natural language processing and machine learning.

Mr Turok is currently head of BlackRock s quantitative fixed income portfolio strategies, and before that the head of Bank of America Merrill Lynch s quant strategist group. The electrical engineer previously worked at Goldman s securities division from 1997-2010. He will join GSAM in the fourth quarter.

Interactions Corp., a startup providing artificial-intelligence technology for customer service call centers, has raised a $56 million round of funding co-led by new investors Revolution Growth Partners, NewSpring Capital and Comcast Ventures.

Ted Leonsis, a partner and co-founder at Revolution Growth, said he thought Interactions could go public one day. Mr. Leonsis described the Series G funding as "speed-up capital," and said he expected an exit "much sooner" than his firm's five-to-seven-year investment horizon.

With the new capital, the 300-employee company will make hires in sales, marketing, provisioning, research and development. Chief Executive Michael Iacobucci declined to disclose whether the company is profitable. Its customers include TXU Energy , LifeLock , Asurion, Humana , Hyatt Hotels and EyeMed.

One of its main competitors is Nuance Communications Inc ., a publicly traded provider of speech and imaging applications with over 13,000 employees.

Founded in 2004, Interactions provides artificial technology to help business automate their customer service, including the speech and natural-language technology used by call centers. The Franklin, Mass.-based company is in the process of building a data center in Germany to house data from its European operations.

The company has raised a total of $167 million, including the new funding. Previous backers include Jackson Square Ventures, Updata Partners, Cross Atlantic Capital Partners and North Hill Ventures .

India tech: Reality call

Deepinder Goyal had a moment of horror last year when he received an email from a would-be entrepreneur seeking funding.

 [The idea] was Uber for water: if you want a bottle of water, I have an app for you and I can deliver it within 10 minutes,  says Mr Goyal, founder of Zomato, an Indian restaurant search platform.  On a bottle of water the margin is about two rupees 	. 	. 	. 	there is no way that can work. He was looking for a $1m seed round at an $8.5m valuation. That is what we had created. 

Mr Goyal, whose company last year raised money from foreign investors who "http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2015/10/16/2142415/a-zomato-going-rotten/" has had a front-row view of an exuberant rush of funding into India s fast-growing internet sector over the past three years.

Having struck gold in Chinese ecommerce, foreign investors such as Japan s SoftBank and New York-based Tiger Global Management turned their sights on India and pumped in billions of dollars, betting on its huge population, rapid growth in internet penetration and strong economic growth.

By last year India had amassed eight  unicorns , or unlisted companies valued at more than $1bn   behind only the US and China. The funding wave was a conspicuous vote of confidence in "http://www.ft.com/global-economy/india" now the fastest-growing of any major nation, and in its ability to use technology to skip over 20th-century concepts such as hypermarkets, while driving higher living standards.

 India never really had modern retail, so the leapfrog that will happen is quite compelling,  says Sanjeev Aggarwal, co-founder of Helion Venture Partners, an Indian venture capital group.  This is day one of India s consumption going digital. 

But both investors and companies now talk of a conspicuous cooling of sentiment, amid fears that the funding rush has led to widespread overvaluation. There has been concern about the scale of losses at some of the companies, stiff competition from foreign rivals and the knock-on effect on other markets of tech investment writedowns. Some businesses are shedding staff and withdrawing job offers as they adjust to a world in which exuberant foreign investors can no longer be relied on to underwrite losses indefinitely.

 If you d asked me   when we got the round   do you deserve the $1bn, I d have said absolutely not,  says Mr Goyal.  But for anything, the value is about how much you want it. And then the market changed and suddenly everyone is sceptical about everything. 

Chinese parallels

When the influential venture capitalist Mary Meeker presented her "http://www.kpcb.com/internet-trends" on web trends in June, she provided two estimates for internet usage growth in 2015: one stripped out India, which was growing so fast that it distorted the sluggish worldwide figure.

The number of web users reached about 317m last October, 49 per cent higher than a year earlier, according to Ms Meeker, citing data from the Internet and Mobile Association of India. This growth was driven by smartphones, of which sales in India increased at a rate of 12 per cent in the first quarter of this year, while they stagnated or even fell globally, according to research groups.

The smartphone boom has attracted the attention of tech leaders such as Tim Cook, the Apple chief executive, who made his first visit to India in May, and it is inspiring excitement among analysts about the outlook for ecommerce growth in the country. Most bullish is Morgan Stanley, which predicted in February that total sales in the sector will grow to $119bn by 2020, up from about $16bn last year.

Such optimism has been fuelled partly by the dramatic rise of Chinese ecommerce groups such as Tencent, JD.com and especially Alibaba, which undertook the biggest ever initial public offering last year.

But investors and entrepreneurs in India warn that any parallel should be treated with extreme caution.  I was very surprised that all these funds were so naive in treating India just like China,  says Kashyap Deorah, a serial technology entrepreneur and author of a book on the  hyperfunding  of Indian internet groups.

India s lower level of development   its per capita gross domestic product was $1,617 last year, against China s $7,990, according to the International Monetary Fund   is one obvious difference. Just as important, Mr Deorah says, is the fact that US internet groups have struggled to make themselves felt in China.

Google, Facebook and Twitter are all unavailable to most Chinese internet users but have won dominant positions in India, limiting the space for local players. Even where Indian start-ups have stolen a march on US rivals, some have seen that lead rapidly eroded.

American rivals

In September 2014, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos clambered on top of a gaudily painted truck in Bangalore wearing a white Indian wedding suit, and handed a giant cheque for $2bn   symbolising planned investment in the country   to Amit Agarwal, whom he had sent to run its Indian operation.

The hilarity of the pantomime-style performance may have been lost on Flipkart co-founders Sachin and Binny Bansal, former employees of Mr Bezos who now found themselves in his competitive crosshairs.

The Bansals   unrelated despite having a surname in common   met while working for Amazon at its Bangalore campus, which then provided back-office support. In 2007, with Amazon showing no sign of launching sales in India, the two men decided to put the company s playbook into practice.

Just like Amazon, Flipkart honed its service by selling books before branching into other products, and after a slow start began attracting investor attention. In 2009 it raised funding that valued it at $4m; in 2010 at $50m; in 2012 at $1bn, and in July last year, at $15bn, making it by far India s highest-valued internet company.  In terms of market share, funding and the brand we have been able to build up in a very short amount of time,  Sachin Bansal told the Financial Times this year.

But losses have also grown rapidly. Flipkart s most recent regulatory filings in Singapore, where it is domiciled, show revenue of Rs102bn ($1.5bn) in the year ending in March 2015, with a pre-tax loss of Rs29.8bn   up from the previous year s figures of Rs29.4bn and Rs10.3bn respectively.

And although the heady investor enthusiasm for Flipkart continued long after Amazon s entry to the market, it is now showing clear signs of fading amid rapid growth at Amazon India, which received an additional $3bn funding pledge from Mr Bezos in June.

A fund run by Morgan Stanley has twice this year marked down its stake in Flipkart, giving it a sharply lower valuation of $9.4bn, and other shareholders have made similar moves.

Funding trends suggest a broad turn in sentiment. In the nine months to the end of June, Indian technology companies raised $3.1bn, down from $6.7bn in the preceding nine months, according to Tracxn, a research company.

Chief executives and investors say the slowdown was triggered in part by sharp falls in US and Chinese technology stocks last summer, and most argue that well-run Indian tech companies will still be able to raise capital, with funding far from drying up. ShopClues, an ecommerce platform, in January became India s ninth unicorn through a financing round led by GIC, Singapore s sovereign wealth fund.

But even Sandeep Aggarwal, a co-founder of ShopClues, perceives a chillier funding environment.  The fear of missing out was so great that [investors] went for spray and pray,  he says.  And when the market started slowing, reality hit them in the face. 

That blow was especially violent for Nikesh Arora, the former Google executive who became one of the most prominent investors in the Indian tech sector after being recruited by SoftBank in 2014. Within weeks of his appointment as president, Mr Arora led investments of more than $800m in Flipkart rival Snapdeal and in Ola, a competitor to Uber in ride-hailing, and made further large capital injections into other Indian tech companies.

But shareholder unease grew as Snapdeal fell far behind Flipkart and Amazon in sales. Ola slashed its prices to fend off a fierce assault from Uber, which is set to redouble its focus on India having sold its Chinese business to rival Didi Chuxing last week.

Mr Arora resigned from SoftBank in June shortly after being cleared by an internal investigation prompted by anonymous investor allegations of improper conduct, largely in relation to his Indian investments. Mr Arora and SoftBank deny that his departure was linked to these complaints, but his brief career at the Japanese group is viewed by some investors in India as a cautionary tale that sums up the rollercoaster ride of the past two years.

The quieter funding market of recent months has come as a relief to some entrepreneurs.

 We re very happy that phase has ended. In the long run that s the right thing for the company and for the country,  says Rohit Bansal, co-founder of Snapdeal.  No company can exist just by raising money from investors. 

Global battleground

Despite their newfound global status, China s leading ecommerce companies have been slow to make incursions abroad. In India, their expansion has been limited to portfolio investments: Didi Chuxing took a stake in its counterpart Ola while Alibaba invested in Snapdeal and in PayTM, a payments and ecommerce business.

However, Alibaba announced in March that it planned to start operating in India as soon as this year and the country looks set to become the first major market to host a full-on fight for supremacy between US, Chinese and local ecommerce companies, says Nandan Nilekani, co-founder of Infosys, the IT services group. Now a venture capital investor, Mr Nilekani argues that companies that have niches least exposed to well-resourced foreign competitors are best placed to succeed.

Among these are groups tailoring their offerings to the many millions of Indians taking their first steps online, typically through newly acquired, low-cost smartphones. Such companies include DailyHunt, a news aggregator that provides content in local languages rather than English.

Asked to demonstrate the product, Virendra Gupta, DailyHunt s chief executive, reaches for his unfashionable mid-range Chinese smartphone, waiting patiently while its basic 2G data connection grapples with downloads. For Mr Gupta such inconvenience is part of an effort to understand his target audience. With his focus on the  next 400m  Indian web users, he has little patience for questions such as how many Indian companies deserve a $1bn valuation.

 People get into a mad rush when there is [a successful model] somewhere else and they just put a multiplier around it,  he says.  It s important for people who invest in the companies to realise: the growth will happen, but India just takes a bit more time. Throwing money doesn t solve problems.

Intel, Apple Add to Artificial-Intelligence  Deal Wave; Chip giant to buy Nervana Systems on heels of iPhone maker's Turi acquisition

Technology companies are hurriedly snapping up startups in the field of artificial intelligence, and Intel Corp. is the latest to join a buying spree fueled by one of the hottest trends in the tech sector.

The chip maker on Tuesday announced plans to pay an undisclosed amount for Nervana Systems, a 48-employee company working on semiconductors, software and services to exploit a popular AI technique called deep learning.

Intel's move follows "http://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-buys-machine-learning-startup-turi-1470448718" by Apple Inc. to purchase Turi Inc., a Seattle-based specialist in the field. The two acquisitions add to a string of 31 purchases since 2011 of AI startups by large companies, according to venture-capital research firm CB Insights. The firm lists buyers that include Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Twitter Inc., Yahoo Inc., International Business Machines Corp. and Salesforce.com Inc.

Factoring in smaller acquirers, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP counts 29 related acquisitions so far this year, suggesting the total deal count for 2016 will top the 37 deals announced last year.

"We are on a very swift and increasing pace," said Todson Page, the consulting and accounting firm's U.S. technology industry deals leader.

Industry executives link the deal activity to the rapidly widening applications of AI, a broad term referring to ways to make computers emulate attributes of the human brain. An initial cycle of excitement about the technology arose in the 1980s and later fizzled, but interest has boomed in recent years due to breakthroughs in the field known as machine learning, especially in the specific area of deep learning.

Instead of programming machines explicitly to, say, recognize a human face, deep learning allows computers to learn to perform the task by analyzing vast troves of images of faces. Apple, for instance, uses deep learning to analyze speech commands issued to Siri, the software used for a variety of tasks on iPhones. Other applications include detecting credit-card fraud, interpreting medical images, studying crop growth, and enabling drones and self-driving cars to navigate.

"AI is about to transform industry after industry," said Andrew Ng, a deep-learning pioneer who is chief scientist at Baidu Inc. and an associate professor at Stanford University. Dollar figures for the AI acquisition binge are hard to come by as are figures for individual AI transactions because the big-tech companies are swooping in on startups before they have built market valuations of a size that buyers would be compelled to disclose. The buyers need talent more than technology, Mr. Ng said, since today's AI products quickly will need to be updated.Google, which led its peers with nine purchases, according to CB Insights, mined the AI research community in 2013 by buying DNNresearch, a company helmed by the influential University of Toronto AI researcher Geoffrey Hinton.Intel has special motivations. While its Xeon chips handle most computing tasks in data centers, rival Nvidia Corp. has popularized chips known as graphics processing units, or GPUs, to more quickly handle specialized chores associated with deep learning.

The following year, Google"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304691904579345641537039368", a London-based startup founded by Cambridge University graduates that some publications pegged at a price tag of more than $400 million. The DeepMind team developed AlphaGo, the AI software that made headlines earlier this year by defeating a South Korean master of the game Go.

Apple helped to ignite the recent consumer AI boom following "http://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2010/04/28/apple-moves-deeper-into-voice-activated-search-with-siri-buy/". In buying Turi, the company stands to benefit from the expertise of Chief Executive Carlos Guestrin, who holds a University of Washingtonmachine learning professorship endowed by Amazon.com Inc.

Industry executives say an array of other companies feel a need to counter AI results at younger companies such as Google and Facebook Inc.

"They are arming up," said Matt Ocko, a managing partner at the venture-capital firm Data Collective, which invested in Nervana.

The pressures are particularly acute on companies that manage vast amounts of images or sounds, said Greg Papadopoulos, a venture partner at New Enterprise Associates, an investor in Turi. Companies that don't step up activity through acquisitions, he said, soon will face serious competitive threats.

Nervana, which divides its staff between the California cities of San Diego and Palo Alto, has AI software that exploits GPUs but also expects to deliver a chip next year it says can complete deep-learning tasks even more quickly.

Jason Waxman, a corporate vice president in Intel's data-center group, declined to say how it might use Nervana's chips. But Naveen Rao, Nervana's chief executive and co-founder, said Intel had unique manufacturing and technical expertise to help propagate the startup's technology.

"No matter how much money we raised, we would not have access to the same kind of technology as we will have at Intel," Mr. Rao said.

Dentsu To Buy Majority Stake in Data Marketing Firm Merkle

Dentsu Inc .'s Dentsu Aegis Network has agreed to acquire a majority stake in data marketing firm Merkle, as the Japanese advertising conglomerate continues its aggressive buying spree.

Baltimore-based Merkle specializes in so-called "customer relationship marketing," which includes crafting loyalty programs for marketers and managing their vast customer databases that hold reams of consumer information. It also offers a host of other digital marketing and technology services including search advertising and data-driven ad buying and analytics.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed but people familiar with the matter said the cash deal has an enterprise value of roughly $1.5 billion when including Merkle's debt.

As part of the agreement, Dentsu said it will buy a Merkle stake held by private-equity firm Technology Crossover Ventures , as well as other Merkle shares held by other shareholders. Merkle's management and employees expect to retain a "significant" minority stake in the firm.

Closely held Merkle had $436 million in revenue in 2015 and works on behalf of companies such as MetLife Inc ., Geico Corp ., and Dell Inc . In recent years, it has invested in ad and marketing technologies to help power its clients' campaigns. Its systems are closely integrated with Facebook , for example, so Merkle could help target ads for a retailer using the data the retailer collects from its customers such as email addresses.

Dentsu was attracted to Merkle, in part, for its data capabilities, which allow Merkle to develop highly targeted marketing efforts for its clients based on data it has on consumers.

"Their ability to develop people-based-marketing highlights where this business is going," said Jerry Buhlmann , chief executive officer of Dentsu Aegis Network. "Convergence is driving our business towards a much greater level of addressability."

Merkle is the latest deal in a long string of acquisitions by Dentsu , the fifth-largest ad company in the world, by revenue. It is seeking to reduce its dependence on its home market of Japan, which isn't growing as fast as other countries.

Dentsu derived 54.3% of its business from markets outside of Japan in fiscal 2015, up from 15% in fiscal 2012. Its shopping spree went into high gear in 2013 with its $5 billion acquisition of U.K.-based Aegis Group PLC , a big player in the ad buying space. Dentsu has signed over 80 deals in the past three years.

Last month, it bought Gyro, one of the largest independent ad firms that specializes in business-to-business advertising. Its other acquisitions this year have included digital analytics firm Cardinal Path, digital agency Flock, and sports marketing firm Alesport Group.

The company said it has no plans to abandon that strategy. "We are still continuing to use acquisitions to accelerate our growth" and bolster Dentsu 's product suite, added Mr. Buhlmann, pointing to areas of continued interest such as social marketing, mobile and data marketing.

Merkle decided to sell to Dentsu because the ad company will be able to help Merkle expand in overseas markets with the help of its big footprint around the globe. Merkle has been trying to expand in Europe and Asia.

"To be able to bring capital to support our own acquisition strategy is a big part of this deal," said David Williams, Merkle's chief executive officer.

Dentsu Aegis was advised on the transaction by Lazard while Merkle was advised by Evercore.

Dentsu Inc .'s Dentsu Aegis Network has agreed to acquire a majority stake in data marketing firm Merkle, as the Japanese advertising conglomerate continues its aggressive buying spree.

Baltimore-based Merkle specializes in so-called "customer relationship marketing," which includes crafting loyalty programs for marketers and managing their vast customer databases that hold reams of consumer information. It also offers a host of other digital marketing and technology services including search advertising and data-driven ad buying and analytics.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed but people familiar with the matter said the cash deal has an enterprise value of roughly $1.5 billion when including Merkle's debt.

As part of the agreement, Dentsu said it will buy a Merkle stake held by private equity firm Technology Crossover Ventures , as well as other Merkle shares held by other shareholders. Merkle's management and employees expect to retain a "significant" minority stake in the firm.

Closely-held Merkle had $436 million in revenue in 2015 and works on behalf of companies such as MetLife Inc ., Geico Corp ., and Dell Inc . In recent years, it has invested in ad and marketing technologies to help power its clients' campaigns.

Axa Investment Managers has begun analysing news articles to help the French asset manager predict market movements and better gauge the performance of the companies in which it invests.

The  679bn fund house said it is trialling a system to monitor news announcements and is in discussions with a San Francisco-based data analytics company to help it beat the market and give it an advantage over competitors.

Jeremy Baskin, chief executive of Axa's  19bn quantitative investing arm, Axa Rosenberg, said he had considered the move before, but the tools to monitor news have now become more cost effective.

"What has changed is that natural-language analytics and technology are just cheaper and more readily available," he said.

"We have already been looking at credit card data and transactional data and we have begun that assessment for news items."

Mainstream asset managers have been slower than banks and hedge funds to experiment with artificially intelligent data tools that can read tweets, news articles and other non-traditional information on the internet to inform investment decisions.

But a growing number of fund houses have begun to look at newsflow analytics and other online data sources in an attempt to cut costs and improve performance.

BlackRock, the world's largest fund house, said in October that it had entered into talks with Google, the technology company, to explore how big data can improve its investment decisions. BlackRock declined to comment.

Many quantitative managers are still sceptical. "Big-data tools just track what happens and do not ask for the reason why things happen," said Matthew Stemp, head of client relations at Berenberg Bank.

Startup Rolls Out System to Pay With Fingerprints

The 1980s movie "Back to the Future Part II" transports viewers to a 2015 where people pay for cab rides with the swipe of a finger.

In the real 2016, fingerprints have entered the mainstream as a way to log on to smart devices, but it's still difficult to pay for rides or at the cash register with just a finger.

To be successful, a payment system would have to match the print against a database that may contain thousands or millions of other prints, and -- to keep impatient customers happy -- do it within seconds.

That's the challenge Yasuhiro Kuda says his Tokyo-based startup, Liquid Inc., has addressed. Backed by the Japanese government and some of the nation's biggest names in finance and technology -- including the venture-capital arms of banking giant Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and cellphone provider NTT DoCoMo Inc. -- Liquid is rolling out a fingerprint-payment system at retailers in Japan and elsewhere in Asia.

Biometrics -- identification through fingerprints, veins, facial features or any other pattern unique to each individual -- has long been considered an ideal form of authentication.

Most biometric systems used by consumers today, including the fingerprint ID used to unlock an Apple Inc. iPhone or iPad, deliver "1:1" identification. The iPhone knows only one fingerprint -- the owner's -- and checks for a match with the one finger on the touch button.

Liquid's system is an example of more-difficult "1:N" identification, which requires finding a match between the fingerprint offered and a large database of prints.

Thanks to artificial-intelligence techniques including "deep learning" -- in which programs figure out on their own how to improve -- Liquid's system can deliver fast and accurate 1:N authentication, Mr. Kuda said.

One business testing Liquid's system is Huis Ten Bosch Co., the operator of a theme park in southern Japan. Season-pass holders who let the park take their fingerprints can pay for food and rides inside the park with just a touch. Though only a few have tried the system, implementation has been "very smooth," a spokeswoman said.

Fingerprint Payment Shows Gains

TOKYO -- The 1980s movie "Back to the Future Part II" transports viewers to a 2015 where people pay for cab rides with the swipe of a finger.

In the real 2016, fingerprints have entered the mainstream as a way to log on to smart devices, but it's still difficult to pay for rides or at the cash register with just a finger.

To be successful, a payment system would have to match the print against a database that may contain thousands or millions of other prints, and -- to keep impatient customers happy -- do it within seconds.

That's the challenge Yasuhiro Kuda says his Tokyo-based startup, Liquid Inc., has addressed. Backed by the Japanese government and some of the nation's biggest names in finance and technology -- including the venture-capital arms of banking giant Mizuho Financial Group Inc. and cellphone provider NTT DoCoMo Inc. -- Liquid is rolling out a fingerprint-payment system at retailers in Japan and elsewhere in Asia, including Sri Lanka and the Philippines.

"Biometrics is convenient but it's not widely used as much as it should be," said Mr. Kuda, a 31-year-old Okinawa native who used to work at a Japanese brokerage.

Biometrics -- identification through fingerprints, veins, facial features or any other pattern unique to each individual -- has long been considered an ideal form of authentication.

Research firm Tractica predicts the global biometrics market will expand to $14.9 billion by 2024 from $2 billion in 2015.

The difficulty lies in the fuzziness of the information. A computer can quickly confirm whether the digital data on a credit-card magnetic strip or chip matches an entry in a database of card holders. It isn't so easy to match the patterns on a fingertip.

Most biometric systems used by consumers today, including the fingerprint ID used to unlock an Apple Inc. iPhone or iPad, deliver "1:1" identification.

The iPhone knows only one fingerprint -- the owner's -- and checks for a match with the one finger on the touch button.

In another kind of 1:1 identification, a person first presents a physical card or ID number, then offers a fingerprint as confirmation.

This method may not be the most convenient for consumers, but it offers security benefits because a criminal would need both to copy the victim's fingerprint and steal the person's ID, said Marios Savvides, director of Cylab Biometrics Center at Carnegie Mellon University.

Liquid's system is an example of more-difficult "1:N" identification, which requires finding a match between the fingerprint offered and a large database of prints. This is nothing new for police departments, which use 1:N systems to check fingerprints taken at crime scenes. The difference is that Liquid can't wait a day for the crime lab, and it must rule out all the prints in the database except the match.

Thanks to artificial-intelligence techniques including "deep learning" -- in which programs figure out on their own how to improve -- Liquid's system can deliver fast and accurate 1:N authentication, Mr. Kuda said. He said the fingerprint readers can distinguish between prints from a living human and those imprinted in, say, gelatin or clay.

One business testing Liquid's system is Huis Ten Bosch Co., the operator of a theme park in southern Japan. Season-pass holders who let the park take their fingerprints can pay for food and rides inside the park with just a touch.

Though only a few have tried the system, implementation has been "very smooth," a spokeswoman said.

In June, Liquid teamed up with Japanese telecommunications operator KDDI Corp. on a service for travelers visiting Tokyo's Ikebukuro shopping district. They can register their fingerprints and credit cards when they check into their hotel, then shop or even rent a car using just a finger.

The government is backing the service, hoping it can be introduced more widely by the time the city hosts the 2020 Summer Olympics.

"It looks interesting and we have never done it before, so wanted to give it a try," said Chien Yu Lin, a 24-year-old visiting with her parents from Taiwan.

Some experts aren't sure Mr. Kuda's ideas are realistic.

"It is not useful for commercial verification without sacrifices in speed and accuracy," said William Saito, an entrepreneur who has worked on biometric technology and advises the Japanese government on cybersecurity.

Such doubts could lead merchants using Liquid's system to require a second form of identification, such as a card -- undercutting the simplicity of Mr. Kuda's technology.

Gartner analyst Ant Allan said he isn't aware of competitors offering similar services, but added that market interest has yet to develop. For that to happen, he said, Liquid must build trust incrementally.

Other tech companies say they're working on 1:N, but with institutional customers in mind.

Former Barclays chief Jenkins joins digital forex venture; Financial services

Former Barclays chief Antony Jenkins has joined a digital provider of foreign exchange and payment services in his first company directorship since leaving the bank last year.

Mr Jenkins, who was ousted from Barclays last July after reports of a disagreement about the future of the investment banking division, has become chairman of Currencies Direct.

His appointment comes a year after the fintech group was acquired by private equity firms Corsair Capital and Palamon Capital Partners in a deal that valued Currencies Direct at over 200m.

In his role, Mr Jenkins aims to help steer the company through what he believes is a digital revolution in financial services.

"We are seeing a time where technology has evolved to a point where it is creating a truly transformational customer experience," he says.

However, he warns that traditional high street banks need to change their culture to deal with the "tsunami" of new technology that threatens to disrupt their business.

He estimates the number of branches and staff employed in the financial services sector could drop by as much as 50 per cent over the next decade.

Digital developments such as artificial intelligence will drive automation through banks, he says, replacing the need for as many staff. Customer demand for mobile is also causing a rapid decrease in branch footfall.

His comments come after the Bank of England cut the base rate to a record low of 0.25 per cent, putting further pressure on banks' profit margins. To compensate, lenders are set to make more aggressive cost cuts. Last week, Lloyds revealed it would close a further 200 branches and cut 3,000 jobs.

Royal Bank of Scotland chief Ross McEwan said yesterday, after the bank posted a 2bn net loss in the first half, that in the low-interest rate environment "clearly income will be lower therefore we will have to look at costs."

Mr Jenkins says: "It is incredibly hard for incumbents to change their business model . . . People inside the banks have a clear view of how things have already been done. It's less risky to continue with the status quo."

Cambridge's Tech Hub Generates Successes and Growing Pains; The historic college town has transformed into a modern tech hub

CAMBRIDGE, England After a long push inspired by Silicon Valley, this centuries-old college town has taken on a new role as a modern, tech-industry hub.

The reward has been a flood of jobs and money. The downsides have been the same sort of housing and traffic strains beleaguering the San Francisco Bay Area. Another, more recent complaint by some locals: Foreigners keep snapping up the best companies that have sprouted here.

Cambridge's tech bona fides were validated afresh last month when Japanese telecommunications giant SoftBank Group Corp. "http://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-bets-on-internet-of-things-with-arm-deal-1468946389" for ARM Holdings PLC. The "http://www.wsj.com/articles/arms-race-to-the-top-started-with-integration-1468837394" in more than 95% of the world's smartphones.

That deal follows the acquisitions of other, well-known Cambridge-affiliated firms by some of America's tech titans. In 2011, Hewlett-Packard"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903596904576517690864419816" for Autonomy Corp., an analytics-software developer that, at the time, was Britain's reigning tech darling. That deal ended in acrimony after Hewlett-Packard"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324352004578130712448913412", an allegation Autonomy's founder is "http://www.wsj.com/articles/autonomy-former-ceo-sues-h-p-for-more-than-150-million-1443724340".

More recently, Alphabet Inc.'s Google"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304691904579345641537039368"DeepMind Technologies Ltd., a giant in the world of artificial intelligence. Microsoft Corp. "http://www.wsj.com/articles/microsofts-swiftkey-acquisition-could-make-mobile-apps-more-productive-1454538400" SwiftKey, which designs smartphone keyboards that try to predict what a person is typing.

"I'm happy at some level to have great U.K. tech successes," said Andy Hopper, the head of the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory. He was research director at Acorn Computers Ltd., which helped build ARM. On the other hand, he said he fears ARM will be vulnerable "http://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-shares-tumble-as-investors-question-32-billion-arm-deal-1468902976". SoftBank has pledged to double the size of ARM's 1,600-employee British workforce in five years.

There is a new potential challenge to Cambridge as a global tech hub: Brexit. Some industry players, including Mr. Hopper, worry the U.K.'s vote in June to leave the European Union, could damp Cambridge's tech clout if it makes it harder for EU citizens to work in the U.K. At the same time, British venture capitalists say the plummeting pound, a collateral effect of Brexit, may also make U.K. tech firms more attractive to foreign takeovers.

The city's recent tech offspring has helped Cambridge punch above its weight. It remains a "http://www.wsj.com/articles/oxford-catches-up-to-cambridge-in-tech-1445904044", for instance, a key benchmark for cities aspiring to be the next Silicon Valley.

Venture-backed companies in the area raised $317 million in equity financing in the first half of 2016, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. By comparison, venture-backed companies in London raised $1.2 billion. Those in the Bay Area hauled in $9 billion over the same period.

Still, Cambridge has become the pride of the U.K. tech industry, which dubs the area "Silicon Fen," a nod to both its budding computer-engineering sector and age-old marshes. About 57,000 people work at more than 1,500 local tech firms with a combined annual revenue of more than 13 billion, according to estimates from the University of Cambridge, which has helped foster the tech boom.

Founded in 1209, the University of Cambridge is the English-speaking world's second-oldest university behind the University of Oxford, which is about 100 years older. Over the centuries, the university here played host to a variety of innovators including physicists Isaac Newton and Stephen Hawking and poets John Milton and Lord Byron.

Just as Stanford University helped spur Silicon Valley, the University of Cambridge did the same starting in 1970. It used its lands and funds to establish the Cambridge Science Park to house and support high-tech businesses.

"They did look to Silicon Valley and Kendall Square" the area near the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in that other Cambridge, outside Boston "as something to aspire to," said Tony Raven, chief executive of Cambridge Enterprise Ltd., a university initiative that helps faculty and students commercialize tech-startup ideas.

The organization shares a building with IdeaSpace, an incubator and co-working space for Cambridge entrepreneurs, at the west end of campus. It is housed in a gleaming glass building, past the Cambridge Lawn Tennis Club and across from the university farm's wheat field.

The university's tech initiatives paralleled the rise of local tech firms such as Sinclair Computers, founded in 1973, and ARM, founded in 1990, that took advantage of the brain power graduating from Cambridge every June. Microsoft said it started a Cambridge lab in 1997 because of the city's "rich history as a center of higher learning and growing global impact as a leading high-tech hub."

London-based pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca PLC is in the midst of moving its global research-and-development center from near Manchester, England, to Cambridge, where it plans to have 2,000 employees.

Now Cambridge is experiencing classic boomtown stresses. The median price of a Cambridge house in the second quarter of 2015 was 360,000 (about $476,633 at current exchange rates), up 47% from 245,000 from the same period in 2010, according to government data. That outpaced rising prices in London. The median rental rate of a private-market, one-bedroom flat in Cambridge for the year ended September 2015 was 900 a month, the highest rate in England outside London, according to government data.

Eben Upton, founder of the nonprofit Raspberry Pi Foundation, known for its $5 computers, said the 10-mile, rush-hour drive to his central Cambridge office takes 45 minutes, or just five minutes less than cycling. "There's a need for some sort of plausible transportation strategy," Mr. Upton said.

Mr. Raven, the Cambridge Enterprise chief, said the U.K. lacks the infrastructure deep-pocketed venture-capital firms or corporate investors with tech-sector expertise needed to keep promising companies under local control. He said this has extended a British problem that predates the modern tech industry.

"We came up with penicillin. We came up with the jet engine," Mr. Raven said. "If you look across the world, the great technologies were designed by the British, but they were not exploited by the British."

Tracy's Take: Post-Postcrisis Bank of England, Again, Cuts Capital Requirements; The move is seen likely to further inflame the debate over postcrisis regulation

U.K. regulators have once again fiddled with bank capital rules as they try to keep the country's economy on track after the vote to exit the European Union, a move likely to further inflame the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/decision-to-loosen-u-k-banks-capital-constraints-divides-experts-1468874551".

The little-noticed shift finalized Thursday "http://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-england-cuts-key-interest-rate-to-new-low-1470309155" underscores the dilemma facing central banks struggling to balance their sometimes-competing goals of shoring up financial stability and shoring up growth.

Specifically, the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority said it would allow banks to exclude reserves held at central banks from their calculation of the "leverage ratio,' a key measurement of bank capital adopted globally after the financial crisis.

"The U.K. has recognized that applying their leverage ratio &endangers monetary policy when interest rates are low and accommodative policy has reached its limits," said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of the policy analysis firm Federal Financial Analytics Inc., in an e-mail. "This is not a unique U.K. concern."

Ms. Petrou's firm has "http://www.fedfin.com/images/stories/client_reports/FedFin arguing the leverage ratio could create new risks.

While technical, the ratio lies at the heart of one of the most intensive debates between bankers and regulators.

The ratio measures equity capital as a percentage of a bank's total assets. Proponents say it is the best measure of bank capital because of its simplicity: Unlike other capital rules, it doesn't rely on complex calculations about which assets might pose a future risk.

Banks prefer the more complex rules, which can allow them to carry less loss-absorbing capital. They have for years argued that the leverage ratio doesn't make sense because it treats super safe assets the same as risky assets.

As evidence, they often point to reserves at central banks. The leverage ratio requires banks maintain the same amount of capital against those assets as they would a subprime mortgage. Banks argue that effectively discourages them from holding central bank reserves. If a riskier - but more profitable - asset counts the same under capital rules as a safe asset, why not hold the riskier asset instead?

It appears U.K. policy makers are sympathetic to the industry's argument that the leverage ratio could discourage banks from boosting their reserves. The BOE is trying to stimulate the U.K. economy in part by boosting the amount of cash banks have on hand to lend. For that policy to work, banks may need to boost the amount of cash they keep on reserve at the central bank.

The aim of the policy change "is to ensure that the leverage ratio does not act as a barrier to the effective implementation of policy measures that might lead to an increase in central bank reserves," the central bank said in a "http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2016/062.aspx" last week, before the new policy was made final by the PRA Thursday.

The U.K. move is likely to embolden skeptics of the leverage ratio at a crucial time. The Basel Committee of global regulators is "http://www.wsj.com/articles/basel-committee-weighs-both-a-tougher-standard-and-a-measure-to-water-it-down-1459933202". U.S. banks have so far been unsuccessful in their efforts to scale back the U.S. leverage ratio, which is far tougher on the very largest American banks than similar rules imposed in other countries.

Or's Take: Private Equity Warms Up to Managed Care; The need to control costs lures firms to the sector

Private equity is warming to managed care, betting that the doctors they back are so good they deserve to earn more.

Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Pamplona Capital Management over the past two years have backed physician groups that contract with commercial insurers and government agencies to manage part or all of a population's care at predetermined charge for each member, each month. The goal of such businesses is to keep expenses below total cash inflow and thus generate profits.

Private equity for years steered clear of managed-care providers because of the risks associated with their relatively unpredictable earnings, which often vary depending on how sick their patients get or how well they manage those patients, said Scott Bingham, a co-practice leader of advisory firm FTI Consulting's transaction advisory services group.

More recently, however, health-care reform has put greater pressure on hospitals and other providers to operate more efficiently by linking reimbursements to the quality of care. That shift has made managed care "much more interesting," said Jeremy Gelber, a partner at Pamplona Capital.

Reimbursements to managed-care providers can be four to six times those that typical fee-for-service providers get, said Ravi Sachdev, partner at CD&R, which recently backed Agilon Health, a managed care provider focused on Medicare and Medicaid patients.

Michael Loiacano, a partner who leads the health-care services practice at executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles International Inc., said that private-equity firms aren't only backing managed-care providers but also the technology companies that support them. Such businesses track patients' diagnoses and treatment, and monitor them to ensure a doctor's thousands of patients get the care they need.

"That's where reporting, logistics, analytics and big data can really support [a physician]," said Ronald Williams, the former chairman and chief executive of insurer Aetna Inc. who is now chairman of Agilon.

He added that "more care isn't always better care. Today, we have the metrics to demonstrate what care is better care and what care isn't."

Tech-Enabled Care-Management Company PopHealthCare Hires Bank to Seek Investor; Founder not looking to sell control of the company, said one person close to discussions

A number of private-equity firms are circling PopHealthCare LLC, a service provider that specializes in technology-enabled care management.

People familiar with the situation said that PopHealthCare, of Tempe, Ariz., hired investment bank Cain Brothers & Co. to help it find an investor to aid in its expansion plans.

One of the people said the founder of the privately owned company has no plans to sell PopHealthCare outright.

Two other people said PopHealthCare, which provides health analytics and risk adjustment services to payers and health-care providers, as well as provision-of-care services to high-risk populations, so far has garnered bids that value the company at up to $150 million.

PopHealthCare posted annual earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $7 million, the people said. A $150 million enterprise value translates to more than 20 times the company's Ebitda, reflecting keen interest among investors in new technologies that can improve the quality of care while driving down costs.

The company specializes in what it calls population management, which refers to an approach that aims to improve the health of a segment of the population through identifying patients who may run the risk of having serious health issues and providing them with preventive and clinical support, often in a lower cost setting.

The highest-risk population often incurs the most health-care spending. A 2014 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality study estimated that 5% of the nation's sickest population accounted for 50% of overall health-care expenditure.

Such proactive care management is also deemed to be the preferred mode of care going forward, as ongoing health-care reforms are altering the payment model to one based on the quality of care rather than on the volume of care provided.

The government has been a major driving force behind that shift. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services recently proposed a bundled payment system for treating heart attacks as well as hip and knee replacements, reimbursing physicians and providers a lump sum for the care of Medicare patients rather than billing for each individual service rendered during the course of care.

PopHealthCare, which also has an office in Nashville, Tenn., said on its website it partners with payers and health organizations on risk assessment and care delivery systems for high-risk populations, serving 40 health plans across 49 states in the U.S. and in Puerto Rico.

The company predominantly serves government payer clients under programs such as Medicare Advantage and managed Medicaid, as well as clients who are eligible for both Medicaid and Medicare. PopHealthCare also works with commercial health-exchange clients and in long-term care markets, including in facility-, home- and community-based care settings.

PopHealthCare in 2014 bought Educerus Health LLC, a provider of in-home screening programs focused on the evaluation and diagnosis of key chronic conditions for Medicare Advantage plans, an integrated care program for individuals in which private companies contract with Medicare.

PopHealthCare's management has experience in the managed-care field. Chief Executive Mike Tudeen previously served in the same position for care and care-management service provider Inspiris Ltd., which was backed by venture-capital firm River Cities Capital Funds. Founded in 1998, Inspiris served medically complex, chronically ill and elderly patients in Medicare, Medicaid and commercial insurance populations. Inspiris was "http://rccf.com/capital-fund-focus/healthcare-services/case-study-inspiris/"UnitedHealth Group Inc. in 2011.

Post-Postcrisis Bank of England, Again, Cuts Capital Requirements

U.K. regulators have once again fiddled with bank capital rules as they try to keep the country's economy on track after the vote to exit the European Union, a move likely to further inflame the "http://www.wsj.com/articles/decision-to-loosen-u-k-banks-capital-constraints-divides-experts-1468874551".

The little-noticed shift finalized Thursday "http://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-england-cuts-key-interest-rate-to-new-low-1470309155" underscores the dilemma facing central banks struggling to balance their sometimes-competing goals of shoring up financial stability and shoring up growth.

Specifically, the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority said it would allow banks to exclude reserves held at central banks from their calculation of the "leverage ratio,' a key measurement of bank capital adopted globally after the financial crisis.

"The U.K. has recognized that applying their leverage ratio &endangers monetary policy when interest rates are low and accommodative policy has reached its limits," said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of the policy analysis firm Federal Financial Analytics Inc., in an e-mail. "This is not a unique U.K. concern."

Ms. Petrou's firm has "http://www.fedfin.com/images/stories/client_reports/FedFin arguing the leverage ratio could create new risks.

While technical, the ratio lies at the heart of one of the most intensive debates between bankers and regulators.

The ratio measures equity capital as a percentage of a bank's total assets. Proponents say it is the best measure of bank capital because of its simplicity: Unlike other capital rules, it doesn't rely on complex calculations about which assets might pose a future risk.

Banks prefer the more complex rules, which can allow them to carry less loss-absorbing capital. They have for years argued that the leverage ratio doesn't make sense because it treats super safe assets the same as risky assets.

As evidence, they often point to reserves at central banks. The leverage ratio requires banks maintain the same amount of capital against those assets as they would a subprime mortgage. Banks argue that effectively discourages them from holding central bank reserves. If a riskier - but more profitable - asset counts the same under capital rules as a safe asset, why not hold the riskier asset instead?

It appears U.K. policy makers are sympathetic to the industry's argument that the leverage ratio could discourage banks from boosting their reserves. The BOE is trying to stimulate the U.K. economy in part by boosting the amount of cash banks have on hand to lend. For that policy to work, banks may need to boost the amount of cash they keep on reserve at the central bank.

The aim of the policy change "is to ensure that the leverage ratio does not act as a barrier to the effective implementation of policy measures that might lead to an increase in central bank reserves," the central bank said in a "http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/news/2016/062.aspx" last week, before the new policy was made final by the PRA Thursday.

The U.K. move is likely to embolden skeptics of the leverage ratio at a crucial time. The Basel Committee of global regulators is "http://www.wsj.com/articles/basel-committee-weighs-both-a-tougher-standard-and-a-measure-to-water-it-down-1459933202". U.S. banks have so far been unsuccessful in their efforts to scale back the U.S. leverage ratio, which is far tougher on the very largest American banks than similar rules imposed in other countries.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Justice Department Appeals Ruling Throwing Out Crisis-Era Bank of America Case

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-appeals-ruling-throwing-out-crisis-era-bank-of-america-case-1470344357" court to reconsider its ruling throwing out a civil mortgage-fraud case against Bank of America Corp., saying the court had "overlooked a wealth of evidence" in reaching its decision.

The Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York had ruled in May that the government hadn't proven fraud by Bank of America's Countrywide unit, only breaches of a contract, in a stunning setback for the government.

U.S. May Finally Get a Peek at the Books of Alibaba, Baidu

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-regulator-expected-to-get-access-to-alibaba-baidu-financials-1470377222" over the ability to vet auditors of Chinese companies listed on American exchanges could be edging toward a breakthrough.

Two big U.S.-listed Chinese companies Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc. and their outside auditors are preparing for audit inspections by officials from the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, the U.S. audit-industry regulator. The PCAOB is expected to gain access in coming months to audit firms' records of the work they did to review Alibaba's and Baidu's books, according to people familiar with the situation. That could be a prelude to fuller PCAOB inspections of the audit firms, a move long blocked by the Chinese government. 

CFPB Updates Mortgage-Servicing Rules to Reduce Foreclosures

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/cfpb-updates-mortgage-servicing-rules-to-reduce-foreclosures-1470339868" on Thursday announced modifications to its mortgage-servicing rules, aiming to reduce foreclosures by providing stronger protections to borrowers struggling to make payments.

The move updates the agency's broader 2014 regulations that established standards for mortgage servicers companies that collect payments from borrowers and forward them to the owners of the loans, such as banks.

Cash Flies Commercial and Other Secrets of Moving Money

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/cash-flies-commercial-and-other-secrets-of-moving-money-1470341383", there is still big demand for cold, hard cash. The Obama administration's secret airlift of $400 million to Iran earlier this year, as reported by The Wall Street Journal, is a reminder of that.

Yet the business of moving cash around the world remains a largely secretive and burdensome specialty one that fewer and fewer banks are willing to undertake. Just three lenders now handle the bulk of the global "bank notes" business: Bank of America Corp., Bank of Ireland in Europe and United Overseas Bank Ltd. in Asia, people familiar with the matter said.

Goldman Pressed by N.Y. Regulator for More Details on 1MDB Inquiries

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-pressed-by-ny-regulator-for-more-details-on-1mdb-inquiries-1470346131" pressed Goldman Sachs Group Inc. for more information on the U.S. and foreign investigations into the Wall Street firm's dealings with a Malaysian investment fund at the center of a corruption scandal.

The New York State Department of Financial Services is seeking details on the firm's role in underwriting bond deals for 1Malaysia Development Bhd., according a letter sent to Goldman on Thursday and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal. The regulator also requested trading records and research documents from the firm, as well as a copy of the March 2013 presentation Goldman had prepared for 1MDB in connection with one of the bond sales.

Goldman Questions How Quickly It Can Unload Private-Equity Holdings

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-questions-how-quickly-it-can-unload-private-equity-holdings-1470346448" it can sell $7 billion worth of private-equity and hedge-fund investments by a July 2017 deadline set by regulators.

The bank had said in a March securities filing that it "expects to be able to exit the majority of such interests in these funds in orderly transactions prior to July 2017," the deadline set by regulators as part of the Volcker rule.

CFTC Details Justification for Cross-Border Swaps Requirements

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/cftc-details-justification-for-cross-border-swaps-requirements-1470332002" fleshed out its economic justification for imposing its postcrisis restrictions overseas, rejecting industry calls to modify or water down the policies.

At issue is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's attempt to impose its rules on affiliates of U.S. banks if they use U.S.-located personnel to arrange, execute or negotiate a transaction but book it overseas. The CFTC successfully defended the rules in federal court in 2014, but the trial judge directed the agency to further explain and consider the economic costs and benefits of the regulations.

More Private-Equity Fees Require SEC's Attention, Group Says

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/more-private-equity-fees-require-secs-attention-group-says-1470348035" have reaped the kind of fees that in other cases were deemed improper by regulators, who claimed that such firms need to be registered as brokerages before charging for the purchase or sale of portfolio companies, according to a coalition of unions, consumer organizations and liberal groups.

A letter from Americans for Financial Reform asks the Securities and Exchange Commission to crack down on such firms as Boston-based Thomas H. Lee Partners and Menlo Park, Calif.-based Silver Lake LLC. Both firms disclose in investor brochures that they charge transaction fees for the acquisition or sale of securities in companies owned by their private-equity funds.

World Bank Revamps Lending Rules, Mindful of Human-Rights Abuses

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/world-bank-revamps-lending-rules-mindful-of-human-rights-abuses-1470346831" revamped lending rules meant to safeguard against human-rights abuses, though some critics say the guidelines still leave the most vulnerable without sufficient protections.

The development institution began the overhaul of the rules four years ago amid several lending scandals and after a scathing internal review found major failures in the oversight of bank-funded land resettlements.

Annuity Loss Adds to MetLife Drama

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/annuity-loss-adds-to-metlife-drama-1470332993" The reaction to Thursday's earnings call a 9% share selloff wiping out $4.3 billion in value is stunning for a big, established insurer such as MetLife.

In the latest stumble, the company took a $2 billion charge to its variable annuity business in the second quarter. The charge relates to MetLife's retail operations, which it plans to soon split off though a sale, a spinoff or an initial public offering.

New Tool for Central Banks: Buying Corporate Bonds

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/new-tool-for-central-banks-buying-corporate-bonds-1470350276" for boosting lackluster growth: corporate-debt purchases.

Two months after the European Central Bank started buying corporate bonds, the Bank of England said Thursday that it would adopt a similar strategy. It will buy as much as 10 billion ($13.33 billion) of U.K. corporate debt starting in September as part of a larger package of stimulus measures, including 60 billion of additional government-bond purchases.

Politics, Home Bias and Transmitting Risk

The European financial crisis was aggravated by the so-called banks-sovereign nexus and that can be blamed on politics, "http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/files/2016060pap.pdf". The two researchers for the Federal Reserve set out to determine why European banks suffer from a significant bias toward domestic government debt in their sovereign bond portfolios, nodding to the argument that such holdings were the critical channel that transmitted credit risk from sovereigns under stress to the real economy. The pair analyzed 2011 stress test data on European banks and concluded that certain banks held a disproportionate amount of their own country's sovereign debt because they were coerced by domestic politicians. Politically connected banks   those owned by the government or have board members who are former politicians   held more domestic sovereign bonds, the researchers found. That "home bias" increased during the crisis, especially after government bailouts, though the injections themselves weren't politically motivated, they say.

Is Modigliani-Miller Right About Capital Requirements

The Modigliani-Miller theory of bank capital posits that higher capital requirements result in negligible costs for banks, making them an effective way for regulators to increase the safety of banks without becoming a drag on their performance. But those costs actually create a tradeoff that regulators should consider more carefully, "https://www.magnetmail.net/actions/email_web_version.cfm?recipient_id=1350835540&message_id=13337985&user_id=IIF_&group_id=1813924&jobid=34782165", an industry group. The financial industry's analysis of Modigliani-Miller shows that it "cannot on its own support arguments for new capital requirements," the group says. They say that the cost of equity capital has risen significantly in regions that have increased their capital ratios above the Basel III minimum requirements, which seems to contradict Modigliani-Miller's predictions. They also note the decline of bank profitability in these regions. Increasing capital requirements "will do more to reduce the volume and increase the cost of lending than to increase stability in the system" the note concludes.

SEC: Judge and Jury

The SEC's increased use of administrative-law judges is an "abuse," "http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-sec-plays-judge-and-jury-1470353410". Citing the SEC case involving Lynn Tilton, CEO of Patriarch Partners LLC, Ms. Strassel says the specifics "are long, complex and best weighed by a court of law. But they aren't being settled by any outside court and therein rests the abuse. Ever since the Dodd-Frank financial "reform," the SEC has been pushing more cases toward in-house administrative-law judges. These judges are hired by the SEC and sit on the commission's payroll. They have ultimate discretion over the cases they handle, and the rules severely limit discovery and depositions." The case against Ms. Tilton, Ms. Strassel writes, "shows another Obama agency that like the EPA or the IRS seems to think it gets to operate outside the usual rules of democracy."

Preparing for a World Without Cash

The Federal Reserve should start considering how the world might work in the future as more central banks test and adopt digital currencies, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/preparing-for-a-world-without-cash-1470353068". "As the world's central monetary power, America should play a leading role in studying the benefits and pitfalls of a digital-currency future," they write. "While plenty of risks would come with such a conversion, the potential perks are so great that it merits serious consideration."

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/online-lender-prosper-in-talks-on-5-billion-loan-buying-deal-1470322065". is in advanced talks with a group of investment firms to sell them roughly $5 billion worth of loans over the next two years, people familiar with the matter said.

"http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/08/04/bitcoin-price-recovers-as-hacked-exchange-remains-offline/" this week's massive hack and theft of $65 million in bitcoin from a Hong Kong exchange, as some traders seized on the lower price to strategically buy the dip.

Quant funds on the lookout for top-notch talent; Financial services: Investing

Algo traders jostle to recruit mathematicians and scientists after 6 years of client inflows

Last year, billionaire investor Steven Cohen emailed a terse question to one of his new managers, Matthew Granade, formerly of Bridgewater. The subject line said: "Have you heard of Quantopian?"

As it happened, Mr Granade sat on the board of the Boston-based start-up, which offers freelance computer scientists, mathematicians and data engineers a platform to design, test and run automated trading algorithms. Last year Quantopian began allocating money to a handful of the best ones, for an embryonic "crowdsourced" hedge fund.

Once Mr Granade had given his boss a rundown on the company, Mr Cohen said: "Sounds cool. Let's get them in."

The meeting paid off. Last week, Mr Cohen said he would not just invest $2m in the company from his venture capital unit, but also hand over up to $250m to Quantopian's "do-it-yourself" algo traders to play with.

The move underscores one of the biggest trends in the hedge fund industry - the mounting interest in "quantitative" investing, where trading is driven by sophisticated computer algorithms rather than humans.

Mr Cohen's Point72 Asset Managementalready has a computer-driven unit and a "big data" group. But the capital Quantopian will manage gives the family office access to ideas and people "in all four corners of the world", instead of "fishing in the same talent pool" as competitors, says Mr Granade, Point72's chief market intelligence officer.

"By looking in different geographies and different backgrounds, you're going to have different strategies and different ways of thinking that could very well produce something that's a lot less correlated both to markets and to the hedge fund strategies."

Quantitative investing has been around for decades and some of the hedge fund industry's most profitable members are powered by computers scanning markets for patterns, rather than human traders.

The quant industry suffered a minor heart attack in the summer of 2007, when many popular strategies went awry and inflicted serious losses on investors, but most recovered their footing quickly. Many of the more technology-savvy hedge funds proved to be the most adept in the years after the financial crisis, while the deteriorating ability of the average traditional hedge fund to beat the market has burnished investors' attraction to quants.

Such funds are on their seventh straight year of client inflows, growing from $408bn in 2009 to $879bn this year, according to data from Hedge Fund Research. Even as many hedge funds have suffered client outflows in recent quarters, computerised ones have generally continued to attract money.

As a result, more funds outside the traditional quant universe are snapping up computer scientists, overhauling their technology, and tapping big data and analytics. Take Kensho, which automates previously human-intensive research, or research firm 1010data, and credit card data provider Yodlee.

"You don't have to be at the bleeding edge any more to start analysing data, massive amounts of data," says one hedge fund quant. The differentiation comes in how the data are processed into something useful - a signal.

Banks are also responding to the mounting demand for information. JPMorgan's capital introduction team, which funnels money from investors to fund managers, has hired two people to focus on analytics.

While quant strategies are seen as "hot" right now, "it's hard to dabble and be successful", says Andrew Fishman, president at Schonfeld Strategic Advisors, whose Quantbot unit has $3bn of market exposure.

Fundamental equity investing and long-short hedge funds using quantitative analysis as part of the process is "a more likely push than really entering the quant space to trade against people like Quantbot and RenTech. People are too far removed to be able to do it," he adds.

But Quantopian hopes eventually to be able to go head-to-head with the quantitative hedge fund industry's biggest names, betting that the cumulative nous of its 80,000 plus members from 180 countries can give it an edge.

This year the company hired former Millennium Management and Bluecrest trader Jonathan Larkin as its chief investment officer to help add an institutional veneer to its motley group of computer programmers.

Quantopian's central thesis is that the biggest advantage for a quant fund is no longer its hardware but its people - and top-notch talent is in short supply. "The need for talent is so intense and we cannot produce enough talent fast enough," John Fawcett, Quantopian's founder, told the FT. "There are lots of people brilliant enough to develop these strategies, but who don't want to devote their life to investing."

RSA produces record underwriting performance

Insurer RSA overcame fires in Canada and floods in Europe to produce a record first-half underwriting performance.

The UK-based insurer, which last year received an offer from Swiss rival Zurich, said its first-half operating profits rose a fifth to 312m. The company also raised its dividend by 43 per cent to 5p a share.

Stephen Hester, RSA s chief executive, described the results as excellent.  It is very unusual, in the current environment, to have these kinds of numbers,  he said.

He added:  We plan to pay out 40-50 per cent of our profits as dividends. There will be scope for special dividends in the future, but not in the near term. 

RSA s shares rose 2 per cent on Thursday morning, and are up 5 per cent since the UK voted in June to leave the EU. The company, which has large operations in Scandinavia and Canada, generates three-quarters of its profits in currencies other than sterling.

Barrie Cornes, analyst at Panmure Gordon, said the numbers exceeded consensus expectations.  With a for sale sign flapping above the company, these figures should highlight the attractiveness of RSA to overseas buyers helped further by weaker sterling,  he said.

RSA s underwriting profits jumped almost three-quarters to 174m as the combined ratio (claims and costs as a proportion of premiums) improved from 96 per cent to 94 per cent. That was despite large losses from events such as floods and fires coming in at 277m, which was 49m worse than last year.

Mr Hester put the improvement down to changes the company had made to its business portfolio, its underwriting models and its use of data analytics.

That underwriting performance was offset by weaker investment income, which fell a tenth to 187m because of lower interest rates.  This is the first half-year in RSA s history where underwriting profits are higher than investment income,  said Mr Hester.

Mr Hester has been restructuring RSA since he joined the company in 2014. He says that, while most of the large strategic changes are out of the way, there is still work to do. The company says it is on track to cut 250m of costs by the end of this year and to beat its 350m cost reduction target by the end of 2018.

RSA said that its Solvency II capital ratio   a measure of capital available as a proportion of the minimum required   was 158 per cent at June 30, at the upper end of its preferred 130-160 per cent target range.

Although the group s operating profits rose sharply, reported net profit more than halved to 91m because of the accounting impact of disposals.

Tracy's Take: Fed, Financial Industry Are Playing Chess

Barclays Cut in Half as Europe Slims Down on Wall Street

Goldman to Settle Federal Reserve Charges Over Leak of Central-Bank Secrets

One More Reason for Investors to Worry About  Earnings Before Bad Stuff'

China Inches Closer to Launching Credit-Default-Swap Market

Fed, Financial Industry Are Playing Chess

In 2014, the Federal Reserve imposed new rules on U.S. units of foreign-owned banks, despite objections from both the banks affected and their home-country regulators. On Wednesday, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/barclays-cut-in-half-as-europe-slims-down-on-wall-street-1470250141" about how some European banks appear to be responding: shrinking their U.S. brokerage units.

At first glance, it looks like the Fed rules have achieved their objective by forcing foreign-owned banks to boost the capital ratios in their U.S. operations, either by raising new equity or cutting down on risky assets. That may indeed be the ultimate outcome. But there is also evidence that the financial industry is evolving in a way that could undermine the Fed's goals.

Take Socit Gnrale SA . "http://www.wsj.com/articles/the-potential-loophole-in-the-feds-foreign-bank-rules-1470250917" the French bank appears to be taking advantage of a potential loophole in the new rules. Foreign-owned firms can move assets from their U.S.-based holding companies to their U.S.-based bank branches, the latter of which are subject to less stringent rules under the Fed regime. Socit Gnrale appears to have moved roughly $18 billion of securities financing assets from its U.S. brokerage to its U.S. branch between 2014 and 2015.

Securities financing, a typically benign but sometimes volatile form of short-term lending, is one of the activities the Fed intends to curb with the new capital rules. If a bank merely moves the activity rather than curtailing it, are the rules really working? Both the Fed and Socit Gnrale declined to comment on the firm's moves.

To be sure, other firms made significant changes in response to the rules, rather than simply reworking their legal structures to circumvent them. Barclays PLC and Deutsche Bank AG have reduced securities financing activity at their U.S. brokerages. Unlike Socit Gnrale , their American bank branches haven't grown significantly.

The twist is that new evidence shows "http://www.wsj.com/articles/direct-repo-loans-gaining-traction-as-banks-step-back-1469037601", where the Fed has limited regulatory authority. While these new players are still relatively small compared to big banks, their growing role illustrates how the financial system can reinvent itself in response to new rules.

Fed officials say they are monitoring the shift. They are contemplating "http://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-eyes-margin-rules-to-bolster-oversight-1452471174" that would apply to all players, not just banks. If the Fed moves ahead with those rules, it will once again be the industry's turn to assess the chessboard and make a move.

Key Developments in Washington, on Wall Street, and Beyond

Barclays Cut in Half as Europe Slims Down on Wall Street

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/barclays-cut-in-half-as-europe-slims-down-on-wall-street-1470250141" no secret of their efforts to slim down, but little-noticed regulatory filings show just how deep their cuts on Wall Street have been.

Barclays PLC reduced assets at its U.S. brokerage, Barclays Capital , by 43% between the end of 2013 and the beginning of this year, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission . Assets at Deutsche Bank 's U.S. broker-dealer, Deutsche Bank Securities , were down 30% during that period, while Credit Suisse Group AG 's U.S. brokerage shrank by 26%.

Goldman to Settle Federal Reserve Charges Over Leak of Central-Bank Secrets

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-to-settle-federal-reserve-charges-over-leak-of-central-bank-secrets-1470237502" has agreed to pay $36.3 million to settle allegations by the Federal Reserve that it obtained and used confidential regulatory materials from the central bank two years ago.

The penalty comes after the bank already paid $50 million in October last year to banking regulators at the New York State Department of Financial Services for failing to properly supervise the former employee that stole and shared the Fed secrets.

TIAA in Talks to Buy Florida's EverBank

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/tiaa-in-talks-to-buy-floridas-everbank-1470233858" Florida-based lender EverBank Financial Corp ., a purchase that would push the financial-services giant further into plain-vanilla banking, according to people familiar with the matter.

An all-cash deal could be announced in coming days, these people said, assuming it doesn't fall apart at the last minute. The deal would value EverBank at about $2.5 billion, according to a disclosure from that bank last week that detailed the exclusive talks and the potential price but didn't name the bidder.

One More Reason for Investors to Worry About  Earnings Before Bad Stuff'

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/one-more-reason-for-investors-to-worry-about-earnings-before-bad-stuff-1470261290?tesla=y" wary when companies overemphasize their own customized earnings metrics. New research shows they may have a point.

Companies that report significantly stronger earnings by using tailored figures like "adjusted net income" or "adjusted operating income" are more likely to encounter some kinds of accounting problems than those that stick to standard measures, according to research by consulting firm Audit Analytics.

China Inches Closer to Launching Credit-Default-Swap Market

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/china-inches-closer-to-launching-credit-default-swap-market-1470288832" of credit-default swaps, a popular financial derivatives contract for hedging credit risks, three people familiar with the situation told The Wall Street Journal on Thursday.

The National Association of Financial Market Institutional Investors , an industry body backed by China's central bank , has consulted major banks and brokerages in recent weeks about draft guidelines and standardized contracts for the product, said the people, who were briefed by the regulator on the matter.

Italy's Shaky Bank-Rescue Plan

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/italys-shaky-bank-rescue-plan-1470280340" to rescue its third-largest bank is that it might just work.

Monte dei Paschi di Siena announced on Friday a complex deal that would see it offload  40 billion ($44.7 billion) of its most toxic bad debts equivalent to around 15% of its loan book into a newly created privately-funded vehicle, paving the way for the lender to raise around  5 billion in fresh capital.

New Jersey Backs Away From Hedge Funds

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/new-jersey-backs-away-from-hedge-funds-1470264516", the latest major investor to retreat from some of Wall Street's highest-paid money managers.

The decision by the New Jersey Investment Council will take the state's target hedge-fund commitment down to 6% from 12.5%. New Jersey's $71.9 billion pension fund had $9.1 billion committed to hedge funds at the end of May, according to state documents. The fund oversees assets for roughly 769,000 active and retired police officers, firefighters, teachers and other public workers.

A $500 Billion Stampede in Money Markets Even Before New Rules Hit

"http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-500-billion-stampede-in-money-markets-even-before-new-rules-hit-1470248418" change is reverberating across the financial system, potentially squeezing short-term lending for businesses and local governments.

The rules haven't taken effect yet but are already upending the $2.7 trillion money-market industry, causing nearly $500 billion to move into, out of and among these funds, which are used by investors to stash their cash and by borrowers for short-term liquidity.

The Fed's Effect on Solvency Shocks and Liquidity Shocks

The establishment of the Federal Reserve in 1914 has resulted in an interbank system that is more resilient to solvency shocks but less resilient to liquidity shocks, "http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/feds/2016/files/2016059pap.pdf". The two dug into how the founding of the Fed affected the size of the interbank system and its vulnerability to shocks. They examined how creation of the Fed affected solvency risk related to contagion from central reserve city banks in New York City and Chicago to reserve city and country national banks, and how it affected the resilience of the banking system to liquidity stresses.

Diversifying the Fed

The Democratic Party platform's attack on the lack of diversity at the Federal Reserve should not be dismissed as just "election season Fed bashing" but instead taken seriously, "https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/the-feds-striking-lack-of-diversity-and-why-it-matters/". Of the 134 different presidents of the 12 Fed regional banks throughout their history, none have been African-American and none have been Latino. There have only been two nonwhite regional bank presidents, both at the Minneapolis Fed : current President Neel Kashkari and his immediate predecessor Narayana Kocherlakota . There have been only six women to serve as regional bank presidents, including current presidents Loretta Mester in Cleveland and Esther George at the Kansas City Fed . Mr. Klein cites a recent Government Accountability Office report that urged more diversity among Fed leaders to ensure a "broader spectrum of information useful for the formation and execution of monetary policy and the oversight of Reserve Bank operations." Diversity, writes Mr. Klein, was the main goal behind having a system of regional banks in the first place.

Why This Recovery Is So Lousy

Through law and regulation, government control of the economy grew as red tape that once had encumbered came to dominate health care, financial services, energy production and the internet, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-this-recovery-is-so-lousy-1470266675"

Bitcoin Falls After Exchange Is Hacked

The price of the virtual currency bitcoin fell sharply after Hong Kong-based digital-currency exchange Bitfinex said it was hacked, resulting in the possible theft of about $65 million worth of bitcoin.

News of the Bitfinex hack hit the price of bitcoin hard in heavy trading on Tuesday. It fell to $540 by late in the day, down about 12% from its level near $613 early Tuesday, according to CoinDesk. At one point, it traded as low as $480, down about 22%, though it recovered to about $548 by late morning in New York on Wednesday.

The hack marks one of the largest thefts in bitcoin's short history and follows a separate alleged theft of an estimated $60 million worth of ethereum, a rival virtual currency, in June. In 2014, investor confidence in bitcoin also was dented by another larger cybersecurity breach, at the Japanese exchange Mt. Gox.

Hacking and thefts of investor property stand as two of the biggest issues that may prevent the fast-growing digital currency from gaining more widespread use. Bitcoin trades on an open ledger known as the blockchain that has excited technologists for its ability to cut out expensive layers of bureaucracy in various areas of commerce.

But securing the bitcoin trading platform has proved elusive. Tuesday, Bitfinex acknowledged the latest theft in a statement on its website and said it was halting all trading on Bitfinex as well as the deposits and withdrawals of digital tokens.

"The theft is being reported to -- and we are co-operating with -- law enforcement," the statement said. "We are deeply concerned about this issue and we are committing every resource to try to resolve it."

Zane Tackett, Bitfinex's director of community and product development, confirmed that 119,756 bitcoins were stolen and said the company knows "exactly how relevant systems were compromised." At Tuesday's value, the amount of bitcoin stolen was worth about $65 million. Mr. Tackett said the company is working with law enforcement and analytics companies to try to track down the stolen coins and is working to get its platform back up so customers can check their accounts.

It wasn't clear what percentage of Bitfinex's overall assets were stolen or whether or not the company had adequate insurance to cover the theft.

"We are investigating the breach to determine what happened, but we know that some of our users have had their bitcoins stolen," the statement added. "We are undertaking a review to determine which users have been affected by the breach. While we conduct this initial investigation and secure our environment, bitfinex.com will be taken down and the maintenance page will be left up."

In 2014, the Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox collapsed after a yearslong series of attacks resulted in the theft of about 850,000 bitcoins, at the time worth about $450 million. About 200,000 were later recovered. In June, Mt. Gox Chief Executive Mark Karpales was released from a Japanese prison on bail, after serving 10 months. The company's liquidation is ongoing.

Bitcoin rallied earlier this year but had been selling off lately after an anticipated event known as a "halving" in early July lowered the subsidy paid to bitcoin miners supporting the network.

In 2015, Bitfinex switched to a system protected by what is known as "multiple signature" security, a feature that requires multiple "keys" to access bitcoin in a virtual wallet, and keeps the customers' money in separate accounts, rather than pooling them into one larger account.

The exchange was fined $75,000 by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission in June for offering illegal off-exchange commodity transactions financed in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and for failing to register as a futures commission merchant. The CFTC said at the time that Bitfinex cooperated with its investigation and voluntarily made changes to its business practices to comply with regulations.

Direct Investment Matchmaker Axial Raises $14M Series C

"http://www.axial.net/", a platform for accredited investors such as family offices and wealthy individuals to connect with companies seeking direct investment, has found a second matchmaking market: helping company chief executives find the bankers and service providers who can help them close a deal.

The company, incorporated as Axial Networks Inc., has raised a $14 million Series C led by Edison Partners , and it has expanded its subscriber base to include 3,300 intermediaries, including Goldman Sachs 's direct lending group and Oaktree Capital Management .

At its 2010 launch, Axial focused on connecting investors with brokers and middlemen. In early 2014 the New York-based company began making direct outreach to company chief executives themselves, who use the platform to select investment bankers and M&A advisers.

Investment bankers such as New York-based Young America Capital use the network to find clients preparing for a sale. Young America founder and Managing Partner Peter Formanek said he also uses Axial's competitor DealNexus, owned by Intralinks Holdings , to originate deals.

Chief Executive Peter Lehrman is considering opening Axial up to additional service providers. Wealth managers, for instance, are very interested in connecting with founders who may be one or two years away from selling their company. But Mr. Lehrman said the company is weighing how to do so in a way that won't alienate the CEO users.

"We want to make sure that interaction is really well-received by the CEO, not just by the wealth manager hunting for new business," Mr. Lehrman said.

Subscribers use the platform's profiles and recommendation algorithm to find matches, like on a dating site. Then they move to face-to-face meetings, and Axial plays no role in negotiations. Axial claims to have matched parties that led to 672 closed deals in 2015, according to survey results reported by users.

The site makes money from annual subscription fees, which range from $20,000 to $250,000, depending on the size of business investors are looking to invest in. Chief executives can join free. Axial has 11,000 capital providers and private companies as members, according to the startup.

Axial focuses on "the middle market, as opposed to the venture market," Mr. Lehrman said, aiming for profitable companies seeking growth equity with annual revenue between $10 million and $250 million.

Yet Kelly Ford , a partner at Edison Partners who joined Axial's board, wouldn't rule out an eventual expansion to include companies that also raise venture funding.

"The market will probably come to them, if larger-size deals start clamoring to them," Ms. Ford said. "Like any network effect business, you need to stay focused, and then the market kind of decides for you eventually."

Axial will use the new funding to build out its sales and marketing operations and to invest in its machine learning techniques to match buyers and sellers. The company has about 100 employees now, and it plans to hire about 20 more, Mr. Lehrman said. Global expansion is a priority for the company, which currently gets about 90% of its business from North America.

Returning investors Comcast Ventures , First Round Capital and Redpoint Ventures participated in the round. The new investment puts the company's total funding over $34 million. Its last financing event was an $11 million round in 2014.

JPMorgan and Virtu Financial in US Treasuries tie-up

JPMorgan Chase and high-frequency trading firm Virtu Financial are teaming up in the US Treasuries market in the latest sign that banks are trying to beef up their capabilities in electronic trading.

Under a strategic partnership announced on Wednesday, Virtu will provide technology to JPMorgan to trade in the dealer-to-dealer markets for Treasuries. The agreement will last for at least three years.

The deal comes as non-bank trading firms such as Virtu that rely on advanced algorithms to trade at lightning speed have elbowed their way into the $13tn Treasury market.

Banks still dominate trading with clients such as asset managers and insurance companies but high-frequency firms have taken on a more significant role in the so-called interdealer market, which mostly trades electronically on platforms such as ICAP s BrokerTec and Nasdaq s eSpeed.

 We are committed to staying a leader in fixed income,  JPMorgan said.  Working with outside firms is complementary to our internal investments and ensures that we are evaluating innovative technologies as the markets evolve. 

Some banks have struggled to compete with the technology capabilities of high-frequency trading firms. The JPMorgan deal follows a tie-up between Credit Suisse and high-frequency trading firm Tower Research, which joined forces in mid-2014. Credit Suisse has been quiet about the specifics of the partnership, but people familiar with it say that Credit Suisse is using Tower s technology to price trades for its clients.

Other large high-frequency firms also say they have explored links with banks.

 From JPMorgan s perspective, dealer-to-dealer US Treasuries has become a very competitive electronic marketplace,  Doug Cifu, Virtu chief executive, told the FT.  It is a sub asset class where they could benefit from our efficient access to electronic markets, which is the foundation of our business. 

The boom in revenue for high-frequency firms has been tailing off with more seeking to find new sources of income as the race for speed has become less lucrative.

The JPMorgan deal helps Virtu gain a stronger foothold in the US Treasury market, which trades in larger size and less frequently than equities and futures, where high-frequency firms are well established. The bank will pay Virtu a fixed fee plus a portion of profits, said a person briefed on the terms.

 Candidly it has been a struggle for us to get into the marketplace,  Mr Cifu said.  To have the opportunity to work with a big institution that knows the market well is a blessing. 

It comes alongside an effort to provide order routing and post-trade analysis to institutional investors. Virtu is working with T Rowe Price, which is using Virtu s algorithms to improve trade execution.

Neither the T Rowe Price deal nor the JPMorgan one is exclusive and Virtu is seeking to expand these businesses as it looks to diversify revenues. Its core business is closely linked to market volumes and volatility.

Bank of New York Mellon licenses Virtu s technology infrastructure   connectivity, risk management and analytics   for foreign exchange.

One More Reason for Investors to Worry About  Earnings Before Bad Stuff'; Companies that report tailored results are more likely to encounter some kinds of accounting problems

By Michael Rapoport

Regulators and investors are increasingly wary when companies overemphasize their own customized earnings metrics. New research shows they may have a point.

Companies that report significantly stronger earnings by using tailored figures like "adjusted net income" or "adjusted operating income" are more likely to encounter some kinds of accounting problems than those that stick to standard measures, according to research by consulting firm Audit Analytics.

The rules allow companies to report such tailored figures, and the research, conducted for The Wall Street Journal, doesn't necessarily mean such companies are less scrupulous in their bookkeeping. But it does suggest that heavy use of metrics outside of generally accepted accounting principles sometimes referred to derisively as "earnings before bad stuff" could be a warning sign.

"I would say an overprominent user of non-GAAP metrics would justify more attention and is a red flag," said Olga Usvyatsky, Audit Analytics's vice president of research. Heavy use of non-GAAP metrics may indicate a company's accounting is "more aggressive," she said.

The study focused on companies in the S&P 1500 index. It found that just 3.8% of those exclusively using standard GAAP metrics had formal earnings restatements from 2011 to 2015. Among heavy users of non-GAAP measures those whose non-GAAP earnings were at least twice as high as their GAAP net income the rate was 6.5%.

Similarly, 7.5% of the GAAP-only group had material weaknesses in internal controls flaws in their procedures to prevent financial errors and fraud versus 11% of the non-GAAP group.

Some of the numbers are small, and the use of non-GAAP metrics didn't specifically cause or relate directly to the companies' accounting flaws. Audit Analytics cautioned more research is needed.

Still, the results suggest companies using non-GAAP metrics heavily "may be somewhat less rigorous in other accounting areas" than companies using only GAAP, said Robert Pozen, a senior lecturer at the MIT Sloan School of Management.

Two examples are Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. and LendingClub Corp. Both companies have been heavy users of pro forma metrics, and both have run into accounting and other problems that have hammered their shares.

Valeant restated earnings earlier this year over revenue-booking issues and said it had material weaknesses relating to its "tone at the top," or the commitment by a company's leadership to doing business ethically. Valeant has used non-GAAP metrics for years, often benefiting significantly. In 2015, the company had a GAAP loss of $291.7 million but an "adjusted" non-GAAP profit of $2.84 billion after stripping out amortization of intangible assets, acquisition costs and other expenses.

Valeant spokeswoman Laurie Little said the company believes its non-GAAP measures "are useful to investors in their assessment of our operating performance and the valuation of our company."

Online lender LendingClub forced its chief executive to resign in May after it found disclosure problems on some loans, and it too cited a "tone at the top" material weakness. The company had a 2015 GAAP loss of $5 million but non-GAAP net income of $56.8 million. LendingClub declined to comment.

Neither company was in the pool Audit Analytics examined.

Companies are allowed to use nonstandard metrics as long as they also provide GAAP numbers and show the differences between the two. The tailored measures strip out unusual or noncash items to present what companies say is a clearer picture of performance.

Even critics acknowledge the tailored metrics can sometimes be helpful showing a company's results in constant currency is a legitimate adjustment, for instance, Mr. Pozen said.

But there is also a concern they are being abused, that companies are stripping out normal, ongoing costs to make themselves look healthier.

A study in June by financial data-research firm Calcbench and corporate-compliance consultant Radical Compliance showed non-GAAP metrics inflated 2015 earnings by $164.1 billion over GAAP at a group of 816 public companies.

In May, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued new guidelines warning companies against placing too much emphasis on non-GAAP metrics. The commission also has been taking issue with companies' non-GAAP disclosures more frequently in comment letters critiquing the companies' SEC filings.

For each accounting problem examined in the Audit Analytics survey restatements, control weaknesses and so on the trend was the same. The problems occurred at relatively low levels in the GAAP-only group, at higher levels among all non-GAAP users and at still-higher levels among heavy non-GAAP users.

Any connection between non-GAAP metrics and accounting problems doesn't automatically signal aggressive practices.

For instance, companies using non-GAAP income measures to exclude employee stock compensation may be the kind of younger outfits that encounter troubles with accounting systems because they are expanding rapidly, said Patricia Dechow, a University of California at Berkeley accounting professor.

But non-GAAP use could also signify a company is concerned with managing market expectations and "may be more likely to push the line on GAAP earnings," Ms. Dechow said.

Distil Networks Inc. is setting cash aside from its latest funding round to make an acquisition in the increasingly consolidating cybersecurity sector.

The company announced $21 million in Series C funding led by Silicon Valley Bank . After "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120160113ec1db0yvo" earlier this year, Chief Executive Rami Essaid said the company is earmarking $5 million to $10 million to acquire another early stage security company.

This move comes as venture capitalists are expecting more mergers and acquisitions in cybersecurity after the sector has seen some large deals, like Symantec Corp .'s $4.65 billion acquisition of Blue Coat Systems Inc .

Distil Networks uses machine learning and big data to detect bots and protect online data from scraping, a technique hackers use to collect data from websites. Mr. Essaid said the company sees an evolving threat from bots, and increasingly bots are targeting mobile apps and mobile API's.

Mr. Essaid said he sensed a positive shift in investor sentiment in recent months when raising funding from venture capitalists. Venture investment in cybersecurity startups totaled $830 million in the second quarter vs. $561 million in the first quarter, according to data from Dow Jones VentureSource.

"It was like when all your friends are standing around a pool and no one wants to jump in because they're afraid the water's cold," Mr. Essaid said of the funding environment in the first quarter of 2016.

Mr. Essaid said he was able to close a round by focusing on how the Series C would bring the company to profitability. He said the company's valuation doubled with the new round. Though he declined to comment on the exact valuation, data tracker Pitchbook estimated the company's post-money valuation to be $81 million as of its Series B round.

He said the environment is still tougher on valuations than it was a year ago.

"I thought tripling in revenue would mean we would more than double in value," Mr. Essaid said. "We came in on low end of my spectrum."

Existing investors Bessemer Venture Partners , Foundry Group and Techstars also participated in the round. The company has raised $65 million to date.

Sensay Uses Artificial Intelligence  to Connect People Seeking Advice and Ideas

A chatbot-messaging platform is betting there are some questions people just can't ask their Facebook friends or iPhone contacts.

Sensay Inc. uses natural language processing to connect a one person to another anonymously through messaging apps such as Facebook Inc .'s Messenger and Kik Interactive Inc . The startup raised $4.5 million in seed funding led by Norwest Venture Partners .

Sensay conversations can be about anything from relationship advice to restaurant recommendations. When you start a Sensay chat, the chatbot asks if you need something or know something. People can type in such phrases as "Need recommendations for a book to read on vacation." Within minutes, a chat begins with another person who has told Sensay they "know" about books.

Chatbots are software agents that use artificial intelligence to understand what you type or say and then respond with an answer. They can live in chat platforms like Facebook Messenger, Slack and Line. Some can be used via SMS text messages, and others are stand-alone apps.

Chief Executive Ariel Jalali said the Los Angeles-based company has more than one million users. He added 50% of those people use Sensay to both ask and answer questions.

"People are connecting in serendipitous ways we wouldn't have imagined," Mr. Jalali said.

The team believes Sensay will be able to help people talk about topics that may be uncomfortable to post about publicly, like how to reach a custody agreement following a divorce. After each interaction with a human, Sensay prompts the other user to rate the person they just spoke to and report any abuse, limiting negativity on the platform.

As chatbots or virtual assistants come to consumers, Sensay is one of several early entrants that has combined artificial intelligence and humans to make an experience that feels like a human to human conversation. While advances in natural language processing have led to improved chatbots, many of the emerging chatbots that venture capitalists have backed still rely on human communication. They automate parts of the conversation to help those humans talk to more people more quickly. As more conversations occur, they train machine learning algorithms and make the automated conversation better and better.

Chatbots have captured the attention of venture capitalists as mobile matures and people download fewer apps. Chat platforms like Facebook Inc . see chatbots as a possible alternative to the Apple Inc . App Store.

Despite the recent flurry of investment activity in bots, it remains to be seen if the medium will take off among consumers. By combining both artificial intelligence and humans, companies like Sensay are avoiding some of the pitfalls that other early chatbots have fallen into. Microsoft Corp .'s early foray with a bot named Tay was deemed a failure after pranksters prompted her too spew anti-Semitic comments.

Many of the chatbots that have raised funding recently, like Mezi, are automating tasks that previously would be completed by customer service and sales representatives. Sensay is unique because it connects people to their peers and others with similar interests. This brings to the messaging world the types of conversations that typically take place on anonymous forums like Reddit .

Sensay declined to comment on whether it generates revenue, but the company is still considering different business models. It may one day rely on transactions in the chats, such as virtual coins. It has also developed a method to use paywalls within the chat service.

Mr. Jalali said that down the line, more of the Sensay experience may become automated. He declined to elaborate but said the future of automated conversations are less like the dystopian future presented in the "Terminator" and more like the friendly assistant R2D2 popularized by the "Star Wars" films.

Sensay has raised $6 million to date. Greycroft Partners , Sweet Capital, NHN Investment Corp., Draper Associates and other existing investors also participated in the round. The company plans to use the funding for international expansion.

Banks' profitability strained by low rates; Analysis: Capital markets

Stress test results highlight competing interests between holders of bonds and shares

Amid the drama of the European Banking Authority's stress test results on Friday, one character was notably absent. Across 46 pages, there was no mention of negative interest rates.

Unprecedentedly low rates have been one of several factors fuelling a collapse in bank shares so far this year. The Euro Stoxx banking index has already lost 31 per cent of its value.

"What they don't test for is the real issue around banks - negative interest rates and the questions around profitability," says Paul Markham, who manages 4bn of global equities at Newton Investment Management.

The thinking is that low rates depress the net interest margin - the difference between the rate at which a bank borrows and lends - and portend weak growth expectations over coming years, which is bad news for bank equity investors.

The EBA tests are designed to focus on the banking system's resilience to "adverse economic shocks".

What they demonstrated is that, despite concerns over certain banks, capital - a measure of balance sheet strength - has improved markedly over recent years. The EBA's measure for transitional core equity tier 1 ratios stood at 13.2 per cent on average at the end of 2015, up from 11.1 at the end of 2013.

What emerges is a bipartite view of the European banking system. While shareholders gnash their teeth at the prospect of weaker growth and low rates bondholders are buoyed by the prospect of more capital, which insulates them from the threat of losses in a downturn.

"Weak profitability per se for us as bondholders isn't bad necessarily, as long as the banks have decent capital buffers and are managing their risks on the balance sheet," says Steve Hussey, head of Financial Institutions Credit Research at AllianceBernstein.

"It's whether, number one, you believe the numbers, and whether certain banks have outsized potential risks or losses that might come through."

"Equity investors are focused on dividends," he adds. "CEOs run banks in the short term."

The Euro Stoxx banking index fell more than 2 per cent yesterday after markets responded to the stress tests.

The worst stress test performer, Monte dei Paschi, was the sole Italian riser. It announced on Friday a plan to boost capital which does not involve hitting bondholders.

Its debt has fallen in price over recent months over fears of losses but yesterday one of the bank's subordinated bonds rose by over 4 per cent to 83 cents on the euro.

Unlike bondholders, who closely watched the capital buffer protecting them from losses, shareholders often see higher capital requirements as an impediment to their returns.

Mr Markham describes higher capital requirements as one of the "structural headwinds" facing banks alongside compressed interest rates.

James Sym, an equities fund manager at Schroders, also sees low interest rates as a structural problem for banks.

But he also thinks the current market presents buying opportunities for certain high quality names. "I would say the banking sector in Europe is the last explicitly cheap area of the market," he says.

Mr Sym points to the political pressures on extremely low bond yields and interest rates. "I think they're ridiculously low. I think we'll all look back in 20 years' time and think what were we doing? Does the current set of conditions really justify that?"

If negative rates are bad for bank shareholders, it stands to reason that higher rates might help them. But the EBA's adverse scenario entailed a rise in interest rates, albeit among other issues.

"Higher interest rates in the adverse scenario still manage to hit banks because they lead to higher, nonpaying NPLs, and the cost of funding increases," says Alexandre Birry, head of analytics and research at S&P global ratings.

He adds that low rates effectively support asset quality, as part of a kind of "monetary sedation".

Many market participants are psychologically conditioned by the brutal impact of the 2008 financial crisis.

The conundrum that banks now face is a different proposition. It concerns the extent to which weak bank profitability, rooted in a stagnant growth environment, will remain a headache for equity investors alone, or whether it will ultimately weaken capital as well.

The latter case would entail a lingering transition from stagnation to systemic disaster, rather than a sudden, unpredictable shock. For signs of this, bond prices, rather than shares, are the crucial factor to watch.

"The impact of low growth, low interest rate environment, I think that's something that will be looked at more by regulators," says Mr Birry. "It's not a severe hit. It's a gradual erosion in the profitability of banks."

Bitcoin s panopticon problem

One of the more curious things about bitcoin enthusiasts is their attitude to privacy.

In one sense they re the most privacy-minded people in the world (allegedly). In the other sense they seem happier than most to provide government authenticated ID to relative newcomer businesses   who have little to no track record with respect to abiding by data privacy laws.

What s more, it s odd that these people should offer up all this information for the sole benefit of using or speculating on a virtual currency that, via that ID link alone, allows the same third parties to maintain some of the most intrusive records of day-to-day spending activities within their closed systems, but also beyond.

Take Coinbase as an example. Being something of a centralising liquidity hub, it s fair to say the company, which operates both as an exchange and a wallet provider, probably knows as much if not more than banking institutions about how their customers deploy their balances.

Once you further account for the fact that most of these third-parties operate on a broker-dealer basis, wherein accounts are made up of third party liabilities to customers not actual bitcoin balances (do see the Mt Gox drama for how that can end up), one really has to wonder what exactly the innovation is?

Overall, the average customer needs to give up as much if not more personal data, often by more dubious means (online upload mechanisms, email or the post) to much less experienced organisations. Once in the system, meanwhile, customer transactions can be linked on a much broader and more publicly intrusive level than anything in the standing banking system. Moreover, there are no associated par value or liquidity guarantees for the customer if and when things go wrong.

And that s before accounting for services like "https://www.elliptic.co/" which take pride in describing themselves as..

 &the global standard in blockchain monitoring technology, and is recognised as an established authority on blockchain compliance. In addition to providing data and analytics services to financial institutions and law enforcement agencies around the world, Elliptic advises governments on blockchain regulatory matters.

So, thus far, it seems to fuse the worst of the old system with the worst of a hyper transparent future "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panopticon"system.

Which begs the question once again, where exactly is the innovation?

Bar the whole point of the bitcoin blockchain being an attempt to manufacture a false sense of security among those who would ordinarily never trust the financial sector, it also seems like a play to gobble up more personal data and related transaction history than any banking system would ever manage to unless it was inclined to bank a much broader and more risky clientele.

Mostly, and arguably, it s a giant privacy bait and switch. There are simply no money transmitter institutions of Coinbase s size that can afford to operate in defiance of the law of the land, unless they care to be based in the sort of jurisdictions most other banking institutions won t care to do business with.

Meanwhile, if the cost in the banking system is indeed mostly related to the cost credit checking, due diligence and policing non-compliance, it s worth considering how exactly the likes of Coinbase improve on these processes vis-a-vis traditional institutions? After all, just knowing who your customer is fairly meaningless. What really matters is having the guts to deny them access if they fail to make the grade, blocking or requesting further information about transactions if and when they re suspected to be fraudulent and generally actively monitoring the clientele base for risk   and that usually takes expensive layers of personnel. If bitcoin third parties are doing that properly, it s likely their cost advantage over conventional banks is linked to more to their non-bank  money transmitter  status, than it is to the fact they re operating in bitcoin.

Which begs one last question about Coinbase. Is it an exchange, a money transmitter or actually a plain old deposit-taking institution such as a bank? Judging by "https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/759995925410385920" from Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong on August 1, Coinbase certainly views itself as a deposit taker. If that s truly the case, it might not be that long before authorities insist Coinbase gets itself a proper banking license   in the process losing most of its cost advantage.

And that s generally how you go full loop in the world of financial innovation.

LBO Focus: Private Equity Bets on Managed Care's Comeback

Changes in reimbursements by U.S. government insurance programs have stirred interest among a small group of private-equity investors in the managed-care sector, which refers to health care based on controlling costs and monitoring outcomes.

The government penalizes hospitals that have too many readmissions within 30 days of an inpatient stay and rewards providers that help propel meaningful savings in the system. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has adopted a rating system that evaluates providers and individual physicians on areas such as patient satisfaction and the amount of preventive screening for common ailments such as diabetes and breast cancer. The higher the score, the better physicians and providers are reimbursed.

This shift away from payments based on the amount of services rendered means medical providers take on the risk of patient health being worse than expected, but the upside can be much greater for companies that keep patients healthy.

Ravi Sachdev, a partner with Clayton Dubilier & Rice LLC, said "the profit opportunity [for managed care] can be four to six times as big as it is for fee for service."

These potential gains have tempted some private-equity firms to back physician groups with payment measures linked to performance, be they primary-care providers or specialist doctors. These physician groups contract with payers, whether commercial insurers or the government agencies of Medicare and Medicaid, to manage part or all of a population's care for a predetermined sum per member, per month. The goal is to manage care effectively, so expenses stay below the sum received or even produce a surplus.

Government and industry participants think the incentive model is better for aligning health-care providers' interests with those of patients, as true cost savings occur when patients are healthy and their ailments are caught early so their conditions won't deteriorate to a state where expensive hospitalization is needed.

Boston's Summit Partners in December led a $250 million investment in DuPage Medical Group, a  physician management company of  primary and multispecialty  doctors in the Chicago area that contracts with both commercial and government insurers like Medicare.

Summit Managing Director Darren Black said most of the company's contracts focus on "taking risks on care unrelated to inpatient hospital care, specifically keeping people out of expensive hospitalizations." Other investments in this area include Pamplona Capital Management LLP and Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s bet on physician practice management company Privia Health LLC, made two years ago, and a new CD&R-backed  platform called agilon health, which provides primary-care physician  management services and technology-based clinical support to enable doctors to take risks.

Managed-Care Reboot

The notion of managed care isn't new. Managed care organizations started in the 1980s as a way to help employers combat rising health-care costs. But such programs got a bad reputation in the late 1980s and early 1990s when fierce competition drove health plans to compete on price and cost savings, sometimes by limiting plan members on the services they could get and the physicians they could visit.

Grievances among the insured led to the rise of preferred provider organizations, which gave patients the flexibility to see wide networks of physicians at the cost of higher premiums.

As the economic pendulum swung back to tougher times after the financial crisis of 2008, keeping tabs on costs through care management came back into vogue. But some investors say managed care is here to stay this time around.

"We are in fact nested inside of a macro trend  that is  promote d,  pushed and  advocated for  by the government, the largest payer in the system," said Ronald Williams, the former chairman and chief executive of insurer Aetna Inc., who is chairman of CD&R's Agilon Health.

Jeremy Gelber, a partner with Pamplona Capital, said not only are government and commercial payers showing greater dedication to incorporating  risks in the equation of care reimbursement, physicians and provider groups also are better equipped to take risks.

"There also are better care-coordination tools, better data capabilities and better ability to engage with patients in cost appropriate settings," he said. "The actual risk models are smarter as it's not just about utilization management, but about taking patients who are really sick and reducing the costs by giving them care at lower cost settings, keeping them out of the emergency room and adhering to medicine."

Managed-Care Risks Remain

Still, managing health-care costs isn't a walk in the park. It involves complicated math based on a set of assumptions of a population's demographic characteristics and their medical needs. Insurance companies, armed with teams of actuaries, are best at making such assessments, but not physicians who have for decades seen patients as they come.

Michael Loiacano, who heads the health-care services practice at executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles International Inc., said physician groups need professionals with technology and data analytics knowledge to help calculate risks, as well as those with customer service experience to help recruit and take care of patients.

"The investors need to hire  the  right talent  for their portfolio companies, but there is just  not  enough talent  out there to do that ," he said.

Scott Bingham, a co-practice leader of U.S. transaction advisory services at advisory firm FTI Consulting Inc., said it is not uncommon for risk-taking physician groups to suffer losses for the first couple of years "as they don't know the ultimate costs of care or they haven't fully built out a closed network" with the clinical scale and capability to manage their members' needs.

And losses can be unforeseeable. Mr. Bingham said he had seen "profits for managed Medicaid contracts get wiped out with a very bad cold and flu season."

To patients and payers, the biggest risk, however, is compliance.

A private-equity executive who declined to be named said that over the years, some operators defrauded government programs on the amount of services they have rendered or falsely represented how sick their patients were in a bid to get more funding.

"It's a known risk," he said. "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services can't chase after every single doctor, but it's been well publicized that the agency has been taking a series of actions to crack down on such frauds."

The Medicare Fraud Strike Force, a unit spanning multiple departments including the Office of Inspector General, the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, among other government agencies, said last month that nearly 2,900 defendants have been charged for having defrauded the Medicare program for more than $10 billion since the unit began its work in 2007.

It is still the early days in the revival of interest in care management, but already there are companies that have called it quits. Privately owned Health Alliance Medical Plans, for one, said last month it would discontinue its Medicaid managed-care contracts next year, as "financial losses from the Medicaid managed-care business are not sustainable." The company declined to comment further.

Private-equity executives said while the macroeconomic environment favors the operation and expansion of risk-taking provider groups, whether investors will make money from such investments boils down to how well their portfolio companies are run.

"Risks go both ways ," said Pamplona's Mr. Gelber. "If you can reduce the costs of care, you have an upside to it; but if you can't manage the costs, you are going to take a hit.

VC Profile: FirstMark Capital Grows Along With New York's Venture-Capital Market

When Rick Heitzmann helped launch FirstMark Capital in 2008 to focus on New York startups, many people told him it wouldn't work.

The New York venture-capital ecosystem was much smaller then, with a few other investors such as Union Square Ventures. Now there are many venture firms and incubators in New York and a startup industry that is the second largest after the San Francisco Bay Area.

"When we started in 2008, people said they aren't sure New York is big enough a market to start a VC firm," Mr. Heitzmann said. "That's changed over the past eight years, and it's gotten to the point where it's sustainable and building on itself."

FirstMark Capital

The Firm

The New York firm, which invests in technology startups, has more than $1.5 billion in assets under management.

The Fund

A $275 million early-stage fund to invest in early-stage technology and a $205 million growth-stage fund.

The Strategy

The fund makes 50% of its deals in New York, while also looking for companies throughout the U.S.

FirstMark was formed in 2008 by the technology team of Pequot Ventures, the former venture arm of hedge fund Pequot Capital Management Inc. that has since closed. FirstMark continued the investing it had done prior to the spinout, but expanded its focus on tech startups in the New York area. This followed the spinout of Pequot Ventures' health-care practice as Longitude Capital in 2006.

FirstMark, which has invested in companies such as Pinterest Inc. and Shopify Inc., in June raised $480 million for two new venture-capital funds: $275 million for a fourth early-stage fund and $205 million for a second opportunity fund to invest in growth-stage deals.

Venture capitalists invested $8.5 billion in New York City startups in 2015 and $5.9 billion in 2014, up from $2.4 billion in 2008 and $1.8 billion in 2009, according to VentureSource, a data provider owned by Private Equity Analyst publisher Dow Jones & Co. Investors pulled back in the first half of 2016 in New York as they did industry-wide, investing $3.8 billion.

The New York startup industry has also been buoyed by exits such as online handmade-goods marketplace Etsy Inc., which went public in 2015, and social site Tumblr Inc., which was acquired by Yahoo Inc. for $1.1 billion in 2013, as well as more recent large private companies such as WeWork Management LLC, Kickstarter, BuzzFeed Inc. and ZocDoc Inc. Large West Coast companies such as Google Inc., Facebook Inc., Microsoft Corp. and others also have opened significant offices in New York.

FirstMark's growth fund will invest at the Series B, C or D stages in startups backed from its own early-stage funds as well as in companies outside its funds that have broken out and shown that they are winners, Mr. Heitzmann said.

Some companies from the firm's first opportunity fund include Pinterest, Airbnb Inc., InVision Inc. and Tapad Inc., which agreed to be acquired by Telenor for $360 million in February.

FirstMark, one of the larger venture-capital firms in New York, is bullish on local startups, having made about 50% of its investments there, while also sealing 25% of its deals in the San Francisco Bay Area.

"The New York angle actually worked for us. I liked their angle and they've had some winners," said a limited partner in FirstMark who declined to be named because he wasn't allowed to speak publicly for his firm. "Ultimately, I was able to sell it [to my partners], and it has worked out quite well."

FirstMark is probably best known for its early-stage investment in Pinterest, which was valued at $11 billion last year. FirstMark first invested in Pinterest in a 2010 angel round after investing in the founders' previous app Tote. The firm has also invested in Riot Games Inc., which was acquired by Tencent Holdings Ltd.; x.ai; Lumos Labs Inc., which does business as Lumosity; Knewton Inc.; and HyperScience.

The firm prefers to invest in serial entrepreneurs as well as people it has worked with before or known for a number of years. Areas of focus include big data, artificial intelligence and marketplaces, as well as social, enterprise, software as a service, health care and education.

FirstMark also has played a notable role in building today's sizable New York tech community with its monthly events on big data, design and other topics, as well as services for its companies, including recruiting and customer service.

The firm's managing directors are Mr. Heitzmann, Amish Jani and Matt Turck. Two partners in the firm's last fund, FirstMark co-founders Lawrence Lenihan and Gerald Poch, aren't in the new fund. The firm doesn't have immediate plans to add new partners, but eventually would do so if the right candidate is available, Mr. Heitzmann said.

After a first quarter that recorded a striking slowdown in U.S. venture-capital investing, the second quarter was a mixed bag with investment volume increasing but deal pace declining.

Investment volume climbed to $15.78 billion in the second quarter, with Uber Technologies Inc. and Snapchat Inc. accounting for nearly $5 billion of the total, according to VentureSource, a data provider owned by Private Equity Analyst publisher Dow Jones & Co. Uber raised $3.5 billion and Snapchat hauled in $1.27 billion during the second quarter.

Not counting those two deals, venture financing during the quarter came in well below the first quarter's $13.18 billion. Even including them, total investment fell by 20% from the second quarter of 2015, when U.S. venture-backed companies raised $19.61 billion.

Investment in the first half of this year totaled $28.96 billion, compared with $36.74 billion in the first six months of 2015.

Deal activity during the second quarter reflects a more cautious atmosphere than that of previous investment periods, with 845 rounds of financing during the quarter, an 8% decline from the prior quarter and a 25% drop from the same period last year. Deal flow in the second quarter was the slowest since the third quarter of 2010, when there were 744 funding deals.

"Capital is patient and waiting for entrepreneurs' valuation expectations to come back down to where the market is now," said Ian Sigalow, a co-founder and partner at Greycroft Partners. "Also people are shopping for bargains and adding reserves for companies where VCs overpaid."

Valuations have cooled, according to VentureSource. The median valuation in the first half of this year stood at $20 million, a little below the $21.25 million median for 2013 but markedly lower than last year's $55 million mark.

Here is a look at what happened in various sectors during the past quarter.

Health Care

Sliding public-market valuations for biotechnology companies have reverberated through private markets, as investments in health-care startups sharply declined during the first half of this year.

Health-care venture investment dropped by 23% to $6.34 billion compared with the first six months of last year, which recorded $8.24 billion for the sector, industry data show.

Biotech brings in more venture funding than any other medical sector and is one of the leading industries for venture-capital investment. In recent years, venture investment totals for biotech have markedly heated up amid a booming initial public offering market, which helped pull crossover investors into private financings of drug startups.

Last year, biotech crossover investors helped drive up overall health-care venture investment to $8.24 billion in the first half. Since then, however, biotech IPOs have cooled and medical venture investment totals have declined.

Venture firms invested $2.96 billion in 182 health-care financing deals last quarter, a 30% drop from the $4.23 billion spread across 204 rounds in the year-ago period. Last quarter's total was the lowest health-care quarterly sum since the $2.45 billion wagered in the third quarter of 2014.

Investment dropped in every medical sector last quarter compared with the year-ago period, but biotech saw the steepest decline. The $1.6 billion put into 69 biotech rounds was down 34% from the $2.34 billion pumped into 80 deals during the same period last year.

Information Technology

Investments in information-technology companies fell during the second quarter to the lowest level in nearly two years, as expectations of venture capitalists and entrepreneurs continued to diverge.

Companies raised $2.39 billion, about 35% below the first quarter's $3.65 billion and nearly the same drop compared with the year-ago quarter, when funding was $3.64 billion.

The number of deals, at 238, was also down. They've dropped by 11% from 267 deals since the first quarter and by 20% year over year.

Information technology has become a world of haves and have-nots: Some companies are raising capital without much difficulty while others are trying to get acquired, raising down rounds or going out of business.

Cybersecurity company Cylance Inc., for instance, which uses machine learning to detect malware and block threats, raised $100 million in June at a valuation of $1.1 billion, more than triple the valuation it had a year ago.

But Keen Labs Inc., which lets customers develop analytics tools, and Qumulo Inc., which makes analytics for network-attached storage, both raised down rounds, as did employer review site Glassdoor Inc.

Financial Technology

Investment in financial technology this year is shaping up quite differently from last year, when online lenders dominated a banner year for fundraising deals.

Overall, 51 financial institutions and services companies raised $1.03 billion in the second quarter, improving on the first quarter, when fintech companies sealed 46 deals totaling $783 million, but still lagging behind 2015's performance, when 59 deals raised $1.19 billion in the second quarter.

Large deals announced in the second quarter include $160 million for health-insurance startup Clover Health, $100 million for online lender Affirm Inc., $75 million for financial adviser Personal Capital Advisors Corp., and $60 million for blockchain-payments company Circle Internet Financial Ltd.

Online lending startups, which hauled in unprecedented capital infusions at high valuations last year, have lost much of the favor in the market, causing widespread pain, as evidenced by layoffs, loan volume decreases and shutdowns.

For the first time since 2014, lending startups took a back seat to payments in terms of venture fundraising, even as the insurance sector gained ground.

"The market was too quick to award these ultrapremium valuations to alternative lenders, some of whom were building not terribly differentiated businesses," said Rob Stavis, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners. Now, he said, the market is acting "as if the whole thing is over," with the sentiment pendulum swinging back in the opposite direction.

Consumer Services

Billion-dollar deals for Snapchat and Uber boosted overall funding for consumer-services startups in the second quarter, although the sector saw a decline in financing rounds.

Venture capitalists made 155 investments in the category, its lowest number of deals since the third quarter of 2010.

"We're definitely seeing a slight slowdown in the pace of quality deal flow, and the number of meetings that we're willing to take have come down," said Jim Scheinman, Maven Ventures' founder and managing partner. "There's more companies who were funded in the last year that are coming back for funding, which frankly look more attractive to us than some of the newer startups that obviously have a lot more risk."

Startups in consumer services raised $6.52 billion, more than three times what the same group received in the first quarter of this year, according to VentureSource. Excluding the megarounds in Uber and Snapchat, though, the category's funding was at its lowest level since 2013.

Retail

Venture funding rebounded in the second quarter, but the bounce back wasn't enough to revive a sluggish retail sector. Retail-focused startups had their slowest first half in terms of total funding since 2010.

Venture capitalists invested more than $250 million in retail startups in the second quarter. That represented a nearly threefold rise over the sector's first-quarter funding largely because of a $111 million round for members-only organic-products startup Thrive Market Inc. The number of retail-focused deals fell to 13 during the second quarter, compared with 21 during the year-ago period.

Investors are pulling back after a few high-profile failures in recent months became symbols of a risky, crowded sector. Members-only sale site Gilt Groupe Inc., once valued at $1.1 billion, sold for $250 million in January, not even fetching the amount it had raised from investors. In June, flash-sale website One Kings Lane Inc., valued at about $900 million in 2014, was acquired for an undisclosed price that buyer Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. termed "not material."

"The poster children have made it very difficult for investors to say,  I'm going to put another $100 million into a retail play,' " said Tim Wilson, a partner at Artiman Ventures.

Food

Venture capitalists' appetite for food startups dropped in the second quarter, particularly at the late stage, after a ravenous second half of 2015.

Investment for food entrepreneurs totaled $49.8 million across 10 deals, down from $69.9 million for 20 deals during the first quarter and $99.6 million for 11 deals during the year-ago period.

By contrast, the sector took in $275.2 million from 15 deals during the third quarter of 2015 and $192.3 million from 14 deals during the fourth quarter.

Still, investors in the category this year maintained a deal pace on par with last year, albeit with smaller sums of money per investment. All deals cemented during the second quarter of this year were seed, Series A or Series B rounds. Moreover, the average deal size in the first half of this year was $4 million, compared with nearly $8 million in the first half of 2015.

"Volume-wise there's still considerable deal flow," said Victor Friedberg, co-founder and managing director at S2G Ventures, which focuses on food and agriculture. "In terms of total capital, it could be down because it's just smaller checks."

"Investors are looking for revenue and gross-margin performance," said James Joaquin, co-founder of Obvious Ventures. "In the early stage, where we do most of our work, it's very vibrant."

Hunt for Returns Reaches Pakistan; Since March, more than $67 billion has poured into a group of 30 emerging markets

Ross Teverson, head of emerging-market strategy at $49 billion money manager Jupiter Asset Management, has a new star pick: Pakistan.

The country wasn't even considered an emerging market when he decided to invest. Until earlier this summer, it was a rung lower a "frontier" market, where stocks are notoriously hard to trade and the political climate is tumultuous. And yet, the benchmark KSE-100 stock index is up 20% in dollar terms this year, Exhibit A in how far global investors are willing to go for returns these days.

Sluggish growth in developed economies has prompted central banks to push interest rates down to zero and beyond, wiping out yields on government debt and sending investors into all sorts of fringe or previously unloved markets such as Pakistan's.

By estimates, since March more than $67 billion has poured into a group of 30 emerging markets tracked by the Institute of International Finance. That number doesn't include money heading to markets such as China and Russia, where information on foreign buying is limited.

"Investors have had to go further down the risk spectrum," said Supriya Menon, senior multiasset strategist at $153 billion money manager Pictet Asset Management.

Alex Muromcew, who manages the TIAA Emerging Markets Equity Fund, has been increasing his fund's exposure to Peru, a fringe investment even among emerging-market specialists. The country has attracted attention with a new president who is seen as market friendly. Stocks there are up 56% this year in dollar terms.

Bond prices in Ecuador have rallied 27% this year, despite an energy-price slump that has cut revenue for the oil exporter. Hungary's stock market is up 16%, beating most European bourses, as investors bet that falling inflation will allow the central bank to ease monetary policy.

Interest is even high in junk-rated Sri Lanka, which reached a deal with the International Monetary Fund in April to stave off a financial crisis. Foreigners have boosted their holdings of Sri Lanka's local-government debt for six straight weeks, according to HSBC Holdings PLC.

Over a single week in July, foreign investors poured more than $5.5 billion into Indonesia, India and five other major emerging stock and bond markets tracked by the Institute of International Finance, the biggest one-week influx of cash in 15 months. Emerging-market debt funds drew a record $14 billion in the four weeks ended July 27, according to fund tracker EPFR Global.

There are limits to how much money these markets can absorb, and analysts warn that investors have probably underestimated the risks. Many emerging economies still rely heavily on commodity exports, making them vulnerable to continued weakness in global growth. Some investors might find it hard to find the exits if markets take a tumultuous turn.

"They might find liquidity to be an issue in emerging markets when there is a need to sell," said Sean Ryan, senior analyst at MPI, a global provider of quantitative research and risk analytics.

Emerging-market stocks and local-currency bonds sustained losses for three consecutive years between 2013 and 2015, as investors pulled out billions of dollars. The MSCI EM index fell 25% over that period, compared with a 52.6% gain for the S&P 500 index. The J.P. Morgan Global Bond Index Emerging Markets Diversified lost 27%, while U.S. Treasury bonds rose 3.4%.

Peru's $109 billion stock market is among the most volatile in all emerging markets. During the past three years, the market lost nearly half of its value, according to MSCI Inc.

Bond investors also have to wrestle with deteriorating credit quality. There have been 19 defaults in emerging countries this year, up from 15 at the same time last year, according to S&P Global Ratings. Nearly one-third of all emerging-market issuers are at the risk of being downgraded.

But an easing of concerns about China's economic slowdown, along with a rebound for commodity prices from their lows early this year, has helped encourage the return to riskier markets. Analysts and investors widely say they expect inflows to continue.

"Emerging markets have been broadly out of favor with global investors for the better part of four years," said Mr. Teverson, whose investment in Pakistan helped his fund gain 17% this year through June. "When you have seen an asset class out of favor for so long and you see valuations so low, that inflow can be sustained for a long period."

Asia, long snubbed by global investors, has been a big winner. The region has accounted for more than half of the emerging-market influx since March, according to the Institute of International Finance.

Foreign ownership of local-government bonds in Indonesia where benchmark yields are hovering around 7% has reached almost 40%, a 15-month peak. That comes although S&P Global Ratings stuck by its below-investment-grade or junk rating on the country in June, citing a population that is still relatively poor and a heavily indebted corporate sector.

In late July, Chinese property developer Greenland Hong Kong Holdings issued $450 million in three-year bonds yielding 4.125%, a half-percentage point below where the junk-rated company initially marketed the bonds and just 3.3 percentage points more than three-year U.S. Treasury notes.

Pacific Investment Management Co., the world's biggest bond-fund manager, has done well this year investing in "out of consensus" countries such as Sri Lanka, according to Luke Spajic, who oversees the firm's emerging-market investments in Asia. He warned, however, that risks such as a sharp slide in oil prices could send investors fleeing again.

"Everything could change on a dime," Mr. Spajic said.

How I Was Wrong About ObamaCare

By Bob Kocher 
913 words
1 August 2016
The Wall Street Journal
J
A11
English
Copyright 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

I was wrong. Wrong about an important part of ObamaCare.

When I joined the Obama White House to advise the president on health-care policy as the only physician on the National Economic Council, I was deeply committed to developing the best health-care reform we could to expand coverage, improve quality and bring down costs. We worked for months to pass this landmark legislation, and I still count celebrating the passage of the Affordable Care Act with the president one balmy spring night in 2010 as one of my greatest Washington memories.

What I got wrong about ObamaCare was how the change in the delivery of health care would, and should, happen. I believed then that the consolidation of doctors into larger physician groups was inevitable and desirable under the ACA. I joined my White House health-care colleagues -- Ezekiel Emanuel and Nancy-Ann DeParle -- in writing a medical journal article arguing that "these reforms will unleash forces that favor integration across the continuum of care." We added that "only hospitals or health plans can afford to make the necessary investments" needed to provide the care we will need in a post-ACA world.

Well, the consolidation we predicted has happened: Last year saw 112 hospital mergers (up 18% from 2014). Now I think we were wrong to favor it.

I still believe that organizing medicine into networks that can share information, coordinate care for patients and manage risk is critical for delivering higher-quality care, generating cost savings and improving the experience for patients. What I know now, though, is that having every provider in health care "owned" by a single organization is more likely to be a barrier to better care.

Over the past five years, published research, some of it well summarized on a Harvard Medical School site, has indicated that savings and quality improvement are generated much more often by independent primary-care doctors than by large hospital-centric health systems.

Look at accountable-care organizations (ACOs), in which doctors and health-care providers come together to provide complete care for an individual and are compensated for keeping them healthy and generating savings. Based upon the latest data the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has released,from 2014, independent physician-led ACOs, like the Rio Grande ACO on the Texas border, are outperforming ACOs from many of the most famous health systems. Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore has been ranked as one of the top three health systems in the nation, but its ACO failed to achieve shared savings in 2014.

Small, independent practices know their patients better than any large health system ever can. They are going up against the incumbent and thus are driven to innovate. These small businesses can learn faster without holding weeks of committee discussions and without permission from finance, legal and IT departments to make a change.

More often than not, one of the most important changes these practices make is embracing technology. The ability to store, analyze and make sense of data has now become so easy and inexpensive that all physicians can use "big data."

In my White House days, we believed it would take three to five years for physicians to use electronic health records effectively. We were wrong about that too. At every opportunity, organized medicine has asked to delay and lower thresholds for tracking and reporting basic quality measures; yet they have no reason to delay.

In the ACOs run by Aledade, which advises small medical practices (I sit on its board), we have found that independent primary-care doctors are able to change their care models in weeks and rapidly learn how to use data to drive savings and quality. For small practices, it does not take years to root out waste, rewire referrals to providers who charge less but deliver more, and redesign schedules so patients can see their doctors more often to avert emergency-room visits and readmissions.

Recognizing the strength in the small practices, the federal government needs to write rules that make it easier for them to thrive under ObamaCare and don't tip the scales toward consolidation. That means introducing payment models that limit losses for small providers to the Medicare dollars they receive rather than total spending, and which rely on multiyear benchmarks instead of single-year swings. It also means comparing small practices to other small ones -- instead of to large health systems with large balance sheets -- when determining if a practice deserves bonus payments for savings.

Large health systems deliver "personalized" care in the same way that GM can sell you a car with the desired options. Yet personal relationships of the kind often found in smaller practices are the key to the practice of medicine. They are the relationships that doctors want to forge with patients, and vice versa. It may sound old-fashioned, but what I have learned is that we do not need to sacrifice this unique feature of our health-care system as we move forward in adapting new value-based payment models and improving the health of patients.

Business News: Group Buys Israeli Game Business

Corrections & Amplifications

The Chinese consortium buying some subsidiaries of Caesars Interactive Entertainment, an Israeli games business, consists of more than a dozen investors. A Business News article Monday about the deal incorrectly said the consortium consists of 11 investors.

(WSJE Aug. 2, 2016)

(END)

SHANGHAI -- A Chinese consortium led by Shanghai Giant Network Technology Co. and joined by a fleet of financial moguls including a private-equity arm set up by Alibaba founder Jack Ma has agreed to purchase an Israeli games business for $4.4 billion in cash.

The consortium of 11 investors -- including Giant Investment Ltd., Yunfeng Capital, a private-equity firm co-founded by Alibaba Group Holding's Mr. Ma, China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co., China Minsheng Trust Co., CDH China HF Holdings Company and Hony Capital Fund -- will purchase a 100% stake in Caesars Interactive Entertainment's subsidiaries, including mobile-games unit Playtika. A statement announcing the deal was released Sunday by Shenzhen-listed Chongqing New Century Cruise Co., a shell company bought by Giant Interactive Group last year.

Caesars Interactive Entertainment is a subsidiary under a joint venture between Caesars Acquisition Co. and Caesars Entertainment Corp. It has developed casino-style games including Caesars Casino, Bingo Blitz and World Series of Poker. The deal doesn't include World Series of Poker and CIE's real-money online gaming business.

The deal, underscoring the Chinese game developer's ambition to expand overseas, is another big Israel-focused move by a Chinese firm. China National Chemical Corp. paid $1.44 billion for a 40% stake in crop-protection producer Adama Agricultural Solutions in July and last year Shanghai Bright Food took over Tnuva, Israel's largest food producer, for more than $2 billion.

Possessing advanced research and development, big data and artificial-intelligence analysis capabilities, Playtika has maintained rapid growth over the past five years, the statement said. Its main business is focused on games such as poker, and it has no presence in China yet. The virtual currency used on the Playtika platforms will remain unexchangeable into real currency, the filing said.

The consortium boosted capital in Alpha Frontier Ltd. in its purchase of CIE's Playtika, said the statement. Playtika will continue to run independently with its headquarters remaining in Herzliya, while its existing management will oversee daily operations, said the companies.

In October 2015, the formerly U.S.-listed Giant Interactive, owned by billionaire Shi Yuzhu, returned to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange via a $2.1 billion reverse merger with Chongqing New Century Cruise Co., which is currently valued at $12.6 billion.

Huffington Post Chief Executive Jared Grusd is joining the board of directors at education-technology company Newsela Inc.

Backed by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and Mark Zuckerberg's education fund, New York-based Newsela aims to make news articles and other nonfiction content accessible to students at different reading levels. Mr. Grusd has previously worked at several technology companies, including Spotify Technology SA.

Mr. Grusd is also a professor at Columbia Business School and said he is personally passionate about education as a cause.

"The mission of Newsela immediately grabbed me to unlock the written word for everyone," Mr. Grusd said.

Newsela CEO Matthew Gross said the company is bringing on Mr. Grusd because of his experience in the technology industry. The company uses a combination of machine learning and freelance journalists to rewrite articles and historical documents at five different grade levels.

Currently the company uses a "freemium" model, offering its service free to students and teachers but requiring school districts to pay for access to its analytics. Mr. Grusd has experience in using this model from his time at Spotify, which uses a similar model. Though Spotify has yet to turn a profit using this approach, Mr. Grusd said he's confident that Newsela will "crack the code" in the education space.

Newsela has several partnerships with media companies, including The Washington Post. However at this time, it has no plans to do so with Huffington Post. Mr. Grusd said his role at Huffington Post didn't lead him to join the board.

"I spent my career less in media and more at technology companies," he said.

Talend Nudges Dormant Tech IPO Market; Software company's stock surges on only fifth tech debut of 2016

Software company Talend SA had a strong debut on the Nasdaq on Friday in what investors see as a possible boost for the lackluster tech IPO market so far this year.

Talend priced the offering at $18 a share, above the company's estimated range of $15 to $17, and raised $95 million on the deal. Shares opened Friday at $27.66, up nearly 54% from the IPO price, and closed at $25.50.

The IPO, only the fifth tech debut of 2016, provided an encouraging sign as companies have hesitated to risk a poor performance in the public markets even as private capital has become harder to raise.

"While relatively few in number, the strong aftermarket performance of these [recent] offerings is reinforcing the demand," said Brett Paschke, head of Equity Capital Markets at investment banking firm William Blair & Co. "We are seeing many companies making preparations to launch and expect a more active IPO market in the coming months."

Talend makes software that combines data from disparate corporate systems so that companies can use it to make business decisions. It claims more than 1,300 customers, including General Electric Corp.

It attributed the decision to go public to a combination of revenue growth, positive cash flow, and burgeoning demand.

"Part of the reason we were able to take the company public in an environment like this is a combination of high and accelerating growth with cash-flow break even," said Chief Executive Mike Tuchen. "We are sustainably cash-flow positive, and there is an enormous market [of big data and cloud customers] moving our way."

The offering shows that the market for tech IPOs may be reviving after a dormant period.

Line Corp., which makes a mobile messaging app, raised $1.14 billion in July in "http://www.wsj.com/articles/lines-post-ipo-run-defies-host-of-skeptics-1468587242"in New York and Tokyo and was trading Friday nearly 12% above its IPO price of $32.84.

Twilio Inc., which provides telephony services over the internet, closed Friday at $40.63, up from an IPO price of $15.

Talend is somewhat unusual, according to Menlo Ventures Managing Director Matt Murphy, who isn't a Talend investor. It was founded in France, has several European investors and less than $100 million in revenue, which venture investors have considered the bar for companies going public.

"If a company like that can get out and do well, it says a lot about the appetite out there for new issues, which is what everyone is worried about," Mr. Murphy said.

Still, the IPO market has been missing big names like Uber or Airbnb, according to Andreessen Horowitz Managing Partner Scott Kupor.

"We need one of those marquee names to go out," Mr. Kupor said. "Until then, you'll see a slower drumbeat" of smaller companies.

Talend has raised more than $100 million from investors including Balderton Capital, Bpifrance, Idinvest Partners, Iris Capital and Silver Lake Sumeru.

Although it isn't profitable, both revenue and net losses have been moving in the right direction. Its revenue last year was $76 million, up from $62.6 million in 2014. Net loss was $22 million, compared with a $22.5 million loss in 2014.

The market for software that, like Talend's, helps corporate customers analyze large amounts of data has been uneven, as many customers have struggled to understand what they want to do with data and how to do it.

Big data technology is also shifting as more companies move software from their own premises to the cloud.

A couple of Talend's competitors, Tibco Software Inc. and Informatica Corp., "http://www.wsj.com/articles/permira-cppib-poised-to-take-informatica-private-in-5-billion-deal-1428398039" to manage this transition, which requires changing from selling perpetual licenses to cloud software subscriptions, according to IDC Research Director Stewart Bond.

While Talend's cloud business is growing, "almost every company will be hybrid [cloud and on-premises] for at least another decade," Mr. Tuchen said. "We can solve the problem while they're doing it."

About half the market doesn't use specialized software to extract and analyze data, instead doing it by hand, he said. That leaves lots of opportunity for software companies to automate the work, he added.

Sterling s fall hits Rolls-Royce, a slew of mixed results and Jaguar is caught between Tata and NTT DoCoMo. FT Opening Quote, with commentary by City Editor Jonathan Guthrie, is your early Square Mile briefing. You can "http://on.ft.com/1QO33TA", is your early Square Mile briefing. You can

Rolls-Royce has taken a socking 2.2bn charge on a dollar hedge to reflect the fall in sterling in the wake of the Brexit vote. As a result, the jet engines group has made a 2.15bn loss in the half-year to the end of the June, compared with a 310m profit last time.

The write-down does not have a cash cost. Underlying profits fell 80 per cent to 104m, which chief executive Warren East says was in line with expectations. However the engineer remains in a vulnerable state as it seeks to ramp up profits. A revision of accounting policies meanwhile looks set to slow the future rate of revenue recognition.

"http://www.ft.com/fastft/2016/07/28/lloyds-sheds-another-3000-jobs-warns-of-post-brexit-slowdown/?ftcamp=crm/email//nbe/OpeningQuote/product" is also wary of a post-Brexit slowdown in the economy. It has more than doubled first-half profit but is accelerating cost-cutting measures by closing a further 200 branches and removing 3,000 jobs.

The bank, which is 9 per cent owned by the government, posted a pre-tax profit of 2.5bn in the six months to June, up from 1.2bn in the same period last year. Underlying profit, which strips out one-off costs, decreased to 4.2bn from 4.4bn last year   but beat analyst expectations of 4bn.

"http://www.ft.com/fastft/2016/07/28/weak-oil-price-weigh-on-shell-in-2q/?ftcamp=crm/email//nbe/OpeningQuote/product"has also seen a hit to earnings. First half earnings at constant cost of supplies fell 87 per cent to $1bn as a result of weaker gas and oil prices and higher depreciation in the wake of the acquisition of BG. The company has held its dividend at 94 cents per share.

It s a heavy morning for results from big companies. Half year statutory profits are 9 per cent higher at 1.1bn for "http://www.ft.com/fastft/2016/07/28/centrica-earnings-fall-on-warm-us-weather/?ftcamp=crm/email//nbe/OpeningQuote/product", which will doubtless enrage consumer champions. "http://www.ft.com/fastft/2016/07/28/sterling-slump-boosts-schroders-assets-to-record-high/?ftcamp=crm/email//nbe/OpeningQuote/product" has seen half-year profits before tax slide 18m to 282.3m, though assets under management are 34bn higher at 344bn. Adjusted operating profits are 6 per cent higher at 1bn for RELX, the big data company formerly known as Reed Elsevier. It s had a great run in recent years.

BAE Systems and Merlin Entertainment report positive half-year profits movements, while AstraZeneca has headed in the opposite direction. "http://www.ft.com/fastft/2016/07/28/anglo-american-on-track-to-hit-10bn-debt-reduction/?ftcamp=crm/email//nbe/OpeningQuote/product" has narrowed its six-month loss from $1.9bn to $364m, while rival BHP Billiton has chalked up a $1.1-1.3bn provision for its stake in Brazil s Samarco mine, origin of a lethal mud slide.

Lloyds, Sky, BT and Diageo have also announced results this morning.

It s nice that post-Brexit vote news includes stories both Leavers and Remainers can believe in. The FTSE 250 is almost back where it started and economic growth, it transpires, was healthy in the run-up to the referendum. Meanwhile, consumer confidence has plunged, according to a poll by YouGov, and construction growth has slowed, judging from a survey courtesy of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors.

The Brexit aftermath has passed off   fingers crossed   without a systemic shock to the financial system. The debate is now over the local impact on the UK economy, with most economists anticipating a cut to interest rates.

The shaggy dog story of Tata Steel has become shaggier. NTT DoCoMo, the Japanese telecoms group, is threatening to seize the UK steel plants or part of Jaguar Land Rover, another Tata affiliate.

NTT DoCoMo claims that "http://www.tata.com/company/profile/Tata-Sons?ftcamp=crm/email//nbe/OpeningQuote/product", the holding company of the Indian business dynasty, owes it $1.2bn. The row further complicates attempts to sell Tata Steel.

There seems little point in the Japanese group seizing assets in a business rated as valueless. It might perhaps claim Tata Sons  stake in Tata Motors, which owns JLR, a valuable business. But it would have to cross a legal minefield to succeed in this.

Readers awaiting delivery of a new Jag need not worry it will be impounded by angry Japanese telecoms engineers just yet.

Beyond the square mile

Asian markets were mixed on Thursday. Japan s broad Topix was down 1.1 per cent and the Nikkei 225 was off 1 per cent. Australia s S&P/ASX 200 was up 0.3 per cent while the Hang Seng lost 0.4 per cent. The Shanghai Composite sank 0.6 per cent. The drop came a day after Chinese stocks suffered their biggest one-day drop since mid-June amid reports that authorities were planning to step up regulation of wealth management products.

Oil was recovering from Wednesday s slide. West Texas Intermediate was up 0.4 per cent at $42.09 a barrel while Brent crude, the international benchmark, gained 0.2 per cent to $43.64.

Gold was down 0.2 per cent at $1,338.03 an ounce, after climbing 1.5 per cent the previous session.

The dollar index, a measure of the US currency against a basket of global peers, slipped 0.4 per cent, on track for a fourth straight day of decline that would mark its longest losing streak since mid-June.

In the US, the Fed left interest rates unchanged. The S&P 500 was down 0.1 per cent.

Marriott and Hilton cut forecasts amid fears of growth peak

Two of the biggest US hotel chains, Marriott International and Hilton Worldwide Holdings, cut their growth forecasts as tightening corporate travel budgets and global economic uncertainty put pressure on hotel bookings.

Some analysts suggest the US hotel industry might be reaching a cyclical peak. Occupancy rates plateaued in the second quarter at 69.4 per cent, up just 0.6 per cent on the same period in 2015, according to STR, a data and analytics group.

During the peak before the financial crisis, occupancy rates hit 63 per cent.

 We re probably in the later innings of this cycle,  said Dan Wasiolek, senior equity analyst at Morningstar.  Revpar [revenue per available room] has probably peaked, but that doesn t mean it won t be positive. 

Lukas Hartwich, a senior analyst at Green Street Advisors, said he expects revenue growth rates to remain low until profits in the energy sector recover and multinationals loosen travel budgets.  The macro backdrop is driving the bus right now,  he said.

"http://www.ft.com/topics/organisations/Hilton_Hotels_Corp" revised its guidance on full year revenue growth on Wednesday, citing a slowdown in corporate bookings, to a range of 2-4 per cent per available room, down from previous estimates of 3-5 per cent.

It also revised down its estimate of adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for the year from $3.02bn-$3.1bn to $2.98bn-$3.04bn.

"http://www.ft.com/topics/organisations/Marriott_International_Inc" followed suit, limiting 2016 revenue growth to roughly 3 per cent per available room, on a constant dollar basis, from earlier estimates of 3-5 per cent.

The company, which excluded the potential impact from its takeover of Starwood, revised down its adjusted ebitda to $1.9bn-$1.97bn from $1.89bn-$1.9bn.

Laura Paugh, global chief investor relations officer at Marriott, said business bookings have had an effect on revpar since the fourth quarter of 2015.  With the economy growing slower than we d like, we re trying to make up for that dearth of business travellers with leisure [travellers] at lower rates,  she said.

Instability in the global economy, including fallout from the Brexit vote, terror events in Europe and the recession in Brazil, have also put pressure on performance.

Starwood Hotels reported second quarter declines in revenue per available room in Latin America and Africa and the Middle East of 5.1 per cent and 9.7 per cent respectively. The W Hotels chain owner reported global revenue growth of 1.4 per cent per available room.

The large hotel operators, which survived the financial crisis by selling off property and becoming primarily hotel managers rather than owners, have been racing to add scale and consolidate.

Marriott s cash-and-stock takeover of Starwood, worth $13.6bn when it was agreed in March, awaits regulatory clearance from China.

Ms Paugh said Marriott has been in a  two horse race  with Hilton to add new units.  If you re a developer and looking to select a brand, Marriott and Hilton are pretty much taking the lion share of new development. What will be interesting is how the Starwood brand plays into that,  she said.

With the closing of the Starwood deal, Marriott is expected to top the list of largest hotels by room size. In the second quarter the group added close to 11,000 net rooms, while Hilton added 10,400.

Marriott shares are up 5.2 per cent this year, slightly trailing behind the Baird/STR hotel index, which is up 5.6 per cent. Hilton, the largest hotel operator by market cap, has gained 8.3 per cent.

Debt Collectors Want New CFPB Rules to Address Email, Text Messages; Law governing industry was enacted in 1977, lacks provisions for digital communication

If a collection agency trying to recoup an outstanding debt doesn't respond to an email or keeps calling without leaving a voice mail, there is a reason for it.

The law governing the debt collection industry was enacted in 1977 and doesn't have provisions for digital communication methods used widely today.

"The law explicitly addresses the use of postcards, collect calls and telegrams but is silent about the use of voice mail, email and text messages," Richard Cordray, director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said. "As new forms of technology have emerged, many questions have arisen as to how to apply the law."

That is one of the reasons why Mr. Cordray announced a plan Thursday "http://www.wsj.com/articles/cfpb-unveils-overhaul-of-debt-collection-1469678460" covering the debt collection industry, providing fresh interpretations to the four-decades-old law called the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, or the FDCPA.

At a public hearing in Sacramento, Calif., where the CFPB unveiled an outline of the rules under consideration, several industry representatives urged the watchdog agency to provide clear guidelines on the use of digital technology, including email and text messaging.

"These new technologies create tremendous opportunities for consumers, debt collectors and debt owners," said Jim Mastriani, president and chief operating officer of Velocity Portfolio Group, a debt collector based in Wall Township, N.J. "However, currently these technologies most often go unused &in favor of traditional telephone and mail communication because of concerns about liability and running afoul of the FDCPA."

Others said many customers much prefer communicating with debt collectors using email or text messages, rather than talking on the phone.

TrueAccord, a San Francisco startup, offers an automated and personalized debt collection service using data, machine learning and behavioral analytics. Ohad Samet, the company's chief executive, said using new technology allows debt collectors to reduce call volume by up to 95%, using methods much less intrusive to consumers.

"We have empirical evidence showing using new technology text, email, social media, digitizing dispute process significantly improves consumer protection, measured by consumer feedback and marked reduction in consumer complaints," Mr. Samet said at the CFPB event.

Venture Deals in Most U.S. Regions Slow to Rebound

A few megadeals have sent figures for U.S. venture funding back up nationally, but in most regions of the country, that comeback hasn't kicked in yet.

Total venture funding for U.S. startups rebounded nearly 20% from the first quarter, helped by a few billion-dollar deals for tech's biggest names, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. An absence of comparable mega-rounds outside California, coupled with an otherwise rocky investment climate, meant that investment in other regions largely stayed down.

Beyond Silicon Valley and Los Angeles, several parts of the country that rode the funding boom of the past few years have not seen a comeback. The Pacific Northwest, mountain and Southeast regions all saw their weakest quarter in a while.

More on Second-Quarter Deal Flow

* "http://www.wsj.com/articles/venture-investment-rises-to-15-78b-1468468862"

Los Angeles-based Snapchat's $1.27 billion round also shook up the usual pecking order. Southern California startups raised $2.46 billion, beating out the mid-Atlantic (typically second only to Northern California) by more than $400 million. The L.A. area's surge even offset a funding decline of more than 75% in the San Diego metropolitan area, where the city's health-care sector took a nose dive.

Among metropolitan areas, Los Angeles and Chicago saw the largest growth spurts versus the first quarter. Total investment more than doubled in those regions.

Investment in the mountain states fell to its lowest number of deals since 2009, and its lowest level by amount invested since 2003.

The region had seen a hot streak in 2014 and 2015, buoyed by the general boom in funding for software and business support services. It attracted a record $810 million in the first quarter of 2015, nearly half of which came from a mega-round that valued Utah data analytics firm Domo at $2 billion. The region's slowdown since the fourth quarter of 2015 has mirrored the national slowdown in funding for business support services.

The mountain region's uptick in 2014 to 2015 may have been more of a string of individual large rounds, rather than a meaningful trend, said Ben Dahl, a partner at Salt Lake City firm Pelion Venture Partners. "Those mega-rounds make some of the aggregate data less helpful, because a lot of the dollars are concentrated in those key deals," Mr. Dahl said.

Funding in the Pacific Northwest was spread more broadly across different industries during its hot streak, but in the second quarter fell in every major sector except biopharmaceuticals. Funding in the Pacific Northwest is down to its lowest point since the first quarter of 2014, both in the amount invested and the number of deals.

Despite the downturn in the Pacific Northwest, Jason Stoffer, a Seattle-based partner at Maveron, said he didn't think investors were losing interest in the region.

"I think what you've seen is a bit of a choppy market for venture funding in general this year," said Jason Stoffer, a Seattle-based partner at Maveron. "I don't think there's a demonstrable difference between Seattle and San Francisco in terms of the sentiment."

Funding in the Southeast (stretching from Virginia to Florida and Arkansas) plummeted more than 60% in the second quarter. The drop is largely owing to the $794 million mega-round that Magic Leap announced in February. When this deal is removed, the region's slowdown actually began in the fourth quarter of 2015, and has now resettled at a level that was normal for the region before its six-quarter hot streak.

The Southeast's hot streak was spread across sectors, and can be read as a series of individual weighty rounds like $300 million for Jacksonville, Fla.-based sports merchandiser Fanatics, $225 million for Charlotte, N.C.-based enterprise payments software AvidXchange, or $62 million for Atlanta-based social media app Yik Yak rather than an wave in any particular sector.

"Venture capital is always a tale of two cities," said Mr. Dahl. "Good companies get funded. And it becomes harder for companies that are more marginal from an investment perspective to get funding." Yet Mr. Dahl said he believed investors would continue to seek out and find promising companies, even outside venture's typical hubs.

"I don't think it's a geographic bias," he said. "It's a quality bias."

FogHorn Systems Raises $12M for Industrial Internet of Things

Corrections & Amplifications:

The proper name of FogHorn Systems Inc. was incorrectly cited in an earlier version of this article as Fog Systems Inc. 

Corporations are putting a premium on technology that connects industrial sensors to the internet so they can take the pulse of everything from a manufacturing line to an airplane fleet.

One problem, however, is the distance between the data and the computing resources needed to analyze the data, which clogs bandwidth and slows analysis.

FogHorn Systems Inc. is trying to solve this challenge and has raised $12 million from investors whose companies could benefit from its internet-of-things technology.

The investment in the Mountain View, Calif.-based startup includes $2.5 million of converted seed capital and a Series A round led by current investor March Capital and GE Ventures, with Robert Bosch Venture Capital GmbH, Yokogawa Electric Corp . and Darling Ventures participating.

"The cloud is phenomenal for designing products better or predicting when machines fail, but when something is going to break in the next 30 seconds, it's good to be able to spot the anomaly in real time and take action, or trigger an action, like shutting off the machine," said "http://foghorn-systems.com" Chief Executive David King.

Turbines or pumps or jet engines can rapidly generate billions of bytes data, Mr. King said, but streaming it to the cloud to try to make sense of it isn't practical. FogHorn's technology grabs the data as it comes in, cleans it, filters it and applies analytics, such as anomaly detection, before it goes to the cloud.

FogHorn's technology improves on older industrial control systems that don't operate in real time, he said those systems are hard-wired and look for signals, which they send to a human operator who's supposed to do something.

Mr. King says not enough progress has been made even though Silicon Valley tech companies have done some work on industrial computing. Microsoft Corp ., for instance, put Windows servers on factory floors years ago, and Cisco Systems Inc ., which coined the term "fog computing," developed secure ways to get data to the cloud.

FogHorn is especially useful for a company like GE Digital, which employs thousands of data scientists and has machine-learning libraries already developed for its own use, according to Mr. King.

The new money will be used to develop markets for FogHorn in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific with help from the corporate investors GE Digital, Bosch and Yokogawa.

Sumant Mandal and James Montgomery from March Capital Partners are on the board. Also on the board is TM Ravi, co-founder of The Hive, a Palo Alto, Calif.-based Big Data studio that started Foghorn.

Scout RFP Raises $9M Series A for Web-Based Supplier Auctions

Scout RFP, a strategic sourcing software to help enterprises make purchasing decisions, has raised $9 million in Series A funding, almost entirely from New Enterprise Associates .

The Pepper Pike, Ohio-based startup provides a web-based interface for businesses to set up an auction environment to allow vendors to bid for their business, along with analytical tools to track the results. It is the third company founded by high school friends Christopher Crane and Andrew Durlak.

Scout RFP aims to disrupt a market that has been controlled by Ariba Technologies, a strategic sourcing tool that was acquired by SAP for $4.5 billion in 2012. The startup had raised $22 million from investors including Benchmark, MK Capital and Intel Capital.

"Salesforce is a modern way to think about CRM," said Chetan Puttagunta , a partner at NEA who led his firm's investment in Scout RFP. "Workday is a modern way to think about HR. Scout is a modern way to think about procurement and purchasing."

He described Scout RFP as more user-friendly than Ariba and Oracle 's competing tool, and said it placed greater emphasis on analytics.

The round closed in December 2015. The startup has raised over $11 million in total funding from investors including GV and Zapis Capital Group. NEA led its $2.75 million seed round in January 2015.

Mezi Raises $9M for Shopping Chatbot

A pair of twin brothers have raised $9 million from investors including American Express Ventures to build a chatbot, dubbed Mezi, for shopping.

Mez Mobile Inc., which produces the app, uses a combination of human shoppers and artificial intelligence to help customers book their next flight or buy clothing. In addition to American Express Ventures, Saama Capital, Nexus Ventures and other angels participated in the Series A round.

Mezi is the latest venture from brothers Swapnil Shinde and Snehal Shinde, who co-founded Dhingana Inc . The Indian music-streaming service was acquired by Rdio in March 2014. The Shinde brothers both hold master's in computer science from University of Southern California and have always worked together, with previous positions at Yahoo , Symantec and IBM Software Labs.

Chatbots, or programs that simulate natural conversations, have become popular in recent months with major messaging platforms, such as Facebook Messenger, beginning to support them. But while many chatbots now allow you to shop at one store, Mezi can help you shop at many different stores.

When Messrs. Shinde set out to build Mezi, they initially aimed to build a general virtual assistant. But soon into beta testing they realized they needed to specialize and focused in on shopping. The app launched in December and is available for iOS and over SMS texting.

With American Express Ventures making a strategic investment, the brothers said they would likely have more opportunities to work with the company and use its customer data to build better algorithms in the future. American Express offers a concierge service to its platinum card holders in which its employees assist customers with travel bookings and shopping.

0242 GMT [Dow Jones] Chinese stocks are higher Tuesday morning as some funds flow into defensive blue-chip stocks amid tightening rules over speculative trading. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index advances 0.5% to 3031.58, propelled by gains in aviation, resource and brokerage stocks. The Shenzhen Stock Exchange says it will remain highly sensitive to recent concept stocks, such as those in virtual reality, graphene, and artificial intelligence. At the same time, it will refine share suspension regulations and internal checks to curb speculation. "This is the latest move by the regulator to cool down speculative frenzy. It sent a message to investors that they should lower profit expectations," says Deng Wenyuan, an analyst at Soochow Securities. In addition, market liquidity remains ample, as the central bank injected a net 70 billion yuan Tuesday via reverse repos. The Shenzhen Composite Index rallies 0.7% to 2034.11 and the ChiNext Price Index gains 1.1% to 2270.40.

B12 is using machine intelligence and automation to help companies design websites.

The startup, which is incorporated as Unlimited Labs Inc., said on Monday it has raised $12.4 million in a Series A round led by General Catalyst Partners . Breyer Capital, Founder Collective, SV Angel and other individuals participated in the round, which closed in April.

The company has built a platform called Orchestra, which can help its network of freelance web designers find experts.

The New York startup's announcement comes as a wave of startups using artificial intelligence to augment humans are attracting interest from venture capitalists. While some companies are using machine learning to totally replace tasks that were previously accomplished by humans, many others are focusing on ways to keep humans in the equation and make them more efficient. This is particularly common in areas like customer support, marketing or security, where a human touch is still needed.

Nitesh Banta, a former General Catalyst Partners principal, and Adam Marcus , a former Locu Inc . employee, launched B12 because they say human-assisted artificial intelligence is the future of work. The team focused first on building websites because there is a lot of open data they could use to improve their algorithms, and they also think human-assisted AI works best in creative and analytical jobs.

Mr. Banta said B12 differentiates itself from others in the artificial intelligence category because they think the future of their business will always include human workers, but it will just give them the time and freedom to take on more tasks.

"We're focused on helping people accomplish more and elevate the work they do," he said.

B12 charges $2,000 a year or $199 a month for the service. The company has 11 employees.

Transtar Holding Co.

Missed interest payment

S&P Global Ratings cut the ratings of auto parts manufacturer Transtar Holding Co.'s corporate credit rating to D from CCC+ after the company missed an interest payment on $370 million term loan. The drivetrain parts maker, based in Walton, Ohio, is backed by San Francisco private equity firm Friedman Fleischer & Lowe. "Transtar missed the last interest payment on its term loan and we expect that it will enter into a comprehensive debt restructuring support agreement, which may involve capital infusions from its existing lenders and sponsors, following the recent expiration of its forbearance agreement," said S&P Global credit analyst Nishit Madlani. The private-equity-backed company, which employs 2,300 people, was founded by Monte Ahuja in 1975. It had estimated revenue last year of $643.7 million, according to data provided by FactSet.

Answers Corp.

Ratings downgrade

S&P Global Ratings Wednesday cut its corporate credit rating on Internet advertising and data analytics company Answers Corp. to CCC from CCC+, its $40 million revolver due 2019 and $325 million first-lien term loan due 2021 to CCC from CCC+ and its $180 million second-lien term loan due 2022 to CC from CCC-. "The downgrade reflects our expectation of worsening credit metrics through the end of 2016, primarily because of weakness in the company's promoted content business, Answers.com," said S&P Global Ratings credit analyst Kenneth Fleming. Answers Corp. operates in two business lines: Answer Cloud Services (ACS), which was built through a number of acquisitions over the past four years and offers content management and data analytic services for brands and online retailers; and Answers.com, which generates revenue through advertising.

Companies may be included on this list for a variety of reasons. The most common include these events:

 " default - the company defaults on a principal or interest payment

 " covenant problems - the company violates covenants on its debt agreement

 " downgrade - the company's debt is significantly downgraded by a public ratings agency, or a ratings agency indicates the company is vulnerable to default

 " going concern doubt - the company's auditors question whether the company has the ability to continue as a going concern

 " litigation - a substantial monetary judgment resulting from a lawsuit has been entered against the company.

Inclusion of a company in this category is not intended to suggest that it will file for bankruptcy protection, default on its debt or suffer any other financial failure.

Dentsu Buys Business-to-Business Ad Specialist From Pegasus

Dentsu Inc.'s Dentsu Aegis Network acquired Gyro, one of the largest independent ad firms that specializes in business-to-business advertising.

Gyro, which was founded in 1999, had annual revenue of roughly $73 million last year and works on behalf of companies such as Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., Visa Inc., and AFLAC Inc.

Gyro has been majority owned by private-equity firm Pegasus Capital Advisors since 2008.

Financial terms of the deal with Dentsu weren't disclosed.

With its deal for Gyro, Dentsu is seeking to grab a piece of the growing spending on business-to-business marketing and advertising, which is expected to increase 5% this year in the U.S. to $154 billion, according to research firm Outsell.

B2B advertising is when a company advertises its products or services to other companies or to professional people, not to the general public.

"Many global advertisers and many of our global clients are increasing their investment in B2B marketing," said Rob Horler, chief executive officer of Dentsu Aegis Network in the U.S.

Gyro is the latest deal in a long string of acquisitions by the ad giant, which has been expanding aggressively outside of Japan in an effort to diversify its revenue base. Its deal-making went into overdrive after its $5 billion acquisition of U.K.-based Aegis in 2013.

The company derived 54.3% of its business from markets outside of Japan in fiscal 2015, up from 15% in fiscal 2012.

Dentsu signed a record 36 acquisitions in 2015 and its appetite for deal-making is showing no signs of waning. So far this year, the company has gobbled up companies including digital analytics firm Cardinal Path, digital agency Flock and sports marketing firm Alesport Group.

Dentsu said it would fold its recently launched B2B agency Interprise into Gyro.

Christoph Becker, currently chief executive and chief creative officer of Gyro, will keep those titles at the combined entity, while Stuart Giddings, currently global president of Interprise, will become global network president of Gyro. The Interprise name will only be used in Singapore and Hong Kong.

The deal will give Gyro the resources it needs to expand into growing markets such as Latin America and Asia, said Mr. Becker.

Pairing with Dentsu also gives Gyro the ability to offer clients ad buying and planning services, a function Gyro has largely outsourced.

"We now partner with independent partners [for ad buying] and that is not ideal," said Mr. Becker. "This gives us a media powerhouse and propels our offering."

Abreast of the Market
Low-Volatility Funds Offer Peace of Mind

Investors are pouring billions of dollars into funds that promise to minimize market swings, highlighting the anxiety that prevails after seven years of stock gains.

Low- and minimum-volatility funds are designed to fluctuate less than the market as a whole -- not climbing as high during rallies but not falling as far during selloffs. That kind of risk avoidance has been popular this year. The top-five low-volatility exchange-traded funds added a net $12.5 billion through June 30, even as investors yanked roughly $52 billion from U.S. equity funds, according to estimates from Chicago-based investment researcher Morningstar Inc.

"It helps me sleep well at night," said Narendra Mulani, chief analytics officer at Accenture, who has added to his low-volatility investments this year.

It is another illustration of the rising cost of peace of mind for skittish investors. Proponents of the approach say it helps investors weather market swings, while providing higher returns over the long run. Critics, however, say they have become trendy investments whose benefits could erode if interest rates rise or markets continue to climb.

The stocks within the iShares Edge MSCI Minimum Volatility USA ETF have gained substantially in 2016 to trade at an average of roughly 26 times their trailing 12 months of earnings. That is 30% higher than the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF's P/E of 20.

Such premiums are now common for funds that some investors and analysts said often concentrate in assets such as utility stocks or real-estate investment trusts that have performed well recently but show limited future potential and typically lag behind the market in periods of high confidence or strong growth.

"If you're paying too high a price, you may be taking on the risk you're trying to avoid," said Jim Stephenson, portfolio manager for the Nuveen NWQ Global Equity Income Fund.

Two of the most popular funds have been among the big gainers this year. Investors added about $6.2 billion to the iShares minimum-volatility ETF in the first half of 2016, according to Morningstar, which includes a collection of relatively stable stocks such as General Mills Inc., Johnson & Johnson and AT&T Inc. The PowerShares S&P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility Portfolio ETF, meanwhile, attracted about $1.4 billion to a fund that selects dividend payers, including financial firms such as data-storage giant Iron Mountain Inc., and utilities including Spectra Energy Corp.

The iShares ETF has risen 13% in 2016, while the PowerShares fund has climbed 19%, according to FactSet.

Robert Nestor, head of U.S. iShares smart-beta strategy at BlackRock Inc., credits most of that fund's 2016 gains to a stable run in January and February. When the S&P 500 tumbled more than 10% at the beginning of the year, it dropped less than 5%. During the sharp selloff after the U.K.'s vote to leave the European Union, it gained 2.2%.

The iShares fund also lagged behind both recoveries, rising 9.7% between the February low and mid-April while the S&P 500 gained 13%. Since the

Brexit selloff ended June 27, the fund has gained 6.5%, as the S&P 500 rose 8.7%.

"The whole idea is to give a smoother ride to investors," Mr. Nestor said.

The funds reflect research that suggests investors tend to overpay for stocks that move more than the broader market and underpay for slow-moving shares, even though those do better in the long run by minimizing losses when the market falls, said Nick Kalivas, senior equity product strategist at Invesco PowerShares. So the theory is that sacrificing some gains when the market rallies, to minimize losses when things sour, pays off.

"This is a way to get equity exposure where you can capture some of the upside and mitigate some of that downside," he said.

Some financial advisers said that if people flee to low-volatility strategies in times of worry, they could miss out when stocks rally -- buying high and selling low. A report issued in February by Newport Beach, Calif.-based Research Affiliates also found that some smart-beta strategies have outperformed the market because their popularity has driven up valuations of previously unloved companies unsustainably.

The high-dividend stocks typically held by low-volatility ETFs could also sell off when interest rates rise.

"If interest rates ever start to rise, we could see those stocks do as poorly on a relative basis as they have done well recently," said Eric Nelson, an investment adviser at Servo, a wealth-management firm in Oklahoma City.

Low-volatility strategies are aimed at reducing risk, not chasing returns, and many take measures against overconcentrating in a limited number of sectors, several analysts said. The iShares ETF, for example, contains shares of Newmont Mining Corp., even though mining stocks tend to fluctuate more than the broader market. It acts as a balance to holdings such as utilities, said BlackRock's Mr. Nestor.

Supporters also noted that economic and market conditions may matter more to the performance of low-volatility strategies than valuations. And despite the billions attracted by low-volatility funds, they remain a fraction of the overall stock market.

(The following is a roundup of selected companies that have revealed securities sales in recent Form D regulatory filings.

Better data risk making some people uninsurable; Individual pricing

More sophisticated use of data could create an "underclass" of people who cannot afford insurance. According to a report from the Chartered Insurance Institute, consumers could miss out on some types of cover altogether if insurers deem them too risky.

Big data are one of the insurance industry's great hopes for the future. Established insurers and a host of start-ups are investing millions in systems to better understand the information they hold about customers and to collect more. They hope that by better analysing the risks each policyholder faces, they can price products more accurately and advise customers on how to avoid problems.

However, the CII paper warns that using data in this way threatens the concept of pooling risk on which the industry was founded.

"Data is a double-edged sword," said David Thomson, director of policy and public affairs at the CII. "The insurance sector needs to be careful about moving away from pooled risk into individual pricing. They need to think about the broader public interest."

The report says that the concept of pooling risk "underpins the effectiveness of insurance cover". It adds: "Some people may be identified as such high risk to insurers that they are priced out of insurance altogether. Big data could, in effect, create groups of 'uninsurable' people. While in some cases this may be to do with modifiable behaviour, like driving style, it could easily be due to factors that people can't control, such as where they live, age, genetic conditions or health problems."

The issue of genetic data is a particularly contentious one. In theory, genetic data could be useful to insurers when deciding how to price life or health insurance. Because of the ethical questions this poses, an agreement signed in 2000 between the government and the Association of British Insurers stops the industry from using predictive genetic test results. The agreement runs until 2019, although a review is due this year.

"You could price people out of the market for health products. There's a danger insurers will not offer health cover to some people. The government would intervene if people are doing social sorting," said Mr Thomson.

Better use of data in other areas has already forced the government to act. Improved mapping and data analysis have allowed insurers more accurately to assess which homes and businesses run a high risk of flooding. Many people complained that the resulting prices made cover unaffordable for people living in areas at risk.

So the government created Flood Re , a new organisation that aims to lower the cost of insurance for people who live in areas prone to flooding. It started operating in April this year and is funded by a levy on the insurance industry, which in turn passes it on to all home insurance customers. Flood Re does not apply to business insurance.

"Regulators are trying to catch up on this issue," said Mr Thomson. "So there is a huge emphasis on insurers to guard their own reputations and business models. As in banking, algorithms can be good and bad."

Equities remain on a high as ECB leaves monetary policy unchanged; Global overview

Benchmark bond yields start inching lower and single currency wobbles after central bank keeps refinancing rate at zero

Global stocks clung on to eight-month highs as benchmark bond yields began inching lower as the single currency wobbled after the European Central Bank left monetary policy unchanged.

The FTSE All World equity index hovered at its best mark since early November after Wall Street's S&P 500 closed on Wednesday at a fresh high of 2,173. The S&P slid 0.2 per cent going into the New York afternoon to 2,167.69.

The pan-European Stoxx 600, which had rebounded more than 10 per cent from the post-Brexit low hit on June 27, closed 0.1 per cent lower.

The single currency fell 0.1 per cent to $1.1008 and benchmark government bonds yields also moved lower.

German 10-year Bund yields dropped by less than one basis point to 0.02 per cent. US 10-year Treasury yields lost 1bp to 1.57 per cent.

It followed the ECB's decision yesterday to hold policy constant, as expected. It kept its main refinancing rate at zero and the deposit rate at minus 0.4 per cent while maintaining the  80bn level of monthly asset purchases.

In his press conference, president Mario Draghi struck a moderately dovish tone and reiterated he remained willing to use all the stimulatory tools at his disposal if required. But he said the ECB had not discussed changing its easing rules to allow it to expand its asset purchase programme.

However, some analysts thought the ECB was still likely to do more QE.

"The immediate risk of financial market contagion after the UK [Brexit] vote has subsided, an economic slowdown in the eurozone is still likely, pushing inflation down," said Tomas Holinka, economist at Moody's Analytics. "Below-target inflation until 2019 will force the ECB to keep the main refinancing rate at zero in the three-year horizon, while extending the asset purchases."

The ECB's UK and Japanese peers are also expected to loosen policy further in coming weeks. And the trend for more central bank largesse, alongside some generally well-received corporate earnings in Europe and the US , has helped buoy stock markets of late.

Base metal prices held on to gains that took copper to a two-week high, though Brent crude dropped 1.5 per cent to $46.45 a barrel after rallying 1.1 per cent on Wednesday when US data showed a ninth consecutive weekly fall in oil inventories. Dollar-denominated commodities were helped by the buck slipping back from a four-month peak.

The dollar index, which on Wednesday rose to 97.23 on expectations that better US economic data may encourage the Fed to raise interest rates this year, eased 0.2 per cent to 97.01.

Sterling traded flat at $1.3208 - still well below the $1.50 at which it traded when the Brexit polls closed on June 23 - after a report showed UK retail sales fell 0.9 per cent in June. But gilt yields are tracking peers, adding 2bp at 0.85 per cent.

The yen was a standout underperformer, initially weakening on reports that policymakers are considering stimulus measures at the upper end of the previously forecast 10tn-20tn range.

The yen moved through 107 per dollar, its softest in six weeks and a fall that helped the export-sensitive Nikkei 225 rise 0.8 per cent, taking its gains over the last eight sessions to 11.3 per cent.

Nikkei futures later fell back, however, and the yen traded 1 per cent stronger at 105.88 after the BBC aired an interview with BoJ governor Haruhiko Kuroda recorded a month ago in which he said there was "no need and no possibility" for the central bank to embark on a policy of so-called "helicopter money". Tokyo's earlier rally was in keeping with the mood across much of the region.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng index, which tends to track Wall Street quite closely, was up 0.5 per cent, while on the Chinese mainland the Shanghai Composite rose 0.4 per cent and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.4 per cent.

New Zealand's S&P/NZX 50 rose 0.6 per cent to a new record high as the Kiwi dollar dipped below US$0.70 after the Reserve Bank of New Zealand - which delivered a surprise rate cut in March - said monetary policy would "continue to be accommodative".

Gold moved up over $15 to $1,331 an ounce, welcoming the softer dollar and lingering tensions over Turkey.

The Turkish lira, which fell overnight to a record low of TL3.096 per greenback on worries that a post-failed coup crackdown by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan will exacerbate tensions, recovered 0.4 per cent to TL3.0783.

But the Istanbul stock market shed 4.4 per cent to a five-month low while Ankara's implied 10-year borrowing costs moved above 10 per cent.

Sprinklr Raises $105 Million to Grow Social Media Management Software; Funding round values the company at over $1.8 billion

Corrections & Amplifications:

The chief executive of Sprinklr is Ragy Thomas. An earlier version of this article incorrectly referred to Mr. Thomas as Mr. Ragy. (July 21)

Social media and customer management software company Sprinklr has raised a $105 million funding round at a valuation of over $1.8 billion, the company announced Wednesday morning.

The round, which brings the company's total funding to $239 million, was led by Singapore-based investment firm Temasek. Wellington Management Company LLP and EDBI also participated, along with Sprinklr's existing investors.

Sprinklr's software is designed to help companies manage every aspect of their activity on social media, from listening to consumer feedback to planning, publishing and measuring the content they post to a growing array of digital platforms.

According to CEO Ragy Thomas, Sprinklr will use the money to grow Sprinklr's software platform, and potentially to fund future acquisitions.

"We have ambitious growth numbers; we think we are sitting on incredible growth opportunity, and have the potential to build the next large enterprise software company," Mr. Thomas said.

The company has made three acquisitions in the past 13 months, including social visualization company Postano, audience segmentation firm Booshaka and analytics company NewBrand.

Mr. Thomas said Sprinklr will continue to make acquisitions if and when suitable opportunities present themselves. As the market for social media marketing software matures, he expects those opportunities to continue to arise. According to some industry observers, it's getting harder for marketing and advertising technology companies to raise money.

"We're seeing first-generation social companies hitting their natural growth limit. This funding round gives us the capital to be opportunistic as we see strategic fits," Mr. Thomas said.

Sprinklr's technology now hooks into 23 social networks and platforms and is used by over 1200 brands including Nike, McDonald's, Microsoft, P&G and Samsung, the company said.

According to Mr. Thomas, companies are increasingly seeing "customer experience management" through social media as a competitive advantage.

Sprinklr said it eclipsed $100 million in annual revenue in 2015, and that its $1.83 billion valuation is a reflection of its growth and performance.

Mr. Thomas said taking the company public through an initial public offering is not currently "top of mind."

Morgan Stanley's Wealth Unit Yields Stability for Bank; Loans to clients help drive 12% increase in net interest income; exploring the robo-adviser game

Morgan Stanley's wealth-management unit muted the effects of volatile markets on revenue during the second quarter, as the bank continues to position the business for profitability and growth as investment advice increasingly goes digital.

Revenue for the New York bank's wealth-management arm in the latest quarter slipped $64 million, or about 2%, from the year-earlier period to $3.81 billion. The unit saw lower commissions and asset-management fees, which fell 14% to $423 million and 4% to $2.08 billion, respectively.

However, net interest income increased by $92 million, or 12%, to $829 million as loans to wealth-management clients grew 19% to a record $69 billion.

"Even though we haven't seen a pickup in retail engagement, [the wealth-management] business continues to provide stability against an uncertain macro backdrop," Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Pruzan said during a conference call Wednesday to discuss earnings.

Profit in Morgan Stanley's wealth arm fell roughly 8% to $516 million from last year, but lower expenses helped pretax profit margin improve from 21% in the first quarter to 23% in the latest quarter. Chief Executive James Gorman previously said the bank has targeted pretax margin for the unit of 23% to 25% for 2017. Overall, "http://www.wsj.com/articles/morgan-stanley-logs-smaller-than-expected-declines-in-profit-revenue-1469012474" but still topped analysts' subdued expectations.

Among other items Morgan Stanley reported along with second-quarter earnings, the bank said its brokerage arm kept its work force basically flat at 15,909.

"Attrition is clearly running low and it's been like that for a while," Mr. Pruzan said on the call. Mr. Gorman added that "http://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-unveils-retirement-savings-revamp-but-with-a-few-concessions-to-industry-1459936802", which toughens standards for financial advisers and brokers providing advice on retirement accounts, hasn't affected recruitment.

Annualized revenue per broker fell about 2% from last year to $959,000.

Morgan Stanley's brokerage had $12 billion in inflows to fee-based accounts. That helped increase fee-based assets by about $22 billion from the first quarter to $820 billion, which represents about 40% of Morgan Stanley's $2 trillion in client assets.

Meanwhile, the unit is exploring the intersection of technology and investment advice, as executives emphasized the firm's investment in digital initiatives during a discussion of the bank's earnings call.

"Digital is far more than just robo," Mr. Pruzan said on the call. "We think that the right business model and the winning hand here is a combination of advice and [financial advisers] with technology."

The unit's digital strategy, he added, has focused on three main areas including data and analytics, efficiencies around automation, and the various platforms on which clients interact with advisers and the firm.

Traditional wealth-management and brokerage firms have been wrestling with how best to embrace the fast-growing digital investment-advice segment, typically referred to as "robo advisers."

Wells Fargo & Co.'s brokerage and retirement arm has announced it may soon offer its own "http://www.wsj.com/articles/wells-fargo-considers-robo-service-1436896442", while UBS Group AG's U.S. brokerage said in May that it is "http://www.wsj.com/articles/ubs-teams-with-robo-advice-provider-1463418199" to develop new tools for its brokers.

Morgan Stanley executives didn't discuss any specific robo offerings on Wednesday, but noted the bank has been "investing heavily in this area."

"We believe secular trends are for advice with technology, and that's the business that we are building," Mr. Pruzan said.

Unilever Buys Dollar Shave Club; European consumer- products giant to pay $1 billion for startup in challenge to P&G

Corrections & Amplifications:

Procter & Gamble's share of the men's razor and blade businesses in the U.S. fell to 59% last year from 71% in 2010, according to Euromonitor An earlier version of this article incorrectly described that market as all of North America.

Four years ago, Michael Dubin launched his company with a hilarious YouTube video poking fun at the pain and expense of shaving. The video went viral and created the Dollar Shave Club. Now Mr. Dubin is selling his startup for a cool $1 billion.

Unilever PLC, the European consumer products giant behind Dove soaps and Axe body sprays, said late Tuesday it was acquiring the Venice, Calif., startup. Terms weren't disclosed, but people familiar with the matter said Unilever is paying $1 billion in cash.

The sale comes about a year after the Dollar Shave Club "http://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120150622eb6mhrmke" in a $75 million funding round led by Technology Crossover Ventures, according to people familiar with the matter. The company has raised at least $150 million in venture capital and had previously raised funding from investors that also include Forerunner Ventures, Venrock and Pritzker Group Venture Capital.

Dollar Shave Club, which isn't profitable, said it has signed up 3.2 million members for its mail-order service that ships out disposable razors and other grooming products for a flat monthly fee.

It has chipped away at market leader Gillette, which has responded with its own Gillette Shave Club and last year filed a patent-infringement lawsuit.

Mr. Dubin's company has been growing quickly by adding customers as well as new product categories, such as hair gels and most recently body washes. The startup had revenue of $152 million last year and is on track to exceed $200 million in 2016, according to Unilever.

In addition to giving Unilever an entry into the shaving market dominated by U.S. rival Procter & Gamble Co.'s Gillette, Dollar Shave Club's direct-to-consumer business model gives Unilever "unique consumer and data insights," said Kees Kruythoff, president of Unilever North America.

Privately, P&G executives acknowledge the company was caught off guard by success of Dollar Shave Club, which started in 2012. "It was probably on the radar but we weren't necessarily having the right conversation around what might disrupt us," said a person familiar with the company's thinking.

P&G's share of the men's razor and blade businesses in the U.S. fell to 59% last year from 71% in 2010, according to Euromonitor. Dollar Shave Club had 5% of the market last year.

Dollar Shave Club offers to send razor cartridges directly to customers for as little as $1 a month, a model that appealed to the changing shopping habits of consumers fed up with the rising cost of a clean shave.

"The razors were just very cheap, that was the draw," said Kurt Jetta, founder of TABS Group, a retailer and consumer analytics firm.

Mr. Dubin, 37 years old, will remain CEO of Dollar Shave Club. He said Unilever promised Dollar Shave Club autonomy within the company and resources to help fuel more growth. The company will operate as a subsidiary of Unilever. He said Mr. Kruythoff proposed the acquisition after the two executives had spent time discussing a potential Unilever investment in Dollar Shave Club.

"If we can deploy those resources in service of our mission we are that much more," he said in an interview. "It just felt right to me and I really trust the people I met at the Unilever."

Mr. Dubin said he will report to a board that includes top-level Unilever executives.

There is "https://bankunderground.co.uk/2016/07/20/is-finance-a-powerful-driver-of-growth/"that a lack of finance is preventing businesses from investing and boosting productivity, but better data is needed to establish whether that is true of all sectors and size of firm, Bank of England economists Saleem Bahaj, Iren Levina and Jumana Saleheen write. "In an era of big data, we have discovered the presence of big data gaps," they write." These data gaps may have blurred our bottom line: we have not found any conclusive evidence of investment deficiency in the UK; and the corporate sector as a whole appears to have an adequate supply of finance to fund their desired investment activities."

BNY Mellon names Kablawi to run European investment services unit

BNY Mellon has appointed Hani Kablawi to head a carved-out role that focuses on the European investment services business of the US custodian bank.

Mr Kablawi, who has been at BNY Mellon for nearly 20 years, will become head of investment services in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (Emea). The division generates most of BNY s revenues in the region and was previously shared with the regional chairman s role.

It will bring together under one unit BNY Mellon s services for investors and banks across asset servicing, alternative investments, corporate trust, broker-dealer, depositary receipts and treasury operations.

Mr Kablawi, who was formerly head of asset servicing in Emea, will report to Brian Shea, chief executive of investment services and Michael Cole-Fontayn , the regional division s chairman. Daron Pearce has been promoted to replace Mr Kablawi as chief executive of asset servicing for the region. (Philip Stafford, July 19)

ICE Futures Europe promotes Williams to COO role

ICE Futures Europe, the London-based derivatives exchange, has promoted Stuart Williams to become its new chief operating officer. He takes over a role that had been held by David Peniket, who is also the group s president. His appointment was effective from July 15, the exchange confirmed.

Mr Williams had previously been corporate development director at ICE Futures Europe and will report to Mr Peniket. Mr Williams, who joined ICE when the US exchange bought NYSE Euronext for $11bn in 2013, had been part of some of ICE  s biggest internal projects of recent years, such as moving clearing of derivatives contracts from LCH to ICE Clear Europe in 2013 and switching trading on Liffe to ICE in 2014. He has also been a management consultant for Protiviti and Accenture. (Philip Stafford, July 19)

LCH promotes Maguire to global rates role

LCH Group, the world s largest swaps clearing house, has promoted Daniel Maguire to an expanded role as global head of its rates and foreign exchange derivatives business.

Mr Maguire will be responsible for the development of listed and OTC rates and FX derivatives at LCH. He has been head of SwapClear, its over-the-counter (OTC) swaps and listed rates business for the last two years, and begins on May 1.

At the same time LCH also appointed Paddy Boyle, a former Goldman Sachs trader, as head of FX product. Mr Boyle was previously global head of G10 FX options at Goldman Sachs and was a member of the Bank of England joint standing committee on FX. He will report to Mr Maguire. (Philip Stafford, April 26)

Euronext s CFO Dauge to join fintech start-up

Amaury Dauge is to end his 15-year career at Euronext , the European exchanges operator, after announcing he will step down to join a financial technology company in New York.

He will be replaced by Giorgio Modica, a former banker at BNP Paribas, as Euronext  s new chief executive Stphane Boujnah reorganises the company s finance team.

Mr Dauge became chief financial officer in 2014 and oversaw Euronext  s demerger from former US parent Intercontinental Exchange , and its flotation on four bourses in Europe. He will leave on June 1st.

Mr Modica was previously a senior corporate financier focusing on the stock exchange sector globally, as well as for the Italian and Spanish markets. He advised NYSE Euronext during its ill-fated attempt to merge with Deutsche Brse , as well as the subsequent IPO once NYSE Euronext was acquired by ICE . He has also worked at HSBC in Milan and MCC/Capitalia in Rome.

The appointments come amid heightened speculation that Euronext may join in potential exchange consolidation and reshuffle of assets. Deutsche Brse is planning to merge with the London Stock Exchange Group but it may face a bid from ICE . The US group has already indicated it would be willing to sell the LSE  s Borsa Italiana , according to two people familiar with the talks.

At the same time Mr Boujnah also appointed Camille Beudin, a former mergers and acquisitions banker as Euronext  s new head of M&A. She previously worked at Deutsche Bank , RBS and ABN Amro .

 Giorgio has been so close to Euronext for so many years that he was the natural person to lead the finance team at Euronext ,  said Mr Boujnah. (Philip Stafford, April 19)

LSE names Ross as chief executive of CurveGlobal

The London Stock Exchange Group has filled the chief executive gap at CurveGlobal, its upcoming new interest rate derivatives joint venture, by naming Andrew Ross of Morgan Stanley to the position.

The position has been unfilled since the LSE said in October it would lead a 30m bank-backed futures trading venue that to compete in European markets dominated by Deutsche Brse and Intercontinental Exchange . Two years in preparation, CurveGlobal represents the biggest push by the LSE into interest rate futures since it was beaten to the 550m sale of Liffe, the London derivatives market, by Euronext in 2002.

At Morgan Stanley , Mr Ross was responsible for agency-listed derivative electronic trading and was also European head of clearing. In his 10-year career at the bank, Mr Ross also been head of CVA trading in London.

 CurveGlobal s success will be built on its ability to bring together a broad swath of exchange-traded derivatives and OTC market participants including the buy and sell sides, prop trading firms and market makers,  said Michael Davie , chairman of CurveGlobal.  It s therefore vital that our chief executive has the depth of experience and relationship with each of these communities, which is why I m delighted that Andrew will be taking on the role. 

The LSE added that France s BNP Paribas had become the seventh shareholder of CurveGlobal on January 29. Bank of America Merrill Lynch , Goldman Sachs , Barclays , Citi, JPMorgan and Socit Gnrale are also backing the project, as is the Chicago Board Options Exchange , the US exchange that owns the Vix volatility indices. The LSE will contribute 9.5m, and the banks and CBOE a further 20.5m. (Philip Stafford, February 5)

Intercontinental Exchange appoints Jackson as CCO

Intercontinental Exchange , the US exchanges operator, has reshuffled several senior executive positions following two recent major purchases.

The Atlanta-headquartered group on Tuesday said it had promoted Ben Jackson , president and chief operating officer of ICE Futures US, to the newly-created role of chief commercial officer. He will be responsible for integration planning and execution of ICE  s acquisitions and joint ventures.

Last month ICE bought Interactive Data , the OTC markets data business in December for $5.2bn, and Trayport , a European energy trading business, from BGC Partners for $650m in shares.

Lynn Martin , president and chief operating officer of ICE Data Services, has been given responsibility for Interactive Data , the OTC markets data business ICE acquired in December for $5.2bn. The unit she heads includes ICE derivatives and New York Stock Exchange market data, analytics and connectivity services.

Trabue Bland, ICE vice-president of regulation, will replace Mr Jackson as president of ICE Futures US. Mr Bland joined ICE in 2007 from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission where he was counsel to then CFTC chairman Walt Lukken .

The appointments are effective from February 1. All three will report to Jeff Sprecher , ICE group chief executive.  These promotions reflect our commitment to delivering on our strategic and financial objectives. And they reflect the contributions of these leaders in serving our customers in an evolving landscape, while establishing the next phase of our company s growth,  said Mr Sprecher. (Philip Stafford, January 26)

Wall retires from chief executive role at Marex Spectron

John Wall is to retire as chief executive of Marex Spectron after more than three years at the helm amid a wide-ranging board reshuffle at the UK commodities broker.

As part of the changes Jeremy Isaacs , the group s non-executive chairman and a key figure in the creation of the Marex business, will also step back from his role.

The duo have played a key role in short life of the company, whose modern incarnation was created when Marex bought by JRJ Group, a private equity firm founded by Mr Isaacs, former head of Lehman s European operations. In the intervening six years it has grown rapidly by hiring staff and purchasing smaller brokers, such as the 94.5m deal for Spectron, in 2011. Mr Wall, who had been at UBS for more than 25 years until his appointment at Marex, was appointed in part to integrate the Marex and Spectron companies.

Mr Wall will be replaced by Ian Lowitt, the group s chief financial officer, who will also move from New York to London to take over. Rob Watts, the group s financial controller, will become Marex s new CFO.

Both appointments take effect from Friday eighth January and remain subject to regulatory approval.

 With the firm in excellent shape, I feel that now is the right time for me to step back. It has been a privilege to lead this great company and I have no doubt that Ian is the right person to take charge of the next stage of its development,  said Mr Wall.

Mr Isaacs will be succeeded by Simon Heale , a non-executive director and former chief executive of the London Metal Exchange . Mr Isaacs will remain on the board. (Philip Stafford, January 6)

Euronext appoints former Tullet executive to lead FICC push

Euronext has appointed Paul Humphrey , a former executive at interdealer broker Tullett Prebon, to help the European exchanges operator develop a strategy to exploit rapidly-changing fixed income, rates and foreign exchange markets.

Mr Humphrey, who had been working at Thomson Reuters as a consultant, will join the group on January 4 with the title of head of fixed income, rates and FX (FICC) strategy. He was previously chief executive of Tullett s electronic broking and information business until the summer of 2014. He has also worked at ABN Amro , Van der Moolen, SLK/Goldman Sachs and ICAP.

His appointment comes as exchanges are increasingly eyeing markets that have long been dominated by banks, which continue to make billions of dollars in profits from it each year. Exchanges have generally been unable to establish a presence in fixed income and forex markets. However a combination of unlawful activity by banks, deep structural change and the emergence of cheap and reliable technology that has allowed alternative ways of trading to emerge. Euronext operates stock, commodity and derivatives markets around the region but has little OTC business.

Mr Humphrey will report to Lee Hodgkinson , head of markets and global sales, who said:  His appointment further strengthens our senior leadership team and his vast experience and strong vision will help us fulfil our growth ambitions in an important sector of the business.  (Philip Stafford, December 2)

Preuss to step away from Eurex role in Deutsche Brse reorganisation

Deutsche Brse , Europe s largest exchanges operator by market capitalisation, has unveiled a wide-ranging internal reorganisation that will see Andreas Preuss step away from his role as head of the Eurex derivatives exchange.

The internal reshaping comes five months after Carsten Kengeter , a former UBS banker, became chief executive with a plan to  put client focus at the heart of its structure.  In a statement on Wednesday, Deutsche Brse said it would create a new  Clients, Products and Core Markets  unit that will encompass its derivatives trading, clearing and settlement business. It will be headed by Jeffrey Tessler , chief executive of its Clearstream settlement business.

Mr Preuss, deputy chief executive and for many years Deutsche Brse  s most senior representative at industry events, will become chief executive of a new division, called  IT & Operations, Data & New Asset Classes . It will combine Deutsche Brse   market data unit, the European Energy Exchange and 360T, the foreign exchange trading network the company bought for  725m over the summer.

The group s cash equities business, which includes the well-known Frankfurt Stock Exchange Xetra, will be separated from the Eurex derivatives business and given its own divisional status  given its high political as well as macroeconomic importance , the company said. The enlarged division, named  Cash Market, Pre-IPO & Growth Financing , will include certificates and warrant businesses and the creation of an  innovative pre-IPO market . It will be led by Hauke Stars, who was previously responsible for Deutsche Brse  s market data division and the renewal of its IT infrastructure.

Mr Kengeter will be directly responsible for group strategy, mergers and acquisitions as well as government relations. (Philip Stafford, November 12)

Bloomberg Beta, the corporate venture capital arm of Bloomberg L.P., closed a second fund of $75 million, the same size as its first fund.

The firm says the fund's mission is to back startups that make businesses work better, building on the group's special interest in machine learning. Since it raised its first fund three years ago, three of its investments have been acquired, although the firm declined to say which ones.

Bloomberg Beta, with offices in New York and San Francisco, takes an unconventional approach to venture capital and has a minimal website. Instead, it publishes its internal operating manual publicly on GitHub, a repository for open source code.

The firm also takes a data-driven approach to investments, using a program called Future Founders, which tries to predict who is most likely to start companies.

Partners in Bloomberg Beta include Roy Bahat, Karin Klein, James Cham and Shivon Zilis.

Recent investments include Orbital Insight Inc., which applies data to understanding national and global trends, and AppZen Inc., which uses artificial intelligence to automate expense reports.

KKR, Warburg Pincus Might Hail Indonesia's Go-Jek

Big-name investors KKR & Co. and Warburg Pincus LLC are taking the "Uber bet" to a new level as they consider an investment in an Indonesian motorcycle-hailing app that would value the startup at more than $1 billion.

The private-equity firms are in discussions to participate in a fundraising round for PT Go-Jek that could raise around $400 million and value the Indonesian company at about $1.2 billion, including the fresh funds, according to people familiar with the matter. Go-Jek, named after the motorcycle taxis, or ojeks, that customers can order through its app, is courting new and existing investors for the fundraising effort.

The people familiar with the situation said the round hasn't been completed and that the terms and participating investors could change.

Investors world-wide are pouring money into ride-hailing apps that are burning through cash to fund subsidies to attract drivers to their platforms. Go-Jek offers cheap, on-demand motorcycle taxis that can be booked through smartphones. The company offers fixed prices and pickups, meaning passengers don't need to haggle over prices at motorbike stands. It has also expanded its offerings into on-demand grocery shopping, delivery services, masseuses and beauticians, and has also ventured into offering cars and minivans.

If successful, Go-Jek's fundraising round would elevate it into the small club of Southeast Asian startups valued at more than $1 billion. Beyond its larger competitor GrabTaxi Holdings Pte Ltd., other billion-dollar startups include online game and messaging business Garena Interactive Holding Ltd. -- valued at about $3.75 billion in a March funding round -- and e-commerce company Lazada Group. In April, China's Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. agreed to pay $1 billion for a majority stake in Lazada.

Gridlock on the streets of Indonesia, Southeast Asia's most populous country and its largest economy, makes motorbike services popular for customers looking to cut through traffic.

Go-Jek competes for Indonesian passengers with ride-hailing companies such as U.S.-based Uber Technologies Inc., whose valuation of nearly $68 billion makes it the world's most valuable startup, and Singapore-based GrabTaxi, which operates across Southeast Asia and was valued at $1.6 billion in a funding round last year. Indonesia is home to more than 250 million people. About 30 million of them live in Jakarta, the capital.

Go-Jek launched its app in January 2015 and operates in 10 Indonesian cities. Both Uber and Grab began as car-hailing companies but have also moved into offering motorbikes. In 2014, Grab inaugurated GrabBike, which now operates in five cities in Indonesia. Uber also started offering motorcycle bookings in February with UberMotor, which it offers in three Indonesian cities. Go-Jek's app was the most-downloaded of the three companies in Indonesia in the first quarter of this year, according to mobile-app analytics firm App Annie, followed by Grab, and then Uber.

Go-Jek has been burning through cash as it provides subsidies to attract riders. The company spent $73 million between October 2015 and March 2016 to expand its business, leaving it with just over $100 million in the bank as of March, according to an investor presentation viewed by The Wall Street Journal.

DCM Ventures raises $770m as VC funding hits 15-year high; Financial services

Venture capital firm DCM Ventures has raised a fresh $770m from backers, including Asia's Tencent, Baidu and SoftBank, at a time when investors are pouring more money into VC funds, despite a cooling in Silicon Valley.

Investments in venture capital firms hit a 15-year high during the first half of this year, underscoring strong investor appetite even though the valuations of some prominent start-ups have been called into question .

Venture capital firms with ties to Asia have been particularly active, with two big rounds closed this week by firms that invest in tech start-ups in the region.

DCM Ventures, with more than $3bn under management, said yesterday that its new fund would split investments between the US and Asia, where previous investment targets have included Renren and Kakao Talk.

Tech investor Jim Breyer and IDG Capital also announced a $1bn fund earlier this week that will invest primarily in start-ups inside and outside China.

Mr Breyer acknowledged that the mood of the market had shifted. "We are in a global late-stage valuation market of increased uncertainty," he said, adding that late-stage start-ups with highly priced shares required more due diligence.

Investing outside Silicon Valley does not eliminate that challenge, he added. "The risk is about the same, in terms of late-stage valuation risk in Silicon Valley versus China."

However, he emphasised that areas such as machine learning and artificial intelligence still provided big opportunities for start-up growth.

The fundraising news from the two firms comes after venture capital firms raised $8.8bn in the second quarter of this year, according to a study by Thomson Reuters and the National Venture Capital Association .

Although second-quarter fundraising was below first-quarter levels, it brings the first half total to $22.9bn, the highest investment levels since the dotcom era.

David Chao , a partner at DCM Ventures, said that the backing of Asian tech companies in its latest round reflects its global ambitions. The emergence of Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba as tech powerhouses have boosted their investments in Silicon Valley.

BlackRock: a rock in a hard place

Managing other people s money is no fun these days. More than four-fifths of US large-cap fund managers failed to beat the S&P 500 index s returns in the past five years, "http://us.spindices.com/search/?ContentType=SPIVA". Investors are wising up, buying cheaper index-tracking products or demanding lower fees. Morale and revenues are falling in tandem.

BlackRock, which runs active and passive funds, released earnings on Thursday. Assets under management are slightly up, and fees slightly down compared with last year s second quarter. Over a five-year period 51 per cent of actively managed fundamental equity strategies have beaten their benchmark and so have 92 per cent of their scientific strategies which rely on data, machine learning and modern technology.

Its iShares division, acquired from Barclays in 2009, accounts for about a quarter of BlackRock s $4.9tn of assets under management, and for 38 per cent of all "http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/8d046d88-2020-11e6-aa98-db1e01fabc0c.html" assets globally.

The company s platform is well diversified across client types, asset classes and strategy types, so when investors switch allocations, they don t need to turn to a different provider: this year they pulled $20bn out of equities but allocated $58bn into BlackRock s fixed-income funds, reflecting the market s risk-off mood. BlackRock s technological prowess supports its ability to create new products, such as  smart beta  strategies, that enhance returns. Few asset managers can credibly combine bottom-up fundamental analysis with high-tech analytics.

Investors should expect no magic, however. BlackRock is well positioned among asset managers, but the pressures on the industry show no sign of relenting. Expect BlackRock s assets under management to keep growing, and the fees it charges for each dollar managed to keep falling.

Bay Dynamics Inc . has raised $23 million to help companies gather cyberrisk analytics.

After high-profile hacks such as the 2013 Target Corp . breach, executives are paying closer attention to cybersecurity. But cybersecurity professionals have struggled to translate cyberthreats into business definitions of risk.

That is where Bay Dynamics ' Risk Fabric tool comes in. It takes information from an enterprise's security tools and reports information about those risks to business leaders, incident responders and security leaders.

"Companies need to move away from speaking in bits and bytes, to speaking in the language of risk," said Bay Dynamics Chief Executive Feris Rifai .

Carrick Capital Partners led the Series B funding. Comcast Ventures also participated.
