Funds Outpay Banks To Lure Data Experts

Hedge funds are paying top dollar to bring in new employees with quantitative skills, underscoring the desperation some funds face to bulk up their abilities around big data and algorithms.

A new survey from Baruch College's financial engineering program found that recent graduates working at hedge funds made significantly more than their peers working at banks. The master's program at Baruch teaches students skills like data science and financial modeling.

At hedge funds, Baruch graduates' annual pay ranged from around $200,000 to more than $1 million, the survey found. But for those alumni working at banks, pay ranged from about $100,000 to $400,000 a year.

Hedge-fund managers once reigned over the investment industry. Now, many of them are floundering. In the quest to gain a new foothold, many have shifted investment decisions from humans to computers. In turn, Wall Street recruiters say people with quantitative skills are in high demand.

In a sign of the shift, some prominent funds have tried to remake themselves. Funds have been recruiting the kind of people who can make investment decisions using code, big data and machine learning.

Two of the Baruch graduates working at hedge funds reported a compensation of $1 million or more.

"People who make that much money make a lot more money for the firm," said Dan Stefanica, a Baruch math professor who analyzed the alumni salary data. "And if you don't compensate them enough, they just go somewhere else."

Hedge funds' hunger for talent is apparent during Baruch's recruiting sessions. During the fall semester, Wall Street firms make their pitch to students. Three years ago, the split of companies presenting was 75% banks, 25% hedge funds, said Mr. Stefanica.

The survey found female graduates made less than the men, said Mr. Stefanica. Median pay was $190,000 for women and $210,000 for men, he said. Some male graduates surveyed took home more than double the pay than any of the women. For women, pay ranged from $110,000 to $450,000; for men, $110,000 to more than $1 million, he said.

The women graduates surveyed tended to work at banks. More than half of the women -- 64% -- worked in banks whereas 21% worked at hedge funds or in asset management, Mr. Stefanica said.

Across the entire survey, 48% of all respondents worked at banks and 38% worked in asset management or hedge funds. Just under a third of the Baruch survey respondents were women, he said.

Baruch surveyed 50 alumni of the program who have been working for four to six years.

Builders VC Expands Leadership, Support for Portfolio Companies; Venture firm adds in-house mental-health professional and seasoned tech executives to aid founders in early stages of company building

As venture-capital firm Builders VC was preparing to raise its second fund earlier this year, the partners realized they also wanted to secure another type of resource: people.

The San Francisco-based firm, which invests in early-stage companies modernizing industries such as agriculture, construction and health care, has brought on a team of operating partners to provide expertise and leadership to portfolio companies.

Builders, which is investing out of its first $175 million fund and is on track to raise its second fund in 2020, decided to pool money from its partners to build out a team to better support its startups. At a time when capital for startups is plentiful, the move is designed to help differentiate Builders from the slew of emerging early-stage venture funds.

The team, called B2, consists of an in-house network of experts such as a mental-health coach, data and marketing scientists, and public-relations specialists.

B2 also offers a suite of technological resources that most early-stage companies can't afford or can't build in house, such as sophisticated analytics and machine-learning tools.

Operating partners of the B2 team include quantitative marketing expert Isaac Dinner, who currently works as a data scientist at Airbnb Inc.; Praveen Mandal, a data scientist who is currently the chief technology officer at electric-car charging company Volta Charging; and veteran PR specialist Mojgan Khalili, a former Khosla Ventures partner who led communications at Yahoo and Cisco Systems Inc. and now runs Cherry Communications.

Builders General Partner Jim Kim, who founded the firm in 2016, said the goal is to provide the kind of support that founders need but that isn't readily available even in today's capital-flush funding ecosystem.

"The idea is to help entrepreneurs by really addressing the pain points that aren't necessarily solved with more money," said Mr. Kim, a former Khosla Ventures partner who also founded venture firm Formation 8 and remains a general partner there. "There are a lot of fires to put out, and any one of them can be a reason a company fails."

Mr. Kim said the quotidian challenges of running a startup are especially pronounced among Builders VC's portfolio companies, which are working in industries slow to adopt new technology in the first place. The firm has backed startups such as agriculture software provider Performance Livestock Analytics Inc. and long-haul freight technology startup KeepTruckin Inc.

At the same time, he said, this extra set of resources helps to differentiate Builders VC from the hundreds of other early-stage venture firms it competes with.

Mr. Kim referred to B2 as a studio, although it differs from startup studios such as Atomic VC and Science. Those firms are more involved in creating companies and incubating startups in house, while Builders focuses on investing in outside companies.

Other firms, like newly launched Greatscale Ventures, employ a hands-on approach to company-building by taking top executive leadership roles and handling strategic decision-making until the startup is mature enough to do so on its own.

In addition to tactical advice on things like international business development and customer acquisition, founders need empathy about the everyday struggles of running a company, Mr. Kim said.

"These are people who are balancing major life events like having a kid with things like firing a co-founder and recruiting an engineering team," said Mr. Kim. "At the same time, they are hearing that every other startup around them is  killing it.'"

Good day. Gene therapy was once a treatment reserved only for rare diseases. But now, much larger populations that are affected by cancer or neurological diseases could benefit from it. These new approaches from several venture-backed startups could pose a significant challenge to existing large incumbents in the market, experts say.

Meanwhile, sports betting outfit DraftKings plans to go public next year in a reverse merger. The company has gone through many changes over the years, and at one time almost merged with rival FanDuel. Now DraftKings says it will have a market value of $3.3 billion upon closing of the deal.

Note: In observance of the holidays, WSJ Pro Venture Capital will publish its next edition on Monday, Dec. 30. We will still be publishing alerts on significant stories through Dec. 30.

And now on to the news...

Top News

Gene therapy for the masses. After developing the first gene therapies for rare diseases, biotechnology companies are seeking to extend gene treatments to common diseases affecting millions of people, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. Several gene-therapy startups are using new technologies that could enable them to compete with large drugmakers in giant markets such as neurological disease and cancer.

* This could mean a much larger impact than has been seen so far from gene therapy and has the potential to transform how major diseases are treated. It also could mean major wins for venture investors in these startups.

* For decades, scientists struggled to make good on the tremendous promise of gene therapy, which involves using genes to cause cells in the body to make disease-fighting proteins. Recently, those efforts have paid off.

* U.S. regulators approved the first gene therapy, Luxturna, a treatment for a rare, blinding condition, in December 2017, and in May 2019, they gave the green light to Zolgensma, which treats the genetic disorder spinal muscular atrophy.

"If gene therapies end up working in large indications, they will disrupt the large players."

  Gbola Amusa, partner and head of health-care research at investment bank Chardan Capital Markets LLC

Going public. DraftKings reached an agreement that would take the sports-betting company public next year, a deal that comes as states move to legalize that form of gambling, The Wall Street Journal reports. Best known for its fantasy sports games, DraftKings said Monday it will merge with Diamond Eagle Acquisition Corp., a so-called blank-check company that trades on the Nasdaq and is backed by former MGM movie studio Chief Executive Harry Sloan. DraftKings also struck a deal to merge with gambling-technology provider SBTech. Several investors, including funds managed by Capital Research & Management Co., Wellington Management Co. and Franklin Templeton, have agreed to invest $304 million in a class of the combined company's stock. DraftKings expects the combined company to have a market value of $3.3 billion at closing and said it would have more than $500 million in unrestricted cash on hand. DraftKings' past venture investors included Accomplice VC, GGV, Redpoint and Revolution.

Targets. Payments company PayPal will continue to pursue potential takeover targets in 2020 amid robust deal activity in the payments sector. "There's a lot of opportunities to acquire companies inorganically," CFO John Rainey said in an interview.

$40 Billion

Corporations Notched Gains From AI in 2019, Executives Say; Though the impact is hard to quantify, tech leaders say AI efforts add business value

Corrections & Amplifications

Mojgan Lefebvre is chief technology and operations officer of Travelers Cos. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated her title as chief information officer. (Dec. 24, 2019)

Companies ramped up their artificial-intelligence projects in 2019 in an effort to better manage operations and lower risks, and many technology executives said they expect that drive to continue or accelerate in 2020.

Although it can be difficult to measure the impact on the bottom line, the executives said they believe their AI efforts added business value. The insights came from 30 technology leaders who participated in The Wall Street Journal's annual end-of-year questionnaire, which asked them about their technology budgets, among other issues.

Travelers Cos. turned to AI this fall to help speed up the claims process related to California wildfires. The insurer developed an image-recognition system that assesses property damage caused by the blazes, enabling the company to start paying claims before manually reviewing geospatial images or sending human inspectors. The system analyzes thousands of images and identifies with more than 98% accuracy which properties can be considered a total loss.

"Early analysis shows that using this unique solution will enable us to issue advance payments on about 90% of wildfire total loss claims prior to having an in-person inspection," said Travelers Chief Technology and Operations Officer Mojgan Lefebvre.

The average number of active AI projects at companies is expected to grow to 10 next year from four this year, according to a survey by research and advisory firm Gartner Inc. By 2022, the number of AI projects is set to increase to 35, Gartner predicts. The firm surveyed 106 respondents for the 2019 report; half of the participants represented companies with annual revenue of $1 billion to $3 billion.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. said in the WSJ questionnaire that it is using AI to reduce fraud losses. The bank developed a machine-learning system that approves or denies transactions for 40 million credit-card accounts. The bank is also using AI to spot-check fraud by analyzing signatures, payee names and check features in real time.

CIO Lori Beer said the fraud applications are expected to save the bank about $150 million a year.

Other AI systems that technology leaders are using are designed to streamline back-office tasks, such as applications that can predict future demand and inventory needs.

Target Corp. is using a machine-learning system for forecasting and inventory management. The system analyzes sales trends, inventory levels and other factors to determine how much of an item should be in a store's inventory.

The system was built in house by the retailer's data-science team, said CIO Mike McNamara. Although the company didn't provide specific numbers, Mr. McNamara said the system was "expanded vastly in 2019 and is now actively managing a good percentage of our store assortment." The move has helped improve on-shelf availability, he added.

In addition to streamlining operations, some businesses are using AI to better manage their human resources. Schneider Electric SE, a France-based industrial company, this year deployed a platform that uses AI to pair employees with career opportunities, including projects and full-time positions. The system identifies open opportunities within the company for employees based on their skills, experience and ambitions.

"While AI value has been limited so far, we are optimistic about future benefits," said Schneider CIO Elizabeth Hackenson.

SEC Investigates Listings of Slack, Others; Small Biotech M&As May Precede Big Buyouts; TikTok's HQ Hunt

Good day. The direct listings of Slack and Spotify were supposed to portend a new way for venture-backed companies to go public. Some venture capitalists such as Benchmark's Bill Gurley have argued that the direct-listing process is much better than traditional IPOs.

But now the SEC is investigating the direct listings of Slack and other companies, as well as other IPOs, The Wall Street Journal reports. While the investigation is in its early stages, it could pump the brakes on the potential direct listings of other companies that had been expected in 2020.

Meanwhile, biotech acquisitions have been relatively paltry in 2019, due to the strength of the IPO market and the consolidation of large acquirers. But some investors remain optimistic for 2020, citing the patent expirations of drug manufacturers and other factors that could spark deal-making in the new year.

And now on to the news...

Top News

Biotech M&A. Biotechnology venture capitalists are hoping a recent flurry of acquisitions of small drugmakers portends a larger slate of buyouts coming up in 2020, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports.

* Biotech startup acquisitions sputtered through the first three quarters of this year, with only 20 venture-backed companies purchased, the fewest since the same number were acquired over the same period in 2012, according to VentureSource.

* When the final 2019 tally of drug-startup acquisitions comes in, it will likely be well below the 42 in 2017 and last year's 37. But a run of buyouts of privately held and smaller publicly traded biotechs of late is an encouraging sign.

* Despite the consolidation of large potential pharmaceutical company acquirers and a strong IPO market that could limit acquisition activity, a new class of buyers and creative strategies such as options deals could help fuel more and larger exits in 2020, investors say.

* Many drug manufacturers need new products because their portfolios are maturing and patents for their top medications are nearing expiration, challenges that mergers and acquisitions can address, said Brian Abrahams, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets.

Direct-listing drama. The Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the listings of Slack and other major companies on the NYSE, in a probe looking at how trading was handled on the first day, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the situation. SEC enforcement staff have recently sent letters including one seeking information from electronic-trading firm Citadel Securities LLC related to how it opened Slack's stock for trading on June 20 in the workplace-messaging app's so-called direct listing, the people said. It also seeks information on other IPOs.

HQ hunt. Bytedance Inc. is considering setting up a global headquarters for its hit video-sharing app TikTok outside of China, part of continuing efforts to shake off its Chinese image, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the company. Singapore is one city being considered, the people said. Other possible locations include London and Dublin, with no American cities on the shortlist, one person said.

"The direct listing of Slack was a tremendous success for the company, its shareholders and our nation's capital markets. From our vantage point, we stand firmly behind the integrity and transparency of the listing and pricing process on this important transaction."

 Machine learning : the big risks and how to manage them

There is no precedent for how this type of trading, which adapts based on experience, might play out

Algorithmic trading has been prevalent in equities trading for more than two decades. It is also now well entrenched in fixed income, too.

It has created new opportunities by speeding up execution of orders, cutting costs and increasing volumes. But it has also introduced new hazards for market participants and created the occasional  flash crash . We have also seen trading algorithms being programmed to manipulate markets.

Now we face an even bigger challenge   machine learning. This technology, centred on computer models that can learn from experience, poses serious challenges and requires a global response.

The Bank of England and the UK Financial Regulation Authority recently published a survey of banks and capital markets firms which found that about half of respondents use machine learning in a modest way today. Most expect to make much greater use of it over the next few years.

Today, machine learning is deployed mainly in back-office functions such as anti-money laundering, fraud detection and credit risk management. It is not currently used much in front-line trading functions, but we expect material change in this area over the next few years.We therefore have the responsibility to consider potential risks and to mitigate them, as far as possible.

Unlike traditional rules-based algorithms, machine-learning algorithms are not static engines, programmed to run only along the paths created by their human programmers.

Instead, they use massive data sets and enormous computational power to enable them to recognise patterns, train themselves, and to make decisions about when and how to trade without human intervention.

This is a transformative moment for those trading in financial markets. It will bring great opportunities, but it will also create new hazards that we simply have not had to think about before. Here are four to consider.

First, what we call  model drift . Machine-learning trading engines learn for themselves how to create prices by repeated and constantly evolving experimentation. In this optimisation process it becomes hard, or even impossible, to trace how decisions are made. It is therefore very difficult to prevent undesirable outcomes in advance, or to correct them afterwards.

These concerns over transparency explain the present regulatory focus on model risk management and software validation, as well as questions about how company boards can satisfy themselves that they have an appropriate level of understanding about what is going on inside the  black box .

Second, bias. Machine learning creates the potential for unexpected or unfair changes in pricing or liquidity for certain types of market users, or even for individual customers   as a result of factors that are impossible to uncover because they lie, effectively undiscoverable, in the heart of the optimisation engine. Unless the machine chooses to tell you its secrets, you will never know why it did something.

More worrying, perhaps, is that a machine optimising on its own will probably find that unethical, manipulative trading practices are more profitable. How do we ensure that the machine understands not just the law and regulatory rules, but also concepts of right and wrong?

Third, market concentration. The way in which machine learning models improve by accessing increasing quantities of data is likely to create network effects, where a small number of data providers effectively control access. That may, in turn, throw up high barriers to entry.

Such barriers could entrench the power of today s large banks and financial services firms or, alternatively, allow technology-based competitors to create new oligopolies at the expense of today s financial sector.

But the consequences of concentrated market structures need careful thought. Participants in the market could be disadvantaged, through unfair rationing of liquidity and skewed pricing.

Fourth, the skills gap. There is a massive shortfall of expert programmers, data scientists and risk managers needed to safely develop, test and implement machine learning in financial markets.

This is just as much the case in the private sector as it is among central banks and market regulators. It creates a significant knowledge gap in the boardrooms of financial services firms and within policymaking institutions about the challenges and hazards posed by machine learning.

Given the international nature of financial markets, these are all challenges that need to be properly considered and addressed at a global level.

The complexity of the issues raised also makes collaboration between public authorities and the private sector essential. A fragmented approach could lead to a trading environment where no one truly knows what the black box is going to do. That is a risk for everyone, not just wholesale markets in one location or another.

Artificial intelligence, fifth-generation wireless networks and blockchain were overhyped in 2019, while cloud and serverless computing deserved more attention than they got, some information-technology executives said.

Investments in AI, 5G and blockchain will need to undergo extra levels of scrutiny as a result of the hype, said Manjit Singh, group vice president and chief information officer of Toyota Motor Corp.'s North American unit. "These technologies will mature significantly over the next few years, but will have less impact as people tire of unrealistic expectations that have already been set," he said.

Mr. Singh was one of 30 IT executives who responded via email to CIO Journal's annual end-of-year questionnaire about their thoughts on emerging technologies and other issues.

Going serverless

One important technology that is adding business value but hasn't generated much buzz is serverless computing, said Nigel Faulkner, head of technology at financial-services company T. Rowe Price Group Inc.

In this emerging method of software development, physical and virtual servers traditionally used to run certain applications "https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2016/12/15/serverless-computing-heats-up-as-pivotal-software-takes-on-cloud-giants/" because the servers are owned and managed by a cloud provider. This frees developers from having to manage servers and enables them to focus on writing code.

Serverless computing can modernize applications while reducing the costs necessary to run and support them, Mr. Faulkner said.

Dick Daniels, chief information officer at hospital and health-insurance company Kaiser Permanente, said cloud computing overall deserves more attention. "Cloud will be a key enabler for Kaiser Permanente to provide new capabilities faster, with greater mobility and flexibility and potentially at a lower cost," he said.

Nothing artificial about AI hype

Contributing to the hype surrounding AI is so-called AI washing, which refers to companies that say they are using AI when they are not.

More End-of-Year Coverage

* "https://www.wsj.com/articles/businesses-keep-a-lid-on-number-of-cybersecurity-vendors-11577097002"

Technologies including AI should be used only to serve a specific purpose for the business, said Bob Worrall, senior vice president and CIO at networking and cybersecurity firm Juniper Networks Inc. "Any new technology is just a means to an end, so without first identifying what that end looks like, the rest of the discussion is moot," he said.

The term "artificial intelligence" will soon become meaningless, in part because it's already embedded across many areas, said Colleen Berube, CIO of software company Zendesk Inc.

Welcome back, blockchain

Blockchain was significantly overhyped in 2019 "https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2018/12/28/expect-more-of-the-same-for-blockchain-in-2019-say-cios/", 2017, etc. many IT leaders said. The technology has the potential to secure transactions, to increase transparency and efficiency of data-sharing and to establish provenance, yet some IT leaders said they are unconvinced.

"While the proposition of an immutable distributed ledger seems obvious, I am not aware of a widely successful production deployment," said Ashim Gupta, interim chief information officer at automation company UiPath Inc.

Blockchain has failed to have the level of impact in the financial-services industry that many predicted, said Mr. Faulkner of T. Rowe Price.

Robot takeover

Several executives said robotic process automation, in which software "robots" automate mundane and low-level tasks, got more attention than it deserved this year. "RPA does not solve every problem, yet it's constantly being posed as the solution," said Vipul Nagrath, CIO at Automatic Data Processing Inc. Software robots are "simply today's latest version of automation, which has existed for decades," he said.

Hopes for 5G

Some IT leaders said 5G got too much attention last year and didn't result in many tangible business benefits, but at least one CIO is bullish on its potential. "I'm personally very excited about the innovation that 5G will bring and believe it will be one of the biggest game-changers we've seen in the history of health care," said Mark Boxer, CIO of health insurer Cigna Corp.

A quantum of hype

Some executives said quantum computing was overhyped this year, mostly because it will still be several years before the next-generation technology can generate useful business applications.

Early-stage quantum computers are being built and tested by technology giants including Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.'s Amazon Web Services.

"I was in fourth grade when I heard about nuclear fusion and that was 10-20 years away. It's been 35 years and we're nowhere close that's how I see quantum computing," said Vijay Sankaran, CIO at TD Ameritrade Holding Corp.

TGIF! Before the U.S. goes into national holiday hibernation mode next week, many firms are closing out unfinished business. So we have news today from Laura Kreutzer about Harvest Partners wrapping up more than $4 billion for its latest and largest flagship fund. There's also news from Aisha Al-Muslim that the private-equity arm of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will see its investment in Arsenal Energy Holdings wiped out by a restructuring.

Meanwhile from The Wall Street Journal, Paul Davies says global regulators have highlighted the problematic rise of leveraged financing, and Paul Kiernan has details on an SEC proposal that would pry open private markets by broadening slightly the class of acceptable investors.

All that and much more awaits, so please tear into it...

Today's Top Stories

Largest Harvest Fund: Harvest Partners has gathered at least $4 billion for its eighth midmarket fund, making the vehicle the largest the firm has raised to date. The New York-based midmarket firm has collected $4.03 billion for Harvest Partners VIII LP and parallel funds, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The amount raised so far exceeds a $3.25 billion target set for the fund in a SEC filing a year ago.

Goldman Sachs Wipeout: Natural gas producer Arsenal Energy Holdings LLC, whose backers include Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s private-equity arm, won bankruptcy court approval for its second prepackaged restructuring this year, cutting roughly $400 million in debt and turning creditors into shareholders. The deal received the court's blessing Thursday, WSJ Pro Bankruptcy's Aisha Al-Muslim reports. The restructuring will wipe out the equity stakes of the Goldman Sachs unit, First Reserve Management LP and Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Co.

Leveraged Financing Caution Flag: The booming market for leveraged loans, a favorite source of buyout financing, has created vulnerabilities in the global financial system, according to a report from international regulators. The Financial Stability Board said a limited number of big banks are most exposed to these markets because they arrange the loans as well as underwrite the creation of structured investment funds known as collateralized loan obligations, The Wall Street Journal's Paul J. Davies reports.

Prying Open Private Markets: More Americans would be able to reap the rewards of investing early in the next Uber Technologies Inc. or Facebook Inc. under a proposal advanced Wednesday by the Securities and Exchange Commission. They could also get more chances to lose their shirts, The Wall Street Journal's Paul Kiernan reports. The proposal would expand the number of people allowed to invest in private-equity funds by allowing investors with certain qualifications, such as an entry-level stockbroker's license, to sidestep current income and wealth thresholds.

Big Number

$100 Billion

The amount Brookfield Asset Management Inc. expects to collect starting as early as 2021 in its next round of fundraising for its flagship funds.

Deals

Pacific Equity Partners is moving to take private Australian movie theater and theme-park operator Village Roadshow Corp. at an indicated price of 3.90 Australian dollars a share, valuing the company at A$761.2 million ($516.55 million), Reuters reported.

Lime Rock New Energy has led a $75 million growth-equity investment in Smart Wires Inc., a Union City, Calif.-based provider of power flow control systems to utilities and electric grid operators. The deal marks Lime Rock's debut investment in emerging energy industry opportunities.

BC Partners has taken technology company Presidio Inc. private in a $16-a-share deal that values the enterprise at $2.2 billion, including debt. Apollo Global Management Inc. owned a 42% stake in New York-based Presidio and backed the deal, which was announced in August at $2.1 billion.

German growth investor Mutares SE has agreed to acquire Tekfor SpA, the Italian business of Tekfor Group, an auto parts maker. The deal includes the unit's two powertrain manufacturing plants in the Turin area, Mutares said in a news release. The operation had fiscal 2018 sales of about  ¬120 million and employs around 670 people. Mutares also closed its acquisition of Q Logistics GmbH from OBB on Wednesday. The Austrian logistics unit had revenue of about  ¬250 million last year.

Bain & Co. has acquired Pyxis, a provider of consumer behavior analysis, as a way to enhance its valuation and strategic services to clients, including buyout firms. Pyxis analytics can depict consumer shopping choices based on why purchases are made, as well as where and how transactions take place, the size of purchases and payment methods.

SFW Capital Partners has recapitalized Micromeritics Instrument Corp. alongside management of the company. SFW Capital focuses on providers of analytical instrumentation, software, and related products and services.

Bain Capital Credit has entered a partnership with Corestate Capital Holding SA, a European real-estate investment manager, to invest in properties in Poland and convert them into student housing. Corestate has already acquired some properties and is examining further acquisitions.

Webster Equity Partners has backed Santa Monica Fertility Center, a provider of vertically integrated reproductive services offering egg donation, surrogacy and in-vitro fertilization.

Carlyle Group LP-backed Atotech Group, a German specialty-chemicals company, is planning a U.S. initial public offering under indirect parent Atotech Ltd., according to a news release.

3i Group PLC's infrastructure team has agreed to sell its 93% stake in U.K.-based Wireless Infrastructure Group to Brookfield Infrastructure. The sale values the stake at about 387 million ($503.5 million) and will result in a 27% gross internal rate of return for 3i, which paid 75 million for a minority stake in 2016 and another 187 million to increase its stake to 93% in 2018. WIG builds and operates communications towers in rural and suburban areas.

Highlander Partners has agreed to sell the jellybean and related candy brands of its portfolio company Gimbal Brothers LLC to the family-owned Jelly Belly Candy Co. Highlander, based in Dallas, acquired the maker of gummy vitamins and chewy candies in the first half of 2017, adding it to its newly formed Bettera Brands holding company.

Great Point Partners has exited clinical research data provider Corrona LLC through a recapitalization made by Audax Private Equity. Great Point initially invested in the Waltham, Mass.-based company in 2014.

The firm has already invested in German wind-power company PNE AG and the network operator Fiber of Portugal.

Industry News

French banking group Crdit Mutuel Alliance Fdrale in Paris has combined its growth investment and venture fund groups to form Crdit Mutuel Equity, which has about  ¬3.0 billion ($3.34 billion) in investments, the bank said Thursday. The new firm's predecessor operations were CIC Capital Canada and CIC Capital Ventures. Crdit Mutuel Equity's growth investments and buyout checks range from  ¬5 million to  ¬150 million, while its venture deals start at  ¬1 million and go as high as  ¬20 million.

Kainos Capital, a midmarket firm focused on food and consumer products, has promoted Jeff Moredock to principal and Julie Sanders to director. Mr. Moredock will lead the execution and management of investments and help direct oversight of portfolio companies. Ms. Sanders will lead the Dallas-based firm's investor relations activities and continue to be involved in marketing, business development and deal sourcing efforts. She also leads the firm's environmental, social and governance initiatives and is involved in recruiting.

Volition Grabs $600 Million for Growth Equity; Benchmark Backs Payments Startup; Epirium Bio Grabs $85 Million

Good day. Startups Gitlab, Snowflake, Credit Karma, Unity and Procore are the five venture-backed companies most likely to go public next year, according to a CB Insights report on the outlook for 2020 IPOs.

The number of large venture rounds of $100 million or more significantly outpaced the number of tech IPOs, suggesting investors are finding little liquidity despite their rapid pace of investment, the report shows.

Plus, Volition Capital has raised $600 million to continue its growth-equity investing strategy a sector that has been on the rise.

And Benchmark has backed payments management software startup Modern Treasury.

Note: We have made a slight change to the formatting of the newsletter to make it more easily readable. You'll still find the same information included each day.

And now on to the news...

Growth-equity growth. The latest firm to jump on the growth-equity trend is Volition Capital, which raised $600 million for a pair of such funds, continuing an investment strategy that has attracted greater interest from venture and buyout firms, WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova reports.

* The Boston firm raised $400 million for its main fund, Volition Capital Fund IV LP, more than the $250 million it raised for its previous fund in 2016.

* It also collected $200 million for its first-time "select" fund, Volition Capital Select Fund I LP, which will make follow-on investments in existing portfolio companies at later stages.

* Volition seeks to invest in high-growth companies providing e-commerce, consumer products, internet-enabled services and cloud software that are generating annual revenue of between $5 million and $50 million, and that have had no institutional funding to date.

Investing in growth-stage companies is a lower-risk strategy than traditional venture capital and has been generating significant returns. Growth-equity firms generally outperformed both buyout and venture-capital funds over three-year, five-year and 10-year periods, according to Cambridge Associates, which analyzed data through June 30, 2018.

Analysis by Yuliya Chernova

Payments deal. Payments-management software maker Modern Treasury Corp. said it has brought on a new investor in its latest round of funding, which comes on the heels of business-payments company Bill.com going public last week, WSJ Pro's Katie Roof reports exclusively. Modern Treasury raised $10 million in a Series A round led by Benchmark, which made early bets on Uber Technologies Inc. and Snap Inc. Modern Treasury's software helps identify and label each financial transaction so a company's accounting team can keep tabs on the full cycle of each payment, from approvals to reconciliation.

Muscular funding. Biotechnology startup Epirium Bio has raised $85 million to develop a new treatment for a type of muscular dystrophy amid rising venture investment in therapies for rare muscular diseases, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. San Diego-based Epirium says its scientists have discovered a hormonal pathway that mimics the benefits of exercise and that could be harnessed to preserve and generate new mitochondria, the powerhouses that provide energy to cells.

Opening startup investments. More Americans would be able to invest early in the next Uber or Facebook under a proposal approved Wednesday by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Journal's Paul Kiernan reports. The proposal would expand the number of people allowed to invest in private securities offerings, hedge funds and private-equity funds. Investing in those vehicles is limited to what are called accredited investors because such investments are generally more opaque and riskier than securities traded on closely regulated public exchanges.

Newly launched Acrew Capital closed its first fund at $250 million, well above its original $175 million to $200 million target. Prominent venture capitalist and Aspect Ventures founder Theresia Gouw is among Acrew's founding partners. The firm has offices in San Francisco and Palo Alto, Calif.

Singapore steps up investment in medtech, energy and AI start-ups

Financials. Strategic focus

City-state is in position as the value-added heart and brain of the region while HK flounders

Akshay Garg raised $90m for his Indonesian fintech start-up FinAccel earlier this month, from investors including the Korean group Mirae.

FinAccel has a million customers using its Kredivo service, which extends credit to shoppers. Mr Garg credits Singapore, where its holding group is, for making it easy for him to access capital.

"The entire south-east Asia [tech] ecosystem would not exist without Singapore," he said. "Singapore Inc is critical. We are only here because of Singapore. Without the connection to Singapore, we couldn't have gotten money from South Korea."

Several other Indonesian start-ups and their investors have benefited from relationships with the Singaporean government, either receiving grants or investment from its financial arms or from state-linked groups, or getting advice and connections from a network of south-east Asian tech start-ups.

Singapore is using its financial clout and $275bn in foreign reserves not including the sums managed by wealth fund GIC and investment group Temasek or funds that can be deployed by state-linked groups such as Singtel, an investor in FinAccel to upgrade its economy strategically.

A generation ago, it focused on highvalue industries such as pharma. Today it is investing in medtech, energy and artificial intelligence start-ups in the hope of reducing reliance on trade and boosting the skills of its labour force.

It is positioning itself as the valueadded heart and brain of the region, investing alongside strategic participants such as Google or venture capital firm Sequoia.

Singapore's activist approach contrasts with that of Hong Kong. "Singapore uses its money as the catalyst for change," said Shaun Lim, a Singaporean based in Hong Kong.

Mr Lim manages a joint venture tech fund between Beijing-based Hopu Investment Management and SoftBankcontrolled UK semiconductor firm Arm Holdings.

Pavilion, a unit of Temasek, is an investor in the fund and in some of its portfolio groups such as Appier, a Taipei-based AI marketing start-up.

His boss, Beijing dealmaker Fang Feng Lei, regularly meets Ho Ching, boss of Temasek.

"The Singaporeans think strategically. Their allocation is far more passive. They have less of a sense of urgency," Mr Lim said.

Hong Kong is less transparent about recipients of its money, which include most of the big US buyout groups such as Blackstone, and the fees it pays them.

Anyone logging on to the website of the Singapore Economic Development Board's investment arm, EDB-I, can find a list of the companies in which it has invested or from which it has already exited.

"We help Singapore and Singapore companies generate growth by nurturing new businesses," said Paul Ng, a senior vice-president at EDB-I. "We want to make all SMEs AI-enabled. We want to improve the environment and develop talent."

For many tech start-ups in the region, the EDB and EDB-I are the first stop.

"The EDB built Singapore," said Willson Cuaca, whose East Ventures invests in the earliest rounds of mostly Indonesian companies, including Tokopedia and Traveloka.

Singapore has invested in East Ventures, but only in its fifth fund, after it had established a record.

"They take risk, but they have also positioned themselves as a haven," he said.

Credo Biomedical, which has pioneered a cheap, speedy test for influenza, for example, is working with both EDB and Enterprise Singapore. The firm was founded by Wilson Wang, who is of the third generation of the family that founded Formosa Plastics in Taiwan. He holds Singaporean citizenship.

"On the financial front, the healthcare and biomedical team of Enterprise Singapore looked at our case and guided us patiently on the various financial grants we can apply," said Tan Tai Lim of Credo.

The group applied for a grant which will reimburse Credo for up to 70 per cent of eligible costs to take part in a medical convention in Dubai.

The EDB's investment arm has invested in start-ups outside the region to bring in knowledge on diseases from diabetes to eye maladies.

While outsiders sometimes wonder how to differentiate between the many arms of Singapore, especially as they evolve, to insiders it is a club in which everyone supports a national mandate.

Many in Singapore liken the country to Israel. "They believe they have no fallback," said one observer.

Sapphire Ventures Bulks Up Late-Stage Investing War Chest; SAP spinout raised roughly $1.4 billion in capital to target mature startups

Sapphire Ventures has raised roughly $1.4 billion it intends to invest in late-stage startups, adding to a growing pool of capital that tech startups are drawing upon to stay private longer.

Sapphire will use the infusion to double down on investing in enterprise software, with a special focus on startups that incorporate artificial intelligence, said Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director Nino Marakovic.

The bulk of the capital will go toward a new growth-stage fund and a new opportunity fund, Mr. Marakovic said.

The growth stage fund has roughly $1 billion and the opportunity fund has $150 million, according to regulatory filings. The balance of the $1.4 billion will top off existing funds.

Sapphire has also pursued late-stage investments with "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sap-spinoff-sapphire-ventures-raises-1-billion-1473879930" in 2016 after the firm was spun out of SAP SE in 2011. The German business software maker is Sapphire's largest limited partner.

The $1.4 billion brings Palo Alto, Calif.-based Sapphire's total assets under management to roughly $4 billion and adds to the growing availability of growth-stage financing, or investments for mature startups, in recent years.

Through the third quarter of this year, venture firms raised roughly $9.7 billion of late-stage capital, down from $10.8 billion through the same period last year but up from $5.9 billion for all of 2017, according to VentureSource, a data provider owned by WSJ Pro Venture Capital publisher Dow Jones & Co.

Startup investors are "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-shareholders-criticize-company-after-wework-wipeout-11574764205" for large late-stage financing deals--particularly those that "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-money-men-who-enabled-adam-neumann-and-the-wework-debacle-11576299616"We Co.'s WeWork derailed initial public offering and several large valuation "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-books-loss-of-4-7-billion-on-wework-investment-11573024776" of startups backed by outsized rounds from SoftBank Group Corp.

With the new capital, Sapphire will invest up to $100 million per company, Mr. Marakovic said. The firm's two new funds will target startups in the U.S., Europe and Israel and will allow Sapphire to invest in startups in Series B to pre-IPO stages.

"We're bulking up to be able to lead growth rounds. But we believe too large isn't good either," Mr. Marakovic said, adding that there is a difference between helping companies prepare for exits and showering startups with capital.

Sapphire's new funds come less than a year "https://www.wsj.com/articles/manchester-city-footballs-parent-heads-investor-list-backing-new-sapphire-sports-tech-fund-11548676801"Sapphire Sport Parallel Fund LP, a $115 million fund that targets early-stage technology companies in the sports, media and entertainment industries with investments of up to $4 million.

Sapphire also invests in early-stage venture funds, though the two new funds won't be used for that, said Scott Brown, the firm's vice president of marketing.

Good day. Hims & Hers was once known for its provocative and racy ads, but now the startup is making an effort to join the formal health-care system with a new partnership with a large health organization and a new funding round that may top $200 million.

Plus, Sapphire Ventures is the latest venture firm to raise a growth fund. "Raise money when you can" is a startup mantra, and it seems to apply to venture firms as well.

Speaking of cash, Bright Health is pouring fuel on the fire, with $635 million in funding led by New Enterprise Associates.

And venture investors are eagerly investing in startups that offer an Airbnb-type experience for travelers but one that is professionally managed.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Beyond racy ads. Telemedicine startup Hims & Hers, known for its suggestive ads for erectile-dysfunction treatment, has always wanted to be part of the formal health-care system. Now it wants to put that plan into action, WSJ Pro's Heather Mack reports exclusively.

* Unlike most digital health startups, which typically partner with established health organizations from the outset, San Francisco-based Hims & Hers went direct to consumers in 2017 when it began offering virtual doctor visits and prescription drug services for embarrassing conditions such as ED and hair loss.

* Two years on, in an effort to be seen less like a consumer brand and more like a legitimate part of the traditional health-care system, the company is offering treatment for more conditions, and has formed its first partnership with a large health organization.

* It remains to be seen whether Hims & Hers can achieve that goal while holding on to its reputation as a way of bypassing the traditional health-care system to get treatment.

Apartment hotels. Venture capitalists still see prospects in real estate, but are shifting their focus to property-rental startups that build on the Airbnb Inc. model, WSJ Pro's Katie Roof reports. Consumers flock to Airbnb for apartment listings, but they are increasingly interested in professionally managed properties, with fresh towels and stylish furniture, investors say. The latest such startup to reveal it has raised funding is Domio Inc., which provides apartment hotel-style accommodations in several cities nationwide. It raised $50 million in an August investment led by GGV Capital.

New funds. Venture firm Sapphire Ventures has raised roughly $1.4 billion it intends to invest in late-stage startups, adding to a growing pool of capital that tech startups are drawing upon to stay private longer, WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian reports. Sapphire will use the infusion to double down on investing in enterprise software, with a focus on startups that incorporate artificial intelligence. The bulk of the capital will go to a new growth-stage fund, and a new opportunity fund.

Growth deal. Health-insurance startup Bright Health Inc. said it has raised $635 million in a venture financing led by New Enterprise Associates that pushes its total equity funding to more than $1 billion, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. Formed in late 2015, Bright Health is an insurance provider and health plan operator led by Chief Executive Bob Sheehy, the former chief executive of health insurer UnitedHealthcare Group.

Unicorns a little less magical. Thirteen U.S. "unicorns," or startups valued at $1 billion or more, made their public debuts in 2019 far more than in any prior year. Despite their growing numbers and valuations, the post-IPO performance of unicorns has been a mixed bag. On the whole, an investor in the second half of the decade was likelier to have put money into a unicorn that was unprofitable and whose value has dropped as a public company than an investor in the decade's first half, The Wall Street Journal found.

Private equity for adtech. Private-equity firm Providence Equity Partners LLC is taking a majority stake in venture-backed social video advertising technology provider Smartly.io Solutions Oy as the firm bets that brands will spend more marketing dollars on Facebook and other social platforms, the Journal's Sahil Patel reports for CMO Today.

Fresh Credit Suisse Spying Report Puts Surveillance Tactics in Focus; Swiss bank probes new revelation of alleged spying on a top executive

Credit Suisse Group AG is probing a third episode of alleged spying on a top executive, highlighting the ethical and reputational pitfalls companies encounter when they physically monitor employees.

The Swiss bank said it is conducting a review after a Swiss newspaper published a photo allegedly showing a top bank executive under surveillance earlier this year, a spokesman said.

The latest revelation follows a September clash on the streets of Zurich between another top Credit Suisse executive and a detective the bank hired to tail him. Separately, The Wall Street Journal reported this month that Colleen Graham, a former Credit Suisse executive who headed a joint venture for the bank, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-executive-at-credit-suisse-joint-venture-alleges-bank-spied-on-her-11576094110" by an investigator during an alleged three-day surveillance in July 2017. Credit Suisse said Ms. Graham's claim was baseless.

The Swiss media report, in the Neue Zrcher Zeitung newspaper this week, said Peter Goerke, a longtime lieutenant of Chief Executive Tidjane Thiam, was followed for three days in February, citing documents and photos. Shortly after the alleged spying, Credit Suisse removed Mr. Goerke from the bank's executive board. He gave up his job as head of human resources and became a senior adviser on bank projects. Mr. Goerke couldn't be reached for comment.

The alleged incidents involving Credit Suisse cast another shadow over Switzerland's second-largest lender by assets. Revenue at its investment bank plunged this year as corporate deals failed to materialize, forcing the bank to cut its financial targets last week. Credit Suisse's share price is down by more than half since Mr. Thiam started as CEO in July 2015.

In September, former wealth management head Iqbal Khan's confrontation with a bank-hired detective sparked weeks of Swiss tabloid headlines and global news reports.

The bank hired a law firm, Homburger AG, to conduct a review into Mr. Khan's surveillance. The law firm found it was ordered by Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Olivier Boue, another close lieutenant of Mr. Thiam. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/credit-suisse-coo-resigns-over-surveillance-scandal-11569908569" and hasn't commented on the law firm's findings. The Homburger partner who conducted the review referred a Wednesday request for comment to Credit Suisse.

In a memo to staff after the incident involving Mr. Khan, Mr. Thiam said the surveillance was "strictly an isolated incident."

Credit Suisse said that a previous review of surveillance on another executive hadn't identified evidence of Mr. Goerke being shadowed.

The line between company security and employee privacy is often blurry. Physical surveillance is typically a last resort for companies including banks, even when they suspect employees of serious ethical or legal breaches such as fraud, bribery or other behavior that violates company rules, experts say.

One reason: Covert surveillance can backfire if it fails to gather the desired evidence and is discovered by the target and the public, as has happened at Credit Suisse.

"Surveillance might just produce circumstantial evidence," said Andrew Watson, a London employment lawyer who represents both companies and employees and spoke about general practices, not Credit Suisse specifically.

If spying is bungled, Mr. Watson said, "You look like you're suspicious of your employees. That has repercussions, in ways that are really hard to quantify, about how people feel about going to work."

Steps taken to spy on employees should be "justified and proportionate" to any suspected wrongdoing, said Tristan Prince of NetWatch Global Ltd., a U.K. corporate-intelligence firm that does online investigations and digital surveillance for corporate clients.

"You usually wouldn't start by putting [physical] surveillance on employees right away," Mr. Prince said. Usually, "you have to have some kind of indication there's fraud, collusion, money laundering" or a similar violation.

Ultimately, experts said, so much information is online and available to banks including about employees that technology provides easier, lower-risk investigative tools. More broadly, banks are already heavily security-focused and more sophisticated than ever about how they gather data on customers, competitors and their own employees, experts say.

"Every company is monitoring employees in some fashion. It would be naive to think otherwise," said Brian Vecci of software and analytics company Varonis Systems Inc., which helps banks and other companies protect data. "The question is to what extent, and what's appropriate."

"I use my company phone for work, but my company doesn't have access to my personal email and texting, Mr. Vecci said. "I would probably have a problem with that."

Still, several people who have seen bank employee surveillance in action said a lot of people would be surprised how much of their behavior can be monitored. Banks have access to executives' personal financial accounts if they're held at their employer, for example. One of the people said they have seen a bank look into employees' personal accounts to investigate suspicions of wrongdoing such as bribery or an inappropriate relationship.

VC Daily: Intel Buys Habana Labs for $2 Billion; Sequoia-Backed Space Startup Files for Chapter 11; Flagship Pioneering Hires Former Bristol-Myers Squibb Executive

Good day. Intel has acquired Habana Labs, an Israel-based startup, for approximately $2 billion. The company had raised $120 million from investors, according to PitchBook Data.

Plus, space startup Vector Launch filed for bankruptcy, blaming investor Sequoia Capital for not putting up more cash.

Meanwhile, Flagship Pioneering has hired a former Bristol-Myers Squibb executive to work with its startups to develop new drugs.

And Andreessen Horowitz has hired Kristina Shen, previously of Bessemer Venture Partners, as its newest general partner.

And now on to the news...

In the News

AI exit. Chip-making giant Intel is expanding its push into the artificial-intelligence market with an approximately $2 billion deal for Habana Labs, an Israel-based AI chip startup, the Journal's Asa Fitch and Michael Dabaie report.

* Habana had raised $120 million from investors including Intel Capital, Battery Ventures, Samsung Catalyst, Bessemer Venture Partners and Walden Venture Capital, according to PitchBook Data.

* Intel said the deal strengthens its lineup of artificial-intelligence chips for use in data centers, the large facilities where companies are running AI algorithms to analyze data to, for instance, identify customer trends that otherwise might be too hard to spot.

* Even before announcing the Habana purchase, Intel said it expected to generate more than $3.5 billion in AI-related sales this year, up around 20% from last year.

* The Habana deal isn't Intel's first acquisition to bolster its lineup of AI products. Intel bought startup Nervana Systems in 2016 for around $400 million and followed that by purchasing Irish startup Movidius.

Space crash. Space-technology company Vector Launch Inc. has filed for bankruptcy, blaming its demise on venture-capital backer Sequoia Capital's decision not to provide additional funding for its development efforts, WSJ Pro's Alexander Gladstone reports. Vector, along with its subsidiary Garvey Spacecraft Corp., filed for chapter 11 protection in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., with a deal to sell its GalacticSky satellite software business to Lockheed Martin for $4.25 million. Vector had raised about $100 million in venture capital, with its Series A funding round led by Sequoia.

Drug development. Flagship Pioneering has hired the former business-development chief of pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. to lead an effort to help its biotechnology portfolio companies expand into working on new drugs they weren't planning to develop on their own, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. Flagship launches health-care and sustainability companies and has been looking to capture more value from its companies as they mature.

Imitating Amazon. The dominance by Amazon over digital retail sales has spawned a fast-growing ecosystem of startups and services aimed at matching different parts of Amazon's sprawling network and at helping retailers and brands of all sizes meet consumer expectations set by the e-commerce heavyweight, Jennifer Smith writes for the WSJ's Logistics Report. Taken together, the businesses are creating what amounts to a virtual logistics system in Amazon's shadow.

Gormley's Take: Drug Manufacturers Snap Up Gene-Therapy Companies

By Brian Gormley

Drug manufacturers are in the market for gene-therapy companies, propelled by concerns about competition for their products and looking to acquire novel medicines that could treat or cure diseases by compensating for faulty genes that cause illnesses.

Earlier this month, Japanese pharmaceutical company Astellas Pharma agreed to buy Audentes Therapeutics for $3 billion to gain a toehold in gene therapy and get the San Francisco-based company's manufacturing capabilities.

Audentes, a venture-backed company that went public in 2016, is developing a potential treatment for the rare neuromuscular disease x-linked myotubular myopathy.

The deal followed an agreement in February by Philadelphia-based Spark Therapeutics, which went public in 2015, to be acquired by Roche Holding. That same month, Sarepta Therapeutics exercised an option to acquire privately held, venture-backed Myonexus Therapeutics of New Albany, Ohio.

Wealth-management platform YieldStreet acquired retirement account services provider WealthFlex for an undisclosed amount. New York-based YieldStreet has raised $178 million in equity and debt from investors including Edison Partners, Greycroft Partners and Raine Ventures.

Publicly traded Organovo Holdings and Tarveda Therapeutics Inc., a developer of precision oncology medicines, agreed to merge. Watertown, Mass.-based Tarveda is backed by investors including Versant Ventures, New Enterprise Associates and Novo A/S.

Cyber Daily: PNC and Venmo at Odds Over Security Protocols; Questions Arise on Foreign Parts in Voting Machines

Good day. A skirmish between Venmo and PNC bank over security protocols means that some joint customers can't connect their accounts. Frustrated consumers have taken to Twitter, and each company blames the other.

Also today: New questions about foreign parts in U.S. voting machines; Iran says it knocked down two cyberattacks; and Navy warned about Chinese drones.

Supply-Chain Security

Venmo glitch opens window on war between banks, fintech firms. Many PNC bank clients are having trouble connecting their bank accounts to their Venmo apps, cutting off their access to the popular mobile-payment system, owned by PayPal Holdings Inc. When they have sought help, they have found the two companies blaming each other for the disruption and citing data security concerns, The Wall Street Journal reports.

Fintech companies say they need access to the customer-account information held by banks and other traditional financial companies. Banks and brokerage firms, protecting their own turf, have resisted.

At the center of the PNC-Venmo skirmish is Plaid, a data aggregator that connects Venmo and thousands of other apps to financial institutions.

Security concerns halt data-sharing. When PNC upgraded its security systems, it prevented Plaid from accessing customers' account and routing numbers. PNC began blocking data aggregators such as Plaid from gaining access to customers' account numbers and routing numbers after it identified "multiple different aggregators" attempting to circumvent the bank's security protocol, bank executives say.

"When aggregators access account numbers, many store them indefinitely, often unbeknownst to customers," said Karen Larrimer, head of retail banking and chief customer officer at PNC. "This puts customers and their money at risk," she said. "We want to make sure we know who is setting up the account."

Plaid says it had already worked with PNC to provide requested system updates. The bank says it has asked Plaid and other aggregators to make changes to their own systems to meet its security requirements.

Big Number

$5.2 Million

Size of an Energy Department program researching for ways to use artificial intelligence to protect critical infrastructure from cyberattacks. Baker Hughes, GE Research, Intel and Florida State University are collaborating with the agency on the three-year project due to start in 2020.

More Cyber News

Voting-machine parts made by foreign suppliers stir security concerns. A voting machine that is widely used across the U.S. contains some parts made by companies with ties to China and Russia, said a report by Interos Inc., an Arlington, Va.-based supply-chain monitoring company. The findings are likely to fan worries about whether voting-machine vendors are doing enough to defend themselves against foreign interference ahead of the 2020 U.S. elections, the WSJ reports.

Points of contention: Voting-machine vendors assailed the research, saying the report failed to note existing safeguards, such as testing done at the federal, state and local levels, and the vendors' internal protocols. The report examined one unnamed voting machine as a case study. In that machine, around 20% of the components in the supply chain that Interos was able to identify came from China-based companies, including processors, software and touch screens, according to the Interos research. Those components weren't necessarily made in China, as the suppliers may have several locations globally, and the Interos data doesn't necessarily cover the entire supply chain, the researchers noted. The Chinese embassy in Washington didn't immediately reply to a request for comment.

Iran said it stopped two cyberattacks. Attempts to attack government systems and electronic infrastructure in Iran were stopped by cybersecurity experts, according to the country's telecommunications minister. One of the incidents involved the APT27 malware, known to be used by Chinese-speaking hackers, the BBC reports. Few other details were released.

U.S. Navy concerned about data security on Chinese drones. Data collected and transmitted by drones from China-based DJI could be intercepted, according to a 2017 memo from the U.S. Navy obtained by George Washington University, CyberScoop reports. Techniques are available online to syphon data from the aerial vehicles, the Navy said. A DJI representative told CyberScoop that the company has fixed the vulnerabilities. A bipartisan group of lawmakers proposed a bill in September that would bar federal agencies from buying drones from China and any other country deemed a national-security risk.

Regulators Find Shortcomings in Resolution Plans at Six Large U.S. Banks; The banks must address the shortcomings by the end of March

WASHINGTON Regulators on Tuesday said they had found "shortcomings" in the resolution plans at six of the largest U.S. banks, while none of the eight major banks they examined had more serious "deficiencies."

The Federal Reserve and Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said the firms, including Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc. and Wells Fargo & Co. had shortcomings related to their ability to reliably produce data needed to execute orderly wind-downs, also known as living wills, "in stressed conditions."

The six banks, which also include Bank of New York Mellon Corp., Morgan Stanley and State Street Corp., must address the shortcomings by the end of March. They next submit living wills in 2021.

Tuesday's moves, the regulatory equivalent of a slap on the wrist, are less severe than the finding of a "deficiency," which could lead to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements for the firms.

The agencies didn't find shortcomings in the plans from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Fed officials have grown increasingly confident that big U.S. banks are safer than they were in 2008, when the financial crisis exposed significant weaknesses in their risk management.

Tuesday's findings are a turnabout from just three years ago, when the Fed ordered five big U.S. banks to make significant revisions to their plans, citing deficiencies.

"The largest banks have been making steady progress, and the regulators are in greater agreement on what progress is than in prior rounds," said Karen Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics, a regulatory advisory firm.

Wells Fargo"https://newsroom.wf.com/press-release/corporate-and-financial/wells-fargo-issues-statement-2019-resolution-plan-feedback"the Fed found no deficiencies with its plan.

A Bank of New York spokeswoman said the lender "will work diligently to address the specific areas of feedback identified by the regulators in the required time frame."

Spokesmen for Bank of America, Citi and JPMorgan declined to comment. The other banks didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.

Kevin Fromer, president and chief executive of the Financial Services Forum, which represents the largest U.S. lenders, said the results show the firms "are strong, resilient and resolvable."

Under the 2010 Dodd-Frank law, big banks must file plans showing they have a credible strategy to go through bankruptcy without causing a broader economic panic, one of many provisions in the law designed to prevent a repeat of financial-crisis bailouts.

Banking & Finance: Goldman Unit Puts $75 Million in AI-Powered Firm

Copyright 2019 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. 

CallMiner Inc., a developer of speech-analytics software powered by artificial intelligence, said Monday that it raised $75 million in new venture funding from GS Growth, an investment unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

The Waltham, Mass.-based company, which has about 250 employees, has raised a total of $142 million since it was founded in 2002.

CallMiner's software platform, called Eureka, uses AI to analyze conversations between customers and a company's representatives. Among other things, the platform can recommend what an agent should say and determine whether employees' answers comply with company protocols.

Eureka uses natural language processing and other techniques to understand the words and sentiment used in calls, web chats, emails, surveys and texts.

The deal marks the first investment in CallMiner by GS Growth, which is part of Goldman's merchant-banking division. CallMiner previously raised $67 million from investors including NewSpring Capital, Jackson Square Ventures and Sigma Prime Ventures. It has about 400 customers including Equifax Inc., Banco Santander SA, Sirius XM Holdings Inc. and Dell Technologies Inc.

Holger Staude, a managing director in Goldman's merchant-banking division, will join CallMiner's board. "CallMiner is well positioned to transform the way organizations operate," he said in a statement.

Jeff Gallino, CallMiner's founder and chief technology officer, said his company plans to use the money to enhance Eureka, including helping it make more prescriptive recommendations.

"I want it to be able to tell the enterprise, 'Hey, did you know when you have a caller on the line, and they mention this competitor and they're calling about product A, if you want to upsell them, here's how you do it,'" Mr. Gallino said.

Eureka has historically focused on contact-center operations, Mr. Gallino said, adding that the company wants to accelerate an expansion into other areas, such as marketing or customer experience, that could benefit from the analysis of customer interactions.

CallMiner competes against companies including NICE Ltd., Verint Systems Inc., and Genesys Telecommunications Laboratories Inc. in a category Forrester Research Inc. calls "AI-fueled speech analytics."

Enterprise demand for such technology has grown in recent years along with advances in deep-learning techniques, said Kjell Carlsson, a Forrester analyst.

Not only has the technology improved but companies are more interested than ever in improving customer experience, he added.

Gecko Robotics Inc., a startup providing robots to help industrial companies inspect infrastructure and prevent accidents, raised $40 million in venture funding.

The deal comes as more large industrial corporations are turning to artificial intelligence and robotics startups to leverage new technology and gain new business insights.

Gecko's robots and AI-based software help its customers, which include Duke Energy Corp., Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Chevron Corp., predict when and where infrastructure could fail.

Gecko's robots can climb tanks, boilers, pipes and other equipment and use lasers, cameras, electromagnetics and ultrasonics to capture data to assess the infrastructure's health.

Companies in a variety of sectors, including energy and agriculture, are exploring different types of robotics to help leverage new insights.

Gecko, an alum of startup accelerator Y Combinator based in Pittsburgh, will use the capital to hire staff, develop software and build more robots as it aims to expand into new sectors, according to co-founder and Chief Executive Jake Loosararian.

The Series B round was led by Drive Capital. Previous investors including Founders Fund, Hive Ventures and Y Combinator participated. In addition, Alpha VP and venture firm Next47 also participated. Last year Gecko "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gecko-robotics-collects-7-million-series-a-1534804196" in Series A funding led by Founders Fund, with Mark Cuban, the Westly Group, Justin Kan and Y Combinator participating.

To do inspections, Gecko's robots roll along a surface and use various methods to check for wall thickness, cracking and other forms of degradation.

The insights the robots collect can help reduce infrastructure failure, explosions, harmful emissions and billions of dollars of loss each year, Mr. Loosararian said. The robotic inspections, which reduce the need for human inspections, can also reduce human injury, Mr. Loosararian added.

Roughly 80% of Gecko's revenue is generated from customers in the energy sector, according to Mr. Loosararian, adding that a portion of the new capital will help Gecko's efforts to increase its business in the manufacturing and oil-and-gas industries.

Founded in 2013, Gecko has a fleet of about 50 robots and will use the capital in part to build another 50, Mr. Loosararian said. Gecko, which gets paid per job, will also use the capital to hire software and product engineers.

Large industrial companies are increasingly turning to startups building different types of robots to offer new insights. This month, for instance, drone startup PrecisionHawk Inc., "https://www.wsj.com/articles/drone-startup-nets-funding-as-regulatory-changes-spur-investor-interest-11576065601" and lists a variety of utility companies as customers that use its technology to help inspect their equipment.

And DroneDeploy Inc. last month "https://www.wsj.com/articles/drone-software-startup-raises-funding-for-business-insights-and-logistics-11573683541" and says that agricultural companies use its drone software to gather data and generate an array of information including crop moisture levels.

Hive Ventures partner Nina Achadjian says she is attracted to Gecko because it is introducing innovative technology to legacy industries.

"The [return on investment] is just very clear for these companies," Ms. Achadjian said.

Good day. Large industrial companies such as Duke Energy, Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron are tapping a startup for its robots that can spot potential infrastructure failures. Gecko Robotics is one of several startups using robots or drones to provide new insights or data to infrastructure companies.

Plus, Goldman Sachs's investment unit is backing startup CallMiner, which uses artificial intelligence to analyze a company's employees and customers and determine if they comply with company rules.

And in IPO news, several venture-backed companies went public at the end of last week, including Bill.com, Sprout Social and EHang Holdings.

And now on to the news...

EnCap Seeks $1.5 Billion for First Clean-Energy Fund; EnCap is one of several oil and gas-focused firms that are expanding into renewable energy

EnCap Investments plans to raise $1.5 billion for a new fund that seeks to capitalize on North America's shift to clean-energy infrastructure, said people familiar with the matter.

The Houston-based energy investor expects to hold a "significant" first closing for EnCap Energy Transition Fund I LP early in the second quarter of 2020, one of the people said. The firm may decide to hold a smaller closing before that, the person added.

After investing in the oil-and-gas industry for more than three decades, EnCap in September said it would also pursue opportunities created by the economy's transition to lower-carbon energy. The firm cited potential investments in wind, solar and natural-gas power plants bolstered by battery-storage systems.

EnCap hired four industry veterans to lead its energy-transition strategy: Managing Partners Jim Hughes, Tim Rebhorn, Shawn Cumberland and Kellie Metcalf. Messrs. Hughes, Rebhorn and Cumberland worked together at Prisma Energy, a private-equity firm that invested in energy-storage startups, while Ms. Metcalf spent nine years at Pattern Development, a Riverstone Holdings-backed developer of renewable-energy projects. Riverstone recently "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pe-daily-elliott-collects-2-billion-for-buyouts-brookfields-9-billion-haul-softbanks-other-vision-stumbles-11572962434?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1" Pattern Development with Pattern Energy Group Inc. upon the power company's acquisition by the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.

EnCap has invested in at least four companies so far under its new energy-transition strategy, including two previously backed by Prisma Energy. Prisma Energy Solutions LLC is a Houston-based short-term lessor of battery-storage systems while Catalyze Inc., of Boulder, Colo., offers software and data analytics that help commercial-property owners develop renewable-energy projects.

EnCap earlier this year also backed two companies alongside Yorktown Partners, an energy-focused firm based in New York. Houston-based Broad Reach Power operates battery-storage power plants. US Grid Co., which is based in New York, seeks to acquire natural gas plants in major cities of the Northeast and Midwest with the goal of reducing their carbon emissions by adding battery-storage systems and renewable-energy capacity to them.

EnCap's general partners funded the firm's energy-transition investments through a separate vehicle since the new fund hasn't had a closing yet, one of the people familiar with the matter said. The fund will later add the investments to its portfolio and reimburse the general partners.

EnCap is one of a number of private-equity firms that have traditionally focused on the oil-and-gas sector and now are expanding into renewable energy. In another recent example, Westport, Conn.-based Lime Rock Management earlier this year "https://www.wsj.com/articles/oil-and-gas-firm-lime-rock-moves-into-renewable-energy-11566381600" to invest in providers of products or services to clean-energy companies. Lime Rock New Energy, as the strategy is called, is seeking $600 million for its first fund, WSJ Pro Private Equity previously reported.

Oil and gas-focused firms embracing clean-energy investments are responding to a desire by many investors to increase their exposure to a growing industry while also trying to appeal to others concerned about the environment, industry experts say. These firms also face challenges raising traditional oil and gas-focused funds, as lower commodity prices and a lack of buyers for their assets squeeze returns.

EnCap was founded in 1988 and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/encap-amasses-new-7-billion-fund-to-invest-in-the-oil-patch-1512388800" oil and gas-focused fund in late 2017 with $7 billion in commitments. The firm plans to continue investing in oil and gas businesses, including producers and pipeline operators, one of the people familiar with the matter said.

"Fossil fuels will continue to play an essential role in meeting global energy demand in the coming decades," EnCap said in September. "However, renewable energy sources are poised for rapid growth."

Economy
Holiday Retail Sales Had a Lackluster November Start; Report signals slower-than-expected start to critical holiday shopping season

WASHINGTON Shoppers are heading into the U.S. holiday season with restrained cheer.

Consumers held back on purchases of discretionary items ranging from clothes to restaurant meals in November. Retail sales excluding cars and gasoline were unchanged from the previous month, the "https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf". When those volatile categories are included, sales rose 0.2%, seasonally adjusted.

Lackluster sales at the start of the holiday shopping season signaled consumer spending, which accounts for two thirds of the U.S. economy, could be softening as the fourth quarter progressed.

November is a key month for retailers, especially for department stores, clothing outlets and online sellers during the holiday shopping season. The month "https://www.wsj.com/articles/thanksgiving-weekend-shoppers-boosted-spending-by-16-11575395503?mod=article_inline", days in which Americans crowd malls and shop online for deals.

Due to a late Thanksgiving, there are six fewer days in the holiday-shopping season this year compared with 2018. Cyber Monday fell in December this year and wasn't accounted for in Friday's report.

Kim Lefko, chief marketing officer at Ace Hardware Corp., based in Oak Brook, Ill., said "retailers would love to have had one more week" for the holiday season, but she added "sales going into Thanksgiving week and since then have been steadily strong."

The Commerce Department said sales in November declined sharply across categories that are closely tied with holiday gift-giving, including clothing, department stores and sporting goods. Spending at bars and restaurants dropped 0.3% last month, the steepest monthly decline since last December.

Retail sales account for about a quarter of consumer spending. Friday's Commerce report doesn't track spending on most services, such as health care and housing, and the figures aren't adjusted for inflation.

"In general, the tone for the consumer is good but it's not one of runaway strength," said Stephen Stanley, chief economist Amherst Pierpont.

He added that "we've seen so many other "https://www.wsj.com/articles/target-extends-its-sales-streak-11574249699"," pointing to higher sales recently reported by Costco Wholesale Corp.

At Rolling Oaks Mall near San Antonio, Phillip Iversen said while most of his holiday shopping is done online, certain deals still bring him to the mall for Black Friday promotions.

Mr. Iversen found a waffle maker at Macy's for about $7 on Nov. 28.

"I think they have to have the price that low now," the 35-year-old said of the deal.

November sales at electronics and appliance stores rose 0.7% from October but were down 1.5% from November 2018. Sales at nonstore retailers, a category that includes internet merchants like Amazon.com, were up 0.8% from October and grew 11.5% from November 2018.

Richard Derr, owner of Learning Express Toys in Lake Zurich, Ill., said, "This has been the strangest season I have ever seen for toys." The season started slow with weak months in October and November, and demand for December has only just started to pick up.

"There's just this malaise that we see in shoppers. We know it's not their pocketbooks," he said, citing the strong labor market and rising incomes. "There's just an overhang that we see in shoppers that they're really, really delayed this season."

Data on retail sales can be volatile from month to month, although the broader trend suggests momentum is slowing. Year-over-year retail sales increased 3.3% in November, a pullback from the 4.4% pace clocked just three months ago.

Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers, which make up about 20% of total retail sales, rose 0.5% in November. Gas station sales advanced 0.7%.

Still, economists and business executives say that household spending continues to be supported by a low unemployment rate and rising wages.

"The U.S. consumer is healthy, and the housing environment is stable and provides support for home improvement demand," Richard McPhail, finance chief of home-improvement chain Home Depot Inc., said at an investor and analyst conference on Wednesday.

While global uncertainty and trade tensions have taken a toll on business investment, consumer confidence remains high. The University of Michigan's preliminary index of consumer sentiment rose to 99.2 in December, up from 96.8 in November.

Consumers are the main driver of the U.S. economy, and they continue to benefit from a low unemployment rate and rising wages in the eleventh year of the current economic expansion.

Still, the Commerce Department report paints a more pessimistic picture of the start to the holiday season than separate data that suggested stronger sales, particularly in online spending.

Online holiday sales were up 14% from a year ago at $108 billion through Thursday, according to Adobe Analytics, which tracks activity on thousands of websites.

Weaker than expected retail sales in November suggests the pace of consumer spending eased somewhat as the fourth quarter progressed, which will feed into the broader pace of economic growth in the fourth quarter. On Friday, forecasting firm Macroeconomic Advisers projected a 1.8% pace for the fourth quarter.

Accolade Partners Raises $580 Million for Growth Equity, Venture Funds; The fund-of-funds manager shifts more to investing in growth-equity funds, but will remain active in venture capital, as well

With $580 million in new capital raised, funds-of-funds manager Accolade Partners will put a greater emphasis on investing in growth equity versus venture capital.

Accolade has long backed growth-equity funds, including from managers such as Accel-KKR, Level Equity, and a recent addition, Radian Capital, out of its main funds. But now the Washington, D.C., firm has a new fund exclusively for growth equity.

The fund, Accolade Growth Equity I LP, has raised $280 million and will back 15 funds.

Accolade has also raised $300 million for a seventh fund of funds, Accolade Partners VII. Half of the money will be invested in early-stage venture funds and half in growth-equity funds. Most will be dedicated to funds from firms Accolade has already worked with, but there will also be room for new managers, the firm said. The fund is about 26% bigger than its predecessor, which closed in 2017.

The two new funds will include some direct investing in companies and will be managed by Joelle Kayden, Accolade's founder and managing member, partners Atul Rustgi and Andy Salembier, and principal Aram Verdiyan.

Accolade looks for growth-equity funds that take minority and majority stakes in technology and health-care companies with under $20 million in revenue and that typically haven't raised institutional funding. After a few years, the funds put the companies up for sale.

This type of growth equity has "lower risk, lower loss-ratio and shorter duration [to liquidity] and still has compelling returns," Mr. Rustgi said. In addition, some investors who perceive venture capital as too risky are very interested in growth equity, he said.

"I was very happy with the level of interest in that particular strategy," said Mr. Salembier, who is also Accolade's chief operating officer. Investors "see there's a gap between venture and buyout" strategies that growth equity fills, he said.

Accolade's growth-equity portfolio is generating a return of 2.5 to three times on its investments, and its annualized percentage return, or internal rate of return, is in the mid-20s, Mr. Rustgi said.

Meanwhile, the firm's venture capital funds return three to five times and even more of what the firm puts in, but they are tending to produce a lower IRR because of longer holding periods, he said.

Accolade has benefited in recent years as venture and growth-equity funds sold stakes through a spate of initial public offerings and portfolio company acquisitions, Mr. Rustgi said.

The firm's venture portfolio includes funds from Accel, Andreessen Horowitz, IA Ventures, and Mucker Capital, as well as life sciences venture funds such as OrbiMed.

Accolade has raised $1.6 billion since its founding in 2000. Its partners are excited about machine learning, artificial intelligence, computational biology and blockchain as new technology opportunities, Mr. Rustgi said.

DataRobot to Buy Data-Prep Company Paxata; Acquisition closes a gap in the company's offerings, executive says

Enterprise artificial-intelligence platform company DataRobot Inc. said Thursday it reached a deal to acquire Paxata Inc., a startup that helps companies prepare data for AI and other applications.

Financial terms weren't disclosed. The deal is expected to be completed within the next two weeks. All of Paxata's nearly 100 employees, including Prakash Nanduri, its chief executive and co-founder, will join DataRobot, which now has a workforce of about 1,100.

Boston-based DataRobot developed an AI software platform that automates the building, deploying, and management of machine-learning models. The company's customers include Kroger Co., Humana Inc. and Panasonic Corp.

To date, DataRobot has raised $431 million in funding, the latest being a $206 million Series E round in September.

Paxata, of Redwood City, Calif., helps businesses gather, standardize and prepare data for AI applications development. Its customers include Standard Chartered PLC, Petco Animal Supplies Inc. and Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co.

Phil Gurbacki, DataRobot's senior vice president of product management and customer experience, called the Paxata acquisition a good fit, saying it closes a gap in its offerings.

"Our mission is really to complete our end-to-end enterprise AI platform," said Mr. Gurbacki. "Every DataRobot customer needs to do data prep, so this is one of our biggest gaps in the product."

Paxata is DataRobot's third acquisition this year. In June, the company bought ParallelM, a software company that helps companies manage and govern machine-learning applications. In February, it acquired Cursor, which helps organizations collect and analyze their data. Terms of those deals weren't disclosed.

"In the case of AI, you really need a scalable solution, a proven solution," said Ritu Jyoti, International Data Corp.'s global lead for AI. The combination of DataRobot and Paxata "seems like a marriage made in heaven," she said.

UK business leaders promise investment if Boris Johnson brings stability

Executives call on PM to deliver a soft Brexit to boost economic confidence

Business leaders and senior executives of listed companies have promised to unlock investment if the new Conservative government brings political stability but they called on Boris Johnson to deliver a soft Brexit that will boost confidence in the UK economy.

Many British companies have concerns about the Conservatives  Brexit strategy, warning about the damage to their operations from leaving the EU. But there had also been fears about a Labour government forcing through a programme of sweeping nationalisation.

Paul Lynam, chief executive of Secure Trust Bank, said businesses had deferred investment while waiting for political and Brexit clarity.  A Tory majority government should create an environment more supportive of business and enterprise, which will help instil the confidence necessary to drive increased investment and job creation,  he said.

Eric Benedict, head of the UK at AlixPartners, a corporate adviser, said there would be  a collective sigh of relief in boardrooms across the UK . But, he added, Brexit  remains a significant, opaque and likely enduring challenge .

Brent Hoberman, a British tech entrepreneur, said there were  hundreds of deals held back because of fear of a hung parliament or Corbyn government. We expect a boost in business confidence and people to start investing again in the UK. 

He hoped the large Tory majority  could lead to a softer, more business friendly Brexit , a sentiment echoed by many senior City executives.

One veteran board chairman, who had advocated for the UK to remain in the EU, said:  Boris winning a 50+ majority is the least worst option now as it will mean he can transcend the [hardline Brexit wing in his own party] The big worry is a no-deal Brexit in a year   that is a huge risk still. 

Another chairman of a listed company said that a  decent Tory working majority is likely to provide only short-term relief as the reality of a hard Brexit dawns on investors and businesses .

He added:  A large Tory majority is better, implying that the PM would then be able to tack closer to the centre, away from the more extreme voices in his party. 

The Conservative manifesto had frustrated some business leaders because of a lack of firm industrial plans. A number of reviews were promised, including of high street business rates, while other proposals include a digital services tax.

Executives told the Financial Times that, above all, they needed a period of stability after the divisive election and Brexit battles of the past year.

Rhydian Lewis, founder of RateSetter, a UK fintech company, said:  The UK stole a march in fintech in the last few years but investment has stalled this year, pending the Brexit morass and then the election   that investment could well clear now. 

The sector, he added,  will now be looking for Mr Johnson to deliver on his campaign rhetoric .

One retail boss said:  What we are looking for is certainty. All retailers have been crying out for it so that we can make the important investment decisions our businesses need. 

Others were more cautious about the prospect of post-election investment drive. Stephen Phipson, head of Make UK, which represents British manufacturers, said industry would  hope this result means that the skies can now begin to clear .

 The recent focus on Brexit and the absence of bandwidth in government has meant that there has been little movement on many vital policy issues and there remains work to do before industry can turn on the taps of investment,  he said.

Giles Palmer, founder of consumer analytics company Brandwatch, said that  UK businesses are losing investment and people. We need clarity and certainty on what Leave means in practice. 

Business leaders also want Mr Johnson to focus quickly on developing policies to boost UK competitiveness.

Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI business lobby, said businesses wanted Mr Johnson to  rebuild confidence in our economy and break the cycle of uncertainty .

 Early reassurance on Brexit will be vital. Pro-enterprise policies on immigration, infrastructure, innovation and skills will help relaunch the UK on the world stage. 

Another chairman of a listed company said:  Rather than obsess over the huge distraction of Brexit, the UK government needs to refocus on global competitiveness, inclusive growth, education and skills.

Cigna AI Product Identifies People Who Skip Medicines

Cigna Corp. plans to expand a system that uses artificial intelligence to identify gaps in treatment of chronic diseases, such as patients skipping their medications, and deliver personalized recommendations for patients.

The product, called Health Connect 360, integrates data from a combination of sources and analytical tools, some developed at Cigna and others brought in as part of its $54 billion acquisition of pharmacy-benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co., completed late last year.

Express Scripts, which began developing the service two years ago, rolled out portions of it to some customers this year.

The complete system will be available next month to all customers of Express Scripts and Cigna that offer health benefits to employees, the company said.

Health Connect 360 was developed for treatment of chronic diseases, including diabetes and heart disease, as well as for pain management. The system aggregates medical, pharmacy, lab and biometric data -- such as information from glucometers, which measure blood-sugar levels -- into a dashboard that is accessible through an online interface.

The dashboard will be visible to the service's customers and to Express Scripts case managers and nurses with access rights.

The system can also feed information to electronic-medical record systems for physicians.

More health-care organizations are looking to artificial intelligence to spot diseases, prioritize cases and improve patient outcomes -- results that also have the effect of lowering overall costs of providers.

AI systems' ability to learn from an array of patient histories, medical tests and diagnostic tests makes them ideal tools for care. However, getting access to health data required for better outcomes can be a bottleneck.

"That was our concept around the acquisition of Express Scripts -- it was much more than just simply buying a pharmacy-benefits management [company]. It was buying a set of care-management capabilities, and access to data and intelligence that would be very, very hard to replicate," said Cigna Chief Information Officer Mark Boxer, who drives the company's AI deployment.

Cigna is already using AI to predict whether patients might abuse or overdose on prescription opioids. Another Cigna tool, One Guide, provides personalized help to health-insurance holders on their benefit plans, appointments and health coaching.

The new Health Connect 360 system combines algorithms that analyze data such as clinical and pharmacy information with predictive models to generate recommendations and ways to best engage a patient, whether through an app or in person.

For example, collected data from pharmacy claims or high blood glucose level readings from connected glucometers could trigger an alert in Health Connect 360 that a diabetic patient needs help to stay on track with medications. After the system was tested and partially deployed this year, early results showed success in helping diabetic patients, the company said.

Managing chronic conditions is much less expensive than engaging in some kind of corrective procedure, said Matthew Josefowicz, chief executive of research and advisory firm Novarica Inc.

"Across the health-care industry, as with every industry, the incredible growth in data availability and ability to communicate enables new kinds of interventions that were just too cost-prohibitive to even consider before," Mr. Josefowicz said.

To keep the focus on its core health business, Cigna recently has been seeking a buyer for a unit that sells life, accident and disability-income insurance to employers for their workers, The Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday.

VC Daily: Which Way for Corporate Venture?; Porsche Invests In Aeva; Omega Funds Raises $438 Million; TripActions Hires CFO

Good day. Corporate venture-capital firms are traditionally known for their tight association with their parent companies in strategy, compensation structure and decision-making. That's a problem, says a managing director at Toyota AI Ventures.

Meanwhile, Porsche Automobil Holding SE has invested in Silicon Valley self-driving sensor startup Aeva Inc., the latest move into autonomous driving by the automotive holding company.

And Omega Funds has raised $438 million for its latest life sciences venture fund to invest across stages.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Corporate independence. Corporate venture capital must mimic traditional venture firms in its structure to be successful, Jim Adler, managing director and board member at Toyota AI Ventures, said at a conference in New York on Tuesday, WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova reports.

* This involves setting up a separate fund with a 10-year life, a limited-partner structure, and venture capital-style compensation for investors, he said, speaking at the CBInsights The Collective event.

* That is Toyota AI Ventures' model. Founded in 2017, the firm is funded by Toyota Motor Corp. and a family office, and manages $205 million out of two funds, Mr. Adler said. Los Altos, Calif.-based Toyota AI Ventures has backed 27 companies to date, including flying-car startup Joby Aviation and Moodify, a fragrance technology startup.

* Corporations are showing increasing interest in Silicon Valley startups and corporate venture arms are one way they are moving in this direction. Over the past decade, the number of U.S. corporations actively investing in startups more than doubled, reaching 212 in 2018, according to PitchBook Data Inc.

* As more corporations set up new startup investing units or re-evaluate their approach, they are weighing which structure works best. They must choose where they fall on the spectrum that ranges from being fully integrated within the corporation to being run entirely independently.

Autonomous move. Porsche Automobil Holding SE has acquired a minority stake in Silicon Valley self-driving sensor startup Aeva Inc., the latest in a flurry of moves by the auto manufacturing holding company in the autonomous driving sector this year, WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian reports. As part of the equity deal, Porsche SE, which houses auto makers such as Volkswagen AG, Porsche AG and Audi AG, will partner with Aeva in hopes of putting its lidar sensors on Volkswagen ID Buzz buses to create autonomous taxis, according to Aeva co-founder and Chief Executive Soroush Salehian.

New fund alert. Omega Funds has raised $438 million for a life sciences venture fund it expects to deploy across early- to later-stage companies, a strategy that has become less common as the venture industry has grown more specialized, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. Boston-based Omega set out in late 2018 to raise $400 million for Omega Fund VI LP, and by early this year had secured most of the fund, founder and Managing Director Otello Stampacchia said, adding that a final closing occurred in November. This vehicle tops Omega's last pool, a 2016-vintage fund that closed at $306 million, he said.

CFO hire. TripActions Inc. named its first chief financial officer as the corporate travel services company eyes continued expansion and an eventual public offering, CFO Journal's Nina Trentmann reports. The Palo Alto, Calif.-based company hired Thomas Tuchscherer for the newly created role. Mr. Tuchscherer joins following a stint as CFO of Snowflake Inc., which ended in September. TripActions had a valuation of about $4 billion in June, following a $250 million funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz.

Exits

Enterprise-software startup Acquia Inc. seeks to acquire customer data platform AgilOne for an undisclosed amount. In September, Vista Equity Partners agreed to purchase a majority stake in Boston-based Acquia. AgilOne, of Sunnyvale, Calif., earlier raised funding from investors including Tenaya Capital, Sequoia Capital, Mayfield Fund, Next World Capital and Four Rivers Group.

VC Funds

SOSV raised $277 million for its oversubscribed fourth fund, nearly double the amount raised for its $150 million third fund. Limited partners included university endowments, foundations, fund of funds, corporations, family offices and wealthy individuals. SOSV IV LP will continue the firm's strategy of providing $100,000 to $250,000 per startup via its accelerator programs, while investing $200,000 to $2 million in follow-on funding rounds focusing on the deep technology sector.

Federal Reserve's Lesson: Keep Your Errors Manageable; Central bank changed course this year in time to avoid obvious damage to the economy

As the Federal Reserve kept interest rates low after the recession and bought bonds, critics in Congress, Wall Street and within its own ranks accused it of courting inflation, debasing the dollar, enabling fiscal profligacy and distorting markets.

Today, with a record expansion and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/november-jobs-report-11575633600", some critics are making the opposite case: The Fed has tightened too much, and growth is lower and unemployment higher than they should be.

President Trump is the loudest, but economic commentators from across the spectrum and even some current and former Fed officials have made that case.

"Any neutral observer has to conclude that the last recession and 'recovery' were significant failures" for the central bank, Narayana Kocherlakota, former president of the Minneapolis Fed, said this week. Last month, Fed governor Lael Brainard said the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-has-taken-significant-action-to-offset-risks-to-economy-brainard-says-11574791909" when it started raising rates in late 2015.

The best evidence for their case is that in December 2015, central bank officials thought the natural unemployment rate the lowest sustainable without fueling inflation was 4.9%. Now the unemployment rate is 3.5%, yet inflation continues to run below the Fed's 2% target.

Had the Fed realized that, critics say, it would have raised rates more slowly or not at all, and employment and inflation today would have been higher. In August 2018, Adam Ozimek, then an economist at Moody's Analytics, estimated that "https://www.economy.com/home/products/samples/2018-11-20-Feds-Mistake.pdf" would have been 0.4% to 0.8% higher and employment 530,000 to one million higher.

Whether this is a failure by the Fed isn't straightforward. Central bankers act on what they know about the economy in real time, and that knowledge is suffused with uncertainty. Central bankers know they will be wrong about the future but not in which direction so they act in a way to minimize the cost of errors.

From 2009 through 2015, the Fed ignored those who wanted a faster return to "normal" interest rates and chose to err on the side of keeping rates low longer than needed, and risk an inflation rebound.

Once it began to raise rates, it did so more slowly than the Fed had ever tightened before. Its aim was to get rates to neutral a level, then pegged at 3.5%, that neither stimulates nor holds back growth but to go so gradually that growth would retain enough momentum to keep pushing unemployment down and inflation up. As the Fed raised rates from 2015 to 2018, it thought they were still below neutral and thus nudging unemployment down and inflation up.

But new data kept forcing the Fed to lower its view of the natural unemployment rate and the neutral interest rate, and adjust plans accordingly. Both interest rates and unemployment are lower today than either it or the private sector projected in 2015.

Asked Wednesday if the Fed had tightened too fast, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said it wasn't trying to "slow the economy down, we were really just trying to get [interest rates] near neutral." He noted that last December, when rates reached between 2.25% and 2.5%, that was "still meaningfully below" what most Fed officials considered neutral.

But new information has painted a different picture: Neutral, Mr. Powell has previously said, is probably lower than he thought, and this year global growth stumbled and trade risks flared. Those factors prompted the Fed to cut rates three times to between 1.5% and 1.75%. If the Fed made an error, it was one from which it has recovered with little obvious damage: The job market has steadily strengthened, and recession risks have faded.

Had the Fed listened to its more dovish critics, the job market might be even stronger yet. But some doves weren't always so dovish.

When Mr. Kocherlakota first joined the Fed in 2009, he opposed many of the Fed's easing measures out of fear of inflation, before having a change of heart in 2012. Just last fall Ms. Brainard was recommending that rates should top 3%. By contrast, Mr. Ozimek has consistently argued that the state of the labor market didn't support the Fed's pace of tightening. The chief economist at Moody's Analytics, Mark Zandi, disagreed with him at the time and still does. (Mr. Ozimek is now chief economist at Upwork, which connects freelancers with employers.)

As for Mr. Trump, he has sought to put on the Fed two advocates of lower rates who were calling for higher rates when Barack Obama was president.

Had the Fed listened to them at the time, the consequences would have been far more serious than anything that has happened in the past year.

Drone Startup Nets Funding As Regulatory Changes Spur Investor Interest; PrecisionHawk raises $32 million in Series E round

PrecisionHawk Inc., a drone startup targeting business customers, has raised $32 million in the latest sign that startups focused on the business capabilities of drones are gaining momentum as government officials rethink regulations.

After years of stalled growth for drones, the Trump administration's favorable drone regulations have helped spur investor interest in the sector, some market participants say.

Drones can gather information that businesses can use to quickly assess the health of real-world assets and infrastructure, as well as their safety and security, these investors say.

Millennium Technology Value Partners led the Series E round, while Third Point Ventures, Eastward Capital Partners and others also participated. PrecisionHawk has raised roughly $135 million in total.

Raleigh, N.C.-based PrecisionHawk builds software for drones that can allow the flying machines to collect massive amounts of data and use artificial intelligence to turn that data into business insights for a variety of industries.

Farmers, for instance, can fly drones over fields to count crops, assess plant health and predict yield. Utility companies have used the technology to help them inspect equipment, PrecisionHawk said.

PrecisionHawk affixes drones with custom sensors specific to the business application. Software for agricultural applications, for instance, can instantly organize and share web links to data, export custom PDFs and produce maps overlaid with insights that can be transferred directly into a farm management system.

Drone startups raised $549 million in world-wide venture funding in 2017, but that figure dropped to $455 million last year, according to data from the Teal Group Corp., an aerospace and defense market research firm. However, the sector raised $351 million through the first five months of 2019, according to the data provider.

The renewed interest in the sector is due both to a maturing regulatory landscape and emerging enterprise applications, said Sam Schwerin, managing partner of Millennium Technology Value Partners.

"There's more dialogue between regulators and drone companies," Mr. Schwerin said. "I give the FAA an enormous amount of credit."

Last month, drone software maker DroneDeploy Inc. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/drone-software-startup-raises-funding-for-business-insights-and-logistics-11573683541" in funding.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration, which has regulatory authority over commercial drones, has taken steps to pave the way for enterprise drone use. In August, for instance, the FAA approved the first drone flight that could move beyond the operator's sight line.

The new financing will help fuel machine-learning elements of PrecisionHawk's software. The financing will also go toward sales initiatives, Mr. Schwerin said.

PrecisionHawk was founded in 2010 and last year purchased Hazon Inc. and InspecTools Inc., both of which specialize in inspection services and technology for the energy industry.

Winner-takes-all digital economy poses risk of unforeseen shocks

T he trend of human tasks being replaced by algorithms is a perennial and understandable focus for the debate about how technology is changing capital markets.

Policymakers are focusing on a longer term trend how benefits of scale in digital industries will concentrate activity among fewer investment providers. The digitisation of capital markets tasks traditionally done by humans, such as trading equities, is well advanced. Technology has also facilitated new investment strategies, in particular algorithmic trading.

Computer-driven funds that scour the market for signals such as momentum the idea that stocks that have done well recently will continue to beat the average collectively account for a fifth of US equity assets under management, according to JPMorgan.

Last week, the US House of Representatives held a subcommittee meeting to discuss the future impact of artificial intelligence on capital markets. But its chairman, Congressman Bill Foster, kept coming back to a related challenge the implications of a concentration of business among the most powerful performers in the market. Scale will allow the biggest investment firms to process more data, find more correlations and thus improve their returns, he said.

"It's a reflection of the winner-takesall nature of digital economies," added Mr Foster. "As more of finance becomes digitised, you're going to see more and more of the rewards go to a smaller and smaller number of dominant players."

He is not alone in this view. In a speech this month Mark Yallop, chair of the FICC Markets Standards Board, and a former executive at interdealer broker ICAP, tackled the same problem.

The way machine-learning models improve by accessing more data will benefit those with the biggest budgets, said Mr Yallop. This "may well in turn create very high barriers to entry for new firms", he added.

We have already seen glimpses of this future. New technology helped highfrequency traders to break open banks' dominance of share trading. Their algorithms are able to fire off millions of deals a day without human intervention. The race to be fastest and smartest has squeezed out all but a handful of big operators such as Virtu Financial, XTX Markets and Citadel Securities.

Markets have also changed as improving technology cuts transaction costs. The Bank for International Settlements illustrated on Sunday the extent to which investment managers were becoming active participants in the repo and interest rate derivatives market.

Gross derivatives positions for asset managers and leveraged funds in threemonth eurodollar contracts on the CME, the most liquid global interest rate benchmark, rose 37 per cent in the three years to April. By comparison, banks' positions rose 18 per cent.

Some fear a greater degree of computer-driven trading will lead to crowded trades. Mr Yallop warned that the rise of algorithms would "make markets more fragile to unforeseen shocks and more interconnected, as multiple users depend on a limited number of underlying data relationships". And those users will depend on a limited number of banks to act as market buffers.

The past decade has also seen many investment banks curb daily trading activity, affecting even the most liquid securities.

A study last week by Albert Menkveld and Boyan Jovanovic found that, even for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust an exchange traded fund that is the world's most-traded equity security liquidity has suffered since the financial crisis.

Meanwhile, the number of banks and other intermediaries active in various markets has dropped sharply, Mr Menkveld and Mr Jovanovic found. In 2007, about 50 institutions were willing to facilitate trading in that S&P ETF. By 2018, the number had dwindled to 10.

Market "depth" for the security, judged by the number of shares available within 0.5 per cent of the best bid price, declined from 2m shares in 2007 to 200,000 in 2018. Mr Menkveld highlighted the impact of the Volcker rule, which prevents banks trading on their own account. "Regulation does seem to matter, even in what supposedly is a perennially liquid security," he said.

The BIS and academics' findings raise the question of where the big computerdriven investors of tomorrow will turn when they need a counterparty to their trades and what happens if that source is switched off.

The BIS hinted that these conditions affected US repo in September, where rates fluctuated. That should be a warning to capital markets. As digital trading evolves, the balance between competition, market stability and liquidity will be a critical test for hedge funds, investment banks and regulators alike.

SoftBank-backed payments group looks for other revenue sources as rivals move in

Often heralded as India s answer to PayPal, the Indian payments start-up Paytm is backed by some of the biggest names in tech.

Last month, it announced $2bn in fundraising, half in equity and half in debt, from stakeholders including Alibaba-backed fintech Ant Financial and Japan s SoftBank, which together own about 60 per cent of the company. Vijay Shekhar Sharma, Paytm s founder, declared that the company is now worth $16bn, making it India s highest valued start-up.

In an interview with the Financial Times, he said that everything was moving in the right direction, arguing that he had cut costs by 10 per cent in the past six months.  We see ourselves on a healthy path,  he added.

But to outsiders the narrative around Paytm is sounding less compelling, as the company burns through cash in the hope of clinging on to its share of the world s fastest-growing cashless payments market.

In September, Paytm s parent One97 Communications announced that its net losses for the year ending in March widened to Rs3,959 crore ($559m) from Rs1,490 crore ($210m) for the previous year, while revenues were up only slightly to Rs3,232 crore ($456m) from Rs3,052 crore ($430m).

The results come at a difficult time for SoftBank, which is still grappling with the aftermath of the failed public listing of WeWork, one of its most significant portfolio businesses.

 My prediction is that the next big problems for SoftBank will come from its Indian investments in Oyo and Paytm,  said Jeffrey Funk, a retired associate professor at the National University of Singapore, adding that his long-term concern over Paytm was that its losses  probably won t go away .

Indeed in a matter of months the company has spent nearly $600m on expanding its business   partly through an expensive strategy of generous cashback offers and discounts intended to entice customers.

 We don t sell a dollar for 90 cents,  Mr Sharma insisted,  but as long as we continue to invest, we will need more funds. 

A crowded field

One of the biggest problems Paytm is facing is that the Indian payments market is becoming increasingly crowded. Three years ago, the government s demonetisation initiative suddenly wiped out almost 90 per cent of the cash in circulation, giving a huge boost to the company s user numbers.

But since then more players have entered the space, as the government-sponsored Unified Payments Interface, a platform that was rolled out in 2016 to allow immediate mobile payments directly between bank accounts, has become widely adopted.

India now hosts a variety of competing payments apps including deep-pocketed rivals such as Amazon Pay, Flipkart s PhonePe and Google Pay, all looking to capitalise on the country s 800m mobile phone users. The fight will only intensify when Facebook-owned WhatsApp Pay launches in the country.

 Paytm is stuck between a glorious past that was built on the back of digital payments and a future that doesn t look anything like Jack Ma s Alibaba,  wrote business journalist Ashish Mishra in an essay entitled  Paytm is Stuck .

Some have argued that Paytm missed a key opportunity in not getting in ahead of the government and creating its own mini-UPI, which could have allowed it to develop the infrastructure underpinning the country s payments system.

 What Paytm didn t do right was to change [its] e-wallet business into UPI,  said the chief executive of an Asian start-up with a large financial services business, speaking on the basis of anonymity.  The company had this notion it could compete with UPI 	. 	. 	. 	and then PhonePe and Google Pay stormed the market. From a payment standpoint it is hard to see how [Paytm] can dominate now. 

Paytm eventually integrated with the UPI system in 2017, but by November of this year Google Pay and PhonePe commanded a bigger market share across UPI apps, with 57 per cent and 27 per cent respectively, versus Paytm s 7 per cent, according to research from payments provider Razorpay.

Mr Sharma, however, argued that the numbers on the ground were better  than people believe .

 We have more transactions and market share for Paytm and UPI than everyone else combined, including Walmart, Google, Amazon, all the banks and all the credit cards,  he said.

Paytm said it logged 700m digital transactions in June. UPI transactions hit 754m that same month, and leapt another 9 per cent in July to more than 800m, according to the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). That compares to 235m transactions one year earlier.

 The superapp route 

Paytm is looking beyond payments to other viable revenue sources, for instance using its payments business as a springboard for bolting on other services, from selling gold to insurance to forex services.

 It is now a lot harder to make money after UPI 	. 	. 	. 	the superapp route is how providers can capture higher-margin transactions such as lending,  said Neha Singh, co-founder of Bangalore-based data analytics company Tracxn.

But even this approach carries risks. Traditionally banks in India, where only about 20 per cent of the Indian population has access to credit, have avoided customers with a score of less than 750 from the country s Credit Information Bureau.

Recently, however, there has been a proliferation of fintech firms and non-banking financial companies offering personal loans to people with either low or non-existent traditional credit scores. Data from Bernstein in a report released earlier this year indicated that a large part of lending is now going to the 650-750 range.

The greatest risk, though, may be the growing protectionist thrust of Prime Minister Narendra Modi s government. In 2018, regulators in the US barred Ant from investing in remittance firm MoneyGram on the basis that financial data constitutes national security data   an argument now being cited in India as a possible reason to force the Chinese-owned Ant to divest its stake in Paytm.

However, Mr Sharma claimed this was not a major concern.  We always believe in keeping data within borders, which is what India cares about,  he said.

It may be that the future of the India s fintech sector, like that of Indonesia, lies in consolidation. For now, however, Mr Sharma said he has little interest either in making acquisitions or in selling his business to someone else.

In the past, he said, he has been approached to sell his company, including to an unnamed US buyer, but he would only consider such a move after going public.

 We have always chosen build over buy, but maybe that will change going forward,  he said.

NEW YORK JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Information Officer Lori Beer said artificial intelligence could help the bank develop new products and services for helping people build retirement savings, among other things.

"I do think we are uniquely positioned to really have an impact on how AI will address social-economic issues that provide wider access to financial services in our communities," Ms. Beer said, speaking at the AI Summit, a conference that focuses on AI's impact across different areas of business.

AI-based virtual assistants, for example, could be used to help consumers save money for retirement, Ms. Beer said, declining to give more details.

About 25% of working Americans say they have no retirement savings at all and 44% worry that their saving isn't on track, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/american-households-remain-financially-fragile-fed-survey-shows-11558627721".

JPMorgan can tackle problems related to AI and socioeconomic issues in part because it has access to an enormous amount of data, Ms. Beer said. The bank, the country's largest by revenue, processes $6 trillion in payments daily and has relationships with about half of U.S. households.

It stores about 390 petabytes or 390 million gigabytes of data, ranging from information about its customers to data about credit-card transactions, Ms. Beer said. The bank also integrates details from about 7,500 alternative data sources, such as public financial statements, census data, social media, satellite images, news sources and market data.

World-wide spending on AI systems this year will be led by the retail and banking industries, according to International Data Corp. Banks are projected to invest more than $5 billion in AI in 2019, according to a September report from IDC, up from an estimated $4 billion in 2018. Investments are expected to focus on automated threat intelligence and fraud analysis, according to IDC.

JPMorgan is using AI in various parts of its business, including "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgan-harnesses-ai-aiming-to-boost-client-services-11554220450". A tool from software company Persado Inc. helps the bank "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgan-chase-taps-ai-to-make-marketing-messages-more-powerful-11564482606".

The bank is also using AI to automate repetitive and mundane tasks. A machine-learning model ingests all of the company's travel and expense data and does automatic audits, eliminating the need for managers to approve expenses, Ms. Beer said. It's "taking some bureaucracy out of our managers' hands," she added.

The Property Report
Investors Warm Up To Cold Storage

With the booming growth of online grocery sales and rising consumer demand for fresh produce, property investors are trying to cash in on the places where grocers and delivery companies store all their food.

Customers of these cold-storage warehouses are some of the biggest names in the food business, from manufacturers like Tyson Foods Inc. to grocery chains such as Kroger Co. and big food sellers like Walmart Inc. Online grocers such as FreshDirect LLC also use temperature-controlled spaces.

Now -- similar to the way real-estate investors flocked to distribution centers to profit from the rise of online shopping -- investors are starting to pile into cold-storage warehouses.

Analysts say it is a business poised for rapid growth but one that involves more risks than owning other real estate, including typical industrial warehouses that hold books, mobile phones or sweaters.

During the first three quarters this year, investors bought $1.9 billion of refrigerated warehouses, up from $1.77 billion for all of 2018, and higher than any year in the past decade, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics.

While there are hundreds of companies that own refrigerated warehouses in the U.S., the sector is consolidating as the biggest players buy up smaller competitors.

Just two firms -- Lineage Logistics LLC and Americold Realty Trust -- control 63% of the cold-storage warehouses held by the top 25 owners in North America, according to the International Association of Refrigerated Warehouses.

Last month, Americold said it would acquire Canada-based Nova Cold Logistics, which owns three locations, for 337 million Canadian dollars (US$254.7 million). It also completed the purchase of two facilities in Maryland and Pennsylvania.

Shares of Americold, the only publicly listed real-estate investment trust focused on cold storage, have been on a tear.

The stock's total returns are up 42% this year, compared with the broader MSCI U.S. REIT Index, which rose 26%.

Having a big portfolio shields the firm from fluctuations in the agriculture or seafood businesses, said Fred Boehler, chief executive officer of Americold.

"Whether there is a bad harvest or cattle shortages, we as consumers, are still going to eat," he said. "If beef is down, you're going to eat chicken or pork."

The push for more cold storage is also going global. Lineage, the world's largest refrigerated-storage company by storage capacity, last month said it would pay more than $900 million to acquire Emergent Cold to expand in Asia. Lineage bought rival Preferred Freezer Services LLC for more than $1 billion this year.

"Cold-storage used to be a cottage industry where a company would own three or four buildings," said Greg Lehmkul, Lineage's chief executive, in an interview last month.

Despite shifting consumer tastes toward fresher foods and delivery convenience, the business of storing food comes with plenty of risks that owners of distribution centers for nonperishables don't face.

In the 1990s, real-estate companies like Vornado Realty Trust and Crescent Real Estate Equities Co. suffered from greater-than-expected capital and labor costs associated with cold storage and exited from the business in the 2000s.

Operators of cold-storage facilities generally have to hire more staff to manage the facilities and handle services such as packing and unpacking food for distribution.

Cold-storage warehouses can also cost three times more to build than those for dry goods, according to real-estate firm CBRE Group Inc.

VC Daily: Perceptive Jumps Into Early-Stage; Inscripta Gets $125 Million for Crispr; Tiger Global Cuts Juul's Value; SoftBank Sells Wag Stake; Away Replaces CEO

Good day. With the glut of venture capital flooding the startup industry, later-stage venture capitalists are moving upstream to invest in startups earlier. Life sciences investors are no exception. Perceptive Advisors, which just raised a $210 million fund, is the latest.

Plus, synthetic biology has been one of the trendy areas for venture capital investment. Inscripta Inc. has benefited from that with its $125 million funding round.

Meanwhile, Tiger Global Management has slashed its valuation of Juul Labs Inc. to $19 billion, after valuing the e-cigarette startup at $38 billion last December.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Surprise round. Inscripta Inc. wasn't seeking to raise capital when the genome-engineering company presented for the first time publicly at SynBioBeta, the synthetic biology conference, in October, WSJ Pro's Heather Mack reports exclusively.

* But the interest drummed up by Onyx, Inscripta's platform that enables scientists to perform genome editing and cell engineering at a large scale, convinced the company, which ended up raising $125 million within eight weeks.

* The Series D round nearly doubles the total amount of capital Inscripta has raised since its 2015 founding and is planned for commercialization efforts, Chief Executive Kevin Ness said.

* The new financing round was led by Paladin Capital Group with participation from other existing investors. New investors Oak HC/FT and JS Capital Management also contributed, bringing the company's total funding to date to $259.5 million.

* Boulder, Colo.-based Inscripta is one of several biotechnology startups offering new tools to enable the research and development process in the emerging synthetic biology sector, which provides the potential for a much broader scale and the use of computation on biology and genetics

Going early. Perceptive Advisors, an investment firm with a long history of funding publicly traded and later-stage privately held life sciences companies, is driving into early-stage venture capital by raising a $210 million biotechnology fund, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. To move into early-stage biotech, Perceptive has joined with Boston-based Xontogeny LLC, a biotech accelerator founded and led by Chris Garabedian, the former chief executive of publicly held biotech company Sarepta Therapeutics Inc.

Wag divestment. SoftBank Group Corp.'s Vision Fund has agreed to sell its nearly 50% stake in Wag Labs Inc. back to the struggling dog-walking startup, the Journal's Cara Lombardo reports, citing people familiar with the matter, marking another disappointment for the Japanese investing giant.

Vape price slash. Investment firm Tiger Global Management slashed its valuation of e-cigarette startup Juul Labs Inc. to $19 billion, the latest sign of a broader reassessment investors are making of several one-time Silicon Valley darlings, The Wall Street Journal's Sharon Terlep reports. The write-down by one of Juul's earliest boosters came at the end of September. Tiger Global had valued Juul at $38 billion last December.

Limits of direct-to-consumer. American shoppers will buy almost anything online. But when it comes to household mainstays, from razors to tampons, the old-fashioned store still beckons, The Wall Street Journal's Sharon Terlep reports. That reality is hitting some of the world's biggest consumer-products companies, which collectively have invested billions of dollars in startups in recent years that sold directly to consumers. More than three years after Unilever paid $1 billion to buy Dollar Shave Club, the razor subscription service still isn't making money, according to people familiar with the matter. Procter & Gamble CEO David Taylor said his company is still figuring out how to turn recently acquired online brands, including Native Deodorant and Walker & Co., into profitable businesses.

CEO swap. Away, an online seller of luggage that investors valued at $1.4 billion earlier this year, said Chief Executive Steph Korey is stepping down. Stuart Haselden, who is departing as chief operating officer at Lululemon Athletica Inc., will succeed her as CEO, according to the company. The news comes after an article in the Verge last week criticized Ms. Korey's management style as harsh, citing several former employees unhappy with the work environment.

AI makes bots smarter. Software robots designed to handle routine office work are undertaking more ambitious jobs, CIO Journal's Angus Loten reports. By combining robotic process automation with machine-learning capabilities, software makers are developing robots that can tackle higher-level workplace functions, including many that require a degree of judgment.

"Agglomeration." The forces driving top technology talent in the U.S. to just a handful of cities have intensified in recent years, leaving much of the nation behind as the U.S. becomes a more digital economy, according to a new study, the Journal's Jon Hilsenrath reports. Just five metropolitan areas Boston, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle and San Jose, Calif. accounted for 90% of all U.S. high-tech job growth between 2005 to 2017, according to the study.

VC Funds

SignalFire raised a pair of new funds totaling $500 million. The San Francisco-based firm said SignalFire Fund III LP and SignalFire Breakout Fund II LP will invest $200 million and $300 million, respectively, in seed and early growth stage enterprise and consumer startups. SignalFire's recent investments include dermatology startup Apostrophe, video platform Frame.io and data scientist collaboration platform Saturn Cloud.

Growth-equity firm Centana Growth Partners closed its second fund with $375 million, or $125 million more than the firm raised for its inaugural fund back in 2015. Centana Growth Partners II LP, which was oversubscribed, will continue the Palo Alto, Calif., and New York-based firm's focus on financial services investments. Earlier this year, Centana participated in funding rounds for insurance platform Ease and financial planning provider Vena Solutions.

Spring Lane Capital has closed its debut private-equity fund at about $156.5 million. Backers of the new vehicle include BDC Capital, Fondaction, Fonds de solidarit FTQ and Palomino Capital Corp. The firm also announced three recent investments: Atlas Organics Inc., which turns organic waste into compost, renewable energy company Aries Clean Energy and Cambrian Innovation, a commercial provider of wastewater treatment services. Spring Lane, which has offices in Boston and Montreal, focuses on providing finance and growth capital for sustainability projects in the energy, food, water and waste industries.

Investment influx backs innovative technology

D espite the current political turmoil and a rollercoaster economic decade since the global financial crisis, Spain is seeing a growing influx of investment from abroad.

The country is among the top beneficiaries of a so-called "Brexit boost". Investment into continental EU countries has risen since the UK referendum result in 2016 at the expense of foreign money coming into Britain.

Total estimated capital invested into the 27-member EU's greenfield foreign direct investment (FDI) projects increased 43 per cent in the three years to the end of the first quarter of 2019, compared with the preceding three years, says FT-owned database fDi Markets. The UK suffered a 30 per cent drop in greenfield FDI during that time.

Greenfield FDI tangible, on-theground investment bringing new or expanded physical facilities and headcount into Spain has risen sharply. Inbound projects numbered 552 in 2018, compared with 299 in 2014, while announced or launched investment grew from $7bn to $18.5bn.

"The evolution of Spain's attractiveness to foreign investors is a very striking case," says Mara Jess Fernndez, executive director of Spanish government investment promotion agency ICEX. Spain, she says, has had "record capital inflows year after year", against a background "in which foreign direct investment has been falling in the world".

She adds: "This is a sustained and significant trend that indicates that Spain has aroused great interest in the international investment community." Yet more significant is the investment quality. Spain has attracted 43 headquarter operations already in 2019, compared with 14 in 2014. Investment in design, development and testing projects rose from $154m in 2014 to $1.1bn in 2018, with a tripling of project numbers.

Since 2014, a total of $2.6bn has been invested into these functions along with $3.6bn in information technology and internet infrastructure and $246m in research and development.

Among most recent investments, Universal Robots, which develops industrial robots and operates as a subsidiary of US-based automation equipment suppliers Teradyne, has partnered with Danish company Mobile Industrial Robots (MiR) to open a 1,500 sq m robotics hub in Barcelona. The centre, in the city's 22@ tech district the formerly heavily industrialised area of Poblenou is aimed at boosting innovation and will host a showroom of new developments.

Meanwhile, Free Now, a ride-hailing partnership between Daimler and BMW, has invested  ¬30m in its innovation centre in Barcelona. Free Now's 1,400 sq m location in the city centre's Plaa de Catalunya has 100 workers and expects to hire 50 more by 2024.

In Madrid, US-based Nalej, a VC capital-backed platform-as-a-service company, has launched an innovation lab and Deloitte has opened an  ¬18m cyber security centre. The latter will have 570 staff and offer services to markets in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

Barcelona and Madrid are moving up the league tables of FDI destinations for innovative activity. A study of European cities for their suitability for investment in artificial intelligence, using fDi Benchmark (an assessment tool that compiles data on factors influencing investment decisions) ranks Barcelona and Madrid just behind London and Paris and ahead of Berlin, Milan and Frankfurt. The Spanish cities rank first and second, respectively, for cost and fourth and fifth on quality metrics.

The average developer salary in Spain ( ¬40,000) is much lower than in France, Ireland, or world hubs London, New York and San Francisco, says Ms Fernndez.

Spain, she adds, has a higher tertiary education rate than the EU average.

Other areas of Spain are attracting innovation-led investment. Switzerland-based dental implant makers Straumann opened a global R&D centre this year in Mendaro, in the Basque Country, having acquired the local company Createch Medical in 2018.

Dublin-based professional services company Accenture plans to expand its flagship technology centre in Malaga, southern Spain. Its near-term goal is to create 300 jobs in the region.

Spain aims to become one of the world's main innovation hubs, says Ms Fernndez: "We truly believe it is just a matter of time." That said, there is no shortage of contenders. Neighbouring Portugal is also making a strong case to be Iberia's innovation centre and is enjoying an FDI boom.

Stiff competition is coming from around Europe and, indeed, much of the world for high-value-added tech investment. Success requires concerted efforts to keep education, science and research well funded, while cultivating the freewheeling, dynamic environment in which creativity thrives. Spain's claim is that it has the right elements falling into place, and the FDI to show for it.

Inbound projects numbered 552 in 2018, compared with 299 in 2014

Whenthe government comes calling for too much information

Legal privilege: companies have the right to keep attorney-client confidences from scrutiny by agencies such as the FBI Reuters easy to ascertain the client's identity.

In a federal investigation,lawyerswantto exclude asmuchas possible fromthe regulator's eyes, especiallyif it concernsconversations betweenthe clientandtheirlawyer.

In the transportcompany's case,however, it wasinitiallywilling towaive its rights to privilege because payinglawyers towade throughthe data to ascertainwhatcouldbe excludedwouldhave cost millions of dollars in legal fees.

Instead,MrMahoneysuggested using digital technologytowhittle thedocumentsdownto a manageablesize. "After avery broadfiltering of the evidence,wewere left with half a million documentsthat couldhave potentiallybeen privilegedandthuskept out of the government'shands," saysMrMahoney,who leads ClearyGottlieb's litigation technology efforts inWashington. "But the government wasn't going to let uskeep500,000documents fromthemwithoutgoodreason.Weneededto showthemwe'dbeenmore rigorous inour analysis than just a big general claim covering half a milliondocuments."

"Theproblemwith trying to sift information potentiallycoveredbyprivilege is it's not just what'sbeing said. It'swho's saying it towhom andinwhatcontext," saysMrMahoney.

Hespoke toa fellowXeroxalumnusnowwith legal techcompanyLighthouse foradvice.

RobHellewell, a lawyer-turned-data scientist, immediately sawMrMahoney's conundrum.

"In determining if a documentis privileged or not, context iskey," saysMr Hellewell."Unearthing privileged material is often a big source of frustration. It's usuallythe minority of data in cases but the majority of costs.

"Theperennial problemis finding needles in the haystack, but the trick ismakingthe haystack smaller."

MrMahoneyrejects the notion that the tool lost his firm lucrative work. "Thiswasn't a case of us arguingourwayout of billable hours,"Mr Mahoneysays. "Thatmoneywasnevercoming to us fromsuch a cost-sensitive client."

Litigation and Disputes Rank Law firm Originality Leadership Impact Total Standout White & Case The law firm successfully defended pharmaceuticals group Allergan by arguing the unconstitutionality of a common practice in class action lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies. This set a precedent for all plaintiffs to demonstrate proof of injury to be considered an injured class, prior to receiving a jury verdict. 9 8 8 25 Dechert In the 2008 lawsuit brought by Northstar against Schwab, which was settled last year, the firm set a precedent for mutual fund litigations. Because mutual fund prospectus documents are covered by federal securities law, these cases can now only be heard in federal, not state, courts. 8 8 8 24 Sullivan & Cromwell Representing carmaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, the firm negotiated a settlement of $800m, as opposed to potential billions, with government agencies and owners of its diesel vehicles that were judged not to comply with rules on emissions. The carmaker was alleged to have used software designed to defeat US emissions tests. In the case, completed in May, the car company did not admit wrongdoing but agreed to install a software solution in cars to ensure compliance. 8 8 8 24 Highly commended Cravath, Swaine & Moore Arrived at a global settlement of $4.7bn and a six-year licensing agreement with iPhone company Apple for its client, Qualcomm, the US chip company. The firm revealed documents triggering allegations that Apple's claim that Qualcomm was not pricing its products competitively was an attempt deliberately to undermine Qualcomm's business. 6 8 9 23 Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher The firm successfully argued that its client, the accommodation-sharing platform HomeAway, did not have to share user data with New York state officials who were concerned over the effect of short-term rentals. It cited the fourth amendment, which protects information from unreasonable searches and seizures. 6 8 9 23 Hausfeld The firm won a $55m class-action lawsuit settlement with pharmaceutical company Celgene, which it alleged had monopolised the market for Revlimid, a drug used to treat a form of blood cancer. The case established a precedent for this type of lawsuit. 7 8 8 23 Morgan, Lewis & Bockius The firm defended pharmaceutical company Shire from the Federal Trade Commission by proving it was not within the FTC's power to sue in federal court if an activity is not current or about to happen. 8 7 8 23 Ropes & Gray Mutual fund manager Metropolitan West stood accused of charging excessive advisory fees. Ropes & Gray mounted a successful defence by demonstrating the competitiveness of the industry. The case hinged on the comparison of advisory and subadvisory fees, which the court ruled was "inapt". 8 7 8 23 Seyfarth Shaw In Johnson v United Airlines, Seyfarth Shaw defended the airline against the accusation that it had breached employees' privacy by using thumbprint identification to clock in and out. 7 8 8 23 Commended DLA Piper Technology company Finisar faced a class-action lawsuit over a claim that it had misrepresented its stock price to the public. The firm argued this was not the case and that inflated stock prices were a result of later statements by analysts. 7 8 7 22 Latham & Watkins In a securities class-action trial, the firm defended start-up pharmaceutical company Puma Biotechnology by arguing that its inflated stock price was caused by external factors rather than a misleading internal statement. 7 8 7 22 King & Spalding Lawyers from the firm used the "doctrine of equivalents" argument when representing pharmaceutical company Galderma against its rival Amneal. Galderma prevailed in the case, which alleged infringement on patent rights. 6 8 7 21 Hausfeld The practice settled an $80m antitrust class action lawsuit for 200,000 dentists in June. It was brought against three dental supply distributors for anti-competitive practices and inflation of prices through fixing margins and boycotting low-priced rivals. 6 8 7 21 White & Case The US Department of Justice alleged that three British bankers were engaged in a "conspiracy" to "suppress and eliminate competition" in trade in the dollar. White & Case represented Richard Usher, one of the three, in court in New York. The men denied price fixing and were cleared. 7 7 7 21 Akerman Argued for the unconstitutionality of new Florida legislation that limited a company's ability to apply for a medical marijuana licence. The court confirmed a conflict with the state constitution and upheld the ruling in July. 7 8 5 20 King & Spalding Successfully blocked the $6.1bn acquisition of Xerox by Fujifilm, arranged by the Xerox CEO in an attempt to retain his position after learning he would be replaced. This allowed for a change of the board of directors and CEO at Xerox. 7 7 6 20 Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman The practice used a disgorgement model as a remedy for lost potential profits to win more than $370m for its client, the founder of Laserscopic Spinal Centers of America.

Winner-takes-all digital economy poses risk for capital markets

Concentration of business among small number of players presents significant challenge

The trend of human tasks being replaced by algorithms is a perennial and understandable focus for the debate about how technology is changing capital markets.

Policymakers, however, are already focusing on a longer-term trend: how the benefits of scale in digital industries will concentrate activity among a smaller number of investment providers.

The digitisation of capital-markets tasks traditionally done by humans, such as trading equities, is well advanced. Technology has also facilitated new investment strategies, in particular algorithmic trading.

Computer-driven funds that scour the market for signals such as momentum   the idea that stocks that have done well recently will continue to beat the average   collectively account for a fifth of US equity assets under management, according to JPMorgan.

Last week, the US House of Representatives held a subcommittee meeting to discuss the future impact of artificial intelligence on capital markets. But its chairman, Congressman Bill Foster, a former scientist, kept coming back to a related challenge  the implications of a concentration of business among the most powerful players in the market. Scale will allow the biggest investment firms to process more data, find more correlations and thus improve their returns, he said.

 It s a reflection of the winner-takes-all nature of digital economies,  added Mr Foster.  As more of finance becomes digitised, you re going to see more and more of the rewards go to a smaller and smaller number of dominant players. 

He is not alone in this view. In a speech this month Mark Yallop, chair of the FICC Markets Standards Board, and a former executive at interdealer broker ICAP, tackled the same problem.

The way in which machine-learning models improve   by accessing more data   will benefit those who have the biggest budgets, said Mr Yallop. This  may well in turn create very high barriers to entry for new firms , he added.

We have already seen glimpses of this future. New technology helped high-frequency traders to break open banks  dominance of share trading. Their algorithms are able to fire off millions of deals a day without human intervention.The race to be the fastest and smartest has squeezed out all but a handful of big players such as Virtu Financial, XTX Markets and Citadel Securities.

Markets have also fundamentally changed in the past decade, as improving technology cuts transaction costs. The Bank for International Settlements illustrated on Sunday the extent to which investment managers were becoming active players in the repo and interest rate derivatives market, a world traditionally dominated by investment banks.

Gross derivatives positions for asset managers and leveraged funds in three-month eurodollar contracts on the CME, the most liquid global interest rate benchmark, grew 37 per cent in the three years to April. By comparison, banks  positions rose 18 per cent.

Some fear that a greater degree of computer-driven trading will lead to crowded trades. Mr Yallop warned that the rise of algorithms will  make markets more fragile to unforeseen shocks and more interconnected, as multiple users depend on a limited number of underlying data relationships . And those users will depend on a limited number of banks to act as market buffers.

The past decade has also seen many investment banks drastically curb their daily trading activity, affectingeven the most liquid securities. An academic study published last week by Albert Menkveld and Boyan Jovanovic found that even for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust   an exchange traded fund that is the world s most-traded equity security   liquidity has suffered on some measures since the financial crisis.

Meanwhile, the number of banks and other intermediaries active in various markets has dropped sharply, Mr Menkveld and Mr Jovanovic found. In 2007, about 50 institutions were willing to facilitate trading in that S&P ETF. By 2018, the number had dwindled to just 10.

Market  depth  for the security, judged by the number of shares available within half a per cent of the best bid price, declined from more than 2m shares in 2007 to under 200,000 in 2018. Mr Menkveld highlighted the impact of the Volcker rule, which prevents banks trading on their own account.  Regulation does seem to matter, even in what supposedly is a perennially liquid security,  he said.

Collectively the BIS and academics  findings raise the question of where the big computer-driven investors of tomorrow will turn when they need a counterparty to their trades   and what happens in the market if that source is suddenly switched off.

The BIS hinted that these conditions affected US repo in September, where rates fluctuated rapidly. That should be a warning to the wider capital markets. As digital trading evolves, the balance between competition, market stability and liquidity will be a critical test   for hedge funds, investment banks and regulators alike.

Goldman Taps Startup to Explore Quantum Computing; QC Ware to help bank determine whether the technology could speed up algorithm used to calculate theoretical value of an option

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has teamed up with a quantum-computing startup to explore how the nascent technology could be used to speed up financial calculations and artificial-intelligence-based decision making.

The bank worked with Palo Alto, Calif.-based startup QC Ware Corp. for three months earlier this year to understand the limitations of current quantum-computing technology, said Paul Burchard, a managing director at Goldman's research-and-development division.

Goldman is extending the partnership with QC Ware, Mr. Burchard said, adding, "We're looking at various possibilities for applying quantum computing across the bank." This is the first time Goldman has announced its work with a quantum-computing services company.

By harnessing the properties of quantum physics, quantum computers have the potential to sort through a vast number of possibilities in nearly real time and come up with a probable solution. While traditional computers store information as either zeros or ones, quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which represent and store information as both zeros and ones simultaneously.

No commercial-grade quantum computer has been built yet, but tech giants such as Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.'s Amazon Web Services"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-rolls-out-quantum-computing-service-11575314729".

QC Ware uses the cloud to connect businesses with early-stage quantum-computing hardware providers including D-Wave Systems Inc., Rigetti Computing and International Business Machines Corp. The startup also helps enterprises develop quantum algorithms and applications.

Its other enterprise clients include Airbus SE, which "https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbus-cto-sees-quantum-computing-taking-off-in-aerospace-industry-11548255860" in understanding how quantum computing could be applied to mathematical calculations in the design phase of aircraft systems and parts.

In the coming months, QC Ware will help Goldman Sachs determine whether quantum computing could be used to speed up a computational algorithm known as Monte Carlo. The algorithm is used to calculate the theoretical value of an option, or a contract that gives individuals the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at a specific price and time.

These types of calculations can be time-consuming for traditional computers, which can take hours to compute option prices and risks for a large portfolio of complex trades.

Quantum-computing technology could also be useful in speeding up AI-based calculations that help determine trading strategies for clients, Mr. Burchard said. Theoretically, quantum computing has "some very attractive applications," he said. But today's quantum machines face numerous hardware challenges, meaning potential business value from the technology could still be many years away.

"We're obviously making a bet that it's worth it to get in now, early, and understand the technology sooner than later, but there's a lot of uncertainty around the eventual timeline," Mr. Burchard said.

QC Ware has received $7.5 million in venture-capital funding since it was founded in 2014. Goldman was the lead investor in the company's Series A funding round last year, along with Citigroup Inc.

A Goldman executive said last month that when quantum computing goes mainstream, the financial-services industry "https://www.wsj.com/articles/quantum-computing-holds-promise-for-banks-executives-say-11573230983" because a quantum algorithm could be deployed to a new financial model in days or weeks, while approving a new material or drug discovered by a quantum computer is likely to take years.

"In the universe of industries where there is a potential quantum advantage, you could argue that finance has got the shortest path to impact," Jeremy Glick, head of research-and-development engineering at Goldman Sachs, said at a quantum-computing panel event in Brooklyn, N.Y.

Investing in Funds & ETFs (A Special Report): Q&A --- Robert Shiller Talks About the Stories We Tell --- The economist explains how narratives affect the economy and markets; 'The overwhelming narrative is all about Donald Trump,' he says

Yale University economist Robert Shiller has produced groundbreaking research about the economy and financial markets, and in 2013 shared a Nobel Prize with Eugene Fama and Lars Peter Hansen for work on analyzing asset prices. Mr. Shiller warned of a stock-market bubble before the 2001 market slide and a housing bubble before the plunge of 2008.

Now he is focusing on narratives, specifically the idea that popular stories, whether true or false, can affect the economy and markets. An example would be the false adage that home prices never fall.

Economists and investors ignore narratives at their peril, says Mr. Shiller, who recently published the book "Narrative Economics: How Stories Go Viral and Drive Major Economic Events."

The Wall Street Journal talked with Mr. Shiller about his research on narratives. Edited excerpts:

WSJ: Can you explain your idea about the role that narratives play in the economy and financial markets?

MR. SHILLER: It's important for investors and economists to look at what people think as things change through time. It can be done by studying their narratives. That is the telling of a story, which imbues it with something memorable.

People generally don't talk directly about their economic theories, but [they do reveal them] through stories. Investors are influenced and should know which stories are viral and whether they're being caught in those stories.

Years ago, fellow economist John Pound and I did a study about how people find investments. We concluded that most people aren't systematic. They aren't necessarily responding to tips, but they are responding to whatever is being talked about.

WSJ: What narratives do you think are at work now in the economy and financial markets?

MR. SHILLER: Technology is an important narrative. That [narrative] drove the dot-com boom and came back just before the financial crisis. It keeps mutating. Now it's artificial intelligence. That's a different emphasis than the earlier one about labor-saving machines.

It isn't scary at the moment. It isn't inhibiting consumer spending. But if the emphasis was on job reductions caused by robots, consumers might well cut back on spending. The fear could come back.

WSJ: What about narratives about the economy as a whole?

MR. SHILLER: The overwhelming narrative is all about Donald Trump. At the moment, [the Trump narrative] is amazingly strong. What does it do to economic activity and investors? It has the potential to scare people and make them pull back. But it hasn't so far. I don't have an answer as to why.

Donald Trump understands people have a success orientation. He helps to nourish that orientation. He encourages people to live high and show off. He thrusts forward the American dream in a new way. That's part of what's driving the economy, financial markets and the housing market.

WSJ: How do narratives play into recession?

MR. SHILLER: They are the dominant explanation for the strength of a recession. The Great Depression was great because of the narrative. Franklin Roosevelt said all we had to fear was fear itself. That phrase is remembered by many people. And it isn't just fear. Other emotions, like anger, might change the economy and markets.

WSJ: How can investors incorporate narratives into their thinking?

MR. SHILLER: An individual investor who has no particular expertise should just diversify. Maybe you can get a little edge by value investing. If you're more ambitious, and it appeals to you to think of these things, then go for it. You need to think about what's genuine value and what's imaginary, and then look at narratives to see what's driving a stock beyond earnings.

WSJ: So the goal is to figure out how narratives are contributing to an asset's price?

MR. SHILLER: Yes, you have to have a sense of the real business. Why does something have an anomalous price? Maybe it's a genuinely positive investment. But if so, why aren't investors driving it up? Maybe narratives are driving attention away from fundamentals.

Narratives can be a valuable part of value investing. I don't know how good Donald Trump is as an investor, but he's good at understanding narratives. He has a certain genius, though I certainly don't mean to praise everything he does. In any case, you can use narratives as part of successful investing if you have good human judgment.

WSJ: But that might be difficult for many investors -- trying to judge the truthfulness of narratives, right?

MR. SHILLER: Yes, it's kind of an art form. It's almost like being a historian. Maybe more people should be history majors, instead of business. My method is to go to digital sources and search for narratives that I see in the press, like the narratives surrounding artificial intelligence. I see how far back it goes and read the articles.

Sometimes a narrative lasts for decades. Others play out more quickly. You're trying to understand with human judgment whether you're reading real news or fake news. Narratives are inspired by real events. But sometimes they grow without being real themselves. In investing, it's even harder. You have to judge how other investors are explaining narratives.

WSJ: Is that kind of like economist's John Maynard Keynes's idea that investing in stocks is like trying to judge how others are judging a beauty contest?

MR. SHILLER: Yes. In the dot-com controversy, Amazon was a genuine success. But others just looked superficially like Amazon and were riding along the narrative.

WSJ: Are there any narratives you see developing soon?

MR. SHILLER: I mention nine perennial ones in my book: panic versus confidence; frugality versus conspicuous consumption; gold standard versus bimetallism; labor-saving machines replace many jobs; automation and artificial intelligence replace almost all jobs; real-estate booms and busts; stock-market bubbles; boycotts, profiteers and evil business; the wage-price spiral and evil labor unions [or the idea that labor unions boost inflation].

Journal Reports: Funds & ETFs
Markets
'Funds of Funds' Move Into ETF World; These funds appear to be similar to regular ETFs. But there are important differences.

Exchange-traded-fund providers are coming out with more offerings of what are known, a bit awkwardly, as "funds of funds."

While a regular ETF typically owns a basket of securities, an ETF fund of funds owns a basket of other ETFs. Funds of funds have a long history in the mutual-fund industry, and are now taking root in the ETF world.

At the end of November, there were 99 ETF funds of funds registered in the U.S., up from 48 at the end of 2014, according to Morningstar Direct.

These products can be split into two broad categories those focused on asset allocation and those dedicated to sectors or themes, says Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual-fund research at financial-analysis company CFRA in New York.

The asset-allocation funds hold a mix of ETFs focused on stocks, bonds and other assets and "are essentially model portfolios in an ETF wrapper," Mr. Rosenbluth says. Examples include iShares Core Moderate Allocation ETF (AOM) and iShares Core Aggressive Allocation ETF (AOA). The former is weighted 54% bonds to 39% stocks. The latter is weighted 19% bonds, 79% stocks.

Other funds of funds specialize in themes or sectors. Global X Thematic Growth ETF (GXTG), which launched in November, is designed to tap into the disruptive trends seen in the economy, such as artificial intelligence and e-commerce. The fund owns seven funds drawn from Global-X's roster of 17 thematic ETFs. The holdings are systematically rebalanced and switched depending on which subsectors are seeing the highest sales growth.

"I think it's a great concept," says Mr. Rosenbluth. "The thematic ETFs require confidence in the long-term horizon of these themes, but the short-term performance can be bumpy, and the Global X fund gives you some enhanced diversification."

On the face of it, ETF funds of funds look, feel and perform like regular ETFs. But there are differences that are important to understand.

Why buy?

The primary appeal of an ETF fund of funds is to provide a one-stop investing solution that financial advisers can suggest to smaller investors, says Ben Johnson, director of global ETF research at Morningstar in Chicago. Such funds can make life easier for individuals who don't want to spend a lot of time thinking about their investments.

Many individual investors lack discipline when it comes to dealing with their own money. "How many of us have the time to do that in our lives?" says Noel Archard, global head of SPDR products at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. When people get busy, he says, investment management often goes on the back burner.

That said, one-stop shopping may not be as appealing to those with a lot of cash to invest. "Those clients would be paying the adviser a lot of money to purchase a single fund," says Mr. Johnson.

What is inside?

Just because a fund holds other funds doesn't mean it's a good bet. Mr. Johnson says there's always a risk that you get a "salad" fund, which is something like tossing the contents of your fridge into the blender and expecting a delicious meal.

The trick here is for investors to understand thoroughly the methodology behind the ETF fund of funds they are considering.

"I think investors should understand whether there's a thoughtful, coherent overarching objective that is threading these funds together," Mr. Johnson says. "A target-date series or an allocation portfolio would be examples of funds-of-funds that fit this mold; a potpourri of disparate thematic funds would not."

On a positive note, there is a lower likelihood of so-called style drift with an ETF fund of funds than there might be with a similar mutual-fund product. "With style drift, you might buy a value fund and then wake up one day with a growth fund," Mr. Johnson says. That is far less common with ETFs because the vast majority passively track indexes. "They are much more stable," he says.

How much does it cost?

Most ETF funds of funds are constructed using ETFs from the same fund family, which helps keep costs down.

"By having this suite of funds, we can subsidize the fund of funds," says Pedro Palandrani, a research analyst at Global-X in New York, in reference to the firm's Global X Thematic Growth fund. In this case, the annual expenses are 0.5%, which is lower than the gross expenses of some of the individual thematic ETFs in Global-X's stable.

Without the in-house approach, a fund of funds provider would need to charge an "overlay fee," or an extra charge over what the component funds charge, which would make the investment substantially less attractive.

The downside of a fund of funds being constructed from ETFs of the same fund family is that it is rare for all of those funds to be the best in their category. Some may be top performers, while others may be duds.

Could an investor save money by investing in a bunch of individual ETFs on his or her own, instead of buying an ETF fund of funds?

It used to be that funds-of-funds structures helped investors save on transaction costs such as brokerage commissions. Earlier this year, however, many large brokerages decided to eliminate commissions for trading ETFs. As such, a do-it-yourself approach could theoretically save money.

That said, the commissions aren't the only cost incurred when trading ETFs. Bid-ask spreads add to the cost of buying and selling. Larger investors, which include funds-of-fund providers, are often able to get better prices than individual investors who buy and sell in smaller amounts or so-called odd lots.

What are the tax implications?

Regular ETFs are considered tax-efficient for buy-and-hold investors because they track indexes. Indexes don't change frequently, which keeps ETFs' capital-gains distributions low.

Funds of funds, however, have more potential for taxable capital gains, especially if they have to rebalance the component ETFs frequently and those holdings are volatile. For instance, a fund of funds with a mix of 70% small-cap tech stocks and 30% high-yield bonds, which is rebalanced monthly to maintain the target weighting, would likely result in more taxable capital gains.

"Just like any other commingled vehicle with a high turnover strategy, there are more opportunities for a taxable event in the fund, versus a similar strategy with lower turnover," Mr. Archard says.

So far, those fears haven't materialized. Of the 99 ETF funds of funds in the market, only five had realized capital gains, he says.

Investors Are Subdued About a Quantum-Computing ETF; Defiance Quantum ETF has yet to attract a lot of assets. The fund's backers say that is because the technology is in the early stages.

A quantum-computing breakthrough announced by Google in October illuminated the technology's potential and an investment opportunity.

So says Paul Dellaquila, president of Defiance ETFs. The firm's Defiance Quantum ETF (QTUM) tracks the BlueStar Quantum Computing & Machine Learning Index, which is made up of companies involved in quantum computing, along with a number of closely related sectors such as big-data solutions used in machine learning. The $12.4 million fund was up more than 40% for the year to date through November.

In "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-claims-breakthrough-in-quantum-computing-11571843751", researchers claimed that the company's quantum computer generated around one million random strings of numbers in about three minutes, far faster than traditional computers. Defiance ETFs says there are implications for this technology, notably its ability to enhance machine learning that is, enabling computers to effectively learn with data without being explicitly programmed.

The technology is still in the early stages, Mr. Dellaquila says. "We're a little far out before we really see companies' bottom line being impacted, but once we get there, I think it's going to accelerate very, very quickly," he says.

QTUM's relatively low assets under management the fund was launched in September 2018 could be due to a lack of investor knowledge of the area, and the fact that real-world applications are many years away, says Neena Mishra, director of ETF research at Zacks Investment Research. And while the fund has performed impressively, it is slightly behind Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) and Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK), broader and cheaper technology funds that could be more suitable for many individual investors.

However, Mr. Dellaquila says Defiance "does not benchmark our ETFs to broad-based tech; we focus more on providing targeted exposure to disruptive subsectors."

Investing in Funds & ETFs (A Special Report): In Translation --- Alternative Data

The term "alternative facts" has been roundly ridiculed since its introduction into political discourse in 2017. In finance, there is a similar phrase that investors should take seriously: "alternative data."

That refers to proxy metrics or information originating from unofficial or noncompany sources that individuals can use to gain insight into an investment.

When measuring something as nebulous as investor anxiety, for example, you need a proxy because if you survey individuals directly about it, "you may get a fuzzy answer," says David Ranson, research director at financial analytics company HCWE.

Mr. Ranson instead looks at credit spreads, such as the ICE BofAML US Corporate BBB Option-Adjusted Spread, which measures how much more that creditworthy companies must pay compared with the government to borrow.

Some useful metrics come from unofficial sources -- for example, consumer activity on the web. IHS Markit publishes alternative data, including the various purchasing-managers indexes, or PMIs. Investors are able to access to alternative data sooner than official figures.

Similarly, investors can get a reading on a company's health before it reports results. Eagle Alpha of Dublin collects data on consumer transactions, social-media activity and online searches that investors could use, say, to learn how much a streaming service's subscription base has grown or fallen. "Using that gets you inside the boardroom of the company," says Eagle Alpha CEO Emmett Kilduff.

U.S. Venture Firm EIP Hires Former Carlyle Executive to Lead European Expansion; Energy Impact Partners' investors include large utility companies, such as U.K.-based National Grid

Energy Impact Partners is the latest U.S. venture firm setting up a presence outside its home market.

The firm has hired former Carlyle Group LP executive Nazo Moosa as a managing partner to set up an office in London where she is responsible for helping source investments in fast-growing European startups that will benefit from shifts in energy consumption patterns.

EIP also recently opened an office in Cologne, Germany, which is led by fellow new hire Matthias Dill, who also joined as a managing partner.

The firm will be looking to write equity checks of between  ¬5 million ($5.6 million) and  ¬25 million in the businesses it backs in Europe, Ms. Moosa said in written responses to questions.

EIP decided to open offices in Europe to capitalize on what the firm sees as an underserved market for fledgling businesses that need capital to scale internationally or launch new products.

"When we look at Europe, there is even a wider gap developing for companies seeking scale-up capital," Ms. Moosa wrote. "Anecdotally, we can see that not only are there fewer funds to start with but that as the existing growth capital funds become larger and larger, funds that can write cheques in the  ¬5 [million to]  ¬25 million range are becoming fewer and fewer."

EIP is the latest in a wave of U.S. venture firms to expand into new markets in recent months.

As competition for deals in the U.S. market has increased with established players like Sequoia Capital and new entrants including SoftBank Group Corp. raising record funds, more firms are looking farther afield.

New York-based Insight Partners recently opened its first overseas office in Tel Aviv. Lightspeed Venture Partners, another U.S. venture firm, also recently hired an executive to help build out a presence in Europe.

EIP closed its debut fund in 2018 with $681 million, garnering commitments from large utility companies that include the U.K.'s National Grid PLC and Japan's Tokyo Electric Power Co. Holdings Inc.

The firm has been investing the fund from offices in New York; San Francisco; Boston; and Palm Beach, Fla. It targets companies in technologies, services and products throughout the electricity supply chain from generation to consumption.

Although the majority of the firm's investment activities have focused on the U.S., EIP already has completed two deals in Europe in Norwegian analytics company eSmart Systems and Amsterdam-based fleet-management platform ViriCiti.

Ms. Moosa has over 20 years' experience investing in technology companies. She was part of the founding team of Carlyle's European technology investing team before leaving after 12 years in 2013 to set up C5 Capital, a European cybersecurity fund.

Economy
Watch Friday's Jobs Report for Clues on Economy's Trajectory; Bounce in employment is expected to reflect GM workers returning from a strike, while the jobless rate remains stable around historically low levels

The Labor Department will release the November jobs report on Friday, offering a view of the U.S. economy's health as the year winds down. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal expect employers added jobs at a solid pace during the month while unemployment remained historically low. Here is what to watch for in the jobs report, due out Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET.

Strike Bounce

Watch for a bounceback in employment last month as General Motors Co. workers, who were on strike in October, returned to work. Employment in auto manufacturing fell by more than 40,000 in October because of the strike. Economists expect the return of GM strikers to help drive November job growth to 187,000, from 128,000 in October.

U.S. employment growth has cooled this year amid an economic slowdown. Employers added an average 167,000 payrolls each month in 2019, down from an average of 223,000 in 2018.

Under Four

Friday's report is expected to show the November unemployment rate remained at 3.6%, in line with October. The jobless rate has logged in at or below 4% for 20 straight months, the longest such stretch since the 1960s. The historically low rate is a sign that most workers who want a job can land one. The question now is how much further unemployment can fall. This year, it has stabilized between 3.5% and 4%.

Participation

Watch for whether the share of Americans working or seeking work continues to provide juice for job growth. The labor-force participation rate rose in October to the highest level since August 2013. Meanwhile, participation among those in their prime working years between the ages of 25 and 54 reached a 10-year high in October. The rise in labor-force participation is a sign that Americans remain confident in their job prospects. But a large pool of people ready to work may be one factor holding down wage gains.

Sluggish Paycheck

Wage growth is losing momentum compared with early this year, despite the unemployment rate trending near a 50-year low. Economists forecast the jobs report to show average hourly earnings advanced 3% from a year earlier, for the third straight month in November. Stagnating wage growth suggests the labor market isn't as tight as a 3.6% unemployment rate implies, said Indeed economist Nick Bunker. "Employers are still able to fill positions, often without pushing wages too much higher." Pay raises have been higher, however, for nonsupervisory workers. Their wages increased 3.5% from a year earlier in October. Wage growth for workers in certain low-wage industries, such as clothing stores and casinos, has picked up more than in other industries, Mr. Bunker said.

Temporary Slip

Temp-worker hiring tends to jump in the early stages of a recovery and crash as the economy stumbles toward a recession. Lately, it has been looking a little weak. Temporary-help employment peaked in December 2018 and has since fallen in six of the past 10 months. "Although we can only compare to two prior business cycles, this indicator bears close watching," Moody's Analytics economist Maria Cosma said. But this expansion, the longest on record, has shown it isn't always like other business cycles: Tried and true warning signals have set off false alarms during a manufacturing mini-recession from 2015-16 and again more recently amid an uncertain global outlook and another factory slump. Manufacturing's malaise could again be at play. An alternative explanation: With unemployment near a 50-year low, workers have the bargaining power to demand permanent positions.

Happy Friday. Startup Vroom has raised $254 million at a $1.5 billion valuation in a competitive car resale sector. The lead on the deal, Durable Capital Partners, is a newly formed investment adviser founded by T. Rowe Price Group veteran Henry Ellenbogen.

Unbanked fund. Private-equity firm Apis Partners LLP raised $550 million from investors including the International Monetary Fund's pension plan to buy stakes in financial technology companies focused on Africans and Asians with little or no access to banking services, the WSJ's Simon Clark reports. Investors in the fund, which initially sought $500 million, also include Mastercard Inc. and the World Bank Group.

Gen Z market. Overtime Sports Inc. is raising an additional $40 million to fund the startup's quest to attract Generation Z consumers, the next big focus for marketers that cater to young people, The Wall Street Journal's Sahil Patel and Benjamin Mullin report. The company is seeking a valuation of about $150 million, according to people familiar with the matter, but the funding terms haven't been finalized.

Newsletter Exclusive

The sale of Indio Technologies Inc. to private equity-backed Applied Systems will provide a positive return to all of Indio's venture investors, according to an Indio backer.

"The company had raised close to $30 million and everybody made a great return, including the last investors," said Sheel Mohnot, general partner at 500 Fintech, a seed fintech fund. Mr. Mohnot says he was Indio's first investor.

Founded in 2016, San Francisco-based Indio was valued at about $112 million in a Series B round led by Menlo Ventures in May, according to PitchBook Data Inc. Indio's investors also include 8VC, NFP Ventures, Compound and Merus Capital.

The company's technology enables users to apply for commercial insurance online. Applied Systems is owned by Hellman & Friedman, Google's CapitalG, JMI Equity and StonePoint Capital. A spokeswoman for Applied Systems declined to comment on deal terms.

Companies analysis from our sister publication

Buy:Impax Asset Management (IPX)

It is abundantly clear that Impax s sustainable investing mandates are both in demand and delivering for clients, writes Alex Newman.

The past year has been marked by  unprecedented concern globally about environmental issues and rapidly expanding opportunities , in the words of Impax Asset Management s chairman Keith Falconer. It is hard to contest that view. Equally, it is hard to think of a UK-listed financial services group better placed to capitalise on this momentous, even exponential, shift.

As previously disclosed, Impax saw its assets under management climb by 21 per cent to 15bn in the 12 months to September. While all but one of Impax s funds beat their MSCI All-Country World Index benchmark and contributed to the asset rise, the balance came from a number of new mandates. That outweighed a dip in flows to the Pax World business acquired in early 2018, despite big improvements in the performance of its funds.

Two years of growing fee income has also allowed Impax to pay off a $13m (10m) debt facility it signed to fund the Pax deal. Though a revolving credit facility has been retained, a strong cash position has led Impax to adopt a new policy to pay dividends equal to between 55 per cent and 80 per cent of adjusted profit after tax.

Broker Peel Hunt flagged the possibility of upgrades  as the year progresses , but currently expects adjusted earnings of 11.5p per share for the year to September 2020, rising to 12.2p in full-year 2021.

Hold: Reach (RCH)

Analysts at Numis expect Reach to deliver adjusted earnings per share of 39.6p in 2019, against 39.2p a year earlier. With the shares priced at 92p, this gives a forward price to earnings ratio of just 2.3 times, writes Harriet Clarfelt.

Newspaper publisher Reach is no longer in talks to buy certain assets from JPI Media   the entity formerly known as Johnston Press, whose titles include The Scotsman and The Yorkshire Post. Reach had been focusing primarily on JPI's regional assets. It said that while  active discussions    first announced in July   have ended, it will continue to review  on a regular and disciplined basis  those M&A opportunities that would accelerate its strategy. In the same breath, the group said that its trading has been  steady , and remains in line with its expectations. The shares climbed by more than a tenth in response.

For the five months to November 24, revenues fell by 4.4 per cent   better than the 6.6 per cent like-for-like contraction seen in the same period in 2018. Like-for-like print revenues were down 7.3 per cent, while digital rose by 14 per cent   constituting improvements from a fall of 8.2 per cent and a rise of 9.3 per cent respectively. To the latter point, Reach said that good audience growth had encouraged it to extend its network of digital regional brands into new places   with seven  Live  site launches planned for next year.

Analysts had previously given estimates for year-end net debt, but Reach   citing strong cash generation   now anticipates a net positive cash balance as at December 29. No bad thing, given the group s large pension deficit and progressive dividend policy. Overall, management is confident about meeting full-year performance expectations.

On JPI, Reach s chief financial officer Simon Fuller noted that  principally, when we look at acquisition opportunities, we look at the value for shareholders; and we had a price that we considered to be the right price for that set of assets, and we were not uncomfortable walking away if that s wasn t the price that was on the table. 

The same morning that this news was released, the Daily Mail and General Trust revealed that it has acquired the  i    a UK national newspaper and website   from JPI Media for 49.6m. DMGT   whose shares were largely unmoved following its own announcement   noted that in 2018, the  i  generated 11m in cash operating income and operating profits from 34m of revenue.

DMGT said that it was anticipated that the deal would be reviewed by the Competition and Markets Authority. Lord Rothermere   DMGT s chairman   noted that his group was  committed to preserving  the  i s   distinctive, high quality and politically independent editorial style .

Sell:Ted Baker (TED)

The 8 per cent share price plunge that followed the announcement of a considerable overstatement of inventory is aheadache the group does not need, writes Tom Dines.

Ted Baker has started an independent review of its accounts after discovering the value of its inventories had been overstated by around 20-25m over a number of prior years.

While the overstatement will not have a cash impact, it damages the clothing retailer s image, which it has been struggling to rebuild since its founder Ray Kelvin, stepped down in the midst of misconduct allegations in March. Shares dropped in October when the group unveiled an unexpected loss for the six months to August 2019.

The board has appointed law firm Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer, with accountants expected to follow, to carry out a comprehensive review of the issue. The group did not disclose how many years the overstatement applied to and has said it will not comment further while the review is ongoing.

We highlighted growing stock levels as a cause for concern following the group s recent half-year results. It sat at 34 per cent of sales at the time, albeit inflated by the acquisition of its footwear licensee, and had been 37 per cent at the full year.

Broker Peel Hunt said the announcement would be  a bump in the road  for the average business, but  is the latest in a line of setbacks that continue to damage investor confidence  for Ted Baker.

John Hughman:Befriend the trend

Labour s plans to nationalise a chunk of BT have been met with pretty much universal derision.

Nevertheless, as the election draws closer and Labour s polling remains fairly solid, investors are considering what life might look like under a Corbyn government that would also renationalise many other natural monopolies such as rail, post, power and water, some of which form the bedrock of many income investors  portfolios.

National Grid and SSE have already moved some of their operations offshore to thwart any potential grab.

The thinking behind these moves also inspired a sensible question at our seminar held this week on the subject of diversification   how should readers position their portfolios to similarly protect their wealth from the possibility of a statist Corbyn government?

Yet the question also highlights one of the inherent difficulties in building a well-diversified portfolio   that tactical diversification against specific events with binary outcomes is difficult to do, and could be rather dangerous if the outcome we position for does not come to pass. Good diversification is about the long term more than the short, and should always be in place to protect against the many, sometimes unexpected risks that could come along and rock the investment world   across asset classes, geographies and, increasingly, the big investment themes that are disrupting business today.

I am particularly struck by the idea that when determining our portfolio exposures, we should perhaps consider the somewhat radical idea of ripping up the theory of old, and consider an entirely new way of diversifying   in short, aligning our investments with the way the world works and is changing rather than with somewhat esoteric ratios of shares to bonds that we determine according to arbitrary risk profiles and an array of risks we can t accurately quantify.

Themes such as resource scarcity, decarbonisation, longevity, artificial intelligence and robotics, and the growth pivot to Asia offer disruptive threat and opportunity in equal measure and should surely sit at the heart of all investors  long-term thinking.

The problem is that unlike established portfolio theory there are as yet no clear rules as to how to implement thematic diversification. It s a problem we will be exploring in the months ahead, and maybe the trick is to combine the traditional approach to diversification with a thematic overlay   sticking with tried-and-tested asset allocation models but making sure the assets we buy reflect the changing world.

Whatever we conclude, there is no shortage of ways to buy into these world-shaping trends, whether through forward-thinking trusts such as Scottish Mortgage, exciting companies such as Alphabet or Alibaba, or via the proliferation of thematic ETFs. Investors   and capitalism in general   seem to have a lot of enemies at the moment. Trends could offer some much-needed friendship.

Good day! The velocity of private-equity fundraising might best be described as turbo-charged over the past couple of years. Limited partners I've spoken to recently say they have been forced to make some tough choices in deciding how much capital they can allocate to their managers this year. However, one large limited partner is rewarding some of its favorite managers with large commitments. The Minnesota State Board of Investment has approved nearly $1 billion in commitments to private equity and credit funds, as Chris Cumming reports for WSJ Pro Private Equity.

Also in the news, software-focused Thoma Bravo is pursuing yet another acquisition of a publicly traded company. This time, the firm has inked an agreement to acquire publicly traded education software company Instructure Inc. for $2 billion. The company is the latest in a string of public companies that the firm has acquired or sought to buy this year.

Now, onto the news....

Today's Top Stories

Minnesota Pension Manager Pledges $950 Million to Private Markets

Minnesota's pension system is planning a slate of investments in new private-equity funds, including ones from buyout firms Leonard Green & Partners, Vista Equity Partners and Madison Dearborn Partners, WSJ Pro's Chris Cumming writes. The Minnesota State Board of Investment authorized a total of $950 million in new investments with private funds at its meeting Monday. The majority, $550 million, is slated for private-equity managers, with real-estate, private-credit and distressed-debt vehicles also receiving pledges.

Thoma Bravo to Buy Instructure for $2 Billion

Instructure Inc. Wednesday said it agreed to be acquired by private-equity firm Thoma Bravo LLC for $47.60 a share, or about $2 billion, in cash. The purchase price is roughly 10% below Tuesday's closing price of $52.96 for the Salt Lake City education software company, but it represents a 12.2% premium to Instructure's closing price of $42.44 on Oct. 28, before the company announced a strategic review for its Bridge business.

Deals

BSC Capital Partners, an investment affiliate of Nashville, Tenn.-based investment bank Bailey Southwell & Co., said it has backed Shearwater Health, which provides offshore clinical process outsourcing and nurse recruitment services to U.S.-based health-care providers and payers. Shearwater is a portfolio company of New York-based WindRose Health Investors, which originally invested in the company in 2016. WindRose remains an investor in the company. Shearwater is the third investment BSC has made in health-care and tech-enabled services, the firm said in a release. BSC typically co-invests between $500,000 and $3 million at a time in minority and growth-stage health-care and tech-enabled services companies.

LLR Partners has made a $40 million growth investment in Suvoda LLC, a software-as-as-service provider that helps pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies manage clinical trials. The deal is the second that Philadelphia-based LLR has announced this week. Earlier, the firm invested $30 million in Relay Network, which provides customer engagement technology.

Transom Capital Group, a private-equity firm focused on the middle market, has acquired Scantron Corp. Among its services, Scantron provides education assessment capabilities, licensure and certification testing solutions, and survey services to the K-12 education sector and the health-care and financial services industries.

Blackstone has invested 100 million ($131 million) for a minority stake in London-based HH Global, which provides outsourced marketing execution and content development services. Blackstone made the investment through its Tactical Opportunities arm.

Billionaire Steven A. Cohen is close to an agreement to purchase a majority stake in the New York Mets from Fred and Jeff Wilpon, a move that would give the hedge-fund manager control over a prominent baseball franchise that has disappointed fans and struggled with financial pressures in recent years, The Wall Street Journal reported Wednesday.

Exits

IA Financial Corp. agreed to buy private equity-backed vehicle warranty provider IAS for $720 million, a deal that diversifies iA's holdings and helps its "ongoing shift towards a capital-light business," Josh Beckerman writes for Dow Jones Newswires. Genstar Capital bought Austin, Texas-based IAS in late 2011. Quebec City-based insurance and wealth management company iA Financial expects to close the deal in the first half of 2020. It is expected to be neutral to earnings per share in the first year and add to EPS in the second year.

NexPhase Capital LP has entered into a definitive agreement to sell Flexible Architecture & Simplified Technology LLC, or FAST, to Verisk Analytics Inc. NexPhase first invested in FAST, which develops software for the insurance and annuity industry, in 2015. Buyer Verisk is a data analytics and risk assessment firm.

People

KKR & Co. said it is appointing Robert Lewin, a 16-year veteran of the firm, as its new chief financial officer. Mr. Lewin, who will assume the CFO role on Jan. 1, is succeeding outgoing CFO William ("Bill") J. Janetschek, who is retiring from the firm. Mr. Lewin has held a number of positions at KKR since he joined the firm in 2004, including most recently as head of human capital and strategic talent.

Global growth investment firm TA Associates said it has hired Charles Ha as a vice president with its North America technology team, based out of Boston. Mr. Ha was previously a vice president at growth-equity firm General Catalyst and before that held positions with Cisco Systems and North Bridge Growth Equity, now known as Guidepost Growth Equity.

Edison Partners said it has promoted Jennifer Lee to principal at the firm. Ms. Lee is a senior member of the firm's financial technology investment team and a 2018 Private Equity Analyst Women to Watch honoree.

Howard Newman, co-founder and managing partner of private-equity firm Pine Brook, is receiving a lifetime achievement award from the Oil & Gas Council, a global network of executives from the oil-and-gas industry.

Industry News

Barnes and Noble Education Inc. said it will review a range of strategic options for the company. The operator of bookstores for universities and schools on Wednesday said it hired an adviser to help it review various opportunities for the company, including new partnerships, joint ventures or other potential moves, Micah Maidenberg writes for Dow Jones Newswires. The company has received a number of unsolicited inquiries, Chief Executive Michael Huseby said in a statement. The Basking Ridge, N.J.-based company said sales in its fiscal second quarter fell to $772.2 million from $814.8 million a year earlier. Net income fell to $35.9 million, or 74 cents a share, from $59.7 million, or $1.25 a share, last year. The latest quarter ended Oct. 26.

Atlantic Street Capital said it has made progress in its push to bring more gender diversity to the boards of its portfolio companies. The Stamford, Conn.-based midmarket firm has hired or promoted 11 female executives to its portfolio companies and added three women to portfolio company boards. Atlantic Street hired Susan Stautberg as a governance adviser back in 2018 to help improve gender diversity across the firm and its portfolio companies.

Pennsylvania State Employees Retirement System, which managed $29.6 billion in assets as of July 31, has lowered its target allocation for private equity to 14% from 16% at its December board meeting, the pension manager said in a release. The shift is part of a change in the pension system's overall policy allocation mix that also includes an increase in its private credit target allocation to 4%, pension meeting documents show. As of July 31, private equity represented 13.7% of the pension system's portfolio. At the meeting, Penn SERS approved a total of up to $150 million in commitments to two private-equity funds: Clearlake Capital Partners VI LP and Insight Partners XI LP.

Good day. Due-diligence surveys are a good starting point for assessing supply-chain security but can't be the only way companies vet suppliers, report WSJ Pro's James Rundle and Catherine Stupp. Health-care nonprofit Highmark Health delegates basic security checks to a standards body it helped create. Mastercard says surveys are useful if followed by personal interviews.

Also today: More coverage from our conference this week, including lessons from Capital One's breach, how Cox Automotive approaches cloud security, and AI threats such as deepfakes and model hacking.

Supply-Chain Security

Risks from business partners prompt deeper vendor scrutiny. While vendor surveys have long been a favored due-diligence tool for large companies to examine the security posture of supply chains, these provide a limited view, said Omar Khawaja, chief information security officer at Pittsburgh-based nonprofit Highmark Health. Furthermore, it is easy for a supplier to overstate their security provisions on such forms, he added.

"We found that there's almost no ability to really rely on the efficacy of the responses coming through," he said. The effectiveness of due-diligence surveys has been questioned in other industries, including financial services.

At Highmark, Mr. Khawaja knew he wanted to examine suppliers closely, but said assessing thousands of companies isn't feasible.

"If we want to review and assess and evaluate evidence for every single control, that in and of itself could be a $30 million program, because it would probably take us about a month to validate every control for each of those vendors. We can't do that," he said.

What security chiefs learned from the Capital One hack. The bank "mostly did everything correctly" when it came to protecting its cloud assets, said Andy Ellis, chief security officer at Akamai Technologies Inc. But it wasn't enough to prevent the compromise of data belonging to about 106 million of the bank's credit-card customers and applicants. Capital One said a hacker accessed the personal information of customers stored on Amazon Web Services' cloud. The avenue of entry, according to investigators: a poorly configured firewall accessed by a former employee of AWS.

Transition state: What's interesting, suggested Mr. Ellis, is that Capital One was compromised not because it didn't try to protect itself, but because as a hybrid cloud user, it faced a complicated problem in integrating the cloud with its own data centers. It took an insider to exploit the vulnerability, he said. It is hard to get security wrong if a company is 100% cloud or 0% cloud, he said. "People don't design well enough for transitions," he said.

Lines of responsibility for cybersecurity measures are often blurred between companies and their cloud providers, leaving businesses vulnerable to attacks, security experts say. Many companies that used Capital One

as a model for cloud security are now saying, "If it could happen to them, what about us," said Patty Smith, CISO at Cox Automotive Inc., the owner of brands such as Kelley Blue Book. Cox Automotive runs most of its applications in AWS. Ms. Smith said the company worked closely with Amazon to identify security areas that are covered by AWS and those that Cox's own engineers needed to develop or buy from third-party security vendors.

"Application engineers are not trained to be security professionals," Ms. Smith said.

Since the Capital One breach, she said, Amazon has built new security features based on company feedback, including continuous patching of software flaws and automated fixes to misconfigured security settings.

Text-based deepfakes, model hacking among top AI threats. Deepfake videos manipulated using AI to look realistic are a concern for security experts. But a bigger threat comes from fabricated news articles, websites or other text content created by AI, said Camille Franois, chief innovation officer at social-media analytics firm Graphika Inc. "If you can just simply automate believable and engaging text, then it's really flooding the internet with garbage in a very automated and scalable way."

Celeste Fralick, chief data scientist and senior principal engineer at cybersecurity-software company McAfee LLC, is concerned about AI model hacking. Also known as adversarial machine learning attacks, this occurs when a bad

actor attempts to find and exploit vulnerabilities in an AI system. Research by McAfee shows that self-driving cars could easily be tricked into thinking a speed-limit sign has a higher number than was actually posted, she said. "We extended the middle portion of the three, so the car didn't recognize it as 35; it recognized it as 85."

Supply-Chain Risks Prompt Deeper Vendor Scrutiny; Security chiefs say simple questionnaires are no longer adequate

Cybersecurity risks are prompting companies to come up with new ways of assessing the security of their suppliers, security chiefs say, but deep examinations can prove prohibitively expensive.

While vendor surveys have long been a favored due-diligence tool for large companies to examine the security posture of supply chains, these provide a limited view, said Omar Khawaja, chief information security officer at Pittsburgh-based nonprofit Highmark Health. Furthermore, it is easy for a supplier to overstate their security provisions on such forms, he added.

"We found that there's a there's almost no ability to really rely on the efficacy of the responses coming through," he said, speaking Tuesday at the WSJ Pro Cybersecurity Executive Forum in New York.

Levels of scrutiny should vary, said Alla Valente, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. Create a catalog of all suppliers and the data they have access to, she said. Suppliers that process customer data or provide digital components in devices require a higher level of scrutiny, she added.

The effectiveness of due-diligence surveys has been "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cyber-risks-force-banks-to-rethink-vendor-relationships-11570468547", including financial services.

At Highmark, Mr. Khawaja knew he wanted to examine suppliers closely, but said assessing thousands of companies isn't feasible.

"If we want to review and assess and evaluate evidence for every single control, that in and of itself could be a $30 million program, because it would probably take us about a month to validate every control for each of those vendors. We can't do that," he said.

The solution was to move to a common framework from the Health Information Trust Alliance, known as Hitrust. The standards body, based in Frisco, Texas, was "https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122646645329820301" by a consortium of health-care organizations including Highmark.

Using Hitrust lets Highmark delegate basic security checkups, Mr. Khawaja said. The company's contracts require that a supplier be Hitrust-certified. This also ensures that suppliers keep up-to-date on threats.

"Three years ago, four years ago, we probably weren't thinking about controls to protect against ransomware, but we should now. So the Hitrust framework, every year, gets updated a couple of times. Control requirements go up and they change based on the risk associated with the specific context of the organization," he said.

The health-care sector is highly regulated, meaning that regulators are scrutinizing whether companies are making sure their suppliers protect data.

Medical providers make basic mistakes such as failing to have proper business associate agreements, violating the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, said Roger Severino, director of the office of civil rights at the Department of Health and Human Services. HHS collected a record $28.7 million in fines in 2018. The department has issued more than $12 million in enforcement actions so far in 2019, he said.

"They must spell out every condition as to how that entity can use that data, what analytics will be done, what protections are going to be put in place to make sure the data is safe and complies with Hipaa," Mr. Severino said Tuesday during another session at the Pro Cybersecurity event.

Before signing new business agreements, corporate cybersecurity teams should ask potential suppliers which standard frameworks they comply with, said Alan Brill, senior managing director in the cyber risk practice at Kroll, a unit of consulting firm Duff & Phelps Corp.

Questionnaires give companies a written record of their suppliers' statements, which can be helpful in case of legal disputes, Mr. Brill said. But it can take a long time for corporate cybersecurity teams to analyze responses from all of their suppliers. Mr. Brill recommends that businesses ask for certification from a third party such as an accounting firm proving that the supplier complies with some widely used security standard, he said.

Other security executives cautioned against ditching questionnaires entirely. Alissa Abdullah, deputy chief security officer at Mastercard Inc., said these are still useful, as long as they aren't the only source of information.

"I don't necessarily agree that questionnaires and assessments aren't the way to go. We have a vast network of suppliers and so we rely on that as our first point of data collection," said Ms. Abdullah, a former deputy chief information officer at the White House under the Obama administration, speaking on the same panel as Mr. Khawaja.

Ms. Abdullah said her approach is to start with vendor surveys, then follow up with on-site visits. Every supplier for Mastercard, she said, has a relationship with someone in the company who can continuously discuss security arrangements.

AI Helps Humana Pitch Flu Shots to Customers; Natural language generation tool from Persado got more Humana members to open emails and click through

Humana Inc. has employed artificial intelligence to come up with persuasive language in emails sent to customers to encourage more of them to get flu shots and it is seeing higher open and click-through rates.

The Louisville, Ky.-based health insurer serves more than 16 million customers, including four million Medicare Advantage members. Medicare Advantage plans are administered by private insurers. These plans typically offer lower out-of-pocket costs than traditional government-run Medicare in exchange for members using in-network doctors and hospitals.

Seniors are at the greatest risk of coming down with the respiratory illness. Those 65 and older "https://www.wsj.com/articles/one-problem-with-flu-shot-not-enough-people-get-it-11573813801" and 69% of hospitalizations in the 2017-18 season.

The flu season usually peaks between December and February.

Flu shots are an important part of keeping Humana members healthy and lowering health-care costs, said Jennifer Bazante, the company's chief marketing officer. For years, it thought it was doing a good job getting members to take preventive measures, but wanted to see if it could improve its messaging and engagement rates, Ms. Bazante said.

In 2016, Humana started working with New York-based software company Persado Inc., which offers a cloud-based AI tool "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgan-chase-taps-ai-to-make-marketing-messages-more-powerful-11564482606". The following year, Humana decided to use the tool on its flu-shot email campaign.

For the email subject line, Humana employees came up with the phrase "Be sure to protect yourself and your loved ones this flu season." Running that language through Persado resulted in the recommendation that Humana go with "[first name] we're serious about protecting you this flu season."

The changes might seem subtle, but as Ms. Bazante explains, the phrase "we're serious" conveyed a sense that the company was committed to its members' well-being.

The results were significant. The Humana message had an open rate of about 20%, while the Persado message had an open rate of 31%. And more people clicked through. The Persado message had a click-through rate of 0.83%, more than double the rate for the original Humana message, 0.41%.

"We have found, through in other research as well, that the emotional element cause the consumer to respond. It creates a sense of trust," Ms. Bazante said.

The company said it can't yet measure whether more members received flu shots, but it is working on it. Still, the email click-throughs points to members being more engaged in their health, a precursor to behavioral change, it said.

When a Persado customer comes up with wording for a particular campaign, it enters the phrase into Persado's platform. The system analyzes the words to determine their meaning. Persado then uses a form of AI called natural language generation which taps a repository of more than 1 million tagged words and phrases in English, ranked by how well they performed in other client campaigns to create a series of new messages. Those new messages are then tested on real customers.

Persado analyzes the responses clicks, conversions or other engagement metrics and produces a message designed to generate the greatest response. The system can make suggestions in 25 languages.

"We see which elements work better," said Alex Vratskides, Persado's chief executive.

Forrester Research Inc. analyst Brandon Purcell said Persado's offering is unique. Until recently, he said, messaging was left to what marketers thought worked best. "Persado is changing the game by actually creating that content and deciphering which content is going to resonate with which types of customers algorithmically," he said.

Ms. Bazante said the Humana marketing team, which was used to trusting its instincts, needed to get accustomed to using an automated process.

"As you see the performance of those campaigns improved and the response of the members, and the engagement of the members, then it started to be much more easily adopted by other teams," she said.

Humana, which has worked with Persado on more than 40 campaigns, including one promoting prescription refills, is making plans for about 20 more.

Marijuana sector struggles to secure insurance

Tobacco. Premiums

Providers including Berkshire and Aon offer coverage but supply remains restricted

Insurance providers including Berkshire Hathaway and Aon have begun offering coverage to US companies in the legal marijuana industry, which was long off limits for regulatory or reputational reasons.

But investors and executives said many insurers remained cautious, resulting in higher prices. They argued that more widely available coverage was badly needed.

"One of the most miserable things I have to deal with for my job is getting insurance," said Tim Conder, chief operating officer of publicly traded TILT Holdings, a Massachusetts-based group that owns a variety of cannabis-related companies and reported $46m in revenues in the third quarter.

Marijuana is legal for recreational use in Canada and 10 US states, and is either decriminalised or approved for medical use in many others. Every part of the business cultivation, lab testing, distribution and retail sales requires coverage, from general liability to property and workers' compensation.

Reliable numbers on the size of the industry are hard to come by, but legal spending on cannabis in the US was just under $10bn last year while cannabis companies attracted $14bn in funding, according to BDS Analytics, an industry consultancy.

Neil Hitchcock, chief executive of Bermuda-based insurance broker Skyfront, said his estimate was that the legal US cannabis industry would pay about $1bn in annual premiums were it insured to levels normal for other businesses. The demand meant Skyfront was "incredibly busy" but "the problem is the limited capacity to take risk" on cannabis businesses in the insurance market.

He pointed to Lloyd's of London, where members of the market are not permitted to write cannabis insurance in countries where the plant is not legal at a federal level. This rules out working with US clients. The marketplace said it would begin providing cover to Canadian companies last year.

Five years ago, insurance was hardly available to the US industry.

Mr Conder said the situation was improving. Today TILT's operating companies use insurance from both large providers such as Aon and small specialists such as Cannasure.

Others pointed to higher prices as a result of the restricted insurance supply.

"If your business plan includes the word cannabis, expect to pay more," said Kyle Nichols, president at insurance broker Hugh Wood Canada. Even in a country where cannabis is legal, companies in the industry could pay five or even ten times standard rates.

Kyle Kazan, founder of California Cannabis Enterprises, one of the largest US cannabis companies, also has extensive holdings in real estate and said his cultivation facilities in California paid double the insurance premiums required for his pecan farms in Georgia.

It was a challenge to find insurers who understood the industry.

"You don't want your local State Farm agent doing this," he said.

He uses insurers including Berkshire and Kinsale for property and workman's compensation coverage.

He said that obtaining directors and officers coverage, which provides liability cover for senior staff and executives, and car insurance for his distribution operations was a challenge.

Erich Bublitz, who oversees cannabis underwriting at Admiral Insurance, a subsidiary of W.R. Berkley, said his company avoided writing D&O coverage for cannabis groups because of their complex and sometimes opaque ownership structures, as well as the tangle of state and federal regulations. "We don't think there is enough controls in place for us to feel comfortable [writing D&O policies]".

On car insurance he said: "Workers in the industry tend to be users of the product. I'm not saying everyone who is driving is high ... but auto is hard [to underwrite] anyway, and you add in that factor and it becomes too hard."

But Mr Bublitz said he did not think the rates charged to insurance companies were significantly higher than in other industries, and there was increasing competition for business.

"Are [rates] higher than people growing soyabeans? Probably. But there are additional exposures [in cannabis]." He noted that people rarely broke into buildings to steal soyabeans.

Berkshire Hathaway and Aon did not respond to requests for comment.

Another risk that insurers pointed to was the prevalence of cash-based transactions when people bought cannabis products, resulting in significant sums having to be carried by delivery people or held at retail outlets.

Cynthia Cleveland, president of California cannabis group Vertical Brands, said this risk would decline with passage of the SAFE banking bill. If passed, it would make it explicit that federally regulated banks are permitted to work with cannabis companies in states where marijuana is legal.

"Our business welcomes regulation," Ms Cleveland said.

Insurers remain cautious in taking on risk, resulting in higher premiums

Major insurance providers, including Berkshire Hathaway and Aon, have begun to offer coverage to American companies in the legal marijuana industry, which had long been off-limits due to regulatory or reputational reasons.

However, investors and executives say many insurers remain cautious in their approach, resulting in higher prices. They argue that more widely available coverage is badly needed.

 One of the most miserable things I have to deal with for my job is getting insurance,  said Tim Conder, chief operating officer of publicly traded TILT Holdings, a Massachusetts-based group that owns a variety of cannabis-related companies and reported $46m in revenues in the third quarter.

Marijuana is now legal for recreational use in Canada and 10 US states and is either decriminalised or approved for medical use in many others. Every part of the business   cultivation, lab testing, distribution and retail sales   requires insurance coverage, from general liability to property and workers  compensation.

Reliable numbers on the size of the industry are hard to come by but legal spending on cannabis in the US was just under $10bn last year, while cannabis companies attracted $14bn in funding, according to BDS Analytics, an industry consultancy.

Neil Hitchcock, chief executive of Bermuda-based insurance broker Skyfront, estimates that the legal US cannabis industry would pay about $1bn in annual premiums were it insured to levels normal for other businesses. The demand means that Skyfront is  incredibly busy  but  the problem is the limited capacity to take risk  on cannabis businesses in the insurance market, he said.

He pointed to Lloyd s of London, where members of the market are not permitted to write cannabis insurance in countries where the plant is not legal at a federal level   which rules out working with US clients. The insurance marketplace said last year that it would begin providing cover to Canadian companies.

Five years ago, insurance was hardly available to the US industry at all. Things are getting better, stresses Mr Conder. Today TILT s operating companies use insurance from both large providers such as Aon and small specialists such as Cannasure.

But others point to higher prices as a result of the restricted insurance supply.  If your business plan includes the word cannabis, expect to pay more,  said Kyle Nichols, president at the insurance broker Hugh Wood Canada, who added that even in a country where cannabis is legal, companies in the industry can pay five or even 10 times standard rates.

Kyle Kazan, chief executive of Glass House Group, one of the largest cannabis companies in the US, also has extensive holdings in real estate and says his cultivation facilities in California pay double the insurance premiums required for his pecan farms in Georgia.

He said it was a challenge to find insurers who understand the industry.  You don t want your local State Farm agent doing this,  he said. He uses insurers including Berkshire and Kinsale for property and workman s compensation coverage.

He said obtaining directors and officers (D&O) coverage, which provides liability cover for senior staff and executives, and auto insurance for his distribution operations was a particular challenge.

Erich Bublitz, who oversees cannabis underwriting at Admiral Insurance, a subsidiary of WR Berkley, said his company avoids writing D&O coverage for cannabis groups because of their complex and sometimes opaque ownership structures, as well as the tangle of state and federal regulations.

 We don t think there are enough controls in place for us to feel comfortable [writing D&O policies] , he said. On auto insurance, he said,  workers in the industry tend to be users of the product   I m not saying everyone who is driving is high 	. 	. 	. 	but auto is hard [to underwrite] anyway and you add in that factor and it becomes too hard .

However Mr Bublitz does not think the rates charged to insurance companies are significantly higher than in other industries and he believes there is increasing competition for business.  Are [rates] higher than people growing soyabeans? Probably. But there are additional exposures [in cannabis],  he argued, noting that people rarely break into buildings to steal soyabeans.

Berkshire Hathaway and Aon did not respond to requests for comment.

Another risk insurers point to is the prevalence of cash-based transactions when people buy cannabis products, resulting in significant sums having to be carried by delivery people or held at retail outlets.

Cynthia Cleveland, president of the California cannabis company Vertical Brands, pointed out that this risk would decline with the passage of the SAFE banking act, a bill currently in Congress. If passed, the SAFE act would make it explicit that federally regulated banks are permitted to work with cannabis companies in states where marijuana is legal.

 Our business welcomes regulation,  said Ms Cleveland.

Welcome to Due Diligence, the FT s daily deals briefing

FT premium subscribers can click here to receive Due Diligence every day by email.

After a long affair with modern art, Steve Cohen is going downmarket.

The hedge fund tycoon (pictured below) is in talks to buy a majority stake in Major League Baseball s New York Mets, fulfilling a long-held dream to own a major sports team.

It comes just days after the Financial Times brought you the news of Silver Lake s investment in Manchester City owner City Football Group. Sport as an asset class is big business and it s about to get bigger.

Cohen, who runs Point72 Asset Management, already owns an 8 per cent stake in the Mets. The Wilpon family are in talks to sell as much as 80 per cent of the Queens-based baseball team at a $2.6bn valuation.

Mets fans should not be so quick to rejoice at an exit of the Wilpons as they will remain in charge for a time.

Under the sale proposal, Fred Wilpon would remain the  control person  and chief executive for five years, while his son, Jeff Wilpon, would remain in his role of chief operating officer for the same period.

There s a lot of interesting facets to this story, so let us explain.

The Wilpons own the Mets through a vehicle called Sterling Partners after they assumed control back in 2002 when they bought out the publishing company Doubleday.

But the Mets ran into some financial trouble because of investments by Wilpon and Saul Katz, his business partner and brother-in-law, with Bernard Madoff.

The Mets weren t Cohen s first pick in the major league. He first had his sights set on the Los Angeles Dodgers and was widely expected to secure the winning bid. He was trumped at the last minute by Guggenheim Baseball Group, led by Mark Walter of Guggenheim Partners.

In 2012 the Mets reportedly completed the sale of 12 minority stakes in the baseball team, each representing a 4 per cent interest for $20m which is when Cohen first came in. Fellow hedge fund billionaire David Einhorn had previously tried to reach a deal for a minority stake but failed to close.

At the time Cohen s former hedge fund   SAC Capital Advisors   was under investigation by the Southern District of New York. The firm eventually pleaded guilty to insider trading in 2013 and paid $1.8bn in fines.

Other hedge fund managers owning large stakes in sports teams include David Tepper, the founder of Appaloosa Management, who bought the Carolina Panthers American football team last year for about $2.2bn. Marc Lasry, co-founder of Avenue Capital, owns a stake in the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team, while the former hedge fund manager Jeff Vinik owns the Tampa Bay Lightning ice hockey team.

Now Cohen is close to joining the ranks with his very own sports team, but the beleaguered Mets could be seen as a consolation prize next to the Dodgers. Although Cohen, who is worth $13bn, has deep pockets to fund the team.

Ad industry: from mad men to sad men

Companies rely on advertisers to make products more attractive. But advertising agencies have failed to add the same lustre to themselves.

Chief executives at two of the world s largest media groups, WPP and Publicis, face the challenge of making their art relevant in the digital age. They ve got very different ways of doing it.

The old clichs   drinking neat whisky and coming up with one liners on the spot   are out of the window. Technology behemoths such as Google and Facebook have forced ad agencies to shift their focus to more, shall we say, boring aspects, like data and tech.

Arthur Sadoun, who took the lead at Publicis in 2017 (pictured top right), is investing in the firm s own data and technology to help brands  take back control  of their customer relationship. It s a service Publicis thinks clients will prize more highly.

Mark Read, on the other hand, who took on the top job at WPP just over a year ago (pictured top left), thinks owning first-party data  is not a nirvana . He s trying to steady a listing ship, paying down debt, selling data assets and trying to bring closer the traditional and digital wings of the WPP empire.

One investor who spoke to the FT s Alex Barker and Harriet Agnew for their look at the industry put it like this:

Sadoun is  a prisoner of the margin target  while Read, by contrast, had  slashed the margin and lowered expectations, which makes life easier at the start .

The two ad empires were constructed through relentless dealmaking by their once all-powerful predecessors, Sir Martin Sorrell at WPP and Maurice Lvy at Publicis.

With the advent of the internet, expansion efforts ran aground and advertisers have struggled to compete with the fast-growing business of digital advertising.

Still, Sadoun plans to press on with acquisitions   notably the $4.4bn takeover of the digital marketing agency Epsilon in April, which followed the acquisition of digital consultancy Sapient in 2014.

Meanwhile, his predecessor Sir Martin is fighting claims that he slapped the face of one of his old WPP protgs.

Was Cristiano Ronaldo worth it?

Cristiano Ronaldo is one of the best footballers of all time. But at 33, the Portuguese striker (pictured below) was well past his peak when Juventus paid  ¬100m (plus  ¬12m in fees) for him to join from Real Madrid in the summer 2018.

With the first season of his four-year contract over, FT Alphaville s Claire Jones took a look at whether the deal for the star footballer was good value for money?

As our colleague Murad Ahmed wrote last year, La Vecchia Signora   or The Old Lady of Turin as Juventus is known   paid not only for Ronaldo s skills with the ball, but for his brand.

Sponsorship and advertising revenues have indeed shot up, along with shirt sales and the club s followers on social media.

On the pitch, however, the results are mixed.

After helping knock them out of the Champions League in the quarter finals during his final year in Spain, Ronaldo was unable to take Juventus any further this time around. A big flop that saw the Italian club miss out on as much as  ¬35.5m in prize money alone.

The U.S. nonfarm private sector added 67,000 jobs in November, missing economists' expectations by a wide margin.

Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal were expecting the ADP National Employment Report to show an addition of 150,000 jobs.

Large and midsize businesses reported the largest increase in new jobs, adding 27,000 and 29,000 jobs, respectively. Small businesses, with 49 or less employees, added 11,000 jobs.

"The job market is losing its shine," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, in prepared remarks. "Job openings are declining and if job growth slows any further unemployment will increase."

The ADP Research Institute collaborates with Moody's Analytics to produce the monthly report.

The job gains were all in the service-providing sector, which added 85,000 jobs. The education and health sector added 39,000 jobs, the most added in a category on the services side. The worst industry performer in the services group was trade, transportation and utilities, which lost 15,000 jobs.

The goods-producing sector lost 18,000 jobs, reporting job losses across the board in natural resources and mining, construction and manufacturing.

The U.S. Labor Department will release its U.S. employment numbers and unemployment rate for November on Friday.

Good day. With the U.S. population aging, elder care is a growth industry. Still, building startups in the sector isn't easy due to heavy competition. A new startup is taking on this challenge.

Meanwhile, venture investment in health-care startups in the Rocky Mountain region is rising as startups in the sector there mature and the region's universities encourage more life sciences entrepreneurship.

Plus, venture-backed startup Genius Media Group Inc. is suing Google over alleged anticompetitive behavior related to music lyrics.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Mountain ventures. Rocky Mountain states are home to startling natural beauty, giant national parks and, increasingly, health-care startups, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports.

* Medical venture-capital investment in the region has reached new highs as maturing startups have drawn investors from across the nation and as universities have encouraged more life sciences entrepreneurship, according to investors and executives there.

* Investment in the Mountain States Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming is poised to reach $1 billion for the third straight year, with $792.6 million deployed across 49 venture rounds through Sept. 30, according to VentureSource.

* Mountain State companies still face challenges akin to those of other startups not based in California or the Northeast, including a shortage of local investors able to lead large, expansion-stage financings and the need to look outside the region for certain skilled professionals.

* But these companies also are using their location to their advantage, luring workers and investors from the coasts to the area's outdoor attractions and lower cost of doing business.

Elder care. A pair of investor-entrepreneurs are looking to make a go at a market that has challenged other technology startups: elder care, WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova reports.

* Farron Blanc, who previously invested in startups such as life insurance provider Fabric Technologies Inc. and launched new business lines at Reinsurance Group of America, has teamed up with Ajay Rajani, an angel investor and founding executive at lending startup Tala, to establish Gerry Care Inc.

* The startup, which helps match seniors with assisted living communities, wants to bring more transparency and new services to the large long-term care market.

* Gerry collected $3.75 million in seed financing on the idea and its founders' pedigree earlier this year, even before it launched the business. Core Innovation led the round, with Equal Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, 8VC, Kapor Capital and Sure Ventures participating.

Lyrical battle. Five months after it accused Google of publishing lifted song lyrics, music website Genius Media Group Inc. is suing the search giant over what it alleges amounts to anticompetitive behavior that has harmed its business, The Wall Street Journal reports. The lawsuit, filed in state court in Brooklyn, N.Y., on Tuesday, seeks $50 million in combined minimum damages from Google and LyricFind, a Canadian company that provides the music lyrics. Genius is backed by investors including Andreessen Horowitz.

Mobile play. LLR Partners invested $30 million in mobile customer engagement company Relay Network LLC, WSJ Pro's Laura Cooper reports. The firm joins existing backers including First Round Capital, NewSpring Capital and Actua.

China's fake-meat market. Beyond Meat Inc. and Impossible Foods Inc. are considering China as their next big market for plant-based meat products, but local startups aim to leverage their own knowledge of Chinese tastes to gain an edge over the U.S. companies, The Wall Street Journal reports.

Black Friday in the black. American shoppers increased their spending by 16% over the five-day shopping period between Thanksgiving Day and Cyber Monday, The Wall Street Journal reports, signaling U.S. consumer confidence hasn't wavered in the face of global political and economic uncertainty.

Exits

ServiceTitan, a provider of software to home-services businesses, acquired WaterSoftWare, a provider of business management services to the water treatment industry, for an undisclosed sum. Last year, Glendale, Calif.-based ServiceTitan landed $165 million in Series D funding at a $1.65 billion valuation from Index Ventures, Battery Ventures, Bessemer Venture Partners, Iconiq Capital and others.

Content experience platform Uberflip acquired SnapApp Inc., which helps marketers create personalized interactive experiences, for an undisclosed amount. Uberflip, of Toronto, is backed by Updata Partners. Boston-based SnapApp counts Providence Equity Partners as a backer.

On-demand industrial parts marketplace Xometry Inc. purchased European peer Shift for an undisclosed amount. Gaithersburg, Md.-based Xometry secured $50 million in Series D funding in May from investors including Greenspring Associates, Dell Technologies Capital, BMW i Ventures, Foundry Group, GE Ventures, Highland Capital Partners, Maryland Venture Fund and Almaz Capital.

Launchmetrics, a provider of influencer relationship management tools, bought visual content creator and distributor IMAXtree. Terms weren't disclosed. New York-based Launchmetrics raised $50 million from Bpifrance, Seventure, Cipio Partners and Famille C in September 2018.

VC Funds

Liquid Stock has closed its debut private company liquidity fund, Liquid Stock Fund I, at $161 million. Sixpoint Partners placed the fund. Liquid Stock, with offices in San Francisco and Los Angeles, provides liquidity to employees and stockholders of privately held companies. Backers of the fund include Goldman Sachs Asset Management, Morgan Stanley AIP and Coller Capital.

Crescendo Venture Partners held the first close on its latest fund, which is targeting $80 million to $100 million. The fund will invest in early-stage Israeli software startups in fields such as big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning with an emphasis on software that transforms traditional sectors such as agriculture, education, construction, health care and industry. To date, the new fund has led a Series A investment in last-mile logistics startup Lightico.

San Francisco-based Commerce Ventures closed its third fund with over $60 million in commitments, more than double the amount raised for its previous fund. Limited partners include strategic individuals and corporate investors. Commerce Ventures III LP will continue to make early-stage investments in the retail and financial services sectors.

Hello. The WSJ Pro Cybersecurity Executive Forum tackled complex issues on Tuesday, including the role of artificial intelligence in fighting cybercrime, the insecurity of the Internet of Things and what doesn't work in securing a corporate supply chain.

Don't miss our coverage of the National Security Agency's forthcoming guidance on cloud security, by WSJ Pro reporters James Rundle and Catherine Stupp. Another highlight: Equifax and Norsk Hydro executives describe the chaos in the aftermath of cyberattacks on the two companies.

In the coming days, we will bring you more coverage of the many discussions from Tuesday. Stay tuned. In the meantime, check out the @WSJCyber Twitter feed and our website for video, images and other material from the conference.

Cloud Security

NSA to issue updated cloud security guidance. The National Security Agency, amid a series of attacks that have targeted service providers in recent months, is fine-tuning advisories that will describe attack methods used by nation-state and advanced hackers and will lay out methods to counter them.

"We'll be coming out with an unclassified advisory on the techniques used to compromise clouds and some mitigation advice," said Anne Neuberger, director of the NSA's Cybersecurity Directorate, speaking at the WSJ Pro Cybersecurity Executive Forum in New York on Tuesday.

The guidance, due out this month, is based in part on the NSA's own experience with cloud computing, she said.

Despite benefits such as cost, using the cloud can also carry risks. "If you want to steal research and development from multiple entities, you can compromise one managed service provider and accomplish a lot more from an espionage perspective," Ms. Neuberger said.

Read the entire story.

Post-Attack Clean Up

Equifax, Norsk Hydro executives describe chaos after attacks. Cyberattacks often cause pandemonium and the cleanup can take far longer than the public thinks, say executives from companies that have suffered hacks.

Jo De Vliegher, chief information officer at Norsk Hydro AS, described the initial moments after the Norwegian aluminum and energy company became infected with ransomware in March as "pure chaos."

Speaking on the same panel at the WSJ Pro Cybersecurity Executive Forum on Tuesday, Jamil Farshchi, chief information security officer of Equifax Inc., said that the effects of a cybersecurity incident can stretch out for months. Mr. Farshchi defended Equifax's response to its breach. "You can armchair quarterback any breach and the response. I think Equifax actually did a great job in responding to this situation," he said.

Norsk Hydro and Equifax faced very different public reactions to their attacks.

Read the entire story.

Big Number

$124 Billion

Global spending on data security efforts in 2019, according to estimates from Gartner Inc. That is up from $114 billion last year.

More From the Conference

Businesses use AI to thwart hackers. Companies are racing to improve products and services with artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and other emerging technologies, stoking fears that data is becoming more vulnerable to hackers. But rather than impeding the pace of innovation, these concerns are prompting many corporate security chiefs to accelerate the development of advanced capabilities, in a bid to turn the tables on attackers by better detecting the misuse of data and keeping it safe.

Like a hacker: "Artificial intelligence is a backbone of security initiatives," Camille Franois, chief innovation officer of social-media analytics firm Graphika Inc. Among other applications, AI is being used in cyberattack modeling, where smart tools identify security vulnerabilities in simulated breaches or hacks, Ms. Franois said. The strategy is to approach your own systems like a hacker, she added.

Omar Khawaja, chief information security officer at Highmark i Health, said supplier security questionnaires aren't accurate. "No better than a coin toss. Half the data is inaccurate."

Nasrin Rezai, global chief information and product security officer at General Electric Co., said many third-party suppliers "are below the poverty line when it comes to cybersecurity."

Christine Izuakor, senior manager of global security strategy and awareness at United Airlines, said that women are 50% of the cyber staff there, and minorities nearly as much. It took two to three years of concerted effort to reach those numbers.

Kevin McNamee, director of threat intelligence at Nokia, said that Internet of Things devices often are set up with no antivirus, no firewall. "They're just sitting there."

Tech blurs lines for public and private systems

Healthcare Digital tools and advice websites have changed how we engage with healthcare, writes Carly Minsky

Hamstrung by tight regulation, legacy technology and sluggish working processes, many public health systems lag the latest innovations emerging from the healthcare start-up community.

The UK's National Health Service acknowledged this in 2015 when it aimed to foster and implement technology-driven tools through a start-up accelerator programme. Last year it launched a tech funding scheme.

According to Will Gibbs, a health expert at British venture capital firm Octopus Ventures, economic pressure within the US private market is a differentiator for technology innovation compared with the NHS. "In the US ... you see greater take up of innovation [than in the UK] as each hospital group competes with each other," he says.

But the distinction between innovation in the private healthcare sector and public systems is becoming blurred as health tech start-ups look to sell their services directly to consumers in private markets, while also rolling them out within publicly-funded systems.

Ideally, innovation spanning the public and private healthcare spheres would take the best of both worlds: risk management and safety protections from public sector innovation, while working to commercially-driven timeframes and targets.

In practice, some instances of NHS partnerships with tech start-ups have imported the disadvantages of private sector healthcare innovation into the public sector sphere, including loosely regulated direct-to-consumer marketing, lower standards of clinical evidence and unequal access to resources.

According to a report by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics, two tech trends are driving the shift towards a consumerist approach in healthcare: the rise of internet-based medical services; and increasingly personalised advice from algorithms and data from wearable technology and genetic testing.

Digital tools have changed how people engage with healthcare through services such as advice websites, health statistic monitoring apps, and NHS digital services for health records, symptom checking and appointment-booking.

However, with these advances come concerns about the reliability of new technologies and of personal information. The Nuffield report notes that private providers "are using all the technologies of modern marketing, not merely to respond to consumer demand, but also to reshape such demand to create and sustain a market".

Start-ups and private providers are able to offer low-cost, personalised services online using innovations in cloud computing, big data, artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies. They have more direct access to consumers through marketing technology including Google keyword targeting and personal data from online records.

Technological advances such as online genetic test results or recommendations from health monitoring apps are putting pressure on public health systems. The report says that unreliable results from online services can cause anxiety and confusion among patients, undermine the authority of doctors and burden public health systems with unnecessary follow-up tests in-person, according to Nuffield's research.

Philippa Hodgson, director of NHS services at online medical start-up Push Doctor, says these advances are changing patient expectations of what they should receive when using healthcare tools. She particularly worries about start-ups that are not bound by the NHS Quality Care Commission standards and can provide, for example, prescriptions for antibiotics more freely or recommend unnecessary tests. Instead of fairly distributing healthcare resources, new technology tools might contribute to antibiotic resistance, heighten demand on resources and create unrealistic expectations when patients are using NHS services, Ms Hodgson says.

"There is a huge expectation that comes from consumers using a private platform; you have paid for an interaction so you expect to get something tangible from it, whether that is a prescription or a referral. It's something we need to deal with as more people use a combination of private and public medical services," she adds.

Sensyne Health , a publicly listed healthcare technology company , uses a "partnership model" to work with the NHS alongside pharmaceutical companies. It hopes to sell its healthcare management tools for diabetes, lung disease and heart failure to private US healthcare providers.

The approach, says Paul Drayson, chief executive, meets the challenges and tensions of new technology employed across private and public healthcare contexts. Patient data are strictly protected and held within the NHS, but insights derived from this data using AI are applied for innovation and drug discovery in the private sector.

Public sector patient data, such as NHS records, are more inclusive and representative of the whole population than data from, for example, private insurance companies or tech groups such as Google and Amazon, says Lord Drayson.

Sensyne advocates funnelling returns back into the NHS through its public listing and using profits to subsidise the provision of free tools to the NHS.

Lord Drayson says: " We need to ensure the returns of investment in healthcare technology are also delivered back to the public."

Banking & Finance: Fidelity Names a New Funds Chief

Fidelity Investments' asset-management chief will retire in February, the latest change at a business under pressure to adapt to investors' appetite for low-cost funds.

Steve Neff, a 23-year Fidelity veteran who spent most of his career in technology roles, was tapped in 2018 to lead asset management, the division that oversees the firm's stock and bond pickers. He will leave the firm a little more than a year later, Abigail Johnson, Fidelity's chief executive, wrote Tuesday in a memo to employees.

Mr. Neff will be succeeded at the Boston-based financial firm with Bart Grenier, an executive at Fidelity International Ltd., Fidelity's sister company in London, Ms. Johnson wrote. Mr. Grenier, 60 years old, had held a variety of roles in the business before leaving Fidelity for a post at Deutsche Bank AG's money-management arm. He ran another asset manager, The Boston Co., until he returned to Fidelity in 2017.

Mr. Grenier will take over a business that is racing to meet individual investors' growing preference for low-cost index portfolios. Like many peers, Fidelity struggled to stem the loss of client money from its actively managed funds, which decades ago powered rapid growth at the firm.

And while Fidelity's diverse collection of businesses, which includes online brokerage and back-office services for wealth managers, have insulated the firm from the full impact of the fund outflows, the losses have crimped profit margins.

Fidelity oversaw more than $2.8 trillion in assets as of Sept. 30, including some $2.3 trillion in actively managed funds.

"Bart is the ideal candidate to succeed Steve," Ms. Johnson wrote. In her memo, Ms. Johnson called Mr. Neff an "inspirational leader" who leaned on his experience as Fidelity's former technology chief to help expand the money-management unit's use of cloud computing and artificial intelligence.

Mr. Neff, who will be 68 when he retires, had approached Ms. Johnson recently with his desire to step away and spend more time with his adopted school-age son, a person familiar with the matter said.

Mr. Neff had succeeded Charles Morrison as asset-management chief. A former bond manager, Mr. Morrison retired in October 2018. Earlier that year, Fidelity moved the longtime head of its equities division, Brian Hogan, into a new role and tabbed Pam Holding and Tim Cohen as co-heads of the stock-picking unit.

Customer- Analytics  Startup Gong.io Raises Series C Round; Latest round of $65 million led by Sequoia Capital

Business-analytics startup Gong.io Inc. has raised $65 million in part to expand the use of its enterprise software to departments across companies that are looking for ways to use artificial intelligence.

Based in San Francisco, Gong.io sells subscriptions to software that enables businesses to gain insights on sales transactions, among other services. The company's software connects to a customer's communications systems, including phone and email, and records, transcribes and uses artificial intelligence to comb interactions for insights on what works and what doesn't.

The financing comes as companies are increasingly aiming to use AI to gather and make use of ever-finer data to improve operational efficiency.

Through the first nine months of the year, 965 AI-related U.S. companies raised $13.5 billion in venture capital, which is on pace to best the $16.8 billion that 1,281 companies raised in 2018, according to a third quarter report by the National Venture Capital Association and PitchBook Data Inc.

Since it was founded in 2015, Gong has signed on more than 700 companies as customers, including Autodesk Inc., General Electric Co. and LinkedIn Corp.

For instance, Gong's software suggested that salespeople for point-of-sale systems startup TouchBistro Inc. should mention hardware elements before software. Gong's AI determined more deals were closed when salespeople pitched the business in that order, according to Gong co-founder and Chief Executive Amit Bendov.

Gong's software also could determine whether the salesperson is talking too much relative to others on phone calls, Mr. Eschenbach said.

Sequoia Capital led the new funding round, a Series C, with participation from existing investors Battery Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners, Cisco Investments and others. Sequoia Partner Carl Eschenbach joined Gong's board as part of the deal.

The capital will go toward the company's product, engineering and go-to-market teams as Gong continues to broaden the software's applications. More than half of Gong's customers have already applied the software to its customer service, marketing and product teams, and Gong is aiming to hasten the expansion, Mr. Bendov said.

Sequoia's Mr. Eschenbach said that in researching the deal, he noticed a shift in salespeople's views of the software over the past year. While some salespeople were initially wary of the oversight abilities the software gave their managers, they now view it as a valuable tool, he said.

Gong previously raised a roughly $40 million Series B in January. With the new round, the company has raised $134 million in total funding.

Portag3 Ventures, a financial technology-focused venture capital arm of Sagard Holdings, said it has closed its second fund with 427 million Canadian dollars ($321 million).

Portag3 Ventures II LP closed at around four times the size of a debut fund that wrapped up with about C$100 million in 2016.

The Toronto-based firm raised capital for the new fund from a list of Canadian institutions that include pension managers Caisse de dpt et placement du Qubec and Public Sector Pension Investment Board, financial institutions Alterna Savings and Credit Union Ltd., Laurentian Bank, National Bank of Canada and Equitable Bank as well as insurers Intact Financial Corp. and La Capitale Insurance and Financial Services.

The fund also attracted capital from investors outside of Canada, including French investors Aviva France and CNP Assurances and Israeli insurance group Harel Insurance & Finance.

This time around, Portag3 is targeting larger investments in startups it backs than it did with its previous fund, typically 10% to 20% ownership stakes, it said in a news release late last year when it held an initial closing for the new fund. The firm focuses on companies across a range of subsectors, including digital wealth management, insurance, personal and small business finance, as well as applications of technologies like artificial intelligence for the financial sector.

So far the firm has backed 17 startups, according to a press release. They include a recent investment in Diagram Ventures, an investment platform that co-launches companies in the financial technology and insurance industries.

Portag3 Ventures is part of an expanding number of investment affiliates of Sagard, an "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sagard-more-than-half-way-to-500-million-goal-for-new-credit-fund-1516293927" of Power Corp. of Canada. The investment firm had "https://sagardholdings.com/news/sagard-holdings-announces-us-545-million-subsequent-closings-of-sagard-credit-partners/" for its debut credit fund as of October 2018. Earlier this year, it "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sagard-taps-ex-cppib-professional-to-lead-health-care-royalty-push-11546897005" Sagard Healthcare Royalty Partners, which backs typical health-care royalty deals as well as financing for commercial-stage drugs or medical devices through credit and credit-like structures.

Corrections & Amplifications

Africinvest and Cathay Innovation didn't participate in Migo's $20 million Series B round. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the listed firms as new investors in the company.

Good day. A new fund managed by Portag3 Ventures is targeting financial-technology startups. So far the firm has backed 17 startups and is part of a growing number of investment affiliates of Sagard, an investment subsidiary of Power Corp. of Canada.

Meanwhile, Sequoia Capital led a $65 million bet on artificial intelligence-based customer analytics startup Gong.io Inc. as more companies turn to AI to leverage data.

Plus, investors backed biotechnology startup IFM Therapeutics LLC's business strategy, which has led to two deals this year.

And now on to the news...

In the News

New fintech fund. Portag3 Ventures, a financial technology-focused venture capital arm of Sagard Holdings, said it has closed its second fund with 427 million Canadian dollars ($321 million), WSJ Pro's Laura Kreutzer reports.

* Portag3 Ventures II LP closed at more than four times the size of the firm's debut fund, which wrapped up with about C$100 million in 2016.

* The Toronto-based firm raised capital for its new fund from a list of Canadian institutions that include pension managers Caisse de dpt et placement du Qubec and Public Sector Pension Investment Board, financial institutions Alterna Savings and Credit Union Ltd., Laurentian Bank, National Bank of Canada and Equitable Bank as well as insurers Intact Financial Corp. and La Capitale Insurance and Financial Services.

* Portag3 is targeting larger investments in startups than it did with its previous fund, aiming for 10% to 20% ownership stakes.

Customer analytics funding. Business-analytics startup Gong.io Inc. has raised $65 million in part to expand the use of its enterprise software to departments across companies looking for ways to integrate artificial intelligence, WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian reports. Sequoia Capital led the Series C round, with participation from existing investors Battery Ventures and others. Gong's software connects to a customer's communications systems and records, transcribes and uses AI to find insights on what works and what doesn't.

Biotech capital. Venture capitalists invested $55.5 million in entities launched by biotechnology startup IFM Therapeutics LLC, betting on a business strategy that has led to two deals with Novartis AG this year, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. Boston-based IFM develops drugs that modulate the innate arm of the immune system to treat diseases. It houses each drug program in its own subsidiary. This way, a corporate partner can strike a deal to acquire access to a specific drug program without taking on nonstrategic assets.

Loan startups. Silicon Valley venture capital is funding a wave of fintech startups in India that use data from borrowers' cellphones to collect on debts in ways that are illegal in both India and the U.S., WSJ's Newley Purnell and Justin Scheck report. The startups are providing much-needed credit in India, where consumer lending has been limited by a lack of credit scores and by banks that are reluctant to make personal loans. While the newcomers' tactics are illegal, they are ignored by Indian regulators who want to encourage lending, according to analysts and company insiders.

Exits

Publicly traded Tenable Inc. acquired industrial cybersecurity provider Indegy Ltd. for an undisclosed amount. New York-based Indegy was backed by investors including Liberty Technology Venture Capital, O.G. Tech Ventures, Magma Venture Partners, Vertex Ventures and Aspect Ventures.

VC Funds

Accel raised $550 million for its sixth India fund. The early-stage investor's fifth Indian fund closed in 2016 with $450 million, while its fourth fund collected $325 million the prior year.

Aberdeen Standard Investments has raised at least $156.9 million so far for Aberdeen Venture Partners XI LP and a related offshore vehicle, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The amount the firm has raised so far for the venture-focused fund of funds is more than three quarters of the way toward a $200 million offering amount indicated in the latest filing and exceeds a $150 million offering amount indicated in an earlier SEC filing last year.

New York diversity-focused firm Harlem Capital closed its inaugural fund at $40.3 million, more than $15 million over its original target. Limited partners included TPG, State of Michigan Retirement Systems, Vanderbilt University, the Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation, W.K. Kellogg Foundation, Consumer Technology Association and Dorm Room Fund. Harlem Capital Partners Venture Fund I LP has invested in eight companies so far including gig economy job marketplace Jobble, pet wellness platform Wagmo and feminine hygiene products startup Aunt Flow.

Credit Unions Get More Ambitious

By Ben Eisen

Jason Lugo shopped around for a loan when he bought a boat this summer, but no one offered him as good a deal as University Federal Credit Union.

The Austin, Texas, construction contractor took home a $42,000 Yamaha AR195 and a 78-month loan with no money down. The credit union gave him a roughly 5% interest rate, far less than what others offered.

"You don't get boat loans like that," said Mr. Lugo, who switched other accounts to the credit union after growing disenchanted with Wells Fargo & Co. a few years ago.

Credit unions, long seen as a humdrum corner of consumer finance, are going toe-to-toe with the biggest financial institutions. Credit unions' assets have grown at nearly twice the pace of banks' over the past decade, and the cooperatives are buying small banks in record numbers. One recently partnered with Google on its plans to create a checking account.

Credit unions are owned by their members and are designed to return their profits in the form of lower borrowing costs and higher deposit rates. They are exempt from paying federal income taxes.

They are using their newfound financial heft to compete aggressively for business. Dozens of them dole out loans for boats and recreational vehicles. Others are getting into cannabis banking. Some went big on problematic loans backed by taxi medallions.

Economists and analysts are uneasy about how these bulked-up credit unions will fare in a recession. In another financial crisis, some could fail or shrink, stranding borrowers who prefer not to use banks. In a worst-case scenario, taxpayers could be saddled with the losses.

"They are making lots of loans with high-risk features," said Karen Petrou, co-head of Federal Financial Analytics, a regulatory advisory firm that has researched credit unions for the banking industry. "They always tried to be George Bailey's bank and they're not anymore."

Credit unions point out that even the largest cooperatives are small compared with the major banks. The entire industry collectively holds less in deposits than JPMorgan Chase & Co. They acknowledge that credit unions now offer loans for items that aren't typical of a not-for-profit, but they said credit unions don't usually offer anything that banks don't.

Credit unions have historically been built around a "common bond," meaning members work for the same company, live in the same place or share another characteristic. Regulators have been loosening the rules about who can join for years.

The growth in credit unions is driven by a relatively small number of the biggest institutions. The median-size credit union nearly quadrupled its assets between 2005 and 2019, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. But many small credit unions have closed shop or been acquired over the past decade, and the majority have 10,000 or fewer members.

Proponents said the growth doesn't undermine the fundamental business model. While banks that are publicly traded must balance the priorities of both customers and shareholders, at credit unions those two stakeholders are one and the same.

Credit unions currently charge lower average rates than banks for home-equity lines of credit and personal loans, according to personal-finance website Bankrate.com. They charge slightly higher average rates for new-car loans.

Credit unions have existed in various forms since the early 1900s, but they began to flourish when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a law during the Great Depression that formally created a federal system for them.

After the financial crisis of 2008, as numerous new regulations were imposed on banks, credit-union regulators in some ways took a more hands-off approach.

For example, one of the most significant postcrisis regulations for credit unions, a set of stricter capital requirements, keeps getting delayed. The industry has lobbied against the rule. The new rule would raise capital requirements for the biggest credit unions, updating the current rule, which has been in place since 2001.

The head of the industry's federal regulator, the National Credit Union Administration, said the entire credit-union system currently is capitalized above what is required.

Credit unions pay into a deposit insurance fund, similar to banks, and the NCUA has said the fund currently has the ability to absorb losses far beyond its worst year on record, in 2009.

"We have in place a very robust examination and supervision model," said NCUA Chairman Rodney Hood. Mr. Hood was appointed to the post this year by President Trump, a Republican.

Many credit unions have ramped up auto lending over the past several years as some banks have pulled back, essentially betting that consumers will keep paying for their cars even if the economy turns. Credit unions now make nearly a third of U.S. auto loans, compared with 23% in 2008, according to an industry lobbying group.

Many of the loans are negotiated by dealerships, where the credit union isn't directly involved in hammering out the loan terms with the customer.

A large share has terms of six years or more, which are more likely to leave borrowers owing more than their cars are worth. The NCUA office found that credit-union auto loans are "higher quality" than bank auto loans.

Heard on the Street
Bloomberg 2020: The Buyout, Not The Candidate --- Were the financial-data company to do a deal, it would be a momentous event for investors

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]

When most people think about a race for Bloomberg, they probably have in mind Michael Bloomberg joining the Democratic primary. But investors might imagine something else entirely: the race for his eponymous financial-data giant, Bloomberg LP.

Speculation has ramped up about what Mr. Bloomberg's political future means for his company. So far, that isn't clear. The Wall Street Journal has reported that Mr. Bloomberg, if nominated or elected, would likely move control of his stake in the company into a blind trust. Mr. Bloomberg, who is 77 years old, has speculated that he could consider selling the company were he elected, partly as a consideration of his age. A spokesman for Bloomberg LP says: "The company is not for sale."

Regardless of Mr. Bloomberg's political fortunes, however, another reason for investors to spend time thinking about this is that it is a great time to do a deal in financial technology. Valuations of Bloomberg's peers in trading and data have soared, giving them lots of firepower. Revenues are up. Deals are getting done by the bucketload. Bloomberg's arguably closest peer, Refinitiv, notably has made the big strategic leap to combine with an exchange, the London Stock Exchange Group.

Bloomberg LP could be the biggest such transaction of them all, both in size and strategic terms. Its primary business is collecting subscription fees on computer terminals used by banks, hedge funds, asset managers, insurers and others. Features and products, such as trading, flow from that terminal relationship.

Burton-Taylor International Consulting, a unit of brokerage firm TP ICAP that tracks the financial-data sector, figures that there were about 330,500 terminals active in 2018, each costing about $25,000 a year, representing the bulk of roughly $10 billion in Bloomberg LP's estimated total revenue. On that, Burton-Taylor estimates the firm earns a roughly 37% profit margin, giving it something approximating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $3.8 billion.

So what would Bloomberg LP be worth? Refinitiv, which sells a competing terminal and has data and trading assets, was acquired by LSE at an enterprise value of about 13 times Ebitda. Using that multiple, Bloomberg could have an enterprise value of $50 billion.

There are arguments why the multiple should be even higher, such as Bloomberg's even more central role on Wall Street with its chat function; or lower, because it might be harder to break out and sell any chunks that fetch a higher multiple. But without public financial statements to peruse, guesswork is required.

Using Refinitiv's deal as a guide, there are a couple of obvious partners: exchanges CME Group and Intercontinental Exchange, known as ICE.

CME, with a market value of $73 billion, could buy all of Bloomberg LP for stock and still take Mr. Bloomberg out of a controlling position (he is said to own slightly less than 90% of Bloomberg LP).

ICE is smaller, valued at $52 billion. But it may be a more natural strategic fit. ICE in 2015 acquired a fixed-income data business, Interactive Data, that competes with Bloomberg LP, and both firms are major players in the fast-evolving electronic bond-trading market -- something for which investors are willing to pay rich multiples. Those overlaps may be reasons to do a deal. They might also be reasons not to, perhaps for antitrust reasons.

Another logical set of partners would be other financial-data companies, especially if Bloomberg wanted to remain independent of any major exchange. Part of its value may lie in independence now that Refinitiv has partnered up.

S&P Global, for example, at $65 billion in market value, has sufficient size, and has continued to expand beyond its ratings business, including acquiring SNL Financial, a data and analytics provider.

IHS Markit, which like Bloomberg LP is a key cog in Wall Street's derivative business, is valued at just under $30 billion. A deal with it, or with a smaller exchange company such as Nasdaq or MarketAxess Holdings, would require some cash if Mr. Bloomberg is looking to avoid having a controlling stake.

If cash matters, there is always private equity. Refinitiv's prior owner, Thomson Reuters, sold a controlling stake to Blackstone Group before the LSE deal.

One can also dream of technology companies such as Amazon.com or Microsoft, which are increasingly integrated into financial-data flows with their cloud units.

But it is a leap to actually owning the data itself or the regulated parts of Bloomberg LP, such as its brokerage.

Perhaps Mr. Bloomberg won't make any headway in a crowded primary and this will all be moot. But that would be no fun for investors.

If you're there, introduce yourself to me, cyber reporters Catherine Stupp and James Rundle and other members of the WSJ Pro Enterprise Tech team. We love to meet our readers. Or follow the festivities on Twitter @WSJCyber and via the hashtag #wsjcyber.

Also today: DHS advice for Cyber Monday; unauthorized Uber drivers; proposed U.S. federal privacy law; and Facebook's disinformation "correction notice."

WSJ Pro Cybersecurity Conference

WSJ Pro Cybersecurity is hosting an executive forum Tuesday in New York, where speakers will dissect how global security problems affect business. The agenda is packed.

Look for coverage throughout the day on our website and our @WSJCyber Twitter account, or via the hashtag #wsjcyber.

Anne Neuberger, director of the Cybersecurity Directorate at the National Security Agency, will discuss how geopolitical events often drive surges in cyberattacks against the U.S. public and private sector. Large companies are caught in the digital crossfire.

We plan to live-stream our session with technology leaders from Equifax and Norsk Hydro, who will discuss their companies' recovery from cyberattacks. The Equifax breach affected an estimated 150 million U.S. consumers. At Norwegian aluminum and energy company Norsk Hydro, a ransomware attack disrupted operations for weeks. Look for the live stream @WSJ on Twitter.

Executives from Mastercard and Highmark Health will share how they secure their supply chains, and leaders at General Electric and Nokia will delve into their plans to deal with a new frontier of risk, the Internet of Things.

Quantum computing, heavy-duty biometrics and other new technologies will force businesses to rethink risk mitigation. Experts will offer guidance on how to start.

Also on the agenda: the year in hacks, the limits of cyber insurance when nation-states launch digital attacks, and how business travelers can avoid security risks.

London's decision to revoke Uber Technologies Inc.'s operating license opens a window into what drivers say has been a relatively common practice of sharing or renting out driver accounts at a number of ride-hailing apps, the WSJ reports. Several drivers for Uber and other ride-hailing apps, in London and elsewhere, say the practice of account sharing is an open secret, discussed in private groups on social media or on messaging apps used by drivers. Uber says account sharing is an issue globally, including in the U.S.

Unauthorized drivers: Account sharing "is a dirty little secret" among American drivers, said Bryant Greening, co-founder of LegalRideshare LLC, a personal-injury law firm in Chicago representing Uber and other ride-share drivers nationwide.

'Nefarious' reasons: People who rent accounts and cars from Uber drivers do so in most cases because they lack a driver's license, would likely fail a background check or can't afford a car, said Harry Campbell, a former Uber driver and author of the Rideshare Guy blog. "Usually the reasons are nefarious," he said. Transport for London, the city's main transportation regulator, said last week it determined 14,000 Uber rides in late 2018 and early 2019 weren't conducted by authorized drivers, but by others who had been able to substitute their photos to use a real driver's account.

Ordered by Singapore, Facebook posts a correction. Facebook Inc. added a "correction notice" to a post that Singapore authorities alleged contains false information, becoming the first technology company to comply with a new law the government says is meant to curb fake news, the WSJ reports.

The notice: Appearing near the bottom of a post from earlier this month, the notice reads, "Facebook is legally required to tell you that the Singapore government says this post has false information." The government had ordered the notice Friday on the post, which alleges authorities had made a wrongful arrest. The government said no such arrest had been made. News Corp, owner of The Wall Street Journal, has a commercial agreement to supply news through Facebook.

Senate Democrats float privacy bill, but bipartisan deal remains elusive. The bill led by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D., Wash.), the top Democrat on the Senate Commerce Committee, aims to give consumers more say over information collected about them online and would impose new responsibilities on companies to prevent privacy violations. Big companies across various industries want a federal privacy bill to pre-empt California's privacy law, which goes into effect Jan. 1. They say setting state-by-state rules for online privacy will raise costs, the WSJ reports. Ms. Cantwell said talks with Republicans will continue and she hopes the bill will serve as Democrats' starting position in more detailed negotiations.

Why fintechs are flocking to Lithuania; Pixpay and the digital natives; RBS launches B

Vilnius has issued licences to more than 100 fintech companies

The opportunity cost from Brexit is not always obvious. But in fintech terms, one only needs to look at Vilnius to see how others are benefiting from the UK s likely exit from the EU.

The Lithuanian capital may not be home to any large fintech unicorns such as Adyen in the Netherlands or Klarna in Sweden. But Vilnius is the second-largest centre in the EU for fintech measured by the number of regulated companies.

It has issued licences to more than 100 fintech companies, many of which are looking to set up a base in the EU to keep their passporting rights to operate across the bloc after the UK has left.

One of those is Revolut, the British digital bank which obtained a banking licence last year from Lithuania.

 We have invested quite significantly into the country and it s a significant hub for us,  Richard Davies, Revolut s chief operating officer, told fintechFT.

Revolut has both banking and e-money licences in Lithuania, and 100 staff. Mr Davies said that after moving Lithuanian customers across to its new licences this year it would transfer those from other EU countries next year. It will also launch credit products in Lithuania next year, before rolling them out elsewhere later.

Mr Davies was one of the speakers at Lithuania s flagship industry conference, Fintech Inn, which attracted more than 3,000 people last week to Vilnius, making it one of the biggest gatherings in the sector in Europe.

Alexander von Schirmeister, executive vice-president for Europe at UK-based mobile credit card reader unicorn SumUp, said:  The arrival of Brexit forced us to look at how we wanted to operate across Europe. The willingness for the Lithuanian government to become a fintech hub and how all the authorities work together to make it a receptive environment have been important. 

Lithuania originally saw fintech as a way of disrupting its banking industry, dominated by Scandinavian lenders seemingly unwilling to invest in new technology.

The Bank of Lithuania, the central bank in this country of just 2.8m people, introduced a regulatory sandbox just as Brexit suddenly made the country attractive, not just to European fintechs. Companies from Israel, Singapore, and China have all gained licences as Vilnius positions itself as a fintech gateway to the EU.

Marius Jurgilas, in charge of supervision and payment systems at the Bank of Lithuania, said:  Our strategy has not been built on targeting UK companies. We want to be an integral part of the global economy. 

A sign of that ambition could be glimpsed last week as Vilnius hosted a meeting of central and eastern European countries and China alongside the conference. Mr Jurgilas said one of the aims was to boost trade between the region and China, a pioneer in fintech, in part by using fintech to cut costs for small businesses.

Monika Rimkunaite-Bloze, chief executive of Lithuanian mobile payments provider MoQ, said:  There are a lot of Chinese entrepreneurs who are interested. There s a big potential to replicate successful Asian products in Europe and adapt them to the needs of instant mobile payments here. 

But there is concern among some about Beijing s intentions, especially after Chinese interest in the crucial Lithuanian port of Klaipeda sparked pushback from several ministers in Vilnius. Vilius Sapoka, Lithuania s finance minister, said the goal was not to attract investment from China but to  share best practice, and discussions about what could be global solutions to common challenges  such as money laundering and data protection.

Financial crime is a sensitive issue in Lithuania. Dirty money from Russia has been behind a number of scandals in neighbouring Estonia and Latvia recently and affected several Lithuanian banks a decade and more ago.

Lithuanian authorities claim they are monitoring the risks from the recent influx of fintech companies carefully.  We are not naive 	. 	. 	. 	It s about business, but also not jeopardising our strategic objectives as a country,  said Mr Jurgilas.

Quick fire Q&A

Company name:Pixpay

When founded:January 2019

Where based: Paris

CEO: Benoit Grassin

What do you sell, and who do you sell it to: Pixpay is a financial tool for digital natives with parental oversight, featuring a Mastercard and two apps.

How did you get started:We were astonished that there is no suitable value proposition for teens in Europe as far as banking is concerned.

Amount of money raised so far:  ¬3.1m

Valuation at latest fundraising: n/a

Major shareholders: Benoit Grassin, Nicolas Klein et Caroline Mnager, co-founders; Global Founders Capital

There are lots of fintechs out there  what makes you so special:Pixpay has a mission to help teens be good with money and get financial confidence in an increasingly cashless society.

FT seasonal appeal: turning to technology to beat the poachers

Wireless cameras, artificial intelligence and cloud computing are all helping conservationists in the increasingly sophisticated battle against animal poachers. The Zoological Society of London, this year s seasonal appeal partner, is at the forefront of these endeavours, working with companies like Google and Microsoft in developing new technology to support conservation projects in places like Kenya and Thailand. For more on this year s seasonal appeal gohere. To donate gohere.

Further fintech fascination

New frontiers:RBS, the UK state-backed lender, has launched a new digital bank in an effort to compete with the likes of Monzo and Starling, reports the Financial Times. Called B (apparently a reference to the Danish for  live well ), the new initiative works on a separate IT system to the bank s NatWest and RBS brands. B is one of a series of digital innovations from RBS designed to see off threats from start-ups and improve efficiency.

Follow the money: Alibaba s financial technology unit, Ant Financial, has launched a $1bn investment fund to back start-ups. The fund will focus on providing later stage funding. Ant Financial s vice-president Ji Gang told a conference in Beijing that it had invested in 160 companies over the past five years.

New frontiers (2): Klarna, the Swedish fintech, says it has signed up 60,000 new merchant partners this year including H&M, Microsoft and Abercrombie & Fitch,reports Business Insider. That is more than double the number registered last year. The company, which organises invoicing and money collection for retailers, says it has now partnered with 190,000 retailers around the world.

Stumbling blocks: Can fintech help the world s poor,asks FT Alphaville. The idea is frequently used by new fintech initiatives, most recently Facebook s Libra. But research published by the Bank for International Settlements is inconclusive. While payment innovations have driven down remittance costs, the research found evidence that fintech can widen the gap between rich and poor.

AOB:The head of one of Switzerland s oldest private banks, Lombard Odier, says that tech disruption does not threaten the market s leaders; Cuvva, an insurtech specialising in pay as you drive motor insurance, has raised 15m ahead of the launch of a pay monthly insurance product next year; Peer to peer lender Zopa is finalising a 130m capital raising,reports Sky News.

Risk Managers Grapple With Potential Downsides of AI; Most risk managers in financial services say they aren't capable of assessing the risks associated with artificial intelligence , according to a survey from Accenture

Corrections & Amplifications

Eleven percent of risk managers say they are capable of assessing the risks associated with AI, according to a recent survey from Accenture. A previous version of this article incorrectly said 11% of risk managers aren't capable of assessing AI-related risks. (Dec. 3)

A blind spot for risk managers in financial services is itself becoming a risk: Few say they have the know-how to properly analyze the potential downsides of artificial intelligence.

AI has been used for years to make "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-artificial-intelligent-investor-ai-funds-beckon-1509937622", but financial services companies more recently have begun exploring "https://www.wsj.com/articles/use-a-landline-that-could-help-you-get-a-loan-from-discover-11551695400" in "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-helps-auto-loan-company-handle-industrys-trickiest-turn-11546516801", "https://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-take-the-hint-from-regulators-and-test-ai-to-spot-criminals-11547150262" and other areas. That has created a new challenge for risk managers, requiring them to understand how algorithms work and identify potential pitfalls with how the technology is applied, executives said.

Risk managers are grappling with a fear of the unknown. AI hasn't been adopted at a large scale and the unintended consequences aren't fully documented, according to Steve Culp, senior managing director for finance and risk at management consulting firm Accenture PLC. "Before there were ships," he said, "we never had shipwrecks."

Eleven percent of risk managers in banking, capital markets and insurance say they are fully capable of assessing AI-related risks, according to a survey of 683 risk managers in nine countries released this week by Accenture. Respondents expressed a similar comfort level with assessing the possible downsides associated with blockchain technology, quantum computing and other emerging areas of technology.

Citizens Financial Group Inc. is one of many lenders exploring new ways to use AI. In contrast to others in financial services, the bank says it has spent several years developing internal controls to ensure it has a handle on AI-related risks.

Citizens is exploring potential uses for AI in customer-facing lines of business, including using algorithms to expedite decisions on consumer loans, according to Malcolm Griggs, chief risk officer of the Providence, R.I.-based bank.

Part of the bank's effort to bolster its AI-related controls has involved hiring several employees within the risk-management division who have advanced degrees in statistics and computer science, Mr. Griggs said.

Citizens also has developed an internal review process to ensure that risk managers understand both how the bank's algorithms work and the quality of the underlying data, according to Mr. Griggs. The risk-management division is also responsible for conducting back-end tests to ensure that the bank doesn't run afoul of fair-lending rules or other regulations, he said.

"We're constantly looking at ways to advance our automation so that we can provide more accurate decisions and faster decisions," Mr. Griggs said. "But in doing so, we have to be really, really careful."

How Credit Unions Outgrew Their Down-Home Reputation; Credit unions' assets have grown more rapidly than banks' over the past decade

Jason Lugo shopped around for a loan when he bought a boat this summer, but no one offered him as good a deal as University Federal Credit Union.

The Austin, Texas, construction contractor took home a $42,000 Yamaha AR195 and a 78-month loan with no money down. The credit union gave him a roughly 5% interest rate, far less than what others offered.

"You don't get boat loans like that," said Mr. Lugo, who switched other accounts to the credit union after growing disenchanted with Wells Fargo & Co. a few years ago.

Credit unions, long seen as a humdrum corner of consumer finance, are going toe-to-toe with the biggest financial institutions. Credit unions' assets have grown at nearly twice the pace of banks' over the past decade, and the cooperatives are "https://www.wsj.com/articles/credit-unions-go-on-bank-buying-spree-11567515601" in record numbers. One recently "https://www.wsj.com/articles/next-in-googles-quest-for-consumer-dominancebanking-11573644601?mod=hp_lead_pos3".

Credit unions are owned by their members and are designed to return their profits in the form of lower borrowing costs and higher deposit rates. They are exempt from paying federal income taxes.

They are using their newfound financial heft to compete aggressively for business. Dozens of them dole out loans for boats, jet skis and recreational vehicles. Others are getting into cannabis banking. Some "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ubers-rise-presses-taxi-lenders-1445471757" on problematic loans backed by taxi medallions.

Economists and analysts are uneasy about how these bulked-up credit unions will fare in a recession. In another financial crisis, some could fail or shrink, stranding borrowers who prefer not to use banks. In a worst-case scenario, taxpayers could be saddled with the losses.

"They are making lots of loans with high-risk features," said Karen Petrou, co-head of Federal Financial Analytics, a regulatory advisory firm that has researched credit unions for the banking industry. "They always tried to be George Bailey's bank and they're not anymore."

Credit unions point out that even the largest cooperatives are small compared with the major banks. The entire industry collectively holds less in deposits than JPMorgan Chase & Co. They acknowledge that credit unions now offer loans for items that aren't typical of a not-for-profit, but they say credit unions don't usually offer anything that banks don't.

Credit unions have historically been built around a "common bond," meaning members work for the same company, live in the same place or share another characteristic. Regulators have been loosening the rules about who can join for years.

The growth in credit unions is driven by a relatively small number of the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-military-credit-union-grows-with-no-speed-limit-1533121200". The median-size credit union nearly quadrupled its assets between 2005 and 2019, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. But many small credit unions have closed shop or been acquired over the past decade, and the majority have 10,000 or fewer members.

Proponents say the growth doesn't undermine the fundamental business model. While banks that are publicly traded must balance the sometimes-competing priorities of both customers and shareholders, at credit unions those two stakeholders are one and the same.

Credit unions currently charge lower average rates than banks for home-equity lines of credit and personal loans, according to personal-finance website Bankrate.com. They charge slightly higher average rates for new-car loans.

Credit unions have existed in various forms since the early 1900s, but they began to flourish when President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a law during the Great Depression that formally created a federal system for them. They gained fervent followings. The treasurer of a Hawaii credit union was "https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=umn.31951d03592402k&view=1up&seq=5" while trying to rescue records in an airplane hangar during the Pearl Harbor bombing.

After the financial crisis of 2008, as numerous new regulations were imposed on banks, credit union regulators in some ways took a more hands-off approach.

For example, one of the most significant postcrisis regulations for credit unions, a set of stricter capital requirements, keeps getting delayed. The industry has lobbied against the rule. The new rule would raise capital requirements for the biggest credit unions, updating the current rule, which has been in place since 2001.

The head of the industry's federal regulator, the National Credit Union Administration, said the entire credit-union system currently is capitalized well above what is required. Credit unions pay into a deposit insurance fund, similar to banks, and the NCUA says the fund currently has the ability to absorb losses far beyond its worst year on record, in 2009.

"We have in place a very robust examination and supervision model," said NCUA Chairman Rodney Hood. He said the capital rule has been delayed to give the regulator more time to consider various changes.

Mr. Hood was appointed to the post this year by President Trump.

NCUA regulators said this year they would examine whether the industry is overly concentrated in specific loan products. The NCUA Office of National Examination and Supervision said the regulator "does not see large concentrations of high-risk activities," such as subprime credit, among the bigger credit unions.

Many credit unions have ramped up auto lending over the past several years as some banks have "https://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-pull-back-on-car-loans-as-used-auto-prices-plummet-1493816356", essentially betting that consumers will keep paying for their cars even if the economy turns. Credit unions now make nearly a third of U.S. auto loans, compared with 23% in 2008, according to an industry lobbying group.

Many of the loans are "https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-seven-year-auto-loan-americas-middle-class-cant-afford-their-cars-11569941215", where the credit union isn't directly involved in hammering out the loan terms with the customer.

A large share have terms of six years or more, which are more likely to leave borrowers "https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-45-000-loan-for-a-27-000-ride-more-borrowers-are-going-underwater-on-car-loans-11573295400". Credit unions made roughly half the loans that had terms of 76 months or longer in 2018 and 2019, according to credit-reporting firm TransUnion.

The NCUA office found that credit union auto loans are "higher quality" than bank auto loans.

Golden 1 Credit Union, based in Sacramento, Calif., is the sixth-biggest U.S. credit union by assets, and Chief Executive Donna Bland said the firm wants to grow assets, loans and deposits by 10% on average annually over the next five years. In 2015, Golden 1 paid more than $100 million for the naming rights to the new Sacramento KingsNBA arena for 20 years.

Golden 1 has just about quadrupled its car-loan business over the past decade, and its portfolio of new- and used-car loans now accounts for more than half its loans. Ms. Bland said the credit union isn't worried about concentration, in part because consumers usually pay down their auto loans faster than real-estate debt.

Still, Golden 1 tightened its standards this year. For 84-month auto loans, it will typically lend no more than 10% above the value of the car.

"We are in the business of taking risk with our members," Ms. Bland said. "And we manage that quite well."

Sberbank takes stake in AI transport start-up

State-run Sberbank, Russia's largest lender, is expanding its high-tech offering through a new investment in driverless cars with AI transport start-up Cognitive Technologies, the bank said yesterday.

Sberbank will take a 30 per cent stake in Cognitive Pilot, a joint venture led by Cognitive Technologies chief executive Olga Uskova and majority-owned by the start-up's top management.

The new company will "develop digital economy projects in transportation, agriculture, computer vision and artificial intelligence," Sberbank said.

Moscow-based Cognitive Technologies has partnered with companies including Hyundai, Russia's railway monopoly and agribusiness Rusagro to develop technology for self-driving cars, trains and industrial equipment.

Sberbank did not disclose the amount of the investment or the valuation of the joint venture.

The deal marks Sberbank's latest move away from banking into a digital "ecosystem" that chief executive Herman Gref says is vital to diversifying away from financial services.

Sberbank has spent more than $1bn on new companies including a taxi and food delivery joint venture with Mail.ru, digital media company Rambler and grocery delivery company Instamart.

It also indicates Sberbank plans to intensify competition with search giant Yandex after agreeing last week to hand over a "golden share" in the company to a new Kremlin-backed non-profit foundation. Yandex, Russia's leading selfdriving car developer, has driven its vehicles more than 1m miles in Moscow and Tel Aviv, and received a licence to begin tests in the US next summer.

The companies have fought over the direction of Yandex Market, their ecommerce joint venture, so badly that they have discussed changing its capital structure to give one side clear control.

Asset management. Research reform

Banks battle to stay relevant with fresh information sets, charticles and podcasts

Dealmakers, traders and globetrotting executives are the public face of the modern investment bank but, for many clients in fund management, the key point of contact is with banks' less glamorous ranks of analysts.

That investment research business is going through a profound reshaping. New investing strategies, regulations, commercial pressures and technology are forcing a rethink of what analysts do, how they do it, and the ways their work is distributed to clients.

"Everything is changing, so investment research has to change as well," said Lou Pirenc, global head of research data at investment bank Morgan Stanley.

The immediate impetus is Europe's Mifid II regulations, which forced asset managers in the region to pay directly for research rather than subsidising it by routing trading orders through banks.

Given the practical difficulty of divorcing European from global operations, many asset managers have adopted this unbundling of research fees as practice everywhere.

Having to pay directly for analysis has triggered a rethink on how much research they consume, which has washed over research departments at investment banks like a tsunami including in the US.

"Not only has unbundling impacted US money managers, it is in the process of changing the whole nature of investment research," Tabb Group, a markets consultancy, said in a report.

Other, broader trends are having as big an impact on research.

Asset management has evolved over the past decade, with the rise of cheap, passive index-tracking funds and computer-driven strategies, and investment groups that primarily work in private markets rather than public ones.

That is a challenge for analysts that have historically focused on producing stock tips, economic research and fixed income strategy for old-fashioned investment managers.

Bank of America has set up a dedicated ETF strategy team to meet the demand.

"The rise of passive investing in particular has changed what clients want, and we need to respond to that," said Candace Browning, head of research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.

Analysts are increasingly turning to data science to cater to computerdriven investors, who seek to meld it with traditional fundamental investing, as well as a broader group of corporate clients.

Analysts sift through non-traditional information such as satellite imagery and credit card data, or use artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning and natural language processing to glean fresh insights from traditional sources such as economic data and earnings-call transcripts.

"If all you're doing is traditional fundamental analysis, it's not enough any more," said Joyce Chang, chair of research at JPMorgan.

Almost every bank is exploring how newer technology can enhance their analysis or even become a separate business line.

An example is UBS's Evidence Lab, which last year was split off from its research department as a unit that collects, cleans and sells data to clients independent of its primary research offering.

"It's a significant moment," said the head of data at one major asset manager. "It's the start of a profound change of what the sellside is."

Evidence Lab is far from the only such effort in the industry, though operating as a separate business is unusual.

It was itself initially modelled on Morgan Stanley's AlphaWise, a unit of about 100 data scientists, coders and analysts.

"Analysis used to be very opinionoriented," said Mr Pirenc. "Now everyone wants the raw info.

It's about analysing it better."

For now, verbose reports remain the bread and butter of an investment bank analyst. But the form of the content is evolving.

These days, reports are often shorter and punchier, and research can come in the form of videos, charticles, live events and podcasts and all are also distributed through social media and messaging apps.

"We have to adapt to the times," said Dan Dowd, head of research at UBS. "I want to deliver content to clients in the way our clients want to consume it."

Distribution is increasingly focused on pulling readers in rather than pushing content out. Rather than emailing research and praying it gets opened, many banks have built up personalisable research portals.

More content is now made public. The websites of most big investment banks look more like those of think-tanks.

Some money managers will still privately question the value of analysts, arguing that many of the best have migrated from banks to investment managers and that the remaining ones are overworked and prone to groupthink.

But questions over the worth of analysts are nothing new.

"Is Wall Street research useless?" the magazine Institutional Investor asked in the late 1960s. Yet over the years, asset managers have continued to spend their time their most valuable resource poring over the research produced by investment banks.

"The evolution of capital markets has put investment research departments in a tricky position," Ms Browning said. "The industry has changed dramatically in how it's done and distributed. But what has not changed is the fundamental job: coming up with great ideas."

The nation's derivatives regulator is filing more enforcement cases in tandem with criminal prosecutors, creating a more muscular approach to deterring wrongdoing in the markets it oversees.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission during the 2019 fiscal year filed a record 16 enforcement actions alongside related criminal charges, the agency said this week in its annual enforcement report.

Coordination between the CFTC and criminal prosecutors has been on the rise for several fiscal years, with the agency filing 14 parallel actions during 2018 and two in 2017, the report said.

A big reason for the upswing: The agency has strengthened its relationship with the U.S. Justice Department, sharing information on cases in which it spots potential criminal activity. Doing so has enabled the CFTC to send a stronger message to the companies it regulates, and to the individuals those companies employ, lawyers said.

"There is no bigger deterrent to misconduct than the risk of going to jail," said Anne Termine, a former CFTC enforcement attorney who now works for law firm Covington & Burling LLP.

The director of the agency's enforcement division, James McDonald himself a former federal prosecutor has highlighted the benefits of the increased coordination for both agencies. The CFTC's specialized expertise and deep knowledge of market data enable it to identify potential criminal conduct that others wouldn't otherwise catch, he told attendees of a legal conference in New York in September.

The agency recently pointed to its coordination with the Justice Department in a case in which two traders and one former executive at JPMorgan Chase & Co. were "https://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-charges-three-traders-over-alleged-metals-contracts-manipulation-11568646947"with spoofing, a type of illicit trading. The CFTC filed a related civil enforcement action against the traders.

Download the report here

* "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/CFTCReport_112719.pdf"

Coordination between the CFTC and Justice Department ramped up after the financial crisis, when the agencies both pursued cases that involved manipulation of the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/last-wave-on-libor-cftc-likely-to-charge-multiple-banks-for-rate-rigging-1455300947", or Libor, according Ms. Termine, who worked on those cases.

The CFTC's overall enforcement over the fiscal year was robust, according to the report. The agency filed 69 enforcement actions, collecting more than $1.3 billion in penalties, disgorgements and restitution, it said.

The report outlined several the CFTC's priorities, including a focus on corporate compliance and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cftc-says-enforcing-risk-management-rules-is-a-priority-11570060413" and data-reporting regulations. In October, the agency for the first time charged a bank with violating rules that require financial institutions to establish internal controls for overseeing data reporting for swap dealers.

One way the agency spots potential misbehavior in the market, including spoofing, is by analyzing the information it receives from the financial institutions it regulates, said Michael Spafford, a partner in the investigations and white-collar defense practice at law firm Paul Hastings LLP.

The CFTC in its report said it was engaged in a multiyear project to enhance its ability to root out misconduct through the use of data analytics. A significant increase in cases involving manipulative conduct was directly tied to those efforts, the agency said.

"I think this reflects that data is king," Mr. Spafford said.

Banks battle for audiences with new information sets,  charticles  and podcasts

Dealmakers, traders and globe-trotting executives are the public face of the modern investment bank, but for many clients in fund management, the key point of contact is with banks  less glamorous ranks of analysts.

That investment research business is now going through a profound reshaping. New investing strategies, regulations, commercial pressures and technology are forcing a rethink of what analysts do, how they do it and the ways their work gets distributed to clients.

 Everything is changing. So investment research has to change as well,  said Lou Pirenc, global head of research data at investment bank Morgan Stanley.

The immediate impetus is Europe sMifid II regulations, which forced asset managers in the region to pay directly for research rather than subsidising it by routing trading orders through banks.

Given the practical difficulty of divorcing European from global operations, many asset managers have adopted this  unbundling  of research fees as practice everywhere. Having to pay directly for analysis has triggered a rethink on how much research they consume, which has washed over research departments at investment banks like a tsunami   including in the US.

 Not only has unbundling impacted US money managers, it is in the process of changing the whole nature of investment research,  Tabb Group, a markets consultancy, said in a recent report.

Other, broader trends are having just as big an impact on research. Asset management has evolved dramatically over the past decade, with the rise of cheap, passive index-tracking funds and computer-driven strategies, and investment groups that primarily work in private markets rather than public ones.

That is a major challenge for analysts who have historically focused on producing stock tips, economic research and fixed-income strategy for old-fashioned investment managers. Bank of America has even set up a dedicatedETF strategy team to meet the demand. Candace Browning, head of research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said:  The rise of passive investing in particular has changed what clients want, and we need to respond to that. 

Analysts are also increasingly turning to cutting-edge data science to better cater to computer-driven investors, who seek to meld it with traditional fundamental investing, as well as a broader group of corporate clients.

Nowadays, analysts sift through non-traditional information such as satellite imagery and credit card data, or use artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning and natural language processing to glean fresh insights from traditional sources such as economic data and earnings-call transcripts. If all you re doing is traditional fundamental analysis, it s not enough any more,  said Joyce Chang, chair of research at JPMorgan.

Almost every bank is now exploring how newer technology can enhance their analysis, or even become a separate business line. A good example is UBS s Evidence Lab, which last year was split off from its research department as a unit that collects, cleans and sells data to clients independently from its primary research offering.

Deal with start-up Cognitive Technologies marks latest venture away from banking

State-run Sberbank, Russia s largest lender, is expanding its high-tech offerings through a new investment in driverless cars with AI transport start-up Cognitive Technologies, the bank said on Thursday.

Sberbank will take a 30 per cent stake in Cognitive Pilot, a joint venture led by Cognitive Technologies  chief executive Olga Uskova and majority-owned by the start-up s top management.

The new company will  develop digital economy projects in transportation, agriculture, computer vision and artificial intelligence,  Sberbank said.

Moscow-based Cognitive Technologies has partnered companies including Hyundai, Russia s railway monopoly, and agribusiness Rusagro to develop technology for self-driving cars, trains and industrial equipment.

Sberbank did not disclose the amount of the investment or the valuation of the joint venture.

The deal marks Sberbank s latest venture away from banking into a digital  ecosystem  that chief executive Herman Gref says is vital to diversifying away from financial services.

Sberbank has spent more than $1bn on new companies including a taxi and food delivery joint venture with Mail.ru, digital media company Rambler, and grocery delivery company Instamart.

It also indicates Sberbank plans to intensify competition with search giant Yandex after agreeing last week to hand over a  golden share  in the company to a new Kremlin-backed non-profit foundation. Yandex, Russia s leading self-driving car developer, has driven its vehicles more than 1m miles in Moscow and Tel Aviv, and received a licence to begin testing them in the US next summer.

The companies have fought over the direction of Yandex Market, their ecommerce joint venture, so badly that they have discussed changing its capital structure to give one side clear control.

Mr Gref, a member of Yandex s board, did not participate in its meetings for a year, according to people familiar with the matter. Yandex has suggested Sberbank s competing investments may require Mr Gref to recuse himself from some board matters.

Hello. Ports and shipping companies in Europe are increasingly adopting technologies such as automation or internet-connected devices to analyze data and improve services. But their cybersecurity defenses haven't caught up, WSJ Pro's Catherine Stupp reports from Brussels. Port operators often prioritize adopting new tools before considering how to secure them. That means hackers could intercept port communications to monitor activities and gain access to data, potentially using that information to steal cargo.

Ahead of next week's WSJ Pro Cybersecurity Executive Forum in New York, we are asking for your help in shaping the discussions by completing this short survey. All responses will remain anonymous. If you have additional feedback, please contact WSJ Pro Research Director Rob Sloan at rob.sloan@wsj.com.

Also today: IRS agents learn bitcoin, take down child-porn marketplace; U.S. tech firms prop up Chinese surveillance program; and Google fires four employees for data-security violations.

Please note: Our newsletter won't be published Thursday or Friday in observance of the Thanksgiving holiday in the U.S. We will be back on Cyber Monday, ready to hear your tales of e-commerce woe.

Seafaring Security

European maritime companies vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. Ports and shipping firms in Europe sometimes adopt new technologies without considering how to secure them, according to the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, known as Enisa. Adding to the strain: Maritime companies tend not to share sensitive information with each other, meaning they have fewer chances to stop hackers, security experts said.

Ports in Europe have adopted new technologies, including drones to monitor operations in Rotterdam and Amsterdam and an early-stage data-analysis project to control traffic at the port of Antwerp.

The international shipping industry will soon face tougher cybersecurity rules that aim to help protect ships from hackers, but they are already outdated. New guidelines from the International Maritime Organization, part of the United Nations, are set to take effect in January 2021. The guidelines were drafted in 2016 and don't refer to newer technologies such as artificial intelligence or cloud computing.

Big Number

Up to 305,000

Number of payment cards potentially affected by a breach over nine months last year at DiBella's Old Fashioned Submarines. The sandwich chain notified customers about the incident Tuesday.

Inside a Child Pornography Investigation

IRS agents hone bitcoin skills to dismantle child-porn site. After a confidential source tipped off two Internal Revenue Service investigators, the agents with multinational help had traced the financial trail of the largest online marketplace for child pornography they had ever encountered, comprising some 250,000 different videos, the WSJ reports. The story behind the takedown of the website Welcome to Video involved getting a lucky break with the right-click of a mouse, stumbling upon a selfie of someone holding a passport, and following electronic breadcrumbs left by bitcoin transactions.

Indictment: Officials from the Justice Department, the IRS and Homeland Security jointly announced an indictment in the case last month, citing the involvement of Britain's National Crime Agency and the Korean National Police in the investigation.

Tor encryption defect: While the location of the website's server was hidden via the open-source Tor anonymization service, which allows users to conceal their identities online, agents discovered a possible defect in the encryption. When they right-clicked on the images of videos on the site, they found they could examine the source code and see that the thumbnail images appeared to be coming from an internet address in South Korea.

Cryptocurrency isn't 100% secret: The confidential source provided multiple bitcoin addresses, saying they were associated with the website. To confirm, DHS agents created accounts and transferred bitcoin to those addresses. They analyzed the blockchain ledgers of those bitcoin transactions and found the funds had in fact gone to addresses grouped with the ones they had been provided. Investigators subpoenaed the relevant bitcoin exchanges.

More Cyber News

U.S. tech companies prop up China's vast surveillance network. U.S. companies, including Western Digital Corp., Intel Corp. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co., have provided components, financing and know-how to China's surveillance industry, the WSJ reports. Several have been involved since the industry's infancy. The firms could face reputational damage if they are seen as enabling a human-rights crisis described by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo as "the stain of the century." They also risk losing significant business if the Trump administration decides to take stronger steps to sanction China's surveillance program.

What the companies say: Representatives say their products can be used in any number of ways, and that convoluted supply chains limit their understanding and control over how their goods are put to use.

Billions: China's video surveillance market reached $10.6 billion in 2018, with the government accounting for about half of those purchases, according to industry analyst IDC.

Google faces backlash after employee firing. Alphabet Inc.'s Google said in an internal memo this week it fired four employees for violating data-protection policies and now is dealing with criticism from some at the company, Bloomberg reports. At least one of the people dismissed was part of ongoing protests against Google's business with China and other matters. Activity that led to the firing, according to the memo, included some employees collecting information through the electronic calendars of co-workers. "Screenshots of some of their calendars, including their names and details, subsequently made their way outside the company," the memo said. Google confirmed the memo and declined to comment further to Bloomberg.

Bling Capital Raising $90 Million, a Year After First Funds; Bling, founded by former Khosla investor Ben Ling, is finalizing a $60 million early-stage fund and a $30 million opportunities fund

Angel investor turned venture capitalist Ben Ling is about to close $90 million in new funds just a year after his firm's launch, according to a person familiar with the matter.

San Francisco-based Bling Capital is finalizing a $60 million early-stage fund and a $30 million opportunities fund for follow-on investments. Bling, whose name is a play on Mr. Ling's name, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/khosla-investor-ben-ling-departs-raises-debut-funds-1543270340" of the same size last year.

The new funds are indicative of the continued strong appetite for early-stage venture funds among limited partners. Some $19.3 billion was invested in early-stage venture funds in the first three quarters of this year, more than any full year since the dot-com era, according to VentureSource, a data provider owned by WSJ Pro publisher Dow Jones & Co.

Mr. Ling previously worked in product management at Google and worked at Facebook before joining Khosla Ventures. Mr. Ling previously has invested as an angel in companies such as Square Inc., Palantir Technologies Inc. and PagerDuty Inc.

It is unusual for a venture firm to raise additional funds so quickly, because a fund typically takes longer to deploy its capital.

The person familiar with the matter said Bling still has unspent capital in its first funds and the new capital will be reserved for a later date, likely sometime in mid-2020.

Bling invests across a range of categories including consumer technology, marketplaces and mobile-focused businesses. Check sizes typically range from a few hundred thousand dollars to about $1 million.

Examples of Bling's recent portfolio companies include Vise AI, which combines artificial intelligence with financial advice, and Edify Labs Inc., which helps businesses manage customer engagement.

In an interview last year, Mr. Ling said Bling would set itself apart by focusing on helping early-stage startups develop their products. He said some of his limited partners formed a product council to give his portfolio companies advice. Members of the council include YouTube co-founder Steve Chen and Kevin Weil, a vice president of product at Facebook, according to the firm's website.

Last year, Mr. Ling said that he saw advantages to having his own firm instead of weighing investments as part of a larger team. "If you have one decision maker, you can move a lot faster," Mr. Ling said at the time.

Departures Hit Pamplona Tech Fund After U.S. Security Showdown; Pamplona raised a $1 billion fund to invest in technology, media and telecommunications companies in 2016

Private-equity firm Pamplona Capital Management has been hit by a wave of departures from a $1 billion technology fund it manages after a dispute with a U.S. national security panel.

Just one employee remains from the team originally set up to run the fund it raised in 2016 to invest in technology, media and telecommunications companies in the U.S. and Europe, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Last year, the influential Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., known as Cfius, pushed Pamplona "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-officials-pressure-russia-linked-buyout-firm-to-sell-cybersecurity-company-11554925363" in Leesburg, Va.-based Cofense Inc. on national security grounds after voicing concerns about the firm's ties to a group of wealthy Russian businessmen. Cofense simulates and detects emailed hacking attacks to help clients fend off security threats.

Pamplona ended up "https://www.wsj.com/articles/blackrock-unit-gets-approval-to-take-russia-linked-firms-stake-in-cybersecurity-company-11566336840" in Cofense to a unit of BlackRock Inc. in August, The Wall Street Journal previously reported.

Since the Cfius intervention, Pamplona's entire team originally responsible for investing the fund except one partner, Justin Perreault, has left to join competitors, the person said. Websites of rival firms also confirm the moves.

At least seven executives, including two partners hired in 2016 to co-lead Pamplona's technology investment team, have departed since the Cfius intervention.

The New York-based firm has removed a list of executives responsible for investing the fund from its website.

Alongside the departures, the fund's investment pace has slowed since the Cfius action.

Apart from its acquisition of the stake in Cofense last year, no other investments from the fund have been made public since March 2017, according to PitchBook Data Inc. records.

One deal the firm completed using cash from the fund since then, that hasn't been publicly disclosed, was in health-care company GetWellNetwork Inc., another person familiar with the matter said.

The first person said that the firm has completed other investments in that time and that the pace of deployment is unrelated to the intervention by Cfius, which is housed in the Treasury Department. The person added that the slowdown in investment activity is also unconnected to the departures.

Pamplona is assessing investment opportunities in the U.S. and Europe, the person said, as well as holding discussions to hire new investment professionals. To cover for the recent departures, the firm has temporarily transferred executives from other parts of its business to the tech fund. Pamplona also manages a  ¬3 billion ($3.31 billion) generalist fund that targets larger deals across a number of sectors, including health care.

The tech fund's difficulties highlight the potential consequences of the recent U.S. crackdown on foreign investment in companies working in sensitive technology sectors.

The Trump administration has increased scrutiny of overseas investors who gain access to U.S. businesses that either collect sensitive personal data or operate in certain sectors, such as artificial intelligence.

This means that private-equity firms with backing from institutions or individuals from countries like Russia or China more frequently find that they need prior approval from Cfius before making investments. The prerequisite can put them at a competitive disadvantage when competing for assets with other firms, according to Doreen Edelman, a senior partner at law firm Lowenstein Sandler LLP.

Pamplona's $1 billion tech fund was its first sector-focused fund. Some of the money for the fund came from a group of Russian businessmen, including Mikhail Fridman, a founder of conglomerate Alfa Group.

The fund, which has a 10-year lifespan, intended to make 12 to 15 investments in companies across the U.S. and Europe.

It got off to a fast start. In May 2016, it invested in Dynamic Network Services Inc., a business which provides software to companies like Twitter Inc. to manage their cloud-based and internet resources.

Deals for industrial instrument manufacturer Nova Sciences Holdings LLC and tech service provider Logicworks Corp. quickly followed. The last publicly disclosed investment by the fund, aside from Cofence, was in media company Legacy.com in March 2017.

Pamplona invested in Cofense in February 2018. It is unclear how many deals the fund has completed subsequently, although it has been involved in bidding on companies, without success, another person said.

Departures from the fund began last year, starting with the two partners who left to join middle-market buyout firm Charlesbank Capital Partners.

They have recently been joined at their new firm by at least three other former Pamplona professionals, Charlesbank's website shows. Other firms to hire former Pamplona executives include Boston-based firms Parthenon Capital and BV Investment Partners.

TSB debacle shows banks need more tech expertise on board

INSIDE BUSINESS FINANCE

Ayear and-a-half ago, a midsized British bank pressed the "go live" button on the most ambitious IT upgrade attempted in the country. Five million TSB customers were instantly switched from the group's old computer system, rented from former owner Lloyds Bank, to a shiny replacement one, developed by new parent Sabadell. But within minutes it was clear the enterprise was spiralling into what would become one of the most humiliating IT blow-ups in the history of European banking.

Nearly 2m were frozen out of their accounts. Callers to helplines had to wait 90 minutes to be answered. And it took months to resolve the hundreds of defects in the system and compensate customers.

Details of the farrago, laid bare in a frank 257-page report published at the bank's behest by law firm Slaughter and May last week, are parochial. TSB is only the eighth-biggest UK lender and the IT failure, although painful for customers and the bank's reputation, caused no systemic damage.

Yet bankers worldwide would be well advised to pay attention, as broader lessons about the damage that mismanaged IT could do to the financial system are fundamental. The Slaughter and May report is focused on the minutiae of what went wrong at TSB. So it should be the bank paid 25m for it. But it is instructive to distil the conclusions down to some core, transferable messages. The technology provider, in this case the Sabis unit owned by Sabadell, was "immature". There was a rush to go live with insufficient testing. And there were conflicts of interest at the heart of the project's management and oversight; an in-house tech provider answerable not to TSB but to its Spanish parent; and an intermingling of executives and non-executives between the tech provider and the bank, muddying the client-service provider relationship.

But perhaps the starkest lesson of all from the TSB affair is just how laggardly banks have been in ensuring their boards are capable of overseeing the technology machines that modern-day banks have steadily become.

Diversity should Checking back through TSB's catalogue of annual reports, it is evident that despite embarking on an IT overhaul in 2015, when Sabadell first acquired TSB, the then chairman Will Samuel brought no independent technologist on to the board for more than two years.

also be about the range of concrete skills a company can demonstrate The board ticked boxes for banking experience, regulatory experience and accounting expertise. It also looked more diverse in gender terms than most rivals, with women representing 60 per cent of its independent nonexecutives.

But diversity should also be about the range of concrete skills a company and its board can demonstrate. While core financial expertise is crucial, so increasingly is technological knowhow. Only in the autumn of 2017, two months before the original rollout date for TSB's new IT platform, did tech specialist Stephen Page, a former Accenture partner, join the TSB board.

Many other banks have the same issue. Boards, even strong ones, are stacked with veterans of the industry from a time when technology was far less core than it is today.

TSB, like other banks, takes advice on tech issues, including at board level, from the big consultancies. But that is not the same as having an impartial non-executive specialist on the board with all the duties that accompany a director's role. European regulators have conducted unpublished research into the issue, which shows a stark correlation between a high incidence of IT glitches and a lack of IT expertise on the board.

Inexpert boards are bad enough when the problem is just day-to-day operational technology. How much more dangerous is it when the threat is posed by cyber crime, often cited by bank bosses as their top business risk? A report last week from the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation, a London think-tank, highlighted another area of concern. As artificial intelligence and machine learning is adopted across large parts of banking, there are not only risks in the technology itself. The way it is deployed, and overseen by senior executives and nonexecutives, is crucial.

"Financial institutions might become over-reliant on AI specialists with highly technical skill sets that decision makers do not sufficiently understand," the CSFI report concludes.

That board-level "skills gap", it warns, could amplify the interconnectedness of global finance and pose a "systemic threat" on a par with the 2008 financial crisis. All of which rather puts TSB's meltdown into perspective.

Outcome Health's Ex-Leaders Charged With $1 Billion Fraud

Federal prosecutors charged former executives of Outcome Health with allegedly falsifying data in a nearly $1 billion scheme to defraud the company's clients and investors, including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Alphabet Inc. and an investment firm founded by Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker.

The criminal indictments of the startup's former chief executive, Rishi Shah, as well as ex-president Shradha Agarwal and previous finance chief Brad Purdy, conclude a two-year investigation by the Justice Department. The case was sparked by a 2017 Wall Street Journal report that the company -- which displays pharmaceutical ads in doctors' offices -- had misled some customers with inflated data and fake reports.

In the indictment unsealed Monday, the three executives were each charged with multiple counts of mail and wire fraud and two counts of bank fraud. Mr. Shah, 33 years old, also faces two counts of money laundering and Mr. Purdy, 30, faces one count of making a false statement to a bank. On the most serious charges, the three each face a maximum prison sentence of 30 years if convicted.

The Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday also sued the three former executives, alleging they committed civil securities fraud.

A lawyer for Mr. Shah said his client denies the charges brought by the Justice Department and SEC and "looks forward to his day in court and the opportunity to clear his name."

Ms. Agarwal's attorney said her client denies prosecutors' allegations. "Shradha never committed fraud and never participated in any conspiracy. To the contrary, Shradha was committed to transparency and integrity at Outcome Health. She will fight to protect her good name in court."

An attorney for Mr. Purdy called the charges against his client false and misguided.

According to the indictment, the executives lied to Outcome's pharmaceutical company clients, falsely inflated data, caused the company to charge for more ads than it could deliver and inflated revenue figures.

The indictment offers new details alleging that the former executives fielded ethics complaints early in 2017 as they were raising money from investors.

It says Ms. Agarwal, 34, sent Mr. Shah an audio message saying that a recently hired operating chief, Sameer Kazi, had claimed "that we are operating an unethical business" and that Outcome's then-executive in charge of sales and analytics, Ashik Desai, was falsifying data.

In her message, Ms. Agarwal said Mr. Kazi received complaints about Outcome's business practices from two other executives during his first week. The next day, Mr. Shah texted Ms. Agarwal proposing that the company "quickly cycle" out Mr. Kazi and the other two executives, the indictment alleges.

A week later, according to the indictment, Mr. Shah forwarded an email to Mr. Desai with a letter from a whistleblower attorney hired by one of the other executives, saying that "it appears the company is artificially inflating" results.

Mr. Kazi departed less than three weeks after he was hired and after confronting Mr. Shah about the company's practices, the Journal previously reported. He didn't respond to a request for comment.

Mr. Desai has been indicted on one count of wire fraud by the Justice Department, which announced that charge Nov. 14.

The charges against Outcome's former executives represent the latest enforcement effort aimed at technology startups that appear to have adopted a culture of 'fake it till you make it.' Last year, federal prosecutors filed fraud charges against the former executives of blood-testing company Theranos Inc., after a series of Journal articles raised questions about its technology and practices. A federal trial in that case is scheduled for August. The executives have pleaded not guilty.

Founded in 2006, Outcome Health hoped to dominate the business of advertising in doctors' offices by installing flat screens to stream pharmaceutical ads.

The company estimated 2016 sales of about $130 million, up substantially from $7 million four years prior.

By early 2017 it had acquired a top rival, leased a large downtown Chicago office building and raised nearly $500 million of capital -- at a valuation the company said exceeded $5 billion -- from well-known investors including Goldman Sachs, Alphabet's CapitalG investing unit and firms led by Mr. Pritzker and Laurene Powell Jobs, Steve Jobs's widow. It had previously raised $485 million of debt financing.

Mr. Shah became a star on the Chicago startup scene and in Democratic politics as he showered politicians with hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Sens. Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) and Elizabeth Warren (Mass.), who is currently running for president, came to his Chicago office for meetings in 2017.

Mr. Shah was close to Mr. Pritzker, also a Democrat. The two knew each other through a business leadership group, according to people familiar with the group, before Mr. Pritzker's firm invested $50 million in Outcome.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Pritzker, who took office in January, said he stepped back from his business at the start of his campaign.

The Journal revealed in October 2017 that the company had grown in part by charging pharmaceutical companies for ads on more screens than it installed, according to interviews with former employees and advertisers, and a review of internal documents.

A month after the Journal's story, Outcome investors sued the company, alleging they had been defrauded.

Mr. Shah and Ms. Agarwal denied wrongdoing. They later resigned from their positions and settled, agreeing to give back most of the $225 million dividend that they had negotiated for themselves as part of the investment round raised just months earlier.

When the Justice Department charged Mr. Desai earlier this month, it also charged two of his former staffers with conspiracy to commit wire fraud. People familiar with the case said the three are expected to plead guilty and cooperate in the government's case against Messrs. Shah and Purdy and Ms. Agarwal.

After the Journal's article, Mr. Desai, 26, left Outcome and enrolled in the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business. Mr. Desai faces a maximum prison sentence of 20 years and his two staffers maximum sentences of five years each.

Singapore Startup Tookitaki Banks on Sanctions Compliance; The financial regulatory startup has raised $11.7 million to expand in the U.S. and Europe

Singapore startup Tookitaki Holding Pte. Ltd. has raised $11.7 million to sell its financial fraud detection software to banks as regulators push the sector to comply with U.S. sanctions.

The company will use the funding in part to expand in the U.S. and capitalize on the increased pressure banks are under to help enforce U.S. sanctions on businesses and other countries, such as Iran and North Korea, co-founder and Chief Executive Abhishek Chatterjee said.

The U.S. has ramped up penalties related to sanctions compliance, with the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control issuing about "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-sanctions-compliance-fines-hit-decade-high-11564057920" so far this year. That is more than 17 times the amount issued in all of 2018, according to data published by OFAC, which administers and enforces U.S. economic sanctions.

At the same time, companies offering financial regulatory technology are becoming more popular with venture investors. Startups in the sector raised $511.1 million across 22 deals in the third quarter, a five-quarter high and a jump from the roughly $310.4 million raised across 21 deals in the second quarter, according to research and data provider CBInsights.

In September, Trulioo Information Services Inc., another startup that helps financial firms meet money-laundering and fraud regulations, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-fund-identity-verification-startup-trulioos-expansion-11568712603" 60 million Canadian dollars ($44.2 million).

Tookitaki sells subscriptions to its software, which helps financial institutions detect nefarious behavior related to money laundering. Artificial intelligence in the software can automatically detect suspicious patterns in money movements and the use of shell companies, among other things, Mr. Chatterjee said.

The startup's software is integrated into existing banking software and increases money-laundering detection accuracy and lowers operating costs, Mr. Chatterjee said.

The U.S. is the largest market for Tookitaki, which means "hide and seek" in Mr. Chatterjee's native language of Bengali. Mr. Chatterjee declined to identify the company's major U.S. customers. Tookitaki also is planning a European expansion next year, Mr. Chatterjee said.

The company, founded in 2014, plans to expand its research and development team in Singapore and Bangalore, India. To drive this initiative, the company appointed former LinkedIn Corp. director Subhas Samanta as vice president and head of engineering and research.

Viola FinTech and SIG Asia Investments led the new financing, which was an extension to a $7.5 million Series A round raised earlier this year. Viola FinTech General Partner Tomer Michaeli will join Tookitaki's board as part of the deal.

Nomura Holdings Inc. participated in the deal through its Nomura Incubation Investment venture division. Existing investors including Illuminate Financial, Jungle Ventures and Seeds Capital, an investment arm of the Singapore government, also participated in the financing.

Good day. Initial public offerings generated some massive exits for venture investors over the past decade. But the end of this year is ending on a sour note. Still, some analysts expect IPO activity to pick up again next year.

Meanwhile, fraud detection is big business these days, particularly with U.S. sanctions against countries such as Iran and North Korea. A Singapore-based startup has raised new funding to bring its technology to the U.S.

Plus, India's Paytm has secured $1 billion from SoftBank and Ant Financial; and Airbnb Chief Operating Officer Belinda Johnson is stepping down as the company prepares to go public.

And now on to the news...

In the News

IPO slowdown. A record-setting decade for initial public offerings of technology companies is ending with an abrupt halt, as negative sentiment from recent listings sours the market, WSJ Pro's Katie Roof reports.

* The final quarter of 2019 has few planned tech listings. WeWork's canceled IPO and the stock slumps of ride-sharing platforms Uber and Lyft have made public investors skittish. As a result, some VC-backed tech companies have concluded that now isn't the right time to go public, Bastian Lehmann, CEO of Postmates Inc., has said publicly.

* Still, it has been a record year for venture-backed IPOs and a decade that included the public debuts of tech giants including Facebook, Alibaba and Uber. Some analysts expect a strong start for IPOs in 2020. There will be at least one more tech IPO before 2019 ends, with payments platform Bill.com Holdings Inc. expected to list before the holidays.

* The 286 U.S.-based venture-backed tech companies to go public in the past decade raised a total of $60.29 billion, according to Dow Jones VentureSource. The amount raised is a record, partly due to large offerings from companies such as Uber and Facebook.

Paytm deal. The parent company of popular Indian mobile-payments startup Paytm said it has secured $1 billion in fresh funds from SoftBank Group Corp. and China's Ant Financial Services Group, giving it more firepower in a fast-growing but crowded market, the Journal reports. The investment values the parent company, One97 Communications Ltd., at $16 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter, making it one of Asia's most valuable startups.

Compliance software. Singapore startup Tookitaki Holding Pte. Ltd. has raised $11.7 million to sell its financial fraud detection software to banks as regulators push the sector to comply with U.S. sanctions, WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian reports. The company will use the funding in part to expand in the U.S. and capitalize on the increased pressure banks are under to help enforce U.S. sanctions on businesses and other countries, such as Iran and North Korea, co-founder and Chief Executive Abhishek Chatterjee said.

Fast yes, slow no. Black female founders have received far less than 1% of the total technology venture funding raised over the last decade. But the fundraising process is made even more challenging when investors are unwilling to communicate rejection clearly, the Journal reports.

Ops departure. Airbnb Inc. Chief Operating Officer Belinda Johnson has decided to step down as the company prepares to go public, the Journal reports. Ms. Johnson will join the Airbnb board after she exits the operating-chief role, Airbnb said.

VC Funds

Foresite Capital Management is raising two new funds totaling up to $881.25 million, according to regulatory filings. The San Francisco-based firm, which invests in life science and health-care startups, has filed to raise up to $705 million for Foresite Capital Management Fund V, and up to $176.2 million for Opportunity Fund V. No funds had been secured as of Thursday.

Fintech-focused MiddleGame Ventures held the first close of a fund targeting $165 million. The fund will make Series A and Series B investments in Europe and North America. Anchor investors include the Luxembourg Future Fund and the European Investment Fund. MiddleGame is based in Luxembourg, with offices in Dublin and Washington, D.C.

Greenwich, Conn.-based Moonrise Capital seeks to raise $150 million for its Moonrise China Partners II LP fund, according to a regulatory filing.

EXCHANGE --- Technology: Medical Records Were the Last Bastion of Privacy. Then Silicon Valley Got Into Health Care.

By Katherine Bindley

We relinquish all kinds of data to tech companies in exchange for convenience. We hand over our location, our heart rates and even imprints of our eyeballs because we want to order an Uber, track a workout or get through airport security faster. But we expect one thing to be mostly kept private: our medical histories.

In a way, our health information is the last sacrosanct piece of personal information. That's why people were so surprised to learn Google had a deal with Ascension to handle tens of millions of patient records, including full names, test results and diagnoses.

They're right to be confused: Aren't there laws that protect patients when it comes to health information? Multiple people tweeted: What about HIPAA? Not everyone is familiar with the particulars of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act but most people have sat in a doctor's office and filled out a pile of paperwork that seemed to suggest we have some control over who sees our medical information.

The answer: Technology is moving faster than regulation. HIPAA was written, and has been amended, with a few objectives in mind: Allowing people to keep their insurance coverage if they change or lose their jobs; developing a set of standards that would allow health-care providers to adopt new technologies, such as electronic medical-record keeping, while still protecting patient privacy; and giving patients the right to request and direct their electronic health information to third parties.

HIPAA became law back in 1996. Google hadn't yet been founded. Neither had Facebook Inc. Amazon.com Inc. was in its infancy. Apple Inc. was on the brink of extinction. All are now tech giants with ambitions of their own in the health-care space. And, as competitors, secrecy tends to be their default mode.

While there's potential for some of the world's best engineering minds and the most powerful algorithms to improve care and lower costs, there's also the risk of negative consequences for patients, who could see the entry of technology firms affect their insurance or be targeted with ads related to their health conditions. The regulations in place now to protect the interests of patients aren't set up for what's already happening, or for what's coming, say experts.

"We have these enormous gaps in our regulatory framework," says Deven McGraw, chief compliance officer for the health tech startup Ciitizen and a former official with the Department of Health and Human Services agency that enforces HIPAA privacy and security rules. "It was never intended to cover the universe and as that universe expands, it looks less and less adequate."

HIPAA allows individuals and organizations who do business on behalf of a medical provider to handle patient records under what's known as a business associates agreement. Those entities have to follow certain rules for handling patient data, such as safeguarding the data against misuse or unauthorized disclosure. (HIPAA requires them to abide by those rules even if they haven't signed an agreement, provided they're receiving personal health information from a health-care provider.)

Historically, Ms. McGraw says, companies signing these agreements tended to specialize in health care. Tens of thousands of businesses, ranging from large medical-records vendors to small companies that transcribe doctors' notes, have signed these agreements.

"The line between what's a health institution and what's not a health institution has gotten blurrier," says John Wilbanks, chief commons officer at the health-tech nonprofit Sage Bionetworks and an expert on data sharing. "When the business associates agreement architecture was created, it was because the idea was these would be associates of the health system, not that they would be a giant advertising system that could help with your health system because they were also good at math."

Consumer-facing companies such as Apple and Facebook don't always have to sign these agreements because HIPAA doesn't apply when personal information is shared by the patient. Both companies are exploring ways for patients to better manage their own care and health information.

Apple, for instance created an encrypted connection that allows health providers to transmit health information at a patient's request to an iPhone. The company says that it doesn't receive or have access to the records, and that it hasn't signed any business associate agreements.

Facebook recently launched a preventive health tool allowing users to do things like set reminders for check-ups or tests they need completed. A spokeswoman says the company is not receiving or transmitting protected health information for or on behalf of a covered entity or business associate.

As providers of cloud services to health-care companies, however, Amazon and Microsoft Corp. regularly enter into business associate agreements. And Google has signed one with Ascension.

"This was like the bomb going off because it's Google," says Ms. McGraw, whose company makes a tool for consumers to consolidate and share their medical records. "People know that Google collects a lot of data about us: has it, monetizes it, does pretty much what it wants to with it, and has a track record on privacy that is less than stellar."

Google plans to use the Ascension data to train its artificial intelligence and develop software that could eventually make suggestions for patient care, according to my colleague Rob Copeland's reporting. Google Cloud President Tariq Shaukat said the company's health-care goal is "ultimately improving outcomes, reducing costs and saving lives."

Insights from machine learning are already being used by doctors to improve care in hospitals. Stanford University's Center for Biomedical Informatics Research has access to the anonymized health information of 200 million patients from Stanford's hospital system and other outside sources.

Algorithms trained on the data have been able to predict things like which patients are likely to die within three to 12 months, so providers can better time discussions of palliative care. Doctors can also use data to compare one patient to a pool of similar patients. If a patient's blood work shows some elevated levels, a doctor can compare it with a larger population and determine whether it's worth increasing checkups and checking for cancer.

Nigam Shah, associate director of the Stanford center, views sharing health data as a moral obligation (the lab allows outside companies to access its data for research purposes. Stanford researchers separately have partnered with Apple on a heart study).

"The challenge is to figure out how to do so in a safe way," he says, "and the current regulations and law are not sufficient."

HIPAA safeguards our data when it's within our health-care system and moving between providers and their associates. But its protections are narrow: We don't get to decide who providers decide to work with, and we have no say in what happens to our health data once our personally identifiable information has been removed -- a process known as "de-identification."

The Department of Health and Human Services lays out what constitutes appropriate de-identification. If you remove certain personally identifiable information from health data, the idea is that you shouldn't in theory be able to re-identify someone.

Ms. McGraw says it's quite common for these agreements with health providers to allow the outside company to remove personally identifiable information from the data. Once it's "de-identified," she says, it's no longer subject to HIPAA and the company can do what it wants with it.

Nicolas Terry, executive director of the Hall Center for Law and Health at Indiana University, says big technology firms wouldn't have much trouble hashing and anonymizing patient data and then triangulating that with existing user information. Google says its agreement with Ascension does not allow de-identification.

There's also the question of whether Google's agreement allows it to improve its product with whatever insights it learns from the Ascension data -- and then monetize it.

The company has said it will be using the Ascension data only for its work with Ascension, that the data will be siloed, that it won't be combined with other consumer information or used for advertising purposes. When asked if the data could still be used to improve Google's AI, a spokeswoman pointed to the blog post and declined to comment further.

An Amazon spokeswoman says that Amazon Web Services does not use personal health information to develop or improve its services.

Mr. Wilbanks, with Sage Bionetworks, says Google will be in a good position to start selling actuarial tables to insurance companies -- like predictions on when a white male in his 40s with certain characteristics might be likely to get sick and expensive.

When it comes to life and disability insurance, antidiscrimination laws are weak, he says. "That's what creates the risk of having one entity having a really godlike view of you as a person that can use it against you in ways you wouldn't even know."

That's not a surprise, given how opaque the data-sharing industry has been to date. Earlier this year, I downloaded the What to Expect pregnancy app to see if Facebook would show me maternity ads. Sure enough, one popped up in my Instagram feed, thus ensuing a wild goose chase to try to figure out why I saw the ad.

It's hard to imagine a scenario in which consumers have the ability to find out exactly how their health data is being used -- especially if Google, in signing a business associate agreement and adhering to HIPAA, was under no obligation to tell patients or doctors that it was analyzing their health records.

"Transparency is key," Dr. Shah says. "Right now the tendency of tech companies to do everything in secret will set the whole field back."

L Catterton-backed Il Makiage Buys AI Startup NeoWize; NeoWize uses machine-learning  algorithms and other data-related technologies to improve the online shopping experience for consumers

Il Makiage, a beauty brand backed by L Catterton, has acquired Israeli artificial-intelligence startup NeoWize Inc. to deepen its use of AI programs so shoppers can buy its products online more easily.

NeoWize traces its roots to intelligence units of the Israel Defense Forces, where co-founders Omer Nevo and Yoav Cafri both worked before starting the Tel Aviv-based company with Ronen Ness in 2016. Mr. Ness has since left the company.

NeoWize specializes in applying machine-learning algorithms and other data-related technologies to online commerce. That is what caught the interest of IM Pro Makeup NY L.P., the New York-based company that does business as Il Makiage.

"Many startups are focused on data but for a million different reasons," said Oran Holtzman, Il Makiage's chief executive. Most machine-learning developers aren't focused on e-commerce, he added.

But NeoWize provided the right fit to help Il Makiage enhance its online customer experience, he said.

Il Makiage, with offices in New York's SoHo neighborhood and in Tel Aviv, was started in 1972 by makeup artist Ilana Harkavi. Mr. Holtzman bought the company in 2013 and leads it with his sister, Shiran Holtzman Erel, who is chief product officer.

ll Makiage expects its annual revenue to exceed $70 million in 2019, Mr. Holtzman said.

L Catterton bought a 35.8% stake for $29 million in 2017, and the private-equity firm so far has invested a total of about $45 million in Il Makiage, according to Mr. Holtzman.

The brand relaunched about 18 months ago with a strategy of developing technology to make it easier for customers to buy beauty products online.

"Beauty is huge in social media and one of the largest categories in YouTube, same in Instagram, but for some reason it's one of the most underpenetrated categories" in online shopping, Mr. Holtzman said. He said most online purchases are made to replenish beauty supplies bought in physical stores.

Il Makiage first developed an algorithm-powered online quiz to help women find the best match for foundation makeup among 50 available shades, based on skin features and other factors. More recently, the company introduced an e-commerce platform where users can watch tutorial videos from beauty influencers before deciding what to buy.

Mr. Holtzman said that one of the main contributions NeoWize's machine-learning technology will make is the ability to shape a user's first visit to the Il Makiage website based on their interactions on the site. That is expected to lead to a better online shopping experience.

"There are so many solutions for analyzing data and utilizing it for a second and third session," Mr. Holtzman said. "What we love about [NeoWize] and what we saw that has a lot of potential is that they can do changes in real time on the first session. And this is something that we didn't see in many other startups."

NeoWize remains an independent operation even though its employees will relocate to Il Makiage's offices and its founders will assume their own roles in the company. Il Makiage named Mr. Nevo as vice president of research and development and Mr. Cafri as chief data scientist. They will continue to lead NeoWize.

Based in Greenwich, Conn., L Catterton focuses on consumer-related sectors such as cosmetics, apparel and fitness. The firm is affiliated with luxury brand company LVMH Mot Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE.

L Catterton invested in Il Makiage from its third growth-capital fund, L Catterton Growth Partners III.

Funds

European private-equity firm Investindustrial has raised  ¬3.75 billion for its seventh buyout fund, Elisngela Mendona reports for WSJ Pro affiliate Private Equity News in London, citing people familiar with the matter. The fund had targeted  ¬3 billion for the midmarket-focused fund, which was nearly twice the size of its 2016 predecessor.

Canadian private-equity firm Novacap raised 940 million Canadian dollars ($708 million) for its latest fund, which closed at its hard cap. The Montreal firm said the Novacap Industries V fund surpassed its C$650 million target by nearly 45%, driven by strong demand from new and existing investors. The fund targets North American midmarket manufacturing companies, food processors, business-service providers and distributors, Novacap said.

Strauss Zelnick's ZMC private-equity firm has collected $775 million for its third flagship fund, which will continue to focus on technology-enabled media and communications companies of the sort pursued by its predecessor.

Industry News

Bumble Bee Foods LLC, one of the nation's largest canned tuna providers, sought bankruptcy protection Thursday with an agreement to sell its assets to Taiwan's FCF Fishery Co. for roughly $925 million. San Diego-based Bumble Bee, owned by private-equity firm Lion Capital in London, said that a chapter 11 process will help facilitate the sale to FCF as well as "reduce its debt burden caused by recent and significant legal challenges."

Thyssenkrupp AG expects to decide early next year whether to sell its profitable elevator business or take it public, and could also sell its plant-building unit, the Essen, Germany-based company said Thursday. New Chief Executive Martina Merz is leading a last-ditch effort to repair the company, The Wall Street Journal's William Boston reports, and asset sales could be part of the mix.

The default risk of companies owned by private-equity firms is 2.5 times that of their public counterparts, according to data collected from banks, insurers and asset managers by analytics firm Credit Benchmark, the Journal's Matt Wirz reports.

A group of creditors and a former executive of Furie Operating Alaska LLC will confront the oil-and-gas company's top lender and executive brass in bankruptcy court next month over the creditors' push to get permission to pursue them for alleged mismanagement. Five creditors and Bruce Webb, a former Furie senior vice president, have requested bankruptcy court permission to chase claims on behalf of Furie's estate against Energy Capital Partners and other Furie executives appointed by the private-equity firm.

EP Energy Corp. received court approval Thursday night for a "backstop agreement" backed by Apollo Global Management and other junior bondholders over objections from senior creditors who are vying to take control of the company.

Swiss private-equity firm Partners Group has been among the European asset managers whose shares have climbed as increasing asset prices feed through into fee revenue, The Wall Street Journal's Mischa Frankl-Duval reports, citing analysts. Investors are increasingly looking for yield in private rather than public markets, said Andreas Vendetti at Vontobel. He said that has helped Partners shares, which have climbed more than 35% this year, outpacing the 19% year-to-date gain for the Stoxx Europe 600 index.

Wellington Management, whose alternative investment strategies include private equity, plans to use the Artivest open-architecture digital system for access to its offerings by financial advisers and wealthy individuals. Other users of the Artivest system include KKR & Co. and Bain Capital Credit, the software company said Thursday. Wellington manages more than $1.1 trillion for institutional and private clients.

A recession in the coming year is unlikely, "but the risks are at a level I'm not entirely comfortable with," former Federal Reserve leader Janet Yellen said at a World Business Forum event in New York, The Wall Street Journal's Lauren Weber reports. "I would bet there will not be a recession in the coming year, but the odds are higher than normal," she said, citing a slowdown in global economic growth, particularly in China, and trade tensions between China and the U.S.

Good day. Not long ago, China's venture market was the envy of the world. Things have changed, as the China venture market has dropped along with the nation's IPO market.

Now Y Combinator is shutting down its China-based YC China unit. The firm says the move is unrelated to trade tensions between the U.S. and China.

Plus, Thrive Capital has backed another health company, Rightway Health. And Longwood Fund has raised $39 million for a cancer drug discovery startup that it founded.

And now on to the news...

In the News

China pullback. Y Combinator, the startup accelerator that has produced tech giants such as Dropbox Inc. and Airbnb Inc., is ending its China-focused effort that launched in the summer of last year, WSJ Pro's Katie Roof reports.

* The firm said in a blog post that it decided now isn't the right time to run a country-specific accelerator and that it reverted to its previous strategy of supporting companies from its Silicon Valley headquarters following a change in leadership. Earlier this year, Geoff Ralston succeeded Sam Altman as president of Y Combinator.

* The firm's YC China was run by Qi Lu, the former chief operating officer at Chinese search engine Baidu Inc. and executive vice president at Microsoft Corp. Mr. Lu now will fund companies through his new program, MiraclePlus. Y Combinator said it would still fund China-based startups through its U.S. program.

Health-care navigation. As the cost of employer-provided health insurance climbs, startups are pitching software aimed at helping consumers and companies eke out savings by accessing care more efficiently, WSJ Pro's Heather Mack reports. Rightway Health Inc., which just raised $20 million in a Series B funding round led by Thrive Capital, says it tries to achieve that goal by combining a digital platform for exploring health-care options with dedicated clinician consultants who know the ins and outs of employer-sponsored health plans and can recommend treatments, doctors and facilities.

Blockchain hype. The enterprise blockchain experiment is over for Boldstart Ventures, WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova reports. The seed investment firm has decided to limit its pursuit of blockchain technology in its new $112 million fund after exploring the sector in its previous fund. The move is the result of slower adoption of blockchain technology by corporations than some anticipated when bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies peaked in popularity at the end of 2017.

Cancer drugs. Venture firm Longwood Fund has founded and raised $39 million for Immunitas Therapeutics Inc., a startup harnessing an emerging technology known as single-cell sequencing to develop cancer treatments, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. Longwood joined Leaps by Bayer and Novartis Venture Fund in leading the Series A round for Cambridge, Mass.-based Immunitas, which expects to use the funding to move its initial antibody drugs toward clinical trials.

Exits

The Players' Tribune, the digital media venture launched by former New York Yankees captain Derek Jeter, has been acquired by Minute Media, a digital publishing platform founded in Israel that operates a network of sports-media sites around the world. Players' Tribune raised a total of $58 million from investors including New Enterprise Associates, GV and IVP. Minute Media has raised $116 million from investors including Battery Ventures, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and ProSieben.

Il Makiage, a beauty brand backed by L Catterton, has acquired Israeli artificial-intelligence startup NeoWize Inc. to deepen its use of AI programs so shoppers can buy its products online more easily.

Home insurance provider Hippo has made its first acquisition with the purchase of home maintenance startup Sheltr for an undisclosed amount. Palo Alto, Calif.-based Hippo raised a $100 million Series D round in July from Bond Capital, Comcast Ventures, Felicis Ventures, Fifth Wall Ventures, Hillhouse Capital, Horizons Ventures, Iconiq Capital and others. Sheltr, of San Francisco, was backed by investors including 122West, MetaProp NYC, NYCA Partners and DG Incubation.

VC Funds

New York-based CityRock Venture Partners raised $8 million toward a targeted $50 million fund, according to a regulatory filing.

Privacy campaigners race to halt Google's Fitbit deal

Technology. Wearables

Critics fret over US search group's ability to access and exploit users' health data

Politicians and privacy campaigners have called for Google's $2.1bn deal for Fitbit to be blocked, over fears that the search giant will feed its growing healthcare business with the data of the 27m people who use the target company's fitness trackers.

The deal for Fitbit has been seen as an attempt by Google to catch up with the Apple Watch by buying a consumer wearables company. But the takeover, if it is passed by regulators, also gives Google access to a huge trove of heart rate, activity and sleep data which it could use to create a new range of personalised health services.

Mark Warner, a Democratic senator, said the purchase raised "serious concerns" as it could tip new areas of the burgeoning personalised health and wellness market in favour of the large tech companies, while Representative David Cicilline, chair of the house antitrust committee, said the deal "would threaten to give [Google] yet another way to surveil users and entrench its monopoly power online".

Privacy and antitrust advocates have called on the Federal Trade Commission to block the purchase, arguing that health data are "critical" to the future of the digital marketplace.

"Google should not gain control of Fitbit's sensitive and individualised health data that can be integrated with data from its current services to entrench its monopoly power," said groups including the Open Markets Institute, Public Citizen and the Electronic Privacy Information Center.

"Through its vast portfolio of internet services, Google knows more about us than any other company, and it should not be allowed to add yet another way to track our every move."

Google declined to comment, but Rick Osterloh, the company's senior vice-president for devices and services, said in the blog post that announced the deal that Google would be "transparent about the data we collect and why".

"We will never sell personal information to anyone. Fitbit health and wellness data will not be used for Google ads. And we will give Fitbit users the choice to review, move or delete their data," he said.

Buying Fitbit would help Google catch up with Apple, which has been focusing its health ventures around data collected by the Apple Watch.

Apple had 15 per cent of the worldwide market in the second quarter, shipping 5.1m watches, compared with just over 10 per cent at Fitbit, which sold 3.5m in the quarter, according to data firm IDC. The global market is led by Xiaomi, the Chinese device maker.

The Fitbit data would be an important win for Google's mission to collect health data, giving it much of the same tracking information about heart rates and physical activity as Apple and the potential to deploy more sensors on an existing customer base.

Carolina Milanesi, a consumer tech analyst at Creative Strategies, said Google was trying to use its expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning to diversify its business, and healthcare looks like it has "huge potential from a revenue perspective". Just like Apple's purchase of Shazam enhanced Apple Music, the Fitbit deal could improve Google's healthcare offerings by acquiring data and expertise, she added.

Fitbit is rich in data that is not covered by US health privacy regulations because the company is not a healthcare provider or insurer.

Going far beyond just tracking step counts, Fitbit has been moving further into healthcare, attracted like Google and other Big Tech companies by the prospect of mining data for new insights on how to treat disease and cut the cost of healthcare.

It has partnerships with health insurers, such as United Healthcare, where members can earn rewards for keeping fit, and will run a health programme for the government of Singapore that covers 20 per cent of the country's population. It recently signed a deal with an alliance between pharmaceutical companies Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, working towards approval of a sensor and algorithm that could spot atrial fibrillation, a sign of the potential for a stroke.

Eric Topol, the author of the book Deep Medicine, said that Google's ultimate aim was probably to use many data sources from fitness data to electronic health records to genomes to create a "virtual coach" for health.

"It will give you real-time advice about why this or that is off track," he said. "In order to get there, they will have to have the person's data."

Google is already facing a raft of healthcare privacy probes.

It is being sued by a patient at the University of Chicago who claims that Google took anonymised data from the university's medical school but could have combined it with the location of patients on Google Maps and with WiFi connections to put names to the patients. Google and the University of Chicago are contesting the lawsuit.

The US government is also investigating whether Google broke privacy rules in its "Project Nightingale" agreement with Ascension, the country's secondlargest healthcare system. Google was given access to medical records of over 50m Americans but many of them only found out about the deal from a report in the Wall Street Journal.

Lenders Brace for Private-Equity Loan Defaults; Financial institutions raised default probability estimates for loans to private-equity-owned companies

The default risk of companies owned by private-equity firms is 2.5 times that of their public counterparts, according to data collected from banks, insurers and asset managers by analytics firm Credit Benchmark.

Private-equity firms use leveraged loans, rated below investment grade, for the financing of buyouts of target companies. Financial institutions raised their estimates of the average probability of default or nonpayment for such loans to about 6% in September from 5.44% a year earlier, according to the data.

Lenders surveyed by Credit Benchmark assigned a 2.36% default probability to leveraged loans of public companies in September, compared with 2.28% a year earlier.

Default expectations are typically higher for privately owned companies because "there are fewer constraints on the debt levels of private firms," said Thomas Aubrey, a risk and compliance adviser at Credit Benchmark. But the jump in the default risk of private-company loans compared with public ones shows "there's a potential for things to deteriorate much faster, particularly in a down market," he said.

The finding comes as worries mount about a turn in the credit cycle and a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/junk-debt-sends-early-warning-signals-1156854520". Easy money from central banks has kept default rates relatively low since the 2008 financial crisis, but rising corporate debt is flashing a warning sign to investors, Morgan Stanley bond analysts said in a report published Nov. 19.

"Leverage remains high, and a majority of other cycle indicators we track are in the 'red zone,'" the analysts wrote.

About 57% of companies purchased in leveraged buyouts now carry debt loads more than six times their earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, according to Morgan Stanley's report. That exceeds the 51% ratio in 2007 on the eve of the financial crisis, according to the report.

Companies that default on their debt can end up in bankruptcy. Toys "R" Us, a high-profile example, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2017 after it failed to repay loans from its leveraged buyout by private-equity firms. Months later, it was liquidated.

S&P Global Ratings expects the U.S. default rate which is distinct from default probability of companies rated below investment grade to rise to 3.9% by September 2020 from 2.8% in September of this year. But in a pessimistic scenario of heightened trade disputes and political instability, the rate could hit 5.2% next year, the ratings firm said.

A jump in leveraged-loan defaults could have more impact on global finance than in years past because there are far more of the loans in existence and they are broadly held by mutual funds, institutional investors and collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs.

Price declines in loans with low credit ratings "https://www.wsj.com/articles/clo-selloff-flashes-warning-sign-to-junk-bond-market-11573477203" in the value of some CLO securities. The value of loans outstanding has roughly doubled since 2008 to about $1.2 trillion, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence.

The rise in lender default expectations indicates a 10% deterioration in credit risk in leveraged loans, according to Credit Benchmark. The analytics firm pooled lender estimates of 221 companies with leveraged loans outstanding, including 134 public borrowers and 63 private-equity-owned borrowers.

Bond Fund's Bet on Risky Nations Backfires --- Ashmore holdings shrink by $2 billion on turmoil in Argentina, Ecuador and Lebanon

A large emerging-markets bond fund that bet almost 40% of its investors' money in a trio of risky countries is struggling as all three economies fall into crisis simultaneously.

The Ashmore SICAV Emerging Markets Short Duration Fund has lost about 5% in the past three months, principally because of bond holdings in Argentina, Ecuador and Lebanon, according to data from Morningstar.

The mutual fund, managed by London-based Ashmore Group PLC, grew quickly over the past year because it paid high yields, but recent losses have prompted redemptions of about $1 billion, a person familiar with the fund said.

The fund's struggles contrast with relatively good performance by other emerging-market bond managers.

The Ashmore fund has shrunk by about $2 billion in recent months to $5.8 billion as investors redeemed shares and the value of its holdings fell, according to Morningstar.

Investor flows into the fund "were very good early this year because people were searching for yield," said Hubert Lam, an analyst at Bank of America Corp. "They didn't think about the risk in emerging markets until this summer when Argentina blew up."

Mr. Lam cut his recommendation on Ashmore stock to neutral from buy in September, "mainly because of the risk in the short-duration bond fund," he said.

Much of the fund's recent loss came this week when Ecuador's government bonds dropped about 15%, according to data from IHS Markit, because of mounting political opposition to fiscal changes.

That follows a 34% fall in Lebanese bonds since mid-October, when protests erupted in the country's capital of Beirut, and a 50% drop in Argentine bond prices after the primary election of a populist presidential candidate in August, according to analytics service Advantage Data Inc.

It is an unusual stumble for Ashmore, which brands itself as an emerging-markets specialist and routinely wins awards for bond picking in developing countries.

The firm was founded by British billionaire Mark Coombs and its assets under management have grown to $93 billion in June from $58 billion two years earlier, according S&P Capital IQ.

"They are a veteran emerging-market shop and very well respected," said an emerging-markets bond-fund manager at a competing investment firm. "I wouldn't have expected them to have this run of bad luck."

While sharp price swings are common in emerging markets, having three core investments drop sharply at the same time is rare, especially when the broader market is relatively stable.

The short-duration fund is performing according to its design to buy into emerging-markets bonds at distressed prices, betting that prices will rebound, the person familiar with the fund said.

Ashmore has increased the fund's allocation to Argentina, Ecuador and Lebanon recently but already had large holdings in the countries before the recent selloffs, according to investor disclosures.

The short-duration fund was 12.5% invested in Argentina, 15.5% in Ecuador and 10.3% in Lebanon as of Oct. 31, compared with 9.9% in Argentina, 11.8% in Ecuador and 8.4% in Lebanon as of June 30, the disclosures show.

Betting big on risky countries normally makes the fund swing wider than most competitors, Mr. Lam said.

"When the market is up, they tend to do better than most but if markets do poorly, they do worse," he said.

The Ashmore fund posted higher returns than a JPMorgan Chase & Co. index tracked by most emerging-markets investors by an average of 6 percentage points from 2015 to 2018, according to data from Morningstar.

The unlucky trifecta of losses in Argentina, Ecuador and Lebanon bucked that trend, and the fund is underperforming the JPMorgan index by 17 percentage points this year, according to Morningstar data.

Good day. New York City's private sector job growth weakened during the quarter ended in September, its slowest since the fourth quarter of 2009 during the peak of the credit crisis. The city is trending well below national figures, according to a report by the City's Comptroller's office.

This was driven in part by a drop in employment in the financial sector, precipitated by lower earnings by six of the nation's largest banks, the report said.

A September index of New York business sentiment from the Institute for Supply Management, meanwhile, showed businesses expressing pessimism about the six-month outlook, with the index dropping to its lowest level in almost 11 years.

The city's technology sector is holding up, despite Amazon's decision to locate its second headquarters elsewhere and New York-based WeWork's fall from grace. Local startups raised more than $4 billion in venture capital in each quarter of the year; a solid performance. Jobs in the information sector rose by 2,200 in the third quarter, the largest gain since the second quarter of 2018, the report said.

Technology may be the city's saving grace, yet.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Several small Los Angeles area investors are set to make a bounty if payment company PayPal Holdings Inc. 's $4 billion purchase of local startup Honey Science Corp. goes through, WSJ Pro's Katie Roof and Yuliya Chernova report.

* Before its most recent round last year, the startup that finds discount coupons for online shoppers collected capital mostly from smaller local investors to raise a total of $49 million in venture capital.

* Citi Ventures led the most recent investment in Honey last year, valuing the company at around $700 million, according to a person familiar with the deal.

* The size of PayPal's acquisition is unusually large for a company emerging from the growing but still nascent Los Angeles startup ecosystem.

* Santa Monica-based seed-stage firm Mucker Capital, for example, is expected to receive proceeds of $280 million from the $3 million it invested in Honey, according to the person familiar with the investment.

Tech support. BigPanda Inc., an information technology management startup, has raised $50 million to expand its software, which can automatically diagnose and fix IT problems for companies, WSJ Pro's Marc Vartabedian reports. BigPanda's customers include Intel, Tivo Corp. and Workday Inc. The Series C round was led by Insight Partners and is part of the firm's expanding interest in the sector.

Werewolf hunting. Biotechnology startup Werewolf Therapeutics Inc. gathered $56 million in venture financing to improve cytokine cancer treatments, which have been limited because they also harm normal tissue, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. MPM Capital and Longwood Fund led the company's Series A round.

The Amazon mold. In the Big Tech era, Amazon has become the incubator for CEOs and entrepreneurs, who are spreading the business gospel of Jeff Bezos across the corporate world, WSJ's Dana Mattioli reports. Alums of the Seattle-based giant, which employs over 750,000 people, head companies including Tableau Software Inc., Zulily Inc., Groupon Inc., and Simple, an online banking unit of Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA.

Final ride. New York ride-hailing business Juno USA LP filed for bankruptcy protection, blaming its demise on minimum wage regulations and mounting lawsuits from drivers, riders and competitors, WSJ Pro's Alexander Gladstone reports. Juno, which was bought by Israeli-based Gett for $200 million, generated $269 million of revenue last year, a 23% annual increase, according to court papers.

Consumer-focused investor CAVU Venture Partners completed raising its oversubscribed third flagship fund with $250 million. With offices in New York, Santa Monica, Calif. and Austin, Texas, CAVU closed its inaugural fund in 2016 with $156 million, and its second fund of $209 million in 2017. Notable exits include Bai antioxidant drink, sold to Dr. Pepper Snapple for $1.7 billion; ONE Brands, sold to Hershey for $397 million; and Beyond Meat, which held an initial public offering in May.

Tech News

Thrive Expands Health Portfolio, Backing Care-Navigation Platform Rightway; Employer-focused Rightway Health provides software and consulting for health-care decision-making and access

As the cost of employer-provided health insurance "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cost-of-employer-provided-health-coverage-passes-20-000-a-year-11569429000", startups are pitching software aimed at helping consumers and companies eke out savings by accessing care more efficiently.

Rightway Health Inc. says it tries to achieve that goal by combining a digital platform for exploring health-care options with dedicated clinician consultants who know the ins and outs of employer-sponsored health plans and can recommend treatments, doctors and facilities. The pitch is that having a knowledgeable guide can help employees navigate the system and help employers track utilization and rein in costs.

The New York-based startup, which just raised $20 million in a Series B funding round led by Thrive Capital, works with companies ranging in size from 150 to 50,000 employees.

Rightway co-founder and Chief Executive Jordan Feldman said the goal is to replicate the experience of having a doctor in the family, which he experienced thanks to his cardiologist father.

"Accessing health care is confusing and frustrating," said Mr. Feldman, who co-founded the company in 2017, in an interview. "Consumers now have more choice and accountability about their care, but they need advocacy and support. They need a dedicated resource who understands where they are and can basically hold their hand through decision-making."

At the same time, Mr. Feldman said, Rightway was designed to help chief financial officers and human resources executives make better-informed health benefits decisions and track expenses through analytics. For example, the platform can identify what types of claims lead to the highest costs, and clinician consultants can then use that data to suggest appropriate preventive care or a better coverage plan.

The promise of improved transparency, leading to better employee engagement and cost savings, has helped Rightway gather customers quickly, Mr. Feldman said. At the end of 2018, Rightway had about 30 enterprise customers. It now has more than 800, comprising 500,000 employees.

Before Thrive's investment, Rightway raised financing from family offices and individuals including former Tiger Global Management Partner Jonathan Locker, who sits on the company's board.

Other investors participated in the latest funding round, Thrive and Rightway said, without disclosing the investors. They declined to disclose Rightway's valuation.

Rightway plans to use the new money to fund its expansion, including hiring more staff and introducing a pharmacy benefits management component to the platform.

Rightway, which has now raised more than $30 million since it launched, is one of several startups and public companies that provide health-care benefits navigation and concierge services. Others include Andreessen Horowitz-backed "https://www.wsj.com/articles/health-care-concierge-accolade-lands-50-million-1522350055" and Castlight Health Inc., which was financed by investors such as Venrock and Oak Investment Partners before "https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2014/03/14/castlight-health-surges-in-trading-debut/" in 2014.

Thrive Capital General Partner Kareem Zaki said his firm was attracted to Rightway for many of the same reasons it has backed other health-care companies, such as Oscar Health Insurance Corp. which was co-founded by Thrive founder Josh Kushner and senior-care startup Honor Technology Inc.

"We need to see companies that, regardless of the model, put consumers at the center of health care," said Mr. Zaki, who will join Rightway's board. "We also look for businesses that are working with existing systems instead of trying to upend everything."

Apple Watches and Fitbits gently encourage members to engage with their own health

Tanned and with a wide grin, Wayne Gono, aged 64, may be one of the oldest people at his family business Regal Plastics   but he and his wife regularly top the employers  leaderboard for taking the most steps. The Texan business was one of the first to embrace a programme offered by United Healthcare, its health insurer, which uses devices such as the Apple Watch to push members into more physical activity.

 My wife and I, since we are the elders in the company, try to stay in the top five. I can say to the others, I m one of the oldest guys here and I m kicking your butt!  he says laughing.

As well as the satisfaction of a win over colleagues, members get cash if they meet three targets: frequency of movement   getting up and walking for small periods often; intensity   at least one burst of 3,000 steps in 30 minutes; and tenacity, completing 10,000 steps in a day. Meeting each goal helps members earn between $1 and $3.

Gono says he has earned about half his deductible back by keeping active, saving money on the amount he pays out of pocket for medical care each year. He puts the extra cash straight into a  vacation fund  for taking his kids and grandchildren on holiday.

Health insurers are turning to wearable devices including the Apple Watch and Fitbit wristbands to encourage employees to engage with their own health   long before they fall ill. They hope that by harnessing technology companies  expertise in how to change behaviour, they will deliver daily nudges that make people healthier and   down the line   save costs.

There are challenges: from ensuring the programmes reach the least fit, not just those who were already exercising, to assuaging fears on privacy and data security, particularly when an employer is paying for the insurance.

But if overcome, such measures could solve some of the biggest problems in chronic care. Obesity   one of the many damaging results of a sedentary lifestyle   is the second-leading cause of preventable death, behind smoking, in the US. It cost the US healthcare system about $147bn in 2008, according to the Centers for Disease Control. Estimates of the cost to the entire US economy because of lost productivity range from $3.4bn to $6.4bn.

Doctors have long known that their patients need to exercise more   but it has been far easier to prescribe pills than physical activity. JoAnn Manson, chief of the preventive medicine division at Brigham and Women s Hospital in Boston, says exercise is  as close to a magic bullet as we ve come in modern medicine .

She has recommended that exercise be considered an  additional vital sign    alongside the classic four of blood pressure, pulse, breathing rate and temperature. Doctors should ask about exercise every visit, she believes.

 I do appreciate clinicians are extremely busy in the office with a lot of demands. It is very rushed. However, this is an intervention that could ultimately reduce the risk of many of the chronic diseases that have such extreme costs, a major human burden and toll on the population,  she says.

Manson says insurers  incentive programmes could be used to encourage more physical activity   but also that there needs to be more research on how effective they are.

United Healthcare launched its programme in January 2018. Paul Sterling, vice-president of emerging products for the company, said it was already saving about $220 per member in medical costs each year, comparing people who participate in the programme with people who don t.

 The underlying thesis is simple. It s not new: movement or motion as medicine,  he says.  The beauty of the programme is that it does provide a day-after-day opportunity for reinforcement and support. 

United is now looking at how to include activities such as swimming, cycling and even gardening, so that people are rewarded for all types of exercise.

Discovery, a South African health insurer and owner of Vitality, pioneered this type of effort. Francois Millard, senior vice-president and chief actuarial officer at Vitality Group, said the project was initially modelled on airline frequent-flyer programmes. The insurer realised it was  uniquely situated to benefit if our members get healthier    so it should share the upsides with participants.

A study by research institute Rand Europe of more than 422,000 Vitality members in the UK, US and South Africa, from 2015 to 2018, found that members of the rewards programme with the Apple Watch were active for an extra five days a month. Perhaps predictably, the study found that unhealthy people were much less likely to take up a programme like this. But, importantly, it found that when they did, they did so with gusto, showing a  more pronounced behaviour change .

Vitality used behavioural economics to design its programme. Members receive a discounted Apple Watch, but must pay the full cost if they do not meet their goals   albeit interest-free. People are more averse to losing money than to potential gains, so it is a strong nudge to change their behaviour.

The programme also borrows tricks from the tech industry that have been shown to engage users more, such as uncertain rewards. Just like a Facebook user refreshes their news feed frequently because he or she is not sure what could appear next (or a gambler gets excited for their next game), if a member meets their goals, they can spin a wheel where they might win gift cards worth anything from $5 to $25.

The obvious goal of these programmes is making members more active   and therefore healthier. But many insurers are also interested in programmes because they build a closer relationship with members, who usually just interact with them when they want a bill to be paid. This added engagement can make members feel more loyal and can give the insurer opportunities to nudge them into other healthy practices.

Oscar Health, an insurance start-up backed by venture capitalists including Google Ventures, put a step tracking function in its app to ensure members come back daily. Oscar gives its members a concierge team to answer questions and direct them to providers that offer the best value for money. It also encourages people to use telemedicine where possible.

Sara Wajnberg, chief product officer for the New York-based company, said the original intention was to offer  fun, gamified goals , where members can earn rewards of up to $100 in Amazon gift cards a year. But it also helps them correct perceptions that insurers are just a  billing interface  into seeing them as an  entry point into the entire healthcare system .

Oscar found that 87 per cent of members who tracked their steps engaged with the concierge team and telemedicine, compared with 57 per cent of the total membership. The company also believes it encourages members, who buy the insurance on an open marketplace rather than being offered it by an employer, to stick with them.

Aetna, the health insurance arm of US pharmacy chain CVS, is going even further, putting more healthcare services in its Attain wellness app. Using an Apple Watch, Aetna members are given personal activity goals and fed notifications including reminders to get vaccinations, refill prescriptions and visit their primary-care doctor if they have not recently. If needed, they are also nudged towards cheaper options for tests and scans.

Ben Wanamaker, head of consumer technology and services at Aetna, said the idea was to  reduce the friction  for users. He said employers recognised Aetna had these  unique capabilities  to engage members.

 They are key customers and in many cases they have shared concerns about what to do about the medical costs and the effectiveness of their employees,  he said.  You don t have to be acutely ill to be less than your best healthwise so Attain helps people get better and be more effective at work and home. 

Aetna is now working with Apple to use machine learning to improve how it personalises the product. Members can choose to send their programme data and health history to Apple, which will use it to create new features.

Andrew Matzkin, a partner at the consultancy Health Advances, said Apple could benefit from these programmes in the short term through bulk sales of the Apple Watch   but in the longer term they could inform Apple s own ambitions in healthcare.

He says one of the biggest questions is whether Apple wants to use its stores to create high-tech clinics   a sort of Genius Bar for the body. The company already owns AC Wellness, a small chain of clinics that serves its employees.

 You could imagine Apple saying eventually,  We know how to create a great consumer experience in person, in retail, and we could combine it to offer more digitally-enabled primary care ,  he says.

Banking & Finance: Aon Buys Online Insurance Startup

Insurance brokerage Aon PLC has agreed to acquire startup CoverWallet, as insurers are competing to figure out how to sell insurance to small businesses online.

CoverWallet, founded in 2015, is an online insurance platform that allows small and midsize businesses to get price quotes and buy policies for liability, workers' compensation and other types of insurance without speaking to an agent.

The companies announced the deal Wednesday. Financial terms weren't disclosed.

Insurance companies are eager to expand in the small-business insurance market, which is estimated to represent approximately $100 billion in premiums in the U.S. The U.S. small-business insurance market grew faster than the overall commercial insurance market between 2015 and 2017, according to a study released earlier this year by investment-management firm Conning.

Travelers Cos. bought U.K.-based Simply Business, a small-business online insurance broker, in 2017. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. started selling small-business insurance online through its biBERK brand in recent years and earlier this year launched a new policy for small businesses, called THREE, that combines a variety of insurance policies into one three-page policy.

Insurers are betting that advanced data and analytics can help them price policies for these customers more accurately and cheaply. Small-business insurance is a popular space for startups focused on insurance technology, or "insurtech."

But convincing small-business owners to buy insurance online has been a slow process. Online sales account for less than 5% of small-business insurance sales and could grow to 12% by 2023, consultant Novarica said in a February study.

Shopping for insurance can be an onerous process for small businesses, as each insurer can require an application, with dozens of questions to answer.The majority of small businesses in the U.S. rely on agents to help them navigate the process and advise them on which policies to buy.

CoverWallet offers one streamlined application that can autofill data pulled from outside sources and cut down on the number of questions.

"The way the insurance market works today is very manual," Inaki Berenguer, CoverWallet's chief executive, said in an interview. "We are leveraging data science and technology to make this process very simple."

The company has bet that as younger, tech-savvy entrepreneurs start businesses, they will prefer to handle their insurance buying online. Most CoverWallet customers have fewer than 150 employees, and many of them buy insurance outside business hours, Mr. Berenguer said.

CoverWallet also has a version of its platform for agents to use when helping their clients, an acknowledgment that most small businesses still prefer to speak with agents.
