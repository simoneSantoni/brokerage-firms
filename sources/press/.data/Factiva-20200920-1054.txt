Rival bids offer two visions for LSE as insatiable demand provides bourses with promise for future

Mergers and acquisitions among exchanges has sometimes been likened to a game of chess. In a world where prized assets are scarce, a move by a major player forces the hand of another.

So it is withHong Kong Exchanges and Clearing, which is taking a rebuffed 32bn bid for theLondon Stock Exchange Group to shareholders. The Chinese exchange is hoping to break up a $27bn deal the LSE struck to buyRefinitiv, a data and trading group.

If either deal completes it will be by far the largest exchanges deal in history, and underscore how the industry s biggest bourses have been radically remoulded since the turn of the century.

 It has been such a dynamic industry; driven by regulatory, geopolitical, macroeconomic, technological changes,  said David Schwimmer, chief executive of the LSE, said on Thursday.

In the late 1990s exchanges began facing competition as electronic competition began to eat at their profits. The broad response was the shed their mutual status and hunt for new markets.

A period of intense dealmaking began, characterised by megadeals and dramatic interventions. In the mid-noughties the CME Group set itself up to become the world s largest exchange by market value with the $8bn purchase of the Chicago Board of Trade and an $8.9bn deal for the New York Mercantile Exchange. Intercontinental Exchange, which also bid for the CBOT, consoled itself with the New York Board of Trade for $1bn.

The LSE bought Borsa Italiana and Nasdaq and Deutsche Brse   having both failed with bids for the LSE   purchased OMX and the International Securities Exchange. The New York Stock Exchange used its shares to acquire Archipelago and merge with Euronext.

That heightened buying spree slowed as the crisis led regulators and politicians to reassess their assumptions about financial markets and flex their muscles. A turning point was the Australian government blocking Singapore s SGX from buying ASX, operator of the main Australian exchange, in 2011.

Deutsche Brse suffered twice when EU antitrust regulators blocked its mergers with the LSE and NYSE Euronext. Successful big deals were rare. ICE   a commodity derivatives bourse which was only founded in 1999   grabbed attention with the $8.2bn purchase of the NYSE in 2013.

Those that were approved tended to be where there was little competitive overlap. Exchanges had begun to realise that ambitious cross-border deals were fraught with manybeginning to see themselves very differently to their histories as venues for trading. It was the world s insatiable demand for data that offered the most promise for the future.

ICE made the first pivot, purchasing Interactive Data Corp for $5.2bn. Others soon followed; Deutsche Brse bought Axioma, an analytics company, in a deal worth $850m.

LSE shareholders now can choose between two different deals that will define its future. Mr Schwimmer has put his bet on Refinitiv, arguing there are two big drivers of change.

 One is the increasing importance of data and analytics. The other is with more and more electronic trading, we think there will be an increasing importance of multi-asset class trading and investment strategies. 

HKEX is offering a more traditional exchange deal based on connecting China s markets with the more than $1.8tn of derivatives business that flows through London every day.

 The combination of HKEX and the LSE makes perfect sense from a strategic perspective 	. 	. 	. 	but the reality is that there s little chance this transaction will gain the regulatory and political approvals necessary to consummate it,  said David Tabaka, analyst at Burton-Taylor.

Shareholders will not only have to weigh up their vision of the future, but which deal has the best chance of success.

Lunch with the FT

There are only two rules at Blackstone: no internal politics and do not lose money. Over poached lobster in Mayfair, the private equity firm's combative co-founder talks to Lionel Barber about risk-taking, Trump whispering and why the rich shouldn't have to pay more tax

W hen Stephen Schwarzman originally proposed lunch, he suggested two venues: Claridge's or St Tropez. Naively, I assumed there was a choice. A rendezvous on the Cte d'Azur, where Schwarzman enjoys one of his many palatial residences, was always a tad risky for a man who loves to control the situation.

Invited for 12.15pm, I spot Schwarzman standing centre stage in The Foyer & Reading Room restaurant. Short and tanned, he's wearing a lightly pinstriped dark suit with his favourite combination: blue-striped shirt with white collar and purple tie. He's put on a few pounds since he was a top runner in high school and college, but at 72 he still looks trim.

Encounters with Schwarzman are rarely dull. He's a combative character who, while outwardly charming, does not take kindly to criticism. We've exchanged expletives in Davos and in his luxuriously appointed office at Blackstone, the Wall Street private equity and asset management firm he co-founded 34 years ago. But there have never been any hard feelings.

Schwarzman's fortune (net worth about $18bn) has bought him power and influence. He's graduated from being a mega dealmaker to philanthropist, back channel in US-China relations and "Trump whisperer". I want to explore these multiple roles, but also pin down why the man who has built one of the most successful financial businesses on the planet has never quite received the credit he believes he deserves.

A Wall Street rival offers a clue: "Steve is one of the most honest people I know. Most people lie to your face. He'll always tell you straight up he's going to screw you."

As we study our menus, I raise the character question. His restless, driven nature is legendary. "Yes, it's true," he admits. "It goes with the territory, the person." As if on cue, he announces we're moving table because of a cold draught, compounded by noisy neighbours.

Schwarzman says, half-joking, that unlike his younger twin brothers he inherited "the right gene mix" from his mother, "a very formidable, strong survivor". His father by contrast was "a lovely, super-bright but not ambitious person" who ran a linen store in Philadelphia. "We could have been Bed Bath & Beyond. I don't know why not. That's the way my mind has always worked, he just had no interest. Fascinating."

My guest is not given to self-doubt.

Accepted at Yale, he phoned the dean of admissions at Harvard to parley his way in. (He was rejected.) After Harvard Business School, he joined Lehman Brothers. He always coveted the top job, but the infighting was murderous and he ended up selling the failing bank to American Express. He struck out on his own, co-founding Blackstone in 1985 with Pete Peterson, the former Lehman chairman and Nixon-era commerce secretary. Our waiter arrives bearing water. Schwarzman orders tomato and basil soup, followed by poached lobster salad. I choose smoked salmon and grilled Dover sole off the bone. Alcohol is out because I am on dry August and my guest says he only drinks wine sparingly. (Schwarzman takes an anticoagulant pill a day to ward off phlebitis, a vein inflammation that killed his grandfather.) Blackstone started as a boutique advisory firm, with the goal of making enough money to start its own private equity fund. Private equity has attracted controversy because of alleged asset-stripping: buying companies, loading them with debt ("leverage") and selling them off at a handsome profit, with favourable tax treatment.

Schwarzman casts himself as a longterm investor, not a scavenger in sheep's clothing. He recounts with gusto the megadeals and the risk-taking involved in picking the right time to buy and sell assets, ranging from US Steel's railroad network to the Waldorf hotel.

His skill is market timing. Blackstone has expanded into real estate and hedge funds and other "alternative assets", with $545bn under management today. Blackstone funds are also the largest owner of real estate in the world. The firm's rise epitomises the "buy side" revolution that favours asset managers at the expense of traditional banks trading liquid securities.

Schwarzman has written a book, which is part memoir, part Blackstone management primer called What It Takes: Lessons in the Pursuit of Excellence. (A better title would be Whatever It Takes, I suggest.) There are many valuable insights; perhaps the biggest is the list of endorsements featuring Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, the ex-Google chairman, Janet Yellen, the ex-Fed chair, and Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England.

Peterson and Schwarzman worked together for 33 years, but the father-son relationship fell apart at the end. Peterson felt he had been squeezed out of his fair share of an expanding business. Schwarzman argued that he was the rainmaker, the firm was hiring more people and something had to give. "He had reached a different stage in his career and he volunteered to reduce his interest in the firm and did."

This is the unsentimental side of Schwarzman. He appears not to care. He prides himself on his intuition (Blackstone went public ahead of the Great Crash in 2008 and, with fresh capital, positioned itself perfectly for the rebound). He also highlights his ability to recruit and retain high-quality executives such as Tony James, his longtime number two, and Jon Gray, the real estate guru, both fellow billionaires.

Blackstone is a meritocracy, he says, where two iron rules apply: no internal politics and do not lose money. "I go from the premise that anybody of talent does not want necessarily to be a private in an army. The lowest they want is to be a lieutenant colonel and preferably they'd all like to be generals."

Hang on, I say, there's no mistaking who's generalissimo at Blackstone. Schwarzman still signs all cheques above $250,000, retains a veto on major decisions and later declares: "I don't think I'll ever retire. My grandfather never did."

Anyway, surely someone loses money some time, I add.

He half-concedes the point: "Every once in a while there's some weird fucking thing where government does something or there's a technological breakthrough that's transformative that a reasonable person couldn't know what is going to happen. And so that introduces what I call unpredictable risk, and you can get, potentially, picked off by that."

I ask Schwarzman how his lobster tastes. "Pretty good," he replies, picking at the pink flesh. My Dover sole is fresh and tasty. So how does Schwarzman assess the state of modern capitalism? "Well, I would answer that with another question: what's the state of modern politics?" The "rejiggering" of governments in the west, he argues, is a legacy of the financial crisis, globalisation and a massive transfer of jobs and wealth to emerging markets such as China. And that's before the impact of technology. These trends have squeezed the middle class and lower-income groups.

His remedies start with an increase in the minimum wage to about $15, up from single digits. This will destroy some jobs, but it will directly benefit 15 to 20 per cent of the population, with a knock-on effect on compensation for another 20 per cent, he argues.

Schwarzman wants to dramatically improve education levels in the US. He would make teachers tax exempt so as to raise wages and create "a new privileged class". Two-thirds of America's workforce went to high school or less, he says. "This is not the workforce of the future."

Finally, he would encourage the Baby Boom generation that's retiring to take up jobs as mentors and assistant teachers. (In a pre-lunch gesture, he offered to donate all book proceeds to Lucy Kellaway's like-minded charity, Now Teach. The offer was accepted.) How about the mega rich paying more taxes? Schwarzman looks incredulous. "Taxes on the wealthy?" Well, why not? "The tax system in the US is extremely progressive ... it's a reverse pyramid. The top 10 per cent pays 70 per cent [of the tax take]. The top 1 per cent pays 38 to 40. I pay around 48 to 47 per cent tax rate." (He later clarifies this is a "blended rate" covering ordinary income, capital gains and dividends.) Schwarzman can be tin-eared. He once compared a proposal to tax private equity executives selling their publicly listed stock as ordinary income to Hitler invading Poland. He says it was a private conversation, but does not deny railing against the "semi-socialist" Obama administration. Today, socialism is no longer a dirty word in the Democratic party. Is he worried about the 2020 presidential election? "The politics of anger and free things is a powerful potential elector," he says, adding that the US is more polarised than ever in his lifetime. "Vietnam was about one issue. This is much more intense, much more far-reaching."

The gravity of the conversation demands light relief, happily provided by the waiter, who congratulates Schwarzman on his choice of the upside down strawberry tart as dessert.

Waiter: "It's the new style."

LB: "New style?" Waiter: "Yes sir." LB: "What's the old style? Waiter: "A regular strawberry tart." Schwarzman won't talk on the record about Donald Trump, a wearily familiar response from chief executives, even billionaires. Yet as chairman and chief executive of Blackstone, he's running the firm while also advising Trump. He says the potential conflicts of interest are manageable, but there have been awkward moments, especially after he had to disband the chief executive panel advising Trump in the wake of far-right violence in Charlottesville in 2017.

Did Trump equivocate about the farright? "Most of us had no idea there were Nazis in America. That may mean we're naive ... We also had no idea there was something called anti-fascistas who also used violence. The whole thing was completely disorienting."

Trump, he concludes, did not get his words right first time. The second time, it "looked right". By the third time, the US had experienced "a societygalvanising moment".

S chwarzman has been accused of wearing too many hats. In China, where Blackstone has important business, he's tried to be a bridge builder; but he agrees that relations between Beijing and the US are at a low point.

"China has enjoyed the most stunning transformation in the past 40 years of any country, most probably, in world history. It did it through a variety of mechanisms that are not consistent with the rules and regulations of the developed world."

Now, in effect, the US is asking Beijing to adopt western practices. This, he admits, is very difficult. But, he suggests, the Chinese leadership has been told that however difficult they think Trump is, the Democrats could be far worse in terms of trade protectionism.

We turn to Schwarzman's generous philanthropy. In recent years, he has donated $100m to the New York Public Library, $150m to Yale, 150m to Oxford university, $350m to MIT. He's also set up the Schwarzman scholars, a one-year masters programme on global affairs for top international students to study at Tsinghua University in Beijing. (Full disclosure: I have served on the 200-strong panel of judges for the past four years.) Schwarzman says he only wants to donate to causes that are "paradigm shifting", such as the artificial intelligence lab at MIT. But he is a hard-boiled negotiator when it comes to disbursing money and naming rights. The New York Public Library became so frustrated that they proposed putting his name on the roof (that way his name would be seen by every plane flying over Manhattan to La Guardia). The funds came through. (Schwarzman's name is now on every entrance to its main building.) The ego has landed in many other prestigious locations. His 60th birthday party in 2007, featuring Rod Stewart in Manhattan's Armory, was reported to have closed Park Avenue ("It was only one lane," he protests). His 70th was an equally extravagant affair with an ancient Silk Road theme held at a fivestar hotel near President Trump's Mara-Lago estate in Florida. Why is glitz and showiness so integral to Steve Schwarzman? "That's a good question," he says, attributing his aesthetic taste partly to his second wife, Christine. "I like generally doing things that nobody has done. I also like to do things that are beautiful."

He points to the striking glass sculpture in the Foyer, with writhing snakes hanging like a chandelier. This was part of the refurbishment of Claridge's, a trophy picked up when Blackstone bought the Savoy Group 21 years ago. "I actually went out to the state of Washington and met with the sculptor Dale Chihuly to check it out."

Schwarzman wonders aloud how lucky he has been a rare moment when the scrappy self-made man lets himself go. I note that we are meeting on the 100th anniversary of the death of Andrew Carnegie, the Scottishborn steel magnate, one of the world's greatest philanthropists who gave away his entire fortune (about $300bn at today's prices).

"Do you agree with Carnegie when he said: he who dies rich dies disgraced?" Schwarzman offers a rambling answer about America's "tax infrastructure". So will he follow Warren Buffett's rallying call to the rich to donate more than 50 per cent of their fortune to charity? (Buffett himself has gone higher, to 99 per cent). "Maybe I will, maybe I won't, but to me that's not relevant ... obviously I've given it a lot of thought and the vast amount will go to charity."

Two and a half hours have passed. I switch off the tape recorder. Schwarzman looks slightly relieved. Just as I'm preparing to settle the bill, Wall Street's arch dealmaker pulls out a copy of the FT and points to an ad highlighting the longlist of the McKinsey-FT business book of the year.

"What It Takes did not make the list. Is it really too late?" Whatever it takes.

SoftBank reaps instant profit from Wirecard debt shuffle

Japanese conglomerate had agreed a Buffett-like investment in German group

SoftBank cut its exposure to Wirecard this week within hours of signing a strategic tie-up with the German payments company, in a move that could net the Japanese conglomerate a big profit while taking little risk.

SoftBank announced in April that it had agreed to pour  ¬900m into Wirecard, providing a vital vote of confidence in the Aschheim-based company that has faced controversy over its accounting.

SoftBank did not purchase a stake in Wirecard, however. Instead it bought a convertib le bond, a type of debt that can be repaid in stock rather than cash.

Wirecard s shareholders gave final approval to the transaction on Wednesday, while also formally signing a  strategic cooperation agreement  with SoftBank. The following day, Credit Suisse sold a new  ¬900m Wirecard bond that is exchangeable for stock to a broad group of investors.

The new deal effectively means that SoftBank has taken the money it invested off the table, in what SoftBank executives described as a  return optimisation  measure.

SoftBank and Credit Suisse declined to comment. Wirecard did not respond to requests for comment.

Analysts at brokerage Stifel said that Thursday s deal offloads the  economic risk  of the Japanese group s bet on Wirecard, adding that the deal effectively allows SoftBank to make good on its April commitment  without having to provide funding .

SoftBank still has skin in the game, however, because Wirecard s shares have rallied strongly since it announced the deal. The Japanese group has retained exposure to 3m shares   now worth around  ¬450m   and can also profit on a further 3.9m shares up to a price of around  ¬230 per share. Wirecard s shares are currently trading at  ¬149.

The Wirecard investment was made through a special fund managed by SoftBank Investment Advisers, which manages the group s influential $100bn Vision Fund.

Capital for the deal came from SoftBank, some of its employees and Mubadala, Abu Dhabi s state investment company, according to people familiar with the matter. Mubadala is the second-biggest backer of the Vision Fund after Saudi Arabia s Public Investment Fund. Mubadala did not respond to requests for comment.

A senior SoftBank executive told the Financial Times that the Wirecard trade was inspired by Warren Buffett, who has a record of making highly structured investments in seemingly troubled companies that then benefit from his reputation.

Mr Buffett s Berkshire Hathaway bought $5bn of preferred equity in Goldman Sachs during the height of the financial crisis, for example. This paid a hefty 10 per cent annual dividend and netted Mr Buffett billions of dollars of profit when the investment bank later bought back his stake.

The so-called  repackaging  of SoftBank s convertible bond was sold to investors at less generous terms than those the Japanese group extracted from Wirecard.

While repackagings are relatively common for small deals, convertible bond investors and bankers said that it is unusual to see one conducted on such a large scale.

SoftBank frequently makes use of equity derivatives such as those seen on its Wirecard trade, often as a way of employing leverage   raising debt against its stakes that can be deployed on other investments. For example, a so-called   equity collar  on shares in Chinese internet giant Alibaba helped SoftBank raise the funds to buy shares in Arm, the UK chip designer, before a takeover bid in 2016.

SoftBank took profit on its Wirecard trade at a time when the group is coming under renewed scrutiny for its outsized bets on tech companies. Investors in SoftBank s Vision Fund are braced for hefty writedowns on some of its investments. One of them, WeWork, has shelved its public listing while valuations for freshly listed Uber and Slack have tumbled.

Wirecard said its cooperation agreement with SoftBank would allow both companies to  pursue global growth opportunities and synergy effects, including through the SoftBank ecosystem in the fields of digital financial services, data analysis and artificial intelligence .

*This article has been amended since original publication to clarify the potential profit SoftBank stands to make.

EXCHANGE --- Markets: Contract Expirations Push Stock Volatility Up

Stock volatility jumped this week, with turbulence heightened on Friday as a flurry of derivatives expired.

The Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, rose Friday, gaining about 9% as the S&P 500 ticked down to end the week. The options-based gauge traded at Cboe Global Markets Inc. tends to fall when the S&P 500 is rising, and vice versa.

Friday is so-called quadruple witching, which occurs four times a year and refers to the day that options and futures on both indexes and stocks expire.

Some investors and analysts say the simultaneous expiration can spur greater volatility in markets as volumes pick up. The day tends to boost trading activity because investors readjust expiring positions. Investors sometimes choose to roll over their positions so that they expire later in time or close them entirely.

Options give investors the right to buy or sell shares of stock at a specific price, later in time. Calls confer the right to buy, while puts give the right to sell.

"There's often increased volume and volatility," said Elisabeth Kashner, director of ETF research and analytics at FactSet.

Happy Friday. Despite venture capital's current bull-market run, Josh Kopelman, co-founder and partner at First Round Capital, said he expects the asset class to underperform in the next few years.

Mr. Kopelman cited the increase in the number of growth funds, rising startup valuations and the faster speed with which deals get done that "are reducing the time to evaluate the opportunity," as reasons he believes venture returns overall would suffer.

Mr. Kopelman was speaking Wednesday at the Primary Venture Partners' summit in New York. He added that VCs need to have a thesis for why they believe they would outperform the asset class in this set of circumstances.

As of the first quarter of 2019, the Cambridge Associates LLC US Venture Capital Index, based on data on some 1,862 venture funds, has outperformed the S&P 500 Index over the past one, five, 15, 20 and 25 years, but it has underperformed if compared to the S&P 500 over the past three and 10-year intervals.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Mushroom deals. A startup backed by $80 million from investors is striking deals with a range of drug companies in its bid to lead the next wave of mental-health treatments, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/atai-life-sciences-is-assembling-a-mental-health-drug-platform-11568924265?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc&tesla=y".

* Munich-based Atai Life Sciences AG has formed and financed several companies creating new drugs from unusual and controversial substances including psilocybin, found in "magic mushrooms," and ketamine, which is nicknamed "Special K" and sometimes used illicitly.

* But the company intends to play a much larger part in a recent flurry of activity in drug-development innovation in mental health following decades of inactivity.

* Founded in 2017, Atai is riding a wave of renewed interest from researchers, investors and regulatory bodies in developing and commercializing new therapies from substances that might be controversial, overlooked or underused, such as the use of ketamine to treat depression, and MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy, to treat post-traumatic stress disorder.

Sky high. Stripe Inc. climbed closer to the top ranks of the highest-priced U.S. startups after a new funding round valued the financial-technology company at $35 billion, the Journal's Peter Rudegeair reports. Sequoia Capital, General Catalyst and Andreessen Horowitz were among the investors behind the $250 million investment, the company said Thursday. The $35 billion valuation, up about 50% from an early 2019 funding round, puts Stripe above Silicon Valley darlings Airbnb Inc. and Palantir Technologies Inc.

Blog cash. Automattic Inc., the parent company of web publishing and e-commerce platforms such as WordPress.com, has raised $300 million in its latest investment round, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wordpress-parent-raises-300-million-11568934656?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc". Salesforce Ventures, the venture arm of Salesforce.com Inc., led the Series D round that values the San Francisco-based startup at $3 billion. That is three times its valuation after a $160 million Series C round in 2014, Automattic founder and Chief Executive Matt Mullenweg said. Mr. Mullenweg said in an interview that the capital will be used to scale up its products, including WordPress.com, WordPress VIP, WooCommerce, Jetpack, and Tumblr.

IPO plans. Home-sharing company Airbnb Inc. expects to go public next year, the company said Thursday. The company didn't release other details about an initial public offering. WSJ Pro "https://www.wsj.com/articles/airbnbs-first-quarter-financials-show-strong-growth-rate-cash-reserves-11565998183?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc" that Airbnb was planning to go public in the first half of next year, citing people familiar with the situation.

VC diversity. Almost half of employees at venture-capital funds in London say their companies are doing nothing to correct the under-representation of women and ethnic minorities in the industry, according to Private Equity News, citing a new report by Diversity VC.

Cloud IPO. Shares of Datadog Inc. jumped as they made their debut in the public markets, reflecting robust investor demand for companies tied to cloud-based technologies. The New York-based company's stock shot up 39% to $37.55. Index Ventures, OpenView Venture Partners and Iconiq Strategic Partners were among the company's biggest investors. Read more.

Salad Chain Sweetgreen's Tech Focus Helps Push Valuation to $1.6 Billion; Hedge-fund firms bankroll restaurant chain's expansion and food-delivery plans

Investors are putting another $150 million behind Sweetgreen Inc., betting that the salad restaurant chain's embrace of technology will deliver them an exit in a sector that has seen minimal venture activity in recent years.

The Culver City, Calif.-based company said it was valued at $1.6 billion in the financing round, up from a $1 billion valuation when it last raised capital 10 months ago. A pair of hedge-fund managers, Lone Pine Capital and D1 Capital Partners, led the round, with participation from True Ventures and other existing investors.

Sweetgreen first raised outside capital early this decade, when the food sector was gaining some traction with venture investors. Some venture capitalists had shied away from bricks-and-mortar businesses, preferring to fund startups with internet-based business models. Others saw an opportunity to fund fast-growing brands.

Yogurt shop Pinkberry Inc. and sandwich shops the Melt and Potbelly Corp. also raised funding around the same time, and Blue Bottle Coffee Inc. and Philz Coffee Inc. became popular with venture investors, drawing comparisons to the early days of Starbucks Corp., when it was backed by venture capital.

A few of these companies have managed to exit. Potbelly went public in 2013, and Nestl SA"https://www.wsj.com/articles/nestle-buys-majority-stake-in-premium-coffee-chain-blue-bottle-1505407881" Blue Bottle in 2017. Private-equity firm Riverwood Capital invested in the Melt in 2013.

Jon Callaghan, co-founder of True Ventures, invested in Blue Bottle and hopes to replicate some of that success with Sweetgreen. He acknowledged it is difficult to create a differentiated business in the food category, but he said Sweetgreen's customer loyalty and incorporation of technology distinguish it from other salad shops.

"Today's consumer really wants the brand to mean something," Mr. Callaghan said. Sweetgreen represents "incredible fidelity to the supply chain, incredible commitment to sustainability," he said.

Jonathan Neman, Sweetgreen's co-founder and chief executive, said most purchases at its "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sweetgreen-salad-new-store-model-tech-incubator-11563280524" are made through its smartphone app. He said he expects that to continue when the company begins offering deliveries through its app next year.

The move will put Sweetgreen in the same category as several delivery apps that have raised venture funding, including Postmates Inc. and DoorDash Inc. However, Sweetgreen will focus on delivering its own food and will remain on Uber Eats and other delivery apps.

Sweetgreen also uses digital products to forecast sales, deploy labor and order food, Mr. Neman said. The technology is primarily driven by data and machine learning, he said.

"We don't consider ourselves just a salad place," Mr. Neman said.

Kelly Granat, a portfolio manager at Lone Pine Capital, said she invested in Sweetgreen because she is optimistic about the company's growth.

"We're investing here with the hopes that this will be a public company one day," she said.

Sweetgreen plans to use the new capital to launch its app-based delivery program and to set up more designated delivery locations in office buildings. The company also plans to open new retail locations in Miami; Denver; and Austin, Texas.

The latest funding round brings the company's total amount raised to more than $500 million since it was founded in 2007. Fidelity Investments led a $200 million round last November at a $1 billion valuation. Other prior venture investors include Revolution and Collaborative Fund.

Happy Friday! This morning's news that Nordic Capital has sold a stake in itself should hardly surprise WSJ Pro readers. After all, firms have been selling stakes in themselves at a steady pace for years now, including recent deals involving BC Partners, HGGC, GI Partners and Siris Capital. But as Will Louch writes this morning, what sets the Nordic deal apart is the buyer of its stake, Ottawa Avenue Private Capital, a unit of RDV Corp., the family office of the DeVos family. Although certainly not a newcomer to private equity, Ottawa Avenue is hardly a name that commonly pops up as a buyer of GP stakes. Could this be a future source of capital for other GPs eager to sell stakes in themselves?

Meanwhile, WSJ Pro's Laura Cooper reports that the initial public offering of Ping Identity Holdings isn't just a milestone for the cybersecurity company but also for its private-equity backer Vista Equity Partners.

Now on to today's news...

DeVos Family Office Enters Market for Buyout Firm Stakes

The latest deal in the booming market for private-equity firm stakes has gone to an unusual buyer: the DeVos family office. Ottawa Avenue Private Capital, a subsidiary of RDV Corp., which serves the extended family of U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos and her husband, Richard, is set to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/devos-family-office-affiliate-to-buy-stake-in-nordic-capital-11568973601?mod=djemPrivateEquityPro&tpl=pe" in European private-equity firm Nordic Capital, according to people familiar with the matter. Financial details of the transaction couldn't be learned, but the deal is expected to be made public later this week, WSJ Pro's Will Louch reports.

Ping Identity Holding Corp.'s initial public offering "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ping-identity-listing-marks-ipo-milestone-for-vista-11568933532?mod=djemPrivateEquityPro&tpl=pe" not only in the company's past three years of private-equity ownership, but also for its backer, Vista Equity Partners. Ping, which made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, is the first Vista portfolio company to go public since the firm's launch in 2000, WSJ Pro's Laura Cooper reports. The IPO valued the company at $1.16 billion, nearly double the $600 million a person familiar with the company said Vista paid for it in 2016. The shares closed at $20.11 Thursday, rising about 34% from the offer price of $15.

Deals

Alternative funds firm DeA Capital and other investors have agreed to sellAcque Minerali S.r.l., also known as Lurisia, to Coca-Cola HBC AGfor  ¬88 million ($97.2 million).

DeA Capital in Milan has about  ¬12 billion in assets under management, according to its website.

Lovell Minnick Partners has offered 315 pence a share to acquire Charles Taylor PLC, an insurance services company based in London, according to a regulatory filing with the London Stock Exchange. The company said the offer represents a 34% premium over its closing share price of 235 pence on Wednesday. The offer puts a value of 261 million ($326.8 million) on the deal, the filing shows. While the company's directors intend to support the bid unanimously, it requires the assent of at least 75% of shareholders at a special meeting expected to be held in November as well as regulatory approvals, according to the filing. Based in Radnor, Pa., Lovell Minnick managed about $3.5 billion in client assets at the end of last year, according to a U.S. regulatory filing.

HarbourVest Partners has acquired a minority stake in Mesa Natural Gas Solutions LLC for $52 million. Mesa provides field generators that convert natural gas coming out of oil wells into electric power for use by nearby energy companies. Mesa is a portfolio company of Dallas-based private-equity firm BP Energy Partners.

Caisse de dpt et placement du Qubec has invested 53 million Canadian dollars ($39.8 million) in Neuvoo Inc., an employment listings website and one of the fastest-growing companies in Canada.

Energy-focused Tailwater Capital said it has committed $150 million to Triten Energy Partners, a newly formed Houston-based company that will pursue downstream infrastructure projects, particularly ones focused on renewable or lower-emission end products.

Crossplane Capital has acquired a controlling interest in Accent Family of Cos. The Tomball, Texas, company makes and distributes building materials and wire products for the waste recycling and other industries. Last month, WSJ Pro's Chris Cumming reported that Dallas-based Crossplane was a third of the way to reaching its "https://www.wsj.com/articles/crossplane-capital-raises-93-8-million-so-far-for-first-fund-11565114960?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=2&mod=djemPrivateEquityPro&tpl=pe" for its first fund.

Exits

Blackstone Group Inc. is exiting its stake in NCR Corp. in exchange for $302 million in cash and 9.16 million shares of common stock valued at about $308 million on Wednesday, the Atlanta-based maker of automated teller machines said.

The New York private-equity firm sold roughly half of its NCR stake in early 2017, Dow Jones Newswires reported.

Tikehau Capital has agreed to sell its stake in HDL Development, the holding company controlling publicly traded Assystem Group, in a deal that would return 2.5 times Tikehau's initial  ¬40 million investment in 2013. Tikehau would receive  ¬55 million in cash and 657,895 Assystem shares, which closed Wednesday at  ¬38.70 each in Paris. At that price, the share stake is worth about  ¬25.5 million. An additional amount may come from the disposal of Assystem's stake in Expleo Group, Tikehau said Thursday in its earnings statement for the first half of 2019.

Funds

NexPhase Capital, a midmarket firm launched by former executives of Moelis Capital Partners, is seeking $400 million for its latest fund, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. MVision Private Equity Advisors USA LLC and Forum Capital Securities LLC are placing the fund, according to the filings. NexPhase targets investments in companies with between $5 million and $30 million of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, according to the firm's website.

Tikehau Capital has created a new private-equity secondary fund, shifting six investments from its balance sheet to the new fund, which will be supplemented with additional investor commitments to reach a target of  ¬210 million ($232 million). The Paris-based firm said the move will expand its private-equity offerings to third-party investors. It added that the transfer added  ¬10.3 million to the portfolio's first-half revenue.

Industry News

Stripe Inc. climbed closer to the top ranks of the priciest U.S. startups after a new fundraising round valued it at $35 billion, The Wall Street Journal's Peter Rudegeair reported.

Berkshire Partners has named two new advisory directors at the Boston-based firm. Both new hires, Chuck Ball and Carol Vallone, will advise portfolio companies and develop new investment ideas, the private-equity firm said. Mr. Ball most recently was senior vice president of distribution services at AmerisourceBergen Drug Corp. and remains a health-care industry consultant. Ms. Vallone has served in a variety of senior roles at software-as-a-service companies, including as president and chief executive of WebCT Inc., Wimba Corp. and Meteor Learning, and remains a director or trustee of several medical institutions in the Boston area.

Stephen Schwarzman:  I like to do things that are beautiful 

The Blackstone co-founder on risk-taking, Trump whispering   and why the rich shouldn t pay more tax

When Stephen Schwarzman originally proposed lunch, he suggested two venues: Claridge s or St Tropez. Naively, I assumed there was a choice. A rendezvous on the Cte d Azur, where Schwarzman enjoys one of his many palatial residences, was always a tad risky for a man who loves to control the situation.

Invited for 12.15pm, I spot Schwarzman standing centre stage in The Foyer & Reading Room restaurant. Short and tanned, he s wearing a lightly pinstriped dark suit with his favourite combination: blue-striped shirt with white collar and purple tie. He s put on a few pounds since he was a top runner in high school and college, but at 72 he still looks trim.

Encounters with Schwarzman are rarely dull. He s a combative character who, while outwardly charming, does not take kindly to criticism. We ve exchanged expletives in Davos and in his luxuriously appointed office at Blackstone, the Wall Street private equity and asset management firm he co-founded 34 years ago. But there have never been any hard feelings.

Schwarzman s fortune (net worth about $18bn) has bought him power and influence. He s graduated from being a mega dealmaker to philanthropist, back channel in US-China relations and  Trump whisperer . I want to explore these multiple roles, but also pin down why the man who has built one of the most successful financial businesses on the planet has never quite received the credit he believes he deserves.

A Wall Street rival offers a clue:  Steve is one of the most honest people I know. Most people lie to your face. He ll always tell you straight up he s going to screw you. 

As we study our menus, I raise the character question. His restless, driven nature is legendary.  Yes, it s true,  he admits.  It goes with the territory, the person.  As if on cue, he announces we re moving table because of a cold draught, compounded by noisy neighbours.

Schwarzman says, half-joking, that unlike his younger twin brothers he inherited  the right gene mix  from his mother,  a very formidable, strong survivor . His father by contrast was  a lovely, super-bright but not ambitious person  who ran a linen store in Philadelphia.  We could have been Bed Bath & Beyond. I don t know why not. That s the way my mind has always worked, he just had no interest. Fascinating. 

My guest is not given to self-doubt. Accepted at Yale, he phoned the dean of admissions at Harvard to parley his way in. (He was rejected.) After Harvard Business School, he joined Lehman Brothers. He always coveted the top job, but the infighting was murderous and he ended up selling the failing bank to American Express. He struck out on his own, co-founding Blackstone in 1985 with Pete Peterson, the former Lehman chairman and Nixon-era commerce secretary.

Our waiter arrives bearing water. Schwarzman orders tomato and basil soup, followed by poached lobster salad. I choose smoked salmon and grilled Dover sole off the bone. Alcohol is out because I am on dry August and my guest says he only drinks wine sparingly. (Schwarzman takes an anticoagulant pill a day to ward off phlebitis, a vein inflammation that killed his grandfather.)

Blackstone started as a boutique advisory firm, with the goal of making enough money to start its own private equity fund. Private equity has attracted controversy because of alleged asset-stripping: buying companies, loading them with debt ( leverage ) and selling them off at a handsome profit, with favourable tax treatment.

Schwarzman casts himself as a long-term investor, not a scavenger in sheep s clothing. He recounts with gusto the megadeals and the risk-taking involved in picking the right time to buy and sell assets, ranging from US Steel s railroad network to the Waldorf hotel.

His skill is market timing. Blackstone has expanded into real estate and hedge funds and other  alternative assets , with $545bn under management today. Blackstone funds are also the largest owner of real estate in the world. The firm s rise epitomises the  buy side  revolution that favours asset managers at the expense of traditional banks trading liquid securities.

Schwarzman has written a book, which is part memoir, part Blackstone management primer called What It Takes: Lessons in the Pursuit of Excellence. (A better title would be Whatever It Takes, I suggest.) There are many valuable insights; perhaps the biggest is the list of endorsements featuring Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, the ex-Google chairman, Janet Yellen, the ex-Fed chair, and Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England.

Peterson and Schwarzman worked together for 33 years, but the father-son relationship fell apart at the end. Peterson felt he had been squeezed out of his fair share of an expanding business. Schwarzman argued that he was the rainmaker, the firm was hiring more people and something had to give.  He had reached a different stage in his career and he volunteered to reduce his interest in the firm and did. 

This is the unsentimental side of Schwarzman. He appears not to care. He prides himself on his intuition (Blackstone went public ahead of the Great Crash in 2008 and, with fresh capital, positioned itself perfectly for the rebound). He also highlights his ability to recruit and retain high-quality executives such as Tony James, his longtime number two, and Jon Gray, the real estate guru, both fellow billionaires.

Blackstone is a meritocracy, he says, where two iron rules apply: no internal politics and do not lose money.  I go from the premise that anybody of talent does not want necessarily to be a private in an army. The lowest they want is to be a lieutenant colonel and preferably they d all like to be generals. 

Hang on, I say, there s no mistaking who s generalissimo at Blackstone. Schwarzman still signs all cheques above $250,000, retains a veto on major decisions and later declares:  I don t think I ll ever retire. My grandfather never did. 

Anyway, surely someone loses money some time, I add.

He half-concedes the point:  Every once in a while there s some weird fucking thing where government does something or there s a technological breakthrough that s transformative that a reasonable person couldn t know what is going to happen. And so that introduces what I call unpredictable risk, and you can get, potentially, picked off by that. 

I ask Schwarzman how his lobster tastes.  Pretty good,  he replies, picking at the pink flesh. My Dover sole is fresh and tasty. So how does Schwarzman assess the state of modern capitalism?

 Well, I would answer that with another question: what s the state of modern politics? 

The  rejiggering  of governments in the west, he argues, is a legacy of the financial crisis, globalisation and a massive transfer of jobs and wealth to emerging markets such as China. And that s before the impact of technology. These trends have squeezed the middle class and lower-income groups.

His remedies start with an increase in the minimum wage to about $15, up from single digits. This will destroy some jobs, but it will directly benefit 15 to 20 per cent of the population, with a knock-on effect on compensation for another 20 per cent, he argues.

Schwarzman wants to dramatically improve education levels in the US. He would make teachers tax exempt so as to raise wages and create  a new privileged class . Two-thirds of America s workforce went to high school or less, he says.  This is not the workforce of the future. 

Finally, he would encourage the Baby Boom generation that s retiring to take up jobs as mentors and assistant teachers. (In a pre-lunch gesture, he offered to donate all book proceeds to Lucy Kellaway s like-minded charity, Now Teach. The offer was accepted.)

How about the mega rich paying more taxes? Schwarzman looks incredulous.  Taxes on the wealthy? 

Well, why not?

 The tax system in the US is extremely progressive 	. 	. 	. 	it s a reverse pyramid. The top 10 per cent pays 70 per cent [of the tax take]. The top 1 per cent pays 38 to 40. I pay around 48 to 47 per cent tax rate.  (He later clarifies this is a  blended rate  covering ordinary income, capital gains and dividends.)

Schwarzman can be tin-eared. He once compared a proposal to tax private equity executives selling their publicly listed stock as ordinary income to Hitler invading Poland. He says it was a private conversation, but does not deny railing against the  semi-socialist  Obama administration. Today, socialism is no longer a dirty word in the Democratic party. Is he worried about the 2020 presidential election?

 The politics of anger and free things is a powerful potential elector,  he says, adding that the US is more polarised than ever in his lifetime.  Vietnam was about one issue. This is much more intense, much more far-reaching. 

The gravity of the conversation demands light relief, happily provided by the waiter, who congratulates Schwarzman on his choice of the upside down strawberry tart as dessert.

Waiter:  It s the new style. 

LB:  New style? 

Waiter:  Yes sir. 

LB:  What s the old style?

Waiter:  A regular strawberry tart. 

Schwarzman won t talk on the record about Donald Trump, a wearily familiar response from chief executives, even billionaires. Yet as chairman and chief executive of Blackstone, he s running the firm while also advising Trump. He says the potential conflicts of interest are manageable, but there have been awkward moments, especially after he had to disband the chief executive panel advising Trump in the wake of far-right violence in Charlottesville in 2017.

Did Trump equivocate about the far-right?  Most of us had no idea there were Nazis in America. That may mean we re naive 	. 	. 	. 	We also had no idea there was something called anti-fascistas who also used violence. The whole thing was completely disorienting. 

Trump, he concludes, did not get his words right first time. The second time, it  looked right . By the third time, the US had experienced  a society-galvanising moment .

Schwarzman has been accused of wearing too many hats. In China, where Blackstone has important business, he s tried to be a bridge builder; but he agrees that relations between Beijing and the US are at a low point.

 China has enjoyed the most stunning transformation in the past 40 years of any country, most probably, in world history. It did it through a variety of mechanisms that are not consistent with the rules and regulations of the developed world. 

Now, in effect, the US is asking Beijing to adopt western practices. This, he admits, is very difficult. But, he suggests, the Chinese leadership has been told that however difficult they think Trump is, the Democrats could be far worse in terms of trade protectionism.

We turn to Schwarzman s generous philanthropy. In recent years, he has donated $100m to the New York Public Library, $150m to Yale, 150m to Oxford university, $350m to MIT. He s also set up the Schwarzman scholars, a one-year masters programme on global affairs for top international students to study at Tsinghua University in Beijing. (Full disclosure: I have served on the 200-strong panel of judges for the past four years.)

Schwarzman says he only wants to donate to causes that are  paradigm shifting , such as the artificial intelligence lab at MIT. But he is a hard-boiled negotiator when it comes to disbursing money and naming rights. The New York Public Library became so frustrated that they proposed putting his name on the roof (that way his name would be seen by every plane flying over Manhattan to La Guardia). The funds came through. (Schwarzman s name is now on every entrance to its main building.)

The ego has landed in many other prestigious locations. His 60th birthday party in 2007, featuring Rod Stewart in Manhattan s Armory, was reported to have closed Park Avenue ( It was only one lane,  he protests). His 70th was an equally extravagant affair with an ancient Silk Road theme held at a five-star hotel near President Trump s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.

Why is glitz and showiness so integral to Steve Schwarzman?

 That s a good question,  he says, attributing his aesthetic taste partly to his second wife, Christine.  I like generally doing things that nobody has done. I also like to do things that are beautiful. 

He points to the striking glass sculpture in the Foyer, with writhing snakes hanging like a chandelier. This was part of the refurbishment of Claridge s, a trophy picked up when Blackstone bought the Savoy Group 21 years ago.  I actually went out to the state of Washington and met with the sculptor Dale Chihuly to check it out. 

Schwarzman wonders aloud how lucky he has been   a rare moment when the scrappy self-made man lets himself go. I note that we are meeting on the 100th anniversary of the death of Andrew Carnegie, the Scottish-born steel magnate, one of the world s greatest philanthropists who gave away his entire fortune (about $300bn at today s prices).

 Do you agree with Carnegie when he said: he who dies rich dies disgraced? 

Schwarzman offers a rambling answer about America s  tax infrastructure . So will he follow Warren Buffett s rallying call to the rich to donate more than 50 per cent of their fortune to charity? (Buffett himself has gone higher, to 99 per cent).  Maybe I will, maybe I won t, but to me that s not relevant 	. 	. 	. 	obviously I ve given it a lot of thought and the vast amount will go to charity. 

Two and a half hours have passed. I switch off the tape recorder. Schwarzman looks slightly relieved.

Just as I m preparing to settle the bill, Wall Street s arch dealmaker pulls out a copy of the FT and points to an ad highlighting the longlist of the McKinsey-FT business book of the year.

 What It Takes did not make the list. Is it really too late? 

Whatever it takes.

Good day. We report on new funds from five firms in today's newsletter, demonstrating the breadth of the venture industry's reach and its continued ability to raise more capital.

Data Collective raised $725 million to invest in deep technology-related startups, while publicly traded Splunk Inc. launched a corporate venture arm called Splunk Ventures with two funds: a $100 million Innovation Fund and a $50 million social impact fund.

Meanwhile, Revolution Ventures closed its latest $215 million fund to invest in startups outside of the main coastal tech centers. Afore Capital raised a $77 million second fund to invest in pre-seed rounds, the latest iteration in venture capital as seed funds get larger and become more commonplace. And Vertex Ventures SEA & India raised $305 million for deals in Asia.

And now on to the news...

In the News

SoftBank's New York move. SoftBank Group Corp. plans to open a New York office for its Vision Fund, marking the global investor's fifth base of operations and positioning it to tap more actively into the city's startup scene, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbanks-vision-fund-to-open-new-york-office-11568838843?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc".

* The New York office will open soon, according to Lydia Jett, a SoftBank partner, who was speaking Wednesday at a conference in the city hosted by seed firm Primary Venture Partners. It isn't clear who will lead the new office or when it will open. Ms. Jett declined to comment further.

* The first Vision Fund has invested in several New York companies, including real-estate companies We Co., which this week postponed its IPO plans, and Compass, which raised $370 million in July.

* A New York office would expand the fund's global network of outposts beyond its current offices in London; San Carlos, Calif.; Tokyo; and Singapore.

* Further investment by SoftBank in New York would accelerate a fast-growing venture investment scene in the city. Startups in New York have raised more than $13 billion in venture capital so far this year, almost as much as in all of 2018, according to a report by Primary Venture Partners.

Undruggable no more. Seed investors are backing a startup that sees machine learning as the key to enabling drugs aimed at molecular targets that have long been thought to be out of pharmaceutical companies' reach, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/startup-aims-to-unlock-drug-discovery-with-machine-learning-11568823688?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc". Unnatural Products Inc. secured more than $6 million in seed financing to fund its mission of solving the problem of "undruggable" proteins the roughly 80% to 90% of proteins in the body that have eluded drugmakers. Molecules called macrocycles have shown the ability to disrupt protein-protein interactions, but drug developers historically have needed some serendipity to identify ideal macrocycle drugs. Using machine learning, Santa Cruz, Calif.-based Unnatural seeks to optimize macrocycles to turn them into effective medicines.

Own together. Some well-funded startups have an unusual pitch for homeowners strapped for cash: Let's own this house together. A handful of companies, including those backed by marquee Silicon Valley names such as Andreessen Horowitz and Mark Zuckerberg's philanthropic organization, are experimenting with a product that essentially lets them take an ownership position in a house along with the homeowner, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/silicon-valley-explores-a-new-investment-your-home-1518955201?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc".

More scrutiny. Foreign investors who want to put money into U.S. businesses that rely on sensitive technology, infrastructure and data could face greater national-security scrutiny under proposed rules released by the Trump administration, the Journal's Katy Stech Ferek reports. Treasury Department officials provided a first glimpse of how they would implement Congress's order last year to expand the scope of national-security reviews of foreign investment deals, including those involving satellites, oil refineries, financial-market systems and drinking water utilities.

Subpoena time. The leader of a House committee investigating Juul Labs Inc. said the e-cigarette maker has failed to turn over documents it requested and warned that the committee could issue a subpoena demanding them, the Journal's Micah Maidenberg reports.

Tencent backs VIPKid. Chinese technology giant Tencent Holdings Ltd. is set to invest $150 million in VIPKid, Julie Steinberg and Shan Li report for WSJ, citing people familiar with the matter, pushing a funding round closer to completion even amid concerns among some investors over the Chinese online education company's business model.

Nielsen bets on brand safety. Nielsen Holdings PLC has acquired a minority stake in venture-backed brand-safety measurement company OpenSlate in an effort to help marketers avoid advertising in environments that don't fit their desired image, WSJ's Sahil Patel reports for CMO Today.

Ping Identity Listing Marks IPO Milestone for Vista; Offering for the cybersecurity company marks the first time a Vista Equity portfolio company went public since the firm's launch

Ping Identity Holding Corp.'s initial public offering marked a milestone not only in the company's past three years of private-equity ownership, but also for its backer, Vista Equity Partners.

Ping, which made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, is the first Vista portfolio company to go public since the firm's launch in 2000.

Shares of Ping, which priced in the middle of their range at $15 each, rose by around 34% to $20.11 each by the end of its first day of trading.

The IPO valued the company at $1.16 billion, nearly double the $600 million a person familiar with the company said Vista paid for it in 2016.

Austin, Texas-based Vista will retain ownership of around 80% of the company following the IPO, according to a regulatory filing.

Ping, of Denver, provides identity management products to more than 1,200 customers in sectors that include retail, banking, health care and manufacturing. Many businesses enlist Ping to help modernize their identity security infrastructure, according to founder and Chief Executive Andre Durand.

Under Vista's ownership, Ping expanded its reach and product offerings through two acquisitions. In 2016, it bought UnboundID, a customer-identity and access-management software company. Two years later, its acquisition of Elastic Beam broadened Ping's reach into the artificial intelligence world by acquiring a product that uses AI to identify and block cyberattacks.

The company's annual revenue rose 17% to $201.6 million last year from $172.5 million in 2017, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Mr. Durand said that Ping decided to pursue a possible public offering about a year to a year-and-a-half ago.

"Vista appreciated how important Ping was to the enterprises we were serving," said Mr. Durand, adding that it was at that time the company and its private-equity backer talked about growing through an IPO.

Vista built a strong record exiting portfolio companies through sales to strategic buyers or to other private-equity firms. The firm had previously planned another IPO on the London Stock Exchange three years ago with Misys Group Ltd., a financial services software provider, but later "https://www.wsj.com/articles/misys-scraps-london-ipo-1477585989" because of to market conditions. The company has since merged with D+H to form London-based Finastra, another Vista portfolio company.

Although it is still too early to tell how Ping's shares will perform over the long run, demand for cybersecurity technology and services across the globe has boosted valuations for such companies, both in the public and private markets.

Another cybersecurity company, SailPoint Technologies Holdings Inc., which was backed by tech-focused private-equity firm Thoma Bravo, has seen its share price grow by at least 72% to more than $20 each since it "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lbo-focus-thoma-bravo-hopes-sailpoint-can-ride-post-ipo-tailwinds-1514548800?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=3". SailPoint provides on-premises and software-as-a-services identity and access management solutions.

Wall St rivals seek research clients beyond fund industry

Cross asset

Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are going head-to-head with the likes of Bain and McKinsey, hoping to sell research services to companies to offset big falls in demand from their traditional clients in asset management.

Historically, the reams of research and economic analysis produced by Wall Street's army of "sellside" analysts has been targeted at hedge funds and fund managers the "buyside" in industry jargon.

But investment groups have come under ferocious fee pressure in recent years and are trying to cut down on costs. At the same time, new regulations stemming from the EU and which have washed over the US have required banks to charge investors for the research they provide, rather than bundling the cost into commissions for trading.

As a result, fund managers have slashed budgets for spending on research, spurring banks to look for new opportunities in the corporate world.

Simon Bound, global head of research at Morgan Stanley, said: "The catalyst is pressure on the overall business. These are incremental dollars we didn't think about before, that we are now trying to bring into the firm."

The motivation is somewhat different at Goldman Sachs, where chief executive David Solomon has been aiming to build relationships with executives at smaller companies, hoping that they can boost the bank's investment banking revenues.

Steve Strongin, the bank's global head of research, said: "The shift is very real. There is a broader recognition that research can be useful to our clients ... beyond the investment industry."

Research divisions within banks often have staffing and resources that dwarf the biggest think-tanks and consultancies, churning out huge amounts of industry, economic and financial research, from simple stock recommendations to machine learning-driven analyses of corporate sentiment. Total commissions paid by US fund managers, covering both research and trading, came to almost $8bn last year, according to Greenwich Associates, down from a peak of $14bn in 2009.

Financials

Deutsche Bank is paying  ¬50m for a 4.9 per cent stake in open-banking start-up Deposit Solutions in a transaction that values the Hamburg-based venture at more than  ¬1bn.

The deal turns Deposit Solutions into Germany's most highly valued fintech after Berlin-based lender N26, which in July was valued at $3.5bn when it raised $170m from its investors.

The start-up operates software that links connects retail clients and lenders, allowing banks to collect deposits from retail clients across Europe who are not their direct customers. It is a rival to Berlin-based Raisin, which, among other investors, is backed by PayPal.

Deposit Solution's valuation more than doubled since its last financing round in August 2018, when it raised $100m from Munich-based private equity group Vitruvian Partners and other investors.

For Deutsche Bank, which also owns stakes in financial analytics start-up Finanzguru, the transaction is the largest fintech investment in its history. The lender will pay roughly half of the  ¬50m in cash.

It has also committed to provide Deposit Solutions with in-kind services that both partners value at  ¬25m, according to a person familiar with the transaction.

Since 2017, the German lender has been one of the first and biggest clients of Deposit Solutions. Its software is at the core of Deutsche Bank's "Zinspilot", a tool that Deutsche's 7m retail customers in Germany can use to funnel savings to third-parties such as real estate lender Deutsche Pfandbriefbank and Cerberus-owned My Money Bank.

Germany's largest lender is planning to roll out the Deposit Solutions software to the 13m clients of its Postbank brand, its 4m retail clients outside Germany, as well as its small business and wealth management customers.

Good day. Donald Trump made a fundraising trip to Silicon Valley Tuesday, with former Sun Microsystems Inc. Chief Executive Scott McNealy hosting the event, The Wall Street Journal reported.

It's the first time since his election that Trump has visited the Bay Area. Three years ago, complaints from Intel employees caused the chief executive of Intel at the time to cancel an event for Trump.

Silicon Valley hasn't been a bastion of support for Trump. He has sought to restrict immigration and free trade, which puts him at odds with many in the technology world. But there are some notable supporters, according to a Vox report.

In the News

Software development. GitLab Inc., a fully remote company that sells tools for software developers within a single application, has raised $268 million, thanks to strong demand for its products from corporations, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/software-development-startup-gitlab-raises-268-million-11568725200?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc".

* The latest influx of cash brings the startup's total funding since 2015 to $426 million and its valuation to $2.75 billion, said Sid Sijbrandij, co-founder and chief executive. GitLab's newest investors include Adage Capital Management LP and Altimeter Capital Management LP.

* The company plans to go public in November 2020, Mr. Sijbrandij said.

* Propelling growth at GitLab, incorporated in 2014, is a shift in how companies' information-technology teams develop software, with a focus on collaboration between various departments and fast and frequent deployments, the CEO said.

Crypto custody. What is the safest way to store digital currencies? The answer to that question could decide the biggest winners in a multibillion-dollar race to determine what companies will be the leading custodians of cryptocurrencies, which are increasingly being used by money managers and other institutions for themselves or their clients, WSJ Pro's Tomio Geron reports. As with traditional assets, such as stocks, bonds or gold, SEC-registered investment advisers are required by law, with certain exceptions, to hold assets with a qualified custodian, a specialized financial firm that holds a customer's assets separate from the customer's financial manager or brokerage firm. For cryptocurrencies, the role of custodian is especially important, since all a thief or hacker needs to steal cryptocurrency is the string of private keys, or codes, assigned to that specific asset.

French unicorns. French insurers and asset managers have pledged  ¬5 billion in investment for homegrown tech firms as part of President Emmanuel Macron's push to nurture France's fledgling startups into a cohort of highly valued heavyweights, the Journal's Noemie Bisserbe reports. Mr. Macron announced the funding on Tuesday before hosting a dinner for executives from about 40 sovereign funds and venture-capital firms including KKR & Co., Accel and Lightspeed Venture Partners at the lyse Palace on Tuesday evening. Investors include AXA SA, BNP Paribas's insurance unit and Natixis SA, according to French officials.

Robotic surgery. CMR Surgical Ltd. said it has raised $240 million in a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-s-cmr-surgical-raises-240-million-to-launch-robot-surgery-technology-11568742328?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc" to prepare for the imminent launch of its robotic surgery technology. The U.K.-based business said Tuesday the new financing puts its valuation at more than $1 billion. It was backed by a number of existing and new investors including LGT, Escala Capital Investments, Cambridge Innovation Capital, Watrium and Zhejiang Silk Road Fund. The funding will go to commercialize CMR's Versius product a robotic instrument that enables surgeons to perform minimally invasive surgeries through the use of a digital interface.

Drug bankruptcy. Sienna Biopharmaceuticals Inc. has filed for bankruptcy with plans to find a buyer or investor during its chapter 11 proceedings, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sienna-biopharmaceuticals-files-for-bankruptcy-11568746455?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc". The publicly traded drugmaker, whose major investors include Arch Venture Partners, filed for bankruptcy days after its cash levels fell below the minimum prescribed by a credit agreement, a court filing shows. The company, which went public in 2017, also said its ability to raise financing has been hurt by a declining stock price.

The New York-based cloud-monitoring company said in a filing it now expects its IPO to price at $24 to $26 a share, up from the previous range of $19 to $22 a share. At the new range, the company's IPO could generate up to $717 million in net proceeds.

Advent Raises $2 Billion for Debut Technology Fund; The global private-equity firm has opened an office in Palo Alto, Calif., and hired seven professionals for its tech team

Advent International is the latest private-equity firm to bet big on technology.

The firm said Wednesday it had raised $2 billion for its debut fund dedicated to investments in software companies and data centers across North America and Europe.

Advent joins a number of buyout shops that have raised large funds to invest solely in technology companies. Vista Equity Partners, led by billionaire Robert Smith, earlier this month collected $16 billion for what stands as the largest technology-focused fund ever raised by an independent private-equity firm.

Investor appetite for tech-focused funds pushed total capital raised for such vehicles in North America to $122.1 billion through Sept. 5, already surpassing the $116.2 billion raised during all of 2018, according to data provider Preqin Ltd.

Advent plans to invest as little as $50 million in equity per deal from the fund, called Advent Global Technology, but it could invest up to $2 billion or more if it also taps into its latest flagship fund, which closed with $17.5 billion earlier this year.

The firm plans to back a range of transactions, including minority growth investments, traditional buyouts and acquisitions of public companies. So far it has backed two deals from the new fund: Definitive Healthcare LLC, a U.S. health-care data analytics company; and payment solutions provider Transaction Service Group.

To help source deals, Advent said it has opened a new office in Palo Alto, Calif., and added seven new professionals to its tech team. The new hires bring the team to 20 professionals, including former TPG Partner Bryan Taylor, who joined Advent in February. Advent said it plans to add more people to the team in the coming months.

In addition to the new Palo Alto office, the firm also has tech-focused deal makers in its London and New York offices.

Founded in 1984, Advent is one of the world's largest private-equity firms. The firm has invested in more than 345 private-equity transactions in 41 countries. It had $54 billion in assets under management as of June 30.

Corrections & Amplifications

An earlier version of the People item on a new chief talent officer at FTV Capital incorrectly spelled Allison Walker's first name and in one instance incorrectly referred to FTV as FTC. (9/18/19)

Good day! Thirty years ago, Jonathan Nelson founded Providence Equity Partners to invest in media and communications companies, makign it one of the earliest sector-focused private-equity firms. Since then, Providence has had its ups and downs as it navigated the dot.com boom and bust of the late 1990s and the great financial crisis of 2008 and 2009. This morning, as Chris Cumming writes, Providence is squarely focused on the future after wrapping up its eighth flagship private-equity fund with more than $6 billion.

In other news, Acosta Inc., a marketing services company backed by the Carlyle Group has hired a law firm to advise it on debt restructuring, while 3G Capital has reduced its stake in Kraft-Heinz.

And the U.K. government threw a spanner into Advent International's acquisition of defense company Cobham PLC, blocking the deal on national-security grounds pending further review.

National Security Worries Threaten U.S. Takeover of U.K. Defense Firm

The U.K. halted the $5 billion sale of a British defense firm to a U.S. investor on national security grounds, pending a government review, in a rare move for a country that hasn't typically inserted itself in big, cross-border deal making.

The intervention comes as critics of the deal for Cobham PLC which makes air-to-air refueling systems and communications equipment for military and commercial planes have said the deal is counter to national interest and undervalues the company.

Cyber Daily: Caution About Multifactor Authentication; Smart Cities Invite Smart Hacking

Good day. Security experts advise multifactor authentication to protect employee and customer accounts, as well as to access sensitive data and systems. But the technique comes with pitfalls, reports Adam Janofsky of WSJ Pro. Companies should streamline how they use such authentication to avoid hurting productivity.

Don't miss: Smart cities decked out in sensors from lampposts to waste-management systems could become a hacker's paradise, WSJ Pro's James Rundle reports. City planners are working to build cybersecurity protections from the start.

Also today: Edward Snowden's new book and new asylum request; surveillance systems around the globe; and medical data online for the taking.

Smart Cities are Coming. Hackers Won't Be Far Behind

Smart cities are collecting data about public utilities, traffic, garbage collecting, road conditions and much more, and then using that data to deliver services to more people and more efficiently. But the more connected a city is, the more vulnerable it is to cyberattacks, reports WSJ Pro's James Rundle.

As additional information on residents is collected, officials worry the resulting reams of data could attract nation-states or terrorists who could incorporate the data into physical and cyberwarfare campaigns.

What are the most vulnerable places in a smart city?

Sensors. The potential for harm is pretty much endless. Hackers could, for instance, either create erroneous data or obscure real information about the integrity of bridges, divert emergency services to nonexistent floods or corrupt information about air quality, instigating false alarms.

Energy and water-supply systems. Malicious software could disable power plants, for instance, as was seen during the spread of the NotPetya malware in 2017 that struck Ukraine, before spreading throughout the world. More than 225,000 people were left without power. The ubiquity of smart meters also means the possible points of entry into the network number in the thousands. Once a utility's system is attacked, it's hard to turn it off and look for the problem.

Autonomous vehicles. Terrorists have shown how manned vehicles can drive into busy streets, causing mass casualties. That becomes even easier, and exponentially more dangerous, if a single hacker can take control of multiple driverless cars. Hackers could also could reroute vehicles carrying people targeted for abduction. Specialists at hacker conferences have repeatedly demonstrated how the onboard systems of such vehicles can be compromised. In addition, they have shown how easily the AI technology that runs these vehicles can be fooled.

Read more here about threats to waste management and traffic-control systems, as well as what city planners can do to guard against attacks.

Multifactor Authentication Can Stop Hacks But Annoy Employees

Companies should streamline how they use it to limit hits to productivity, cybersecurity experts say

By Adam Janofsky

When it comes to protecting sensitive business data and safeguarding important accounts, one of the most commonly recommended tools is also one of the simplest.

Multifactor authentication provides an extra layer of security on top of a username and password. With multifactor typically two-factor authentication enabled, users are prompted to enter an additional piece of information before they gain access to an account. Often this is a code sent as a text message, email or push notification to their phones.

This basic step can block most account-compromise attacks in some cases close to 100% of these incidents according to separate reports released recently by Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Microsoft Corp.

"Multifactor authentication is the kryptonite to most cyberattacks," said Kevin Richards, global head of cyber risk consulting at the Marsh brokerage unit of Marsh & McLennan Cos.

Despite the benefits, just 30% of people use multifactor authentication to log into accounts, according to a poll of 1,223 adults in the U.S. published Tuesday by Chubb Ltd.

Not all forms of multifactor authentication are created equal, and companies can fail to reap the benefits if they aren't careful. For example, authenticator apps which send users a code through the app, not over a cellular network and hardware tokens are more secure than text-message codes sent to smartphones. Codes sent to phones, meanwhile, are more secure than knowledge-based authentication techniques that ask a user for information that only he or she should know, according to research from Google.

Factors Matter

A study by researchers from Google and New York University that was published in May evaluated how effective 14 secondary authentication factors were in preventing more than 350,000 real-world account hijacking attempts.

Knowledge-based challenges, such as asking users to recall the name of the street they grew up on, prevented as little as 10% of phishing attempts, the study found. This form of two-factor authentication is weak because answers can be extracted in data breaches or dug up online, and many users forget the response they originally selected, said Periwinkle Doerfler, an NYU doctoral student in computer science and a co-author of the study.

"These are terrible for an added layer of security. People don't remember how to answer these questions," she said.

At the other end of the spectrum, text-message-based authentication blocked 96% of phishing attempts examined in the study. Security keys, which look like USB flash drives and are inserted into a device as a second form of authentication, blocked 100% of these attempts, according to the study.

Although text-message-based authentication is widely used, the codes have to go through a cellular network, which introduces risks, Ms. Doerfler said. One example, known as SIM swapping, involves fraudsters tricking a mobile carrier into assigning a victim's phone number to a new device that they control.

Even technology companies get this wrong. Jack Dorsey, Twitter Inc.'s chief executive, got caught up in a SIM-swapping attack in August when hackers took advantage of a mobile carrier weakness to hijack his Twitter account and post obscene messages.

"The phone number associated with the account was compromised due to a security oversight by the mobile provider," the company said in a statement. "This allowed an unauthorized person to compose and send tweets via text message from the phone number."

Don't Overdo It

There are downsides to using multifactor authentication extensively, cybersecurity experts say.

Adding an extra step to the log-in process can irritate employees and in some cases prevent them from getting work done. According to Google's research, adding a second authentication factor leads to 52% of legitimate users having difficulty signing in.

"Multifactor authentication can be rather annoying, and businesses have to take that into account when implementing it," said Steve Durbin, managing director of the Information Security Forum.

To get around this, companies should consider using multifactor authentication only on their most sensitive data and accounts, Mr. Durbin said. Users also can be prompted to enter a second factor only if the system recognizes a discrepancy, such as a login from a new location or device.

World catching up with China on surveillance tech. China leads the world in facial-recognition and other new surveillance technologies, with its own government using the tools at home and Huawei Technologies Co.exporting them globally, according to a new report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. But other countries are adopting similar technologies, according to the think tank's report, which is based on research by a former State Department official in the Obama administration.

Surveilling citizens: At least 75 countries, including the U.S., Brazil and Singapore, host artificial intelligence to surveil citizens, the report said a wider footprint than previously documented, The Wall Street Journal reports. The top U.S. firm identified in the report was International Business Machines Corp., which sold surveillance technology in 11 countries. IBM and Huawei didn't respond to requests for comment.

Medical images, data for millions of Americans available online.X-rays, scans and medical information about five million American patients reside unprotected online, according to ProPublica in an investigation with German public broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk. The outlets identified 187 servers without safeguards in doctors' offices and other health-care locations. ProPublica said it uncovered no evidence the data was copied or published elsewhere.

U.S. sues Snowden over new book. The U.S. Justice Department on Tuesday filed a civil lawsuit against Edward Snowden, arguing the former intelligence contractor violated government nondisclosure agreements by publishing a new book about his 2013 leaks of classified surveillance programs, the Journal reports. The suit doesn't seek to prevent the distribution or sale of the book, "Permanent Record" which could run afoul of First Amendment guarantees of freedom of speech. Rather, the government is asking a court to seize the financial proceeds from the sale of the book as well as to enjoin Mr. Snowden from giving speeches related to the book.

No secrets? "This book contains no government secrets that have not been previously published by respected news organizations," said Ben Wizner, an attorney for Mr. Snowden who runs the American Civil Liberties Union's speech, privacy and technology project. Macmillan, part of Germany's Holtzbrinck Publishing Group, referred to ACLU's statement and declined further comment.

Tweet: In a tweet, Mr. Snowden noted the lawsuit over his book, and then linked to the Amazon.com listing for his memoir, saying: "This is the book the government does not want you to read."

C'est la vie: Meanwhile, Mr. Snowden wants to move to France. Mr. Snowden is calling on French President Emmanuel Macron to give him asylum, the Associated Press reports. Mr. Snowden has been living in Russia since 2013 when he was denied asylum in France under then-president Francois Hollande. Mr. Macron's office didn't comment.

Regulatory squeeze forces Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to hunt for new consumers

Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are going head-to-head with the likes of Bain and McKinsey, hoping to sell research services to companies to offset big falls in demand from their traditional clients in asset management.

Historically, the reams of research and economic analysis produced by Wall Street s army of  sellside  analysts has been targeted at hedge funds and fund managers   the  buyside  in industry jargon.

But investment groups have come under ferocious fee pressure in recent years and are trying to cut down on costs. At the same time, new regulations stemming from the EU   and which have washed over the US   have required banks to charge investors for the research they provide, rather than bundling the cost into commissions for trading.

As a result, fund managers have slashed budgets for spending on research, spurring banks to look for new opportunities in the corporate world.

Simon Bound, global head of research at Morgan Stanley, said:  The catalyst is pressure on the overall business. These are incremental dollars we didn t think about before, that we are now trying to bring into the firm. 

The motivation is somewhat different at Goldman Sachs, where chief executive David Solomon has been aiming to build relationships with executives at smaller companies, hoping that they can boost the bank s investment banking revenues.

Steve Strongin, the bank s global head of research, said:  The shift is very real. There is a broader recognition that research can be useful to our clients 	. 	. 	. 	beyond the investment industry. 

Research divisions within banks often have staffing and resources that dwarf the biggest think tanks and consultancies, churning out huge amounts of industry, economic and financial research, from simple stock recommendations to machine learning-driven analyses of corporate sentiment. Total commissions paid by US fund managers, covering both research and trading, came to almost $8bn last year, according to Greenwich Associates, down from a peak of $14bn in 2009.

But the banks  analysts are mostly trained to service that investment industry, which is looking for specific advice on trading strategies. That means the banks are having to recast their research to be more digestible to senior executives, creating research that is much broader in nature   akin to that produced by consultancies such as Bain or BCG.

But the biggest hurdle is simply getting banks  research products into the right hands.

Morgan Stanley s Mr Bound said:  The challenge is distribution. We re set up to distribute research to asset managers, hedge funds and wealth managers, not corporate [clients]. But it will be hand-to-hand combat. You need salespeople to connect with those corporate clients. 

Joyce Chang, global head of research at JPMorgan, said that universal banks with large commercial operations   such as JPMorgan, Bank of America or Citi   have been marketing research services to corporate clients for a while.

However, the bank last year launched a new research product called JPMorgan Perspectives that is more thematic and targeted at a general corporate readership, often picking up topics discussed by chief executive Jamie Dimon in his capacity as chair of the Business Roundtable, a powerful lobby group.

 I do get a lot more calls from corporate clients on some issues, but it tends to evolve,  Ms Chang said.  Dodd-Frank [post-crisis regulatory reform] was a big thing for a period, and these days it is more about ESG and climate change. And everyone always wants to talk about China.

Good day. WeWork's parent company is expected to postpone its initial public offering until October, in the latest blow to the highly anticipated listing, WSJ's Maureen Farrell reports.

Investors have questioned WeWork's valuation and its corporate governance. The company had been planning to begin its roadshow to market the offering this week.

It's the latest bad news for SoftBank, which is a major investor in WeWork and is seeking to raise a second massive fund.

What will be the impact for other venture-backed companies planning to go public? Other startups will be hoping that any problems stemming from the many unique features of WeWork and its offering won't affect other well-positioned IPOs. Let's wait and see.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Another VC split. The founders of Aspect Ventures, a prominent female-led venture firm, are parting ways to launch separate firms, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venture-capital-firm-aspect-ventures-breaking-up-11568665236?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc". Jennifer Fonstad, who focused on digital health and enterprise software, is creating Owl Capital to invest in early-stage deals, and Theresia Gouw, named by Forbes last year as the wealthiest female venture investor, is setting up her own early-stage firm called Acrew.

* Acrew aims to raise about $175 million. Owl Capital hopes to raise around $125 million.

* "We saw very much eye to eye in terms of our investments and strategy. But we had very different leadership styles and different ways of operating at the portfolio level," Ms. Fonstad said of the moves, adding that she wanted to run a small, boutique firm.

* Other well-known venture firms have disbanded in recent years. Mary Meeker recently left Kleiner Perkins to set up her own growth fund. Several years ago, Formation 8 split up into several firms, including Joe Lonsdale's 8VC.

* Owl Capital is bringing on Niloofar Razi Howe, a former executive at cybersecurity companies RSA Security and Endgame Inc., as an investor. Other Aspect team members joining Ms. Fonstad will be Chad Herrin and Rebecca Hu.

* Several Aspect team members are expected to join Ms. Gouw, including Lauren Kolodny, who led the firm's Series A investment in mobile bank Chime, among other deals, and Vishal Lugani, who co-led or worked with PredictHQ Ltd., Pie Insurance Holdings Inc. and others.

Banks bet on identity verification startup. Several Wall Street banks and financial firms have invested 60 million Canadian dollars ($45.2 million) in identity verification startup Trulioo Information Services Inc., "https://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-fund-identity-verification-startup-trulioos-expansion-11568712603?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc". Goldman Sachs Growth Equity led the company's Series C financing round, with participation from Citi Ventures, Santander InnoVentures and American Express Ventures. Banking is an ideal sector for Trulioo because of tight regulation of the industry and the sensitivity of the private information involved, according to Chief Executive Stephen Ufford.

More funding for construction software. One of a number of startups that offer software for managing construction sites, Fieldwire has raised $33.5 million in capital, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/construction-management-startup-fieldwire-raises-33-5-million-11568646000?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc". Menlo Ventures and Brick & Mortar Ventures led the deal, while construction-tools company Hilti Group and Formation 8 participated. Venture investment in construction technology has ballooned, reaching a record last year. "Construction is one of the luddites of verticals that has been late to adopt," said Tyler Sosin, a partner at Menlo Ventures.

Supply chains for electric vehicles. A supply-chain race is under way to supply Europe's burgeoning electric automobile industry. Swedish startup Northvolt AB is rushing to establish a factory to produce battery cells for vehicles, an effort that's part of a battle between Europe and China over control of the technology that powers electric cars. The WSJ's William Boston writes that Northvolt founder Peter Carlsson, a former Tesla Inc. supply-chain chief, aims to create a European system that links electric-car manufacturers with battery makers, all powered locally by solar and wind plants and using European workers and know-how. It's a bet on an expected demand boom as auto makers invest billions of dollars to take electric vehicles mainstream.

Newsletter Exclusive

Social media manager Sprout files for IPO. Social media management platform Sprout Social Inc. has filed confidentially for an IPO and plans to go public before the end of the year, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is managing the offering, the person said. Goldman was also one of its investors. Other prior investors include New Enterprise Associates and Lightbank. According to PitchBook Data Inc., the company has raised over $100 million, most recently at an $800 million valuation last year.

Chicago-based Sprout had about $80 million in revenue last year with about $20 million in losses, the person said. This is up from about $45 million in revenue and about $20 million in losses the year prior.

Sprout works with businesses like Grubhub Inc. and Glassdoor to publish on social media platforms and analyze its effectiveness, according to the company's website.

Sprout competes with other venture-backed startups including Sprinklr Inc., which has raised close to $230 million at a $1.8 billion valuation, according to PitchBook. Its backers include Intel Capital, ICONIQ Capital and Battery Ventures. In Vancouver, British Columbia, competitor Hootsuite Inc. has raised over $300 million from Accel, Salesforce Ventures and Fidelity Investments.

Sprout didn't immediately respond for comment. Goldman Sachs also didn't respond for comment.

Good day! This weekend's attack on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia sent shares of certain U.S. oil producers up yesterday. However, a number of U.S. producers said they don't plan to increase production to fill the production gap the attack is producing, The Wall Street Journal reports. It remains to be seen whether or not the disruption will help stave off the carnage that has been affecting private-equity backed oil-and-gas companies. This morning, Becky Yerak of WSJ Pro reports on that carnage with news that Sheridan Production Partners II has filed for bankruptcy protection.

In other news, U.K.-focused firm Pollen Street Capital is pitching its newest fund and the Journal reports that WeWork may delay its planned initial public offering.

Now on to today's news...

Today's Top Stories

Sheridan Production Fund Files for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy

Sheridan Production Partners II LLC filed for bankruptcy with plans to hand ownership to its lenders, subject to better bids, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sheridan-production-fund-files-for-chapter-11-bankruptcy-11568660102?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1&mod=djemPrivateEquityPro&tpl=pe". The transaction is aimed at reducing the oil-and-gas company's $1.1 billion debt load by about $900 million. The Houston-based company and several affiliates filed chapter 11 petitions Sunday in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Houston. Industry challenges have squeezed liquidity, making it difficult for the business to make interest payments on its debt, the business said. The bankrupt businesses are part of a broader group established in 2006 by oil and gas executives with Warburg Pincus.

Pollen Street Capital Targets 600 Million for Latest Fund

London's Pollen Street Capital has kicked off fundraising for its latest flagship fund, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/pollen-street-capital-targets-600-million-for-latest-fund-11568652345?mod=djemPrivateEquityPro&tpl=pe", citing a person familiar with the matter. The fund has a 600 million ($750 million) target and, if successful, would be the largest the firm has raised since it was set up in 2013. Pollen Street was spun out of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLCsix years ago by a group of its executives led by Lindsey McMurray as managing partner. At RBS, the team managed a $1.1 billion special opportunities fund within the bank. Pollen Street closed its most recent fund last year on 400 million.

WeWork Parent Expected to Postpone IPO

SoftBank Group's Vision fund and J.P. Morgan Asset Management's PEG Digital Growth fund may have to wait a while to see the public's valuation for WeWork, after people familiar with the situation told the Wall Street Journal on Monday that The We Co. may put off its initial public offering until next month. The private investment arms of SoftBank Group Corp. and JP MorganChase & Co. both hold common stock in the New York company that provides locations for shared office space. Vision fund affiliates hold 113.99 million common shares and the PEG Digital funds hold 18.54 million shares, while venture funds managed by Benchmark Capital Partners own about 32.65 million shares. The delay follows questions that have been raised about the company's management and worth, the Journal said.

Silver Lake-Backed Endeavor Group Seeks $712 Million in IPO

Silver Lake Partners-backed Endeavor Group Holdings Inc. plans to raise as much as $712.3 million in its initial public offering, the entertainment company said in a regulatory filing Monday. The parent company of William Morris Endeavor, Hollywood's biggest talent agency, plans to offer 19.4 million common shares at $30 to $32 each. The company's entertainment and sports division, which negotiates media-distribution deals on behalf of more than 150 clients including the International Olympic Committee and National Football League, is Endeavor's biggest source of revenue, which reached $2.05 billion in the first half of this year. But Endeavor also reported a $192.6 million loss for the period. Silver Lake first invested in the company in 2012.

Blackstone Group Inc. is taking its portfolio company Vivint Smart Home Inc. public through a blank-check company formed by SoftBank Group Corp.'s Fortress Investment Group in October 2017. The deal would give Vivint an initial enterprise value of $5.6 billion. Blackstone will roll over $2.3 billion in equity in the deal and invest an additional $100 million while Fortress will add $125 million. Blackstone and affiliates will own 78% of Vivint shares after the deal closes. The company's estimated fiscal 2020 revenue is expected to reach $1.3 billion and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization are projected at $530 million, for an implied deal multiple of 10.5 times forward Ebitda. Vivint supplies cloud-enabled services and smart-home products to 1.5 million U.S. and Canadian subscribers. Blackstone acquired Vivint in November 2012 for more than $2 billion.

Advent International's $5 billion bid to acquire U.K. aerospace supplier Cobham PLC won approval at a special shareholder's meeting Monday, with holders of more than 93% of the shares favoring the deal, Cobham said. Advent had to muster the support of at least three-quarters of the shares held by Cobham investors for the 4 billion cash offer, or 165 pence per share. The deal would provide investors with a 34% premium over the company's share price just prior to the disclosure of the bid. Closing the transaction remains subject to various regulatory approvals.

J.Crew Group Inc., the preppy clothing brand backed by TPG and Leonard Green & Partners, has filed a registration statement for an initial public offering of shares in its Madewell unit in a deal that would separate the two. J.Crew also made public a presentation on the IPO and separation that it gave to debtholders in late July. It shows the company's sponsors hold 85% of its equity and indicates that just 40% of Madewell would be sold in the IPO. Before it can pursue the offering, J.Crew has to convince a lender group that includes Blackstone Group Inc.'s GSO Capital Partners LP and Anchorage Capital Group LLC, WSJ Pro has reported. The IPO would provide a mechanism to restructure J.Crew's debt. The company agreed one a debt extension deal with Blackstone and Anchorage in 2017 that gave the lenders a say in future restructurings.

EMEA Capital has invested in Moneybaba, a London financial technology company that specializes in emerging markets. Moneybaba is an online-only lender that distributes product through affiliations with local vendors as well, providing point-of-sale financing.

Industry News

A bankruptcy judge has approved Empire Generating Co.'s restructuring plan, overruling holdout lenders that include Ares Capital Corp., and giving Black Diamond Capital Management LLC control of the power-plant business.

Walrath in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., Monday signed off on GenNx360's bid to buy the drill maker out of bankruptcy and assume its debt of $10.3 million plus $6 million in post-petition financing.

Bain Capital and Carlyle Group LP may lose out if Osram Licht AG's recommendation that shareholders accept Ams AG 's  ¬4.3 billion ($4.76 billion) takeover offer is widely accepted by shareholders. But even as it recommended the bid, Osram's leaders expressed concern about the Austrian semiconductor company's strategy and ability to manage the takeover. Osram's management and supervisory boards said Monday that their recommendation was based on Ams's offer price but they considered the entrepreneurial strategy proposed by Bain Capital and Carlyle as "all in all more viable" for the lighting manufacturer.

Real Estate
Tom Barrack Is Done With Traditional Real Estate. He's Going Digital. His investment company is remaking itself in response to the impact new technologies have had on commercial real-estate cash flow

Colony Capital Inc. is making one of the most aggressive bets yet that technology is disrupting real estate: It is selling nearly all of its traditional holdings and channeling the money into property that focuses on the tech sector.

The Los Angeles-based real-estate firm is a global investor with $55 billion in assets under management. Colony aims to sell as much as 90% of its $20 billion property portfolio of hotels, warehouses and other commercial real estate by the end of 2021, company officials said last week.

Colony said it would use the proceeds to buy data centers, mobile phone towers and fiber and grow its digital real-estate investment management business.

"We want to be mostly all things digital," said Thomas Barrack Jr., a real-estate pioneer who founded Colony in the early 1990s and is the firm's chief executive and executive chairman. He is also a close friend of President Trump and headed up Mr. Trump's inaugural committee.

The remaking of the 28-year-old investment company represents an extreme response to the way new technologies have been cutting into cash flow for most every type of commercial real estate.

Hotel owners have felt pressure from short-term rental companies like Airbnb Inc. WeWork and other co-working firms have siphoned off corporate business from office landlords and revamped the leasing process, while e-commerce has decimated malls and their owners.

"Physical, financial and functional obsolescence [is] everywhere," Mr. Barrack said during a recent investor conference. "I'm terrified by legacy assets."

Colony's move is the latest sign that big investors are making unprecedented bets on the intersection of real estate and technology. Billions of dollars from venture-capital firms, including a record $12.9 billion raised in the first six months of 2019, are pouring into startup "prop tech" businesses that are changing workspaces, stores, distribution centers and homes.

Some in the real-estate industry view Colony's move as a risky gamble. Data centers and mobile towers face the constant danger of obsolescence from new technologies like servers with higher storage capacities, satellites and faster 5G networks being built in the telecommunications industry.

Analysts point out that Colony has a long slog ahead of it, even if its overhaul works out in the long run. For one, selling all its traditional real estate at good prices won't be easy.

"This is a longer term turnaround story," said Jade Rahmani, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. "It's not as if they can snap their fingers and overnight become a digital real-estate company."

Colony executives say that their strategy reflects the higher growth potential in the digital real-estate world. They predict that giants like Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and others will continue to have demand for data centers, transmission towers and fiber-optic cable in the future from such technologies as driverless vehicles, artificial intelligence and the Internet-of-things.

Plans for this transformation follow another overhaul of the company. In 2017, Colony combined with NorthStar Asset Management Group Inc. and NorthStar Realty Finance Corp. in a disastrous stock-for-stock merger, causing Colony's shares to plummet below $5 a share from the $14 range before the merger was announced.

Colony set the stage for its technology push in July by paying $325 million in cash and stock to acquire Digital Bridge Holdings LLC, which manages nearly $20 billion in digital infrastructure globally. Digital Bridge's CEO Marc Ganzi is slated to succeed Mr. Barrack as chief executive 18 to 24 months after the acquisition closed. Mr. Barrack will remain executive chairman.

Mr. Ganzi has a track record in digital infrastructure, including founding Global Tower Partners, a cellular tower company, which he sold in 2013 to American Tower Corp. in a deal valued at $4.8 billion.

The combined company currently manages 38 data centers and 350,000 tower, cellphone and other sites.

"We've had a rich history of pioneering these esoteric real-estate structures and trying to convince investors that what we're doing is more parts real estate than telecom," Mr. Ganzi told investors last week.

The data center industry also has had a history of gluts. In northern Virginia, a wave of new construction has created "headwinds" for leasing these properties, said Paul Szurek, chief executive of CoreSite Realty Corp., a data center owner, in a recent earnings call.

Stock investors are taking a wait-and-see attitude toward Colony's efforts to reinvent itself. Shares have risen from their low of $4.32 to the $5.60 range since the Digital Bridge deal closed but are still far below the adjusted high of about $18 in 2015.

Business News: Fire-Risk Algorithms Stir Insurance Furor --- California advocates oppose disaster- prediction models that could drive up rates

Finding home insurance in wildfire-prone parts of California is getting more difficult and more expensive. No one can agree on how to make it any easier.

A new flashpoint is the use of algorithmic models for predicting catastrophe losses. Insurers have long used these models to project losses from natural disasters but insurers, homeowners and regulators disagree on how they should be applied to assess California's wildfire risk.

Insurers are pushing for broader permission from the state to use catastrophe models when setting rates. But some consumers say those models are opaque and fail to adequately capture wildfire risk.

The debate over catastrophe models is part of a broader disagreement between insurers and consumer advocates over how to respond to two years of record-breaking wildfire damage in the Golden State. Many residents of fire-prone areas are either paying more for insurance or having problems securing it, and the state has warned that the situation is likely to get worse.

California wildfires cost insurers more than $24 billion in 2017 and 2018. One insurer, Merced Property & Casualty Co., was pushed to insolvency and liquidated by the state following the 2018 Camp Fire.

"Insurers are acting as you would expect where the risk is going up. They're adjusting their pricing and deciding in some cases that the risk is too high," said Dave Jones, senior director at the Nature Conservancy and a former California insurance commissioner. But without drastic steps to address climate change, he said, "we're marching steadily towards a future where the wildfire risk is uninsurable."

Catastrophe models are sold to insurers by vendors including RMS, a unit of Daily Mail & General Trust PLC, and AIR Worldwide, a unit of Verisk Analytics Inc. Insurers also use products like Verisk's FireLine, which assigns properties a score of zero to 30 based on their wildfire risk.

In California, insurers can't use catastrophe models when setting statewide average rates for standard home-insurance policies, which include wildfire coverage. State regulations require insurers to rely on historical-loss data when calculating expected future losses.

California's insurance regulations are more stringent than those of most states. Insurers need to get approval before they can change the rates they charge, and rate filings are made public.

Though an insurer's average California home-insurance rate has to be based on historical data, the insurer can use catastrophe models to determine how to price policies for certain regions or segments of the market. Insurers also can use these models when deciding whether or not to insure a specific property.

But the insurance industry says its pricing would be more accurate if it could use the forward-looking models when setting overall rates. Catastrophe models run tens of thousands of simulations to project a range of possible scenarios.

Insurers say models provide a more comprehensive view of risk than historical data and are able to take climate change into account.

"We're told there's a new normal" due to climate change, which regulators and scientists have said increases wildfire risk, said Rex Frazier, president of the Personal Insurance Federation of California. But under current regulations, "we cannot use probabilistic modeling that attempts to build a rate based upon where models suggest losses will go."

Consumer advocates say the models don't give homeowners and communities enough credit for taking steps to mitigate their wildfire exposure through brush-clearing and other efforts.

"They want to have a black-box model and not let the public or advocates see what's in it," said Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog.

Patty Swenson of Montecito, Calif., was told earlier this year that the insurance policy for her five-bedroom home wouldn't be renewed. Her insurance agent said the insurer had cited the house's proximity to a forest as a reason, Ms. Swenson said.

But the forest near Ms. Swenson's home burned in the 2017 Thomas Fire, she said, which she thinks makes it less likely to burn again. Ms. Swenson added that her property is cleared of flammable brush and that the Montecito community has invested in safety measures to protect it from fire-related debris flow.

Ms. Swenson was able to find another insurer, but her new coverage limit is lower, leaving her underinsured, she said. "Everything we've done has further mitigated the risk of a future disaster," Ms. Swenson said. "That should count for something."

One concern for regulators is that until recently, wildfire models were less sophisticated than hurricane and earthquake models. Many insurers were shocked by the extent of the damage in 2017 and 2018 and said the previous models didn't predict those losses.

Both AIR and RMS have released new wildfire models in the past two years that they say are more predictive than past models.

But different models might still reach different conclusions about the risk facing a certain property or book of business.

Venture-Capital Firm Aspect Ventures Breaking Up; Five years after founding the venture-capital firm, Theresia Gouw and Jennifer Fonstad are parting ways to launch new firms

Corrections & Amplifications

Owl Capital will invest in early-stage deals. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that it will invest in growth deals. (Sept.16)

The founders of Aspect Ventures, a prominent female-led venture-capital firm, are parting ways to launch separate firms.

Jennifer Fonstad, who focused on digital health and enterprise software, is creating Owl Capital to invest in early-stage deals, and Theresia Gouw, named by Forbes last year as the wealthiest female venture investor, is setting up her own early-stage firm called Acrew.

"We saw very much eye to eye in terms of our investments and strategy. But we had very different leadership styles and different ways of operating at the portfolio level," Ms. Fonstad said of the moves, adding that she wanted to run a small, boutique firm.

The two teams continue to work out of Aspect's offices, Ms. Fonstad said.

Ms. Gouw declined to comment.

Some other well-known venture partnerships have disbanded in recent years because the partners wanted more control. Mary Meeker"https://www.wsj.com/articles/venture-capital-firm-kleiner-perkins-plans-to-split-1536933600" to set up her own growth fund. Several years ago Formation 8 split up into several firms, including "https://www.wsj.com/articles/joe-lonsdales-8vc-closes-640-million-fund-1524508834".

Owl Capital is bringing on Niloofar Razi Howe, a former executive at cybersecurity companies RSA Security and Endgame Inc., as an investor, Ms. Fonstad said. Other Aspect team members joining Ms. Fonstad will be Chad Herrin and Rebecca Hu, she said.

Several Aspect team members are expected to join Ms. Gouw at her new firm, including Lauren Kolodny, who led the firm's Series A investment in "https://www.wsj.com/articles/chime-raises-9m-to-bring-banking-to-millennials-1463657408", among other deals, and Vishal Lugani, who co-led or worked with PredictHQ Ltd., Pie Insurance Holdings Inc. and others, people familiar with the matter said.

Acrew aims to raise about $175 million, a person familiar with the situation said. Owl Capital hopes to raise around $125 million.

Ms. Fonstad and Ms. Gouw "https://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00020140205ea25g34e3" in 2014 after serving as managing director at Draper Fisher Jurvetson now called Threshold Ventures and managing general partner at Accel, respectively.

"It was very hard for two women to individually raise funds," Ms. Fonstad said. "It was not an era when that could be done, so we combined forces. But the entrepreneurial itch continued to be there for both of us."

Aspect raised two funds, a $150 million debut vehicle in 2015 and a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/aspect-ventures-closes-second-fund-at-181-million-1516710617" in January 2018. Melinda Gates and Cisco Systems Inc. were among the limited partners in the second fund.

Aspect's team will continue to manage the firm's existing portfolio but will make any new investments out of their new funds, Ms. Fonstad said.

Ms. Gouw is a longtime investor in consumer internet, enterprise software and cybersecurity startups. At Aspect she led investments in networking company Cato Networks Ltd., security startup Exabeam Inc. and cybersecurity company Forescout Technologies Inc., which went public in 2017, among others. At Accel, she invested in companies including cybersecurity company Imperva Inc., digital real-estate company Trulia Inc. and financial planning company LearnVest Inc. Ms. Gouw also worked on Accel's investment in Facebook Inc., a deal led by Jim Breyer.

Ms. Fonstad's investments at Aspect have included now-public luxury consignment company The RealReal, artificial-intelligence company Qordoba Ltd. and marketing-automation startup FollowAnalytics Inc. Ms. Fonstad is also a co-founder of female angel-investor network Broadway Angels.

VC Daily: SoftBank's $750 Million for We IPO; Mission Lane Raises $500 Million; Andre Iguodala Talks Investing

Good day. SoftBank had a tough week, with Uber being threatened by California's new law on gig workers and WeWork's IPO plagued by weak interest. SoftBank is doubling down on WeWork, at least: It plans to buy at least $750 million in shares of WeWork's IPO, the Journal reports.

Meanwhile, subprime credit-card startup Mission Lane LLC has secured $500 million, faring better than it did when it was part of financial-technology company LendUp.

In IPO news, Cloudflare's shares rose 20% in their first day of trading Friday. Major investors included New Enterprise Associates.

And forget those hearing aids new drugs currently going through clinical trials could cure the biological causes of hearing loss.

And now on to the news...

In the News

SoftBank steps up. SoftBank Group Corp. plans to buy at least $750 million of the shares in WeWork's impending IPO, the Journal's Maureen Farrell and Corrie Driebusch report, one of a series of moves by the office-sharing company to shore up an offering that has been plagued by tepid investor demand. The Japanese technology conglomerate, already the biggest investor in WeWork's parent, would end up with 25% or more of the shares sold in an offering that is expected to raise at least $3 billion and value the startup at between $15 billion and $20 billion, according to people familiar with the matter.

Mission Lane raises $500 million. Subprime credit-card startup Mission Lane LLC has secured $500 million in financing, emerging from a difficult period of fundraising when it was part of financial-technology company LendUp. The company raised $200 million in equity from Invus Opportunities, LL Funds LLC, QED Investors and funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management LP, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. provided $300 million of debt, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/subprime-credit-card-startup-mission-lane-raises-500-million-after-separating-from-lendup-11568635673?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1&mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc". Mission Lane split from LendUp, formally Flurish Inc., last December, after the combined company struggled to raise capital at its desired valuation.

Fixing hearing loss. Scientists are pursuing the first medicines to treat hearing loss, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. Today's principal treatments hearing aids and electronic devices called cochlear implants help many people who have suffered damage to their ears caused by aging, noise, genetics or drugs. But neither of those treatments cures or counters the biological causes of hearing loss. By contrast, several experimental new drugs aim to do just that. Many of these efforts are still in the early stages. But a few drugs and treatments with potential are now in clinical trials, and investigators say that growing understanding of both the genetics of hearing loss and how the ear works have them hopeful of success.

The gig is up. A decade after companies like Uber rocketed to popularity by offering low-cost, on-demand services, governments are pushing back, demanding many of the same labor protections and other regulatory requirements that the companies avoided in devising their business models, the Journal's Eliot Brown reports. Regulatory moves threaten to add significant costs for the gig economy, which extends beyond Uber and Lyft to a host of delivery companies like DoorDash and Instacart.

Today's IPO: Cloudflare Inc. shares rose 20% in their trading debut Friday after the company's initial public offering of 35 million shares was priced at $15 each, above the expected range of $12 to $14 apiece, the Journal reported. The San Francisco provider of cloud-based networking and cybersecurity services said it would have about 293.3 million shares outstanding after the IPO, giving it a valuation of about $4.4 billion before the start of trading. Major shareholders before the IPO included New Enterprise Associates. Pelion Venture, Venrock and Fidelity Management & Research hold smaller stakes.

Lawsuit Funding: Legalist Inc., a litigation finance startup founded by two Harvard College dropouts, has closed on $100 million for its second fund, WSJ Pro's Will Louch reports. Legalist's two founders dropped out of Harvard in 2016 and were introduced to the concept of litigation financing in a meeting with the general counsel at Y Combinator.

Accel-KKR recapitalizes portfolio companies. Tech investor Accel-KKR joined the growing list of firms "https://www.wsj.com/articles/accel-kkr-recapitalizes-older-portfolio-with-1-39-billion-in-new-capital-for-continuation-fund-11568630700?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1&mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc". The private-equity firm closed Accel-KKR Capital Partners CV III LP with a total of $1.39 billion, including $225 million in fresh capital to fund follow-on investments in four older Accel-KKR portfolio companies.

Exits

Clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company Imara Inc. said it has confidentially filed a draft registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission for a proposed initial public offering. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/drug-company-imara-files-confidentially-for-ipo-11568383433?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc".

Climate change and artificial intelligence will reshape investing, according to an analysis showing that many asset managers are badly prepared for these challenges. Investors will be confronted with difficult asset allocation choices and changes in business models.

"Today's asset management industry may well be unrecognisable by the end of the next decade in the face of these two global mega trends. A profound transformation is now in the pipeline," said Amin Rajan, chief executive of Cre-ate-Research, the consultancy. Create-Research interviewed 45 CIOs, portfolio managers and strategists across 16 countries about their assessment of the risks presented by AI and climate change.

Two-thirds of the participants said AI would "definitely" rewrite asset management and a fifth rated this as a probability.

Tools such as cognitive computing, machine learning and social media are used by portfolio managers and quantitative specialists to look for informational advantages over rival players. Blockchain and robotic process automation are being applied to backoffice functions such as fund accounting and settlements.

Mr Rajan said AI could help to save costs, increase returns and improve the quality of services. "AI can do things previously unimaginable with the volume, velocity, variety and veracity of big data. It can deliver an edge given the information intensity of all of the processes in asset management," he said.

'Today's industry may well be unrecognisable by the end of the next decade due to these trends' More than half (57 per cent) of survey participants said they viewed climate change as both a risk and opportunity, reflecting uncertainty about the topic.

Matt Oomen, global head of distribution at BNY Mellon Investment Management, said supertanker trends, such as AI and climate change, posed big challenges for investments.

"We are witnessing changes in the way markets operate in response to these trends. They will be the defining challenges not just for the current generation of asset managers and investors, but for generations to come," he said.

Israel Prepares to Unleash AI on Health Care; In a small country with digitized records, big data  could make medicine cheaper and more effective

Israel is becoming a testing ground for the power of artificial intelligence to improve health care.

Digital medical records for the vast majority of Israelis are currently stored in databases maintained by the handful of semipublic HMOs that provide most health care in Israel. While the biggest health-maintenance organizations already leverage their records in partnerships with private companies to develop technology for more advanced health care, Israel's government wants to take such efforts to a new level.

The government last year announced a $264 million initiative to begin to combine those millions of records into a giant unified system, one that takes decades of individual patients' information and puts it all in the same format so medical data looks the same across all health-care institutions. Corralling the records and organizing them in ways that maximize their usefulness to AI programs and data analytics, the government hopes, will make the data of even greater value to researchers and health-care companies. And the greater goals, officials say, based largely on the promise of AI technology, are to make health care less expensive, more effective and better tailored to individuals everywhere.

AI-assisted machines and programs, with their ability to learn and draw conclusions from the millions of detailed histories, medical tests and diagnostic results stored in these records, have the potential to help doctors give more preventive care by spotting diseases in earlier stages; tailor more medicine to the needs of specific patients; read diagnostic imagery and lab tests faster and more accurately; and make health-care less expensive.

Israel's plans rely on patients giving their consent for their clinical data to be transferred from the HMOs to the government system. Patients who agree will be asked to supply genetic information and other additional data as well.

Medical experts and government officials in Israel are still grappling with the ethical and privacy implications of the initiative. But a number of international health officials say the potential benefits outweigh the pitfalls. Israel's health-care system already is globally recognized as a leader in using digitally stored data for public health-care delivery. This includes HMO programs and activities such as constantly running algorithms on their patients' data to detect signs of kidney disease or colon cancer.

"I have seen a tremendous amount of output from AI digital startups coming out of Israel," says Eric Topol, director of the La Jolla, Calif.-based Scripps Research Translational Institute, which specializes in tech-powered personalized medicine.

Officials say it could take a decade before the unified system equals the size of databases the HMOs already have. While the effort may at first seem duplicative, the officials emphasize that the point is to make the data more accessible to a broader group of researchers and businesses. The HMOs themselves currently maintain the health records of all Israeli citizens, and their sharing of their own databases with Israeli companies and multinationals working with Israeli partners has led to an explosion of AI-based digital health-care technologies in the country. The Israeli government has helped encourage partnerships and cooperation agreements with foreign businesses and research institutes as well. The technology produced from such partnerships has the potential to be adopted by the national health-care system.

Creating a similar system in the U.S. could be difficult, since most U.S. medical providers aren't digitally connected, or compatible, and must adhere to strict national privacy laws. In Israel, the four government-run HMOs have kept digital records in compatible formats for all patients since the early 1990s. The U.S. and several other countries are working to create similar national databases as Israel, but the data isn't likely to be of the same quality.

Under the rules of the Israeli initiative, parties accessing the data are barred from identifying patients or otherwise causing them harm, government officials say. But some ethicists warn of the dangers of unintended consequences.

Tehilla Shwartz Altshuler, a technology-policy specialist at the Israel Democracy Institute think tank in Jerusalem, says Israel needs legislation that will clearly regulate when patient data can and cannot be used. Health data should be used only to create technology that would clearly benefit the health of Israeli citizens, Dr. Altshuler says, and should not be sold simply for profit. Moreover, people should be informed every time their data may be used on a given project to allow them to opt in or out, she says.

The HMOs and Israel's government say the data is anonymized, meaning it removes any features that could identify any patient. But that might not be enough to satisfy some critics of the project. Dr. Altshuler points to "https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-10933-3" published in Nature Communications in July that showed that 99.98% of Americans could be re-identified from any anonymized data set using 15 demographic characteristics, such as age, marital status and gender.

Health officials are working on legislation that would regulate access to the government and HMO databases, says Itai Kela, head of health tech at the Israel Innovation Authority, a business-focused government agency that is working on the database initiative with the prime minister's office and the Health Ministry.

"The world is global: On one hand you don't want to sell the data outside; it's private data for Israeli citizens," Dr. Kela says. "But on the other hand, you want to collaborate."

Yael Villa, who is heading the work on the national database, known as the Mosaic Initiative, says she wants to create not just a database with clean, easy-to-use data, but a virtual platform that will also give researchers the analytical tools needed to run experiments quickly.

"The idea is to do the dirty work for them and have them invest their time in what they really need to do," she says.

Dr. Villa says that while it could take a few years to reach even 100,000 volunteers, what will differentiate the Israeli national database from other such initiatives will be the combination of the rare 20-year-deep clinical records combined with genomic data.

The work so far is moving slowly. Important issues that still need to be resolved include figuring out how the HMOs will transfer their data to the government system, and exactly who will have access.

The breadth and quality of Israel's trove of medical information are nearly unrivaled, experts say. The HMOs have kept digital patient records from cradle to grave primary and specialty care, lab work, pharmaceutical prescriptions, hospital care and geographic data. The data is well organized, too. Doctors across individual HMO systems use the same methods and formats for note taking, experts say, which will make it easier to design software for working with the new databases and, more important, make it easier for AI systems to analyze the data and learn from it.

Lack of good data in compatible formats has been a major problem for companies trying to leverage technological progress and increased computing power to achieve new breakthroughs in medical science and health care.

Dr. Topol, of Scripps Research Translational Institute, says Israel's data sets help it bypass "a bottleneck for moving the field forward."

Mining the Israeli data for new insights could provide a windfall for the country's already-booming health-care-tech industry. More than 500 Israeli-based startups work in digital health in Israel and together have raised capital in excess of $500 million in 2018, according to Start-Up Nation Central, a Tel Aviv nonprofit that connects businesses to Israel's tech companies.

"As the world moves more and more in the direction [of big-data health care], Israel will be more and more central," says Scott Duke Kominers, an associate professor at Harvard Business School and co-author of a "https://hbr.org/product/maccabitech-the-promise-of-israel-s-healthcare-data/819032-EPB-ENG" that examined the research arm of Israel's second-largest HMO, Maccabi, and its work with private companies to create technology using its database.

Israel has "an unusually strong competitive advantage because of the way the Israeli health-care system works: It's the combination of the data and the computer-science talent," Mr. Kominers says.

Indeed, while the government databases are still years away from completion, Israeli companies already have used the HMO databases to great effect.

One example is K Health, a mobile app launched in 2018 that helps users understand their ailments by mimicking a conversation with a live doctor. The app, through a partnership with Maccabitech,  has access to millions of Israeli medical records, analyzing them in seconds. Users tell the app their age, gender and what's wrong. The app then takes less than a minute to compare the user with thousands of similar cases.

In the U.S., users can pay to speak with doctors who work with K Health about the results. In Israel, users will soon be able to order simple lab tests after consulting the app, bypassing the need to see a family doctor first.

Allon Bloch, a K Health founder, says Maccabitech has access to more than 400 million doctors notes, more than a billion lab exams and hundreds of millions of prescriptions, among other data. Mr. Bloch says his company will continue to add data to the app from countries it operates in.

Anthem Inc., the U.S.-based insurance giant, announced a partnership in July with K Health to eventually bring the app's services to its 40 million clients. The app will let consumers, including those who don't have Anthem insurance, schedule and pay for medical visits through their smartphones, as well as learn potential diagnoses and text with doctors.

 In May, Israel's Innovation Authority signed a memorandum with the Mayo Clinic for Israeli health startups to team up with the U.S. institution's researchers and equipment. There are currently five Israeli companies working with the Mayo Clinic, and dozens more have applied for future work.

"We have been impressed by the level of expertise and how Israeli companies have been able to leverage artificial-intelligence approaches developed in other areas and apply them to solve problems in health care," says Kelly Krajnik, director of strategic opportunities at the Mayo Clinic.

 For example, researchers at the Mayo Clinic worked with the Israeli-based Beyond Verbal, a voice-analytics company that uses Israeli health data, in a 2016 a study that found a correlation between certain voice characteristics and heart disease. The study shows doctors can use a noninvasive method of checking for heart disease just by analyzing a voice.

Another example is Zebra Medical Vision, an Israeli company that uses AI to search for and recognize ailments in CT scans, X-rays and mammograms. The company received grants from Israel's government to deploy its technology throughout Israel's hospitals and health clinics. It charges customers roughly the equivalent of $1 a scan.

While health-care officials are pleased with the results they have seen so far in terms of delivering new technologies, Israeli privacy advocates remain concerned about what they see as a national experiment with sensitive information in medical records.

"This is one of the biggest hacks of privacy in Israel," says Dr. Altshuler, the technology-policy specialist. "We are going to be very sorry for this process in the near future."

Varda Shalev, head of Maccabitech, says her HMO uses the highest standards of security. She says the small risks to privacy are worth the benefit.

"Putting it in balance," Dr. Shalev says, "I think we are doing the right thing."

Otis Names New CFO as It Preps for Separation From United Technologies; Rahul Ghai joins the elevator maker from defense company L3 Harris Technologies

Otis Elevator Co. hired a new finance chief as it gets ready to separate from industrial conglomerate United Technologies Corp.

The Farmington, Conn.-based maker of elevators and escalators said Monday that Rahul Ghai is its new chief financial officer. Mr. Ghai joins from defense company Harris Corp., which this year completed a combination with L3 Technologies. Mr. Ghai had been Harris's CFO since February 2016. Prior to Harris, he worked in financial roles at health insurer Aetna Inc. and Otis's parent company, United Technologies.

United Technologies is in the process of breaking itself "https://www.wsj.com/articles/united-technologies-to-separate-into-three-independent-companies-1543272920", even as competitor Thyssenkrupp AG prepares to sell its elevator unit.

United Technologies's Carrier Global Corp., the heating-and-cooling business, and Otis are expected to become separate companies in 2020, leaving United Technologies to focus on aerospace. Carrier Global on Friday"https://www.wsj.com/articles/carriers-new-cfo-to-guide-spinoff-from-united-technologies-11568409546".

Otis is seeking approval from regulators on its future capital and tax structure and is setting up its own management and finance systems, United Technologies Chief Executive Gregory Hayes said at an investor conference Thursday.

That will entail additional costs because Otis will no longer benefits from centralized functions. Mr. Ghai is expected to focus on reducing costs across departments and on pruning the independent entity's portfolio, said Joshua Aguilar, an analyst at Morningstar Inc.

Otis in its latest quarter reported a 6% drop in new equipment orders compared to the same prior-year period. Some of that decline is down to slowing economic growth in China, an important market for Otis, resulting in pricing pressure for the manufacturer.

"Pricing has been a big detriment for Otis," said Sheila Kahyaoglu, an equity analyst at investment bank Jefferies LLC.

Otis generates about 45% of its revenue from sales of new elevators, while maintenance services account for 55% of its turnover. The company recorded net sales of $3.3 billion in the quarter ended June 30.

Competitor Thyssenkrupp is also working to separate its elevator division in response to criticism from activist investors over its structure. The company initially planned to break itself up, but shelved those plans in May as it seeks to sell part of the elevator business "https://www.wsj.com/articles/thyssenkrupp-abandons-planned-split-pursues-ipo-11557486499" during the 2019-20 fiscal year. Management is also listening to potential buyers, Chief Executive Guido Kerkhoff has said.

A potential sale or IPO at Thyssenkrupp could highlight the state of the unit's maintenance services compared to Otis, said Josh Sullivan, an analyst at Seaport Global Securities LLC. "The growth in this industry is on the service side," Mr. Sullivan said. "That is where your margins are, and Otis is playing catch-up with Thyssenkrupp."

Remote analytics and augmented reality tools can help bring down maintenance costs, and Otis could boost investments in the service area once it has been spun out of United Technologies, Mr. Sullivan said. "It will be up to the new CFO to make these investments wisely but judiciously, as the industry is changing," he said.

Otis said Mr. Ghai would focus on achieving earnings growth and performance goals in his new role.

"Rahul has joined us at a pivotal time as we prepare to drive growth and shareowner value as a stand-alone company," Judy Marks, Otis's chief executive, said in a statement. "He has outstanding public company leadership experience, and brings to Otis a deep understanding of the needs and expectations of the investor community."

Industry report finds fund sector is badly prepared to tackle its biggest challenges

Climate change and artificial intelligence will reshape the future of investing, according to an analysis that indicates that much of the asset management industry is badly prepared for these twin challenges.

The operations ofcompanies and financial markets will be affected by global warming and rapid developments in advanced computing, confronting investors with difficult asset allocation choices and driving radical changes in the business models of asset managers.

 Today s asset management industry may well be unrecognisable by the end of the next decade in the face of these two global mega trends. A profound transformation is now in the pipeline,  said Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create-Research, the consultancy.

Two-thirds of the survey participants said developments in AI would  definitely  rewrite the future of asset management globally and a further fifth rated this as a probability.

More than half (57 per cent) of survey participants said they viewed climate change as both a risk and opportunity, reflecting widespread uncertainty about how global warming might affect investment portfolios.

Mr Rajan said investors were faced with  huge judgment calls  on the potential loss of value in stranded assets such as coal and oil reserves at a time when renewable energy technology had not progressed enough to make a big dent in fossil fuel dependency.

In addition, few countries have priced carbon pollution high enough to meet globally agreed temperature targets, leaving investors to guess when more draconian measures might become inevitable.

Matt Oomen, global head of distribution at BNY Mellon Investment Management which commissioned the research, said  supertanker trends , such as AI and climate change, posed big challenges for the investment community.

 We are already witnessing changes in the way markets operate in response to these trends. They will be the defining challenges not just for the current generation of asset managers and investors, but for generations to come,  he said.

New Products The introduction of huge fines for allowing cyber hacks; a beefed-up rule book for European markets; and the spectre of a bad Brexit: European companies faced a host of threats last year. While uncomfortable for businesses at the receiving end, those challenges have spelt new opportunities for law firms that are helping their clients navigate them. "The world in Europe changed last year and it was all to do with GDPR," says Patrick Van Eecke, partner and global co-chair of data protection, privacy and security at law firm DLA Piper. To some, the letters GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) might conjure up needy emails from retailers and news websites beseeching customers "not to leave". But for companies operating across the EU, the new data protection rules, designed to prevent the abuse of personal data, have resulted in big new obligations and potentially devastating fines for breaches.

"Before that, companies could shuffle breaches into the background and hope no one would find out about them," says Mr Van Eecke. Today companies have just 72 hours to notify their relevant data regulator in the UK, the Information Commissioner and risk punitive fines of up to 4 per cent of their annual revenues or  ¬20m, whichever is the higher, for infringing certain rules. In the UK, for example, DLA Piper lawyers across Europe, the firm launched its Notify software, which uses an algorithm based on the requirements, definitions and exemptions surrounding data breaches and the necessary response. It replaces a process of human interpretation with a streamlined questionnaire that spits out a reporting template too. Last year British Airways was the first company to be fined under GDPR by the UK regulator, after cyber hackers stole personal data of half a million of the airline's customers, resulting in a 183m fine. Lawyers have legal privilege, giving them an advantage over the Big Four accountancy the previous maximum fine was 500,000, as levied on Facebook in 2018 for failing to protect users' personal information in the Cambridge Analytica data scandal. Yet, despite the possibility of fines, there are no clear guidelines on how to define the severity of a breach, and it is not straightforward to work out whether customers should be informed. "Companies are struggling with the definitions of 'high impact' and 'high risk' in the context of a data breach because it has not been defined by legislation," says Mr Van Eecke. Some law firms have devised systems to help companies understand their responsibilities. After work by and consultancy firms, which have been encroaching on law firms' turf, particularly in areas of employment law and intellectual property. "Law is the only profession to offer privilege on all information shared in a cyber incident," says Mr Van Eecke. "When the situation can change on an hour-by-hour basis you don't want to have any documents created by consultants which do not fall under privilege, as the company could be in extreme danger," he argues. Another seismic regulatory shift has hit companies in Europe over the past year. In January 2018, European market rules were overhauled in ambitious reforms known as Mifid II. The aim was to afford greater protection to investors and improve transparency of trading and investing across asset classes, from derivatives to bonds and fixed income. But the legislation seven years in the making and running to some 1.5m paragraphs of text had a big impact on companies operating in financial markets, which sought stringent advice from lawyers and consultancies. One change affected financial companies relying on trading venues, which have mushroomed across Europe. After Mifid II came in, the venues amended their rules. "The rule books can range from 50 pages to over 200," says April Brousseau, head of innovation and new business The devil is in the data Seismic regulatory shifts for companies in Europe spell new opportunities for law firms. By Kate Beioley Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg testifies to a US Senate committee last year PHOTO: GETTY 30 at law firm Simmons & Simmons. The firm has devised Trading Venue Reviewer, a tool that allows clients to compare and contrast the rules on each venue on a single platform. Regulatory changes such as Mifid II, GDPR and uncertainty thrown up by Brexit have led to new mandates for the Big Four accounting and consultancy firms. The Big Four, it was predicted in 2017, could earn as much as $30bn a year from consulting business, A&O Consulting, and says it is filling a gap highlighted by clients, including big banks. "Law firms have tended to give structural advice and consultancy firms have come in to do the implementation. But as a bank you have to deal with two different parties and there's a risk of a lack of co-ordination or the ball getting dropped between the two," says Tom Lodder, legal services, according to ALM Intelligence, a consulting and legal analyst. In July, one of the Big Four, Deloitte, hired Andrew Lilley, former managing partner at law firm Travers Smith, to lead its employment practice, having secured an alternative business licence in June 2018. The move intensified an increasingly fierce turf war. Magic circle law firm Allen & Overy has set up its own managing director of A&O Consulting. "The incumbents probably aren't happy with the increased competition. We have interaction with the Big Four and we are learning from them and, in some cases, stealing talent too." New Products and Services Rank Law firm Originality Leadership Impact Total Standout Kennedys Developed a suite of products for claims management, helping clients to save time, money and use lawyers less. PuniWraps, an artificial intelligence tool for Bermuda-based clients to manage high-volume, low-level punitive damage claims, reduces processing time by 40 per cent and saves an average $500 per claim. The Subro tool takes out the complexity for clients to recover damages owed by third parties, removing the need for external lawyers. A third tool, Riverstone, enables clients to manage high-volume construction claims at speed and scale. 9 8 8 25 Simmons & Simmons Developed the Trading Venue Reviewer to provide clients with summaries of the rule books and associated risks of more than 140 trading venues in Europe. The tool is subscription based and customisable, helping clients ensure compliance and operational efficiency to avoid fines and sanctions. The firm estimates it would take four times longer to manage risks and requirements for the venues without TVR. 8 8 8 24 Highly commended Dentons Established a new service for central European clients that advises on opportunities for EU funding, grants and tax incentives to further company research and development of new technology. The offering combines legal, tax, consulting, financial, scientific and technological expertise. The group is advising 15 clients on  ¬250m worth of grants and funded projects to develop new intellectual property and process improvements. 7 8 8 23 DLA Piper Developed Notify, an algorithmic tool to help clients assess both the severity of a data breach and whether they are required to report it to authorities within the set 72-hour window. Lawyers and technologists across the firm's European offices collaborated with the European Union Agency for Cybersecurity, using official reporting standards to develop the algorithm, removing personal bias in decision making. 8 8 7 23 Ecija Partnering with Prodigioso Volcn, a Spanish public relations agency, the firm produces plain-language contracts for financial sector clients, combining clear language with visual communication. Financial institutions in Spain had been under scrutiny for using unclear and potentially misleading language in customer contracts, requiring a reworking of much of their documentation. Clients include local council projects such as the redesign of traffic fines. Mishcon de Reya Two new services, MDR Brand and MDR Cyber have expanded the firm's offering into consulting and other professional services. MDR Brand packages services such as brand licensing, commercial partnerships, intellectual property and legal advisory for clients. MDR Cyber combines legal advice with reputational management, cyber security and digital investigations. Software developed in-house supports the offering, helping the team to capture data faster and with less risk for clients. 8 8 7 23 Norton Rose Fulbright Developed N-Accelerate, a process for the automation of complex transaction documents, making production 10 times faster than traditional document automation tools, with an error rate of zero. The process has enabled lawyers without coding experience to automate Loan Market Association documents and templates for other transactions. The time taken to draft LMAs has shrunk from 10 hours to 20 minutes. 7 8 8 23 8 8 7 23 Commended Allen & Overy Launched A&O Consulting to provide strategic advice and operational support to clients on complex regulatory matters. Consultants combine traditional legal services with advisory on governance, corporate purpose and culture, operational risk and regulatory policy. Deloitte Legal (Spain) Following the introduction of tax obligations in Spain requiring companies to provide real-time invoice data to tax authorities, the firm developed My Tax Analytics to automate the process and leverage the potential of the new datasets. The system can detect invoicing discrepancies, automatically populate tax forms and improve budgeting and resource planning. 7 22 Mills & Reeve According to the UK's Solicitors Regulation Authority, 75 per cent of all reported cyber crimes in 2016 were "Friday afternoon frauds", when large sums are handled at the completion of property conveyancing transactions, worth a total of 85m. The firm has set up a service with insurance client Pen Underwriting to streamline responses to notification of a fraud, reducing reaction time and recouping more 50 per cent of its 2018 losses, amounting to 2.5m. Shoosmiths Development Constraints is a new service for property developers to reduce the burden of costly and unnecessary insurance premiums on greenfield projects. A team of lawyers analysed surveyor reports to assess whether the legal risks associated with high-rise construction, such as the impact on a neighbour's right to natural light, were properly appraised. The firm found that reports frequently assessed this risk to be too high, which led to unnecessarily expensive insurance cover. Commended: Wayne Nash. CMS Expanded the equIP programme to international markets. Now 73 start-ups from more than 20 countries are involved in the incubation programme. CMS lawyers who worked for the start-ups at a discounted rate do not suffer remuneratively. Lawyers have worked on four exits and 60 fundraisings since the programme's inception in 2015. Commended: Anthony Waller. Goodwin Created the En Bloc security agreement to simplify the process for banks to secure syndicated loans in Germany. The package includes all rights and protections necessary, reduces documentation by 75 per cent and cuts errors and duplicative work. A matrix of providers and security options provides banks with a complete overview of a credit security package on one page. Allen & Overy Developed marginMAPP, an online tool freely available to all clients to assist them with identifying whether new arrangements are needed to comply with initial margin rules. The tool was built on Neota Logic's automation software, using decisiontree logic, cutting time and costs associated with complying with the new initial margin rules. Herbert Smith Freehills Developed software to determine automatically what personal information data breaches contain, and whether there are notification requirements. Documents with the most sensitive data are prioritised and the software works with the ediscovery software Relativity to enhance efficiencies. Estimated cost savings on medium-sized breaches are $200,000. Commended: Andrew Moir. Selepey, Volkovetsky & Partners Specialising in the distressed assets market in Ukraine, the firm combines legal and broader business advice to improve compliance with consulting services to assist business development for clients. The firm takes options in revitalised assets rather than a fee based on hourly billing, and has revitalised several large supermarket chains. Toffoletto De Luca Tamajo e Soci Implemented a structured process to commoditise legal services, developing several products that lawyers can pitch as part of their service to clients. Teams of lawyers and trainees worked together to develop and market the new tools, which cover long-distance employee monitoring, flexible working policies, data privacy, employee benefit plans and whistleblowing. 7 8 7 22 7 8 7 7 8 22 8 8 6 22 6 8 7 21 7 7 7 21 6 7 7 20 7 7 6 20 6 7 7 20 6 7 7 20 New Products RESEARCH AND AWARD SUPPORTED BY 32 ING has set up an 'Obeya' war room to discuss topics Strategy and Changing Behaviours Rank Law firm Originality Leadership Impact Total Standout Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer The firm is one year into a threeyear digital transformation strategy to change the way it approaches client matters, technology and the lawyer/business professional divide. Coming out of this overall strategy for example is Mattrs, a platform through which clients experience the services and products of the firm. Commended: Charlotte Baldwin. 8 9 8 25 Kennedys Since 2018, the firm has seen a 31 per cent increase in profitability, which it attributes to using technology to remove the need for lawyers for certain tasks across all its client matters, particularly in insurance claims. Commended: Richard West. 7 9 8 24 Pinsent Masons Became one of the first leading international law firms to commit to becoming a purpose-led business, an initiative that involved all its 3,000 people across 24 offices and 2,000 data points. The firm's purpose, values and required behaviours are articulated, and it is now incorporating this into every business line and client interaction. Commended: Richard Foley. 8 10 6 24 Taylor Vinters A purpose-led strategy has led the firm to make tough decisions on client and talent selection. It launched a #GreaterThings campaign last year to reinforce its employer brand, which made the partners' contribution to the firm's culture part of their remuneration. The firm saw a 15 per cent increase in revenues last year. 8 9 7 24 Highly commended Garrigues The firm set up a legal operations delivery team and seven specific topic hubs through which it delivers services and works with clients. The firm's new digital strategy is breaking down traditional practice area silos and fostering multidisciplinary teams. 7 8 7 22 Hogan Lovells The firm set out to tackle intolerant attitudes and harassment in the workplace with its Project Respect programme. Every employee must undertake a two-hour workshop, and "respect advocates" provide a new channel for reporting bullying or harassment. 7 8 7 22 Commended Macfarlanes In an attempt to change staff behaviours around using email for non-matter communication, the firm is using HighQ Collaborate to remove "noise" from inboxes. All knowledge management and insights are directed through the platform, with project management resources, business development and marketing information, new feeds, case decision, training updates and social events information. Commended: Damian Crossley. Note: HighQ is a sponsor of the Innovative Lawyers awards. 7 7 7 21 Sorainen With operations in Belarus, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the firm pursued a strategy of integration and cultural unification that enables it to be the only law firm that operates as a single entity across the Baltics and Belarus. Hiring a new operating officer brought in new management practices, training for lawyers and investments in technology and allowed the managing partner to focus on building practice areas. Aequo The firm's goal to transition from newcomer to top five law firm in Ukraine in the next five years has been aided by Aequo Academy, a training initiative that helps it focus on brand, innovation and advanced knowledge management. It became the first Ukrainian law firm to join the UN Global Compact. Since 2017, it has had a 30 per cent increase in new clients. 6 7 7 20 CMS Launched the platform #hacks, built on Crowdicity software used to collect and gamify the generation of ideas, to encourage innovation in the firm. So far 1,400 people have joined the platform, and more than 90 ideas have been generated, with more than 1,200 votes cast. Ideas include a new client portal, document automation products and using cryptocurrency as a reward system. 5 7 8 20 Talent, Strategy and Changing Behaviours Rank In-house legal team Originality Leadership Impact Total Standout Lloyds Banking Group The bank's legal team created the "Shaping Our Future" initiative to support its new digital strategy.

They are taught systems thinking and given mentorship to provide a holistic and hands-on training experience. Solutions developed over eight missions to date have benefited other employees. Commended Accenture Since over 50 per cent of new deals by Accenture now comprise a digital component, the company needed the team to develop their digital skills. Working with coaching company Cognician, the team built a scalable digital platform to deliver their Missions training programme to more than 465 lawyers in 42 countries. The platform uses deal simulations to tie training to real work experiences. 6 8 7 21 Aviva Collaborating with law firm Pinsent Masons and media company Crafty Counsel, the team created 10 short training videos on legal and regulatory developments for both internal and external use. The videos are short and accessible anywhere. 7 7 6 20 ING Bank Developed a legal Obeya room (Japanese for "war room"), used in lean manufacturing to refer to a room set aside for meetings and discussion on particular topics. The room comes with communication tools, and processes and principles for how it is used. 6 7 7 20 Anheuser-Busch InBev The world's largest brewer teamed up with digital production company GadFly to create interactive training videos, addressing ethics and compliance issues such as harassment and corruption, helping empower employees to raise concerns. 6 6 7 19 Robert Bosch The team defined its purpose and culture to restructure how it operate. It developed a "find your lawyer" tool for internal clients to find quickly the right skill set for a specific task anywhere across its global operations. 6 7 6 19 7 7 7 21 7 8 7 22 Commended Mills & Reeve Implemented a programme to encourage innovation in the firm that includes a hub built on the Crowdicity platform. Multiple ideas have been posted and voted on, nearly 75 per cent of which have been developed. 5 7 8 20 Obelisk Support The firm continues to refine its business model, which focuses on getting women back into the legal workforce. Working for leading financial institutions, it hires alumni who want to work on a flexible or remote basis. PLMJ Undertook a comprehensive and lasting exercise with staff and clients to rebrand the firm and refresh its cultural values and strategy. It looked back over its 50-year history and defined its identity in the Portuguese legal market as lawyers capable of transforming client businesses. 6 7 7 20 Shearman & Sterling The firm's "client value" team continues to transform efficiencies in the firm. Most recently, it worked with the capital markets group to change working patterns and enhance relationships. In some cases, document automation is 85 per cent faster and contract review is 95 per cent faster.

London Stock Exchange Rejects Bid From Rival Hong Kong Exchange; U.K. exchange operator says it has 'fundamental concerns' about the price and strategic aim of the proposed deal

LONDON London Stock Exchange Group PLC took a swipe at Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. Friday, rejecting its $36.6 billion bid and questioning Hong Kong's future as a financial gateway to China.

Undeterred, the HKEX said it was disappointed the LSE had failed to properly engage in talks and said it would continue to talk to LSE shareholders about its unsolicited offer.

The U.K. operator said it remains committed to buying financial-information and terminal company Refinitiv Holdings Ltd., "https://www.wsj.com/articles/london-stock-exchange-eyes-27-billion-bet-for-blackstones-refinitiv-11564222109" that would have been scrapped if the Hong Kong exchange succeeded in its bid.

Shares in LSE were 2% higher after the rejection, having already risen almost 6% on Wednesday after HKEX announced its unsolicited offer, surprising investors. Analysts say HKEX could improve its offer with a larger cash component, or that other exchanges may want to bid for the London exchange.

HKEX's bid has led some investors and analysts to question whether a new round of global exchange consolidation is coming, potentially involving the U.S. exchange giants: NYSE parent Intercontinental Exchange Inc., known as ICE, or futures-exchange behemoth CME Group Inc., the world's biggest exchange operator by market cap.

"We'd expect the U.S. exchanges might be viewed as logical additions to fill the North American presence of a truly global exchange model," Sandler O'Neill + Partners wrote in a research note Thursday. ICE explored a possible bid for the LSE in 2016 but ultimately backed away.

Representatives of CME and ICE declined to comment.

In a letter to the Hong Kong exchange issued publicly, LSE Chairman Don Robert said LSE's board doesn't believe HKEX is the best partner for its long-term positioning in Asia, and that the company's cash-and-shares offer is unattractive because of "inherent uncertainty" around the value of HKEX shares.

"We question the sustainability of HKEX's position as a strategic gateway in the longer term," Mr. Robert said. He added that the Shanghai Stock Exchange is its preferred and direct channel to access opportunities in China.

A successful tie-up between LSE and HKEX looked like a long shot to many analysts because of regulatory and political hoops. Hong Kong is reeling from a summer of "https://www.wsj.com/articles/hong-kong-protesters-call-for-u-s-support-11567931423" that have raised concerns about China's tightening grip on the financial center. London is grappling with its own political upheaval in the form of Brexit.

The history of the exchange business over the past decade is riddled with failed cross-border deals. Many of these were blocked by regulators out of concerns that a prized national asset would be taken over by foreigners, or that the takeover would give the combined company monopolistic pricing power in crucial financial markets. Exchanges themselves have often failed to agree on deal terms and how to structure a combined entity.

The bid from Hong Kong was the latest for LSE, which has become a highly sought-after target for a range of suitors over several years, attracting multiple bids and making multiple acquisitions of its own. The group, which has been offering stock trading for more than 200 years, now derives much of its value from data services and the popularity of passive investing.

Revenue from LSE's clearing house and financial indexing business far outstrips a 20% contribution from its more traditional exchange businesses of floating companies and securities trading. That was the big lure for the Hong Kong exchange group.

LSE's stock has soared ninefold in the past 10 years, compared with a 47% rise in the FTSE 100 index of the U.K.'s largest companies. It had risen 80% this year even before the HKEX offer.

That performance sets it apart from other U.K. financial companies such as banks whose stocks have been dragged down by low interest rates and stricter regulation since the financial crisis. In contrast, LSE has benefited from postcrisis rules pushing more derivatives through its LCH clearing house and a boom in indexed funds.

Tracing its roots to City of London coffee houses where stockbrokers set up shop, LSE thrived as London established itself as a global hub for company fundraising and trading. It floated its own shares in 2000, and spent much of the next decade fending off takeover attempts by rivals including Nasdaq and Deutsche Boerse AG.

It has averaged a bid approach every 2 years since its initial public offering, according to analysts at Berenberg Bank.

But while British banks during the 2000s were multiplying in value from global expansion and increased risk taking, the London exchange was at threat of becoming obsolete. Its monopoly on domestic stock trading was ended by a 2007 European Union directive that paved the way for alternative trading platforms. It suffered more and its shares slumped as company listings and trading volumes collapsed after the financial crisis.

Xavier Rolet, who was LSE's chief executive between 2009 and 2017, is credited with reversing the decline and transforming the company into a global force. He led the acquisition of around 25 companies, including LCH and the FTSE Russell financial indexing business.

As of June 30, LSE's post-trade services made up 38% of its 1.14 billion ($1.41 billion) in revenue, and information services made up 39%.

In an interview Thursday, Mr. Rolet said his vision for LSE was to deepen its role connecting companies, banks and investors globally, and to let users pay for the products and pieces of financial plumbing they needed access to, rather than making them pay for bundled services at a single price.

"We wanted to be one of the two or three financial infrastructure companies with the full set of products," Mr. Rolet said. He predicted LSE will eventually have an American or Chinese owner as the industry continues to consolidate.

His successor, David Schwimmer, set three goals for the group: to expand globally, become more diversified by asset class and bolster its data analytics business. In August, Mr. Schwimmer said the plan to buy Refinitiv, which supplies market information and operates foreign-exchange and bond trading platforms, addresses all of those ambitions.

LSE's earlier smart bets made the Refinitiv bid possible, since it has a strong share price to use as currency, said Chris Turner, a senior equity analyst at Berenberg. The planned purchase, agreed with Refinitiv's shareholder Blackstone Group, shot LSE stock up 30%.

"That's the problem for Hong Kong exchange. Now you need to pay a premium over that premium. It's too expensive now for others," Mr. Turner said.

Corrections & Amplifications

The name of Verizon Ventures' parent company is Verizon Communications Inc. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated it was Verizon Wireless. (Sept. 12, 2019)

As wireless carriers begin rolling out next-generation 5G network technology and as 5G-enabled smartphones reach consumers, some investors are readying for a boom in new startups.

The power of the new networks is expected to "https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-5g-will-mean-to-consumersand-when-1536804241" groundbreaking possibilities. Higher speeds and reduced lag time will pave the way for new businesses, experts say. Corporate venture firms whose parent companies are racing to deploy the technology are "https://www.wsj.com/articles/five-small-5g-related-companies-that-investors-should-watch-11551236401" on these startups.

Chris Bartlett, the head of Verizon Communications Inc.'s Verizon Ventures, joined WSJ Pro Venture Capital to discuss his firm's approach to investing in 5G-related startups. Here are edited excerpts:

What is Verizon Ventures' investing strategy when it comes to 5G?

We want to get a couple things out of investments. The first is simply insight and knowledge that we can bring back to our business units. 5G is just one element of Verizon's strategies. It's a key part of our venture investing supporting the evolution of the 5G ecosystem and the various use cases that might develop.

We certainly don't have a crystal ball, but we think some use cases could be more industrial- or business-focused than in previous wireless technology cycles, such as 4G.

Are there startups in your portfolio that are completely dependent on 5G?

The short answer is yes. Recently we've invested in a couple of companies that I would say are aligned, by either hardware or software, to our 5G deployment. And then there are others, like the last handful of investments we've made, that are more tangentially related [to 5G]. Many are network- or connectivity-centric and make our core network more efficient.

Can you talk about the balance of deciding whether it is too early to invest in a startup that needs a 5G network to do what it wants to do?

We're very much prepared to make investments in businesses that are developed specifically for 5G or beyond use cases. And sometimes there's a dearth of those, because people are still building solutions that are architected for 4G-type connectivity.

Given where we sit here at Verizon, I would think we have the best insight into what 5G is actually going to enable. I think the challenge is that the software and platforms just don't exist yet to take advantage of the currencies and the low latencies of 5G.

Some founders are spooked by the idea of taking corporate venture capital. They say it's like handing over their keys to a competitor. With 5G's potential and technical nature, how are those concerns discussed within your team?

I think the sources of concern have been less around what you described and more around, "Does the corporate strategy change and therefore you're not going to support us anymore?" Candidly, our corporate strategy has been pretty consistent with a network centricity.

The benefit of getting access to our technologists, our presence, our customers, our distribution ultimately outweighs concerns [founders] have about their IP. We're able to turbocharge their business with our resources.

So far, the virtual-reality sector hasn't transformed the media and entertainment landscape as many thought it would, and venture capital has been slowing. Is 5G the missing link?

The adoption curve on [VR] has been slower to develop. But many of those are very consumer-leaning applications for virtual reality. I think the use cases more likely to take will be less sexy, such as augmented reality for industrial use and real-time industrial analytics, for example.

I do think 5G in many cases is the linchpin and there will be an earlier adoption curve on the industrial side versus the consumer side for AR/VR.

Summit Partners Leads Investment Round in Akeneo; The growth-equity round will pump $46 million into the provider of product information management software

Growth-equity investor Summit Partners has led a $46 million funding round into Akeneo SAS, a product-experience software provider that serves retailers and brands.

Akeneo, based in Nantes, France, is a technology company whose software helps merchants and product managers collect and sort product information to distribute it to sales and e-commerce channels. It counts Sephora, Fossil and Shop.com among its clients.

Current investors in the company, including Alven Capital, Partech Ventures and Salesforce Ventures, also participated in the funding round, alongside Stephan Dietrich, an Akeneo director.

The fresh capital follows a $13 million funding round from Partech and Alven in 2017. Last December, Salesforce Ventures and Mr. Dietrich also supplied capital to the company. Mr. Dietrich joined the Akeneo board at that time.

Steffan Peyer, a principal on Summit's London team, said the latest funding round brings the total amount of capital raised by the company to around $60 million. He said that Summit was attracted to the company because of its place in the product information management sector where software providers help retailers ensure a positive customer experience through data management and analytics.

The company has already grown through at least one acquisition. In January Akeneo said it bought Sigmento, an Israeli company that focuses on product-data automation.

Mr. Peyer said that Summit aims to help expand the company's sales and marketing team and expand internationally particularly in the U.S., where the company sees unmet demand.

In addition, the company has earmarked the capital for product development, including integrating its software with artificial intelligence-powered data, Mr. Peyer said.

Summit Partners' investments range from growth equity and venture capital to credit and public equity, according to the firm's website. For growth investments the Boston-based firm generally invests $10 million to $500 million per company across health-care and life sciences businesses and technology companies, among other growth-oriented enterprises.

In March, Summit announced it had "https://www.wsj.com/articles/summit-partners-raises-4-9-billion-for-latest-growth-fund-11551822301" for its latest flagship fund.

Tech-Driven Litigation Finance Firm Raises $100 Million for Latest Fund; The latest fund from Legalist far surpasses the firm's first litigation investment vehicle, which raised $10.25 million in 2017

Legalist Inc., a litigation finance startup founded by two Harvard College dropouts, has closed on $100 million for its second fund.

The firm raised the money largely from institutional investors, including endowments and insurance companies, to source and finance civil lawsuits that require less than $1 million in funding.

The fund reflects a strong appetite from institutional investors for a once-niche strategy that has "https://www.wsj.com/articles/litigation-funding-moves-into-mainstream-1470338402?mod=article_inline" from endowments, pension funds and wealthy individuals in recent years. The funding of lawsuits by uninvolved third parties became more commonplace in the late 1990s. In recent years, the strategy has become more popular as the returns it generates aren't tied to the broader markets.

"Litigation finance returns are uncorrelated and as an asset class are very high yield, which is one reason the fund is attractive to institutional investors," said Eva Shang, Legalist's co-founder and chief executive.

Ms. Shang declined to comment on the returns the firm's first fund generated. That vehicle "https://www.wsj.com/articles/vcs-back-tech-driven-litigation-finance-1503574201" in 2017.

Financing lawsuits can be high risk. If a case is unsuccessful, the backers of the litigation stand to lose their entire investment.

Other organizations that have raised money to finance legal disputes include London-based Burford Capital Ltd., a publicly traded firm which "https://www.wsj.com/articles/muddy-waters-claim-sees-shares-in-litigation-finance-firm-tumble-11565178688?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=7" last month from short seller Muddy Waters Research. Longford Capital Management LP, whose investors include Jeffrey Vinik, owner of the National Hockey League's Tampa Bay Lightning, closed its second litigation fund "https://www.wsj.com/articles/litigation-funder-longford-raises-500-million-as-industry-surges-1505707261?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=6" in 2017 with a strategy to fund corporate lawsuits.

Ms. Shang said that despite the substantial step-up in fund size, Legalist will continue focusing on smaller cases, as there are fewer competitors in this segment of the market. Burford, for example, usually works with larger companies including members of the Fortune 500, according to its website.

San Francisco-based Legalist prefers to support small businesses that typically lack the cash reserves to finance potentially expensive litigation battles and would rather use the money to expand.

"Technology allows Legalist to fund  David versus Goliath' cases brought by small businesses," said Ms. Shang.

Last year, the firm saw applications for around $1 billion of litigation financing, she added.

A recent example of successful litigation financed by Legalist's first fund involved a dispute between a Massachusetts-based maker of ice-cream sandwiches and a vendor, in which the manufacturer said sold it poor-quality ice cream. A firm spokesman said it made a profit from funding this case.

Legalist also differs from most of its peers in that it uses computer algorithms to assess which cases to back. Most firms have lawyers which review cases by hand.

The algorithms used to assess state and federal court cases takes into account the reputation of the presiding judge or appeals court for being plaintiff-friendly or defense-friendly, among other factors, when deciding which cases to back.

The company recently hired former U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Richard A. Posner as an adviser. Mr. Posner will be responsible for helping with outreach, and his long legal resume helps establish the firm's credibility with lawyers, Ms. Shang said. Both Ms. Shang and Legalist's other co-founder, Christian Haigh, lack legal backgrounds.

Alongside its two founders and Mr. Posner, the firm employs two attorneys and four engineers.

Legalist's two founders dropped out of Harvard in 2016 and were originally planning on setting up a legal analytics company. A meeting with the general counsel at Y Combinator, the famed Silicon Valley startup accelerator, introduced the duo to the concept of litigation financing and set them on the path to founding Legalist.

Good day! Hong Kong's stock exchange threw a wrench into Blackstone Group's planned sale of Refinitiv Holdings to the London Stock Exchange with a $36.6 billion bid for the LSE that depends on the Refinitiv deal being scrapped.

The Dallas-based firm invested in Kainai Forage LP, a supplier of timothy hay, alfalfa and other field products to markets such as Japan, South Korea, the Middle East and China.

SmileDirectClub's IPO Draws Cheers From Teledentistry Rivals

As SmileDirectClub Inc. prepares to go public Thursday, other venture-backed startups in the teledentistry business say the initial public offering itself is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/smiledirectclubs-ipo-draws-cheers-from-teledentistry-rivals-11568234607?mod=djemPrivateEquityPro&tpl=pe", WSJ Pro's Katie Roof reports.

The company Wednesday said its IPO priced at $23 a share, raising $1.35 billion. This gives SmileDirectClub a market capitalization of $8.9 billion before it expects to begin trading on the Nasdaq on Thursday. The startup received backing at a $3.2 billion valuation last year from Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, Kleiner Perkins and Spark Capital. Now, it will be the first to complete an initial public offering out of a growing group of startups such as Candid Care Co. and Uniform Teeth that are challenging the traditional orthodontics business.

Blackstone Closes Record Real-Estate Fund at $20.5 Billion

Blackstone Group Inc. has raised the largest commercial real-estate fund ever, with $20.5 billion of commitments despite an increasingly tough commercial property market, the Journal reports. The giant investment firm, which had $153.6 billion in real-estate assets under management at the end of the second quarter, has been the world's leading real-estate fundraiser. Before it closed the most recent global fund, Blackstone accounted for five of the top 10 largest real-estate funds ever raised, according to data firm Preqin Ltd. Its previous real-estate fund, which closed in 2015, raised $15.8 billion, which was the record until now.

Big Number

$9.406 Trillion

Total estimated U.S. residential mortgage debt at the end of June, surpassing the record $9.294 trillion peak reached in 2008 and adding to pressures on consumer spending this year, according to BDO USA LLP

Deals

Hong Kong Exchange's LSE Bid May Derail Blackstone's Refinitiv Deal

Blackstone Group Inc.'s sale of Refinitiv Holdings Ltd. may be thwarted by the Hong Kong stock exchange's unsolicited $36.6 billion bid to buy its London-based rival in a deal that would unite two of the world's major trading hubs when both are under severe political pressure. A Blackstone-led group acquired Refinitiv from Thomson Reuters Corp. in a deal announced last year and last month said it would sell the business to the London Stock Exchange for $14.5 billion in stock. But the bid to combine the Hong Kong and London exchanges may founder. The LSE reacted skeptically, calling it "preliminary and highly conditional," while reaffirming its commitment to the Refinitiv transaction.

KKR & Co. has acquired a majority stake in Burning Glass International Inc., a Boston company that does business as Burning Glass Technologies and provides real-time labor-market data. The New York firm bought the stake through its Global Impact strategy, which targets businesses that can help meet United Nations sustainable development goals. Burning Glass provides data that helps determine what jobs and skills are likely to be needed in the future, aiding educational institutions and training managers. Seller Providence Equity Partners acquired the interest in Burning Glass through its Providence Strategic Growth arm in 2015.

Permira-backed software company TeamViewer GmbH has set a price range of  ¬23.50 to  ¬27.50 per share ($25.87 to $30.27) for its initial public offering, which is expected to commence Thursday and could raise more than $2.54 billion. As many as 84 million shares may be sold, including 9 million to cover potential over allotments and 15 million that may be added to the initial 60 million to be sold by current shareholders, the company said. The shares will be listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange with the trading ticker of TMV. The Goeppingen, Germany-based company began operations in 2005 and provides secure remote access products for small to mid-size businesses, with installed products on more than 2 billion devices world-wide. Permira acquired Teamviewer for  ¬870 million in 2014.

Luminate Capital Partners in San Francisco has made a growth investment in MSI Data LLC, a provider of cloud-based field service management software founded in 2010. The Milwaukee company plans to use the new resources for product development. Enterprise software-focused Luminate in January purchased a controlling interest in LiquidFrameworks Inc., which provides field services software to industries including oil-field and environmental services, WSJ Pro reported at the time.

Finrock Growth Partners, a software-focused private-equity firm in Austin, Texas has acquired business process management provider BP Logix Inc. The San Diego company uses an artificial intelligence-powered system to create and deploy digital applications designed to automate routine functions. Finrock's Girish Pashilkar, a managing director of the firm, as the company's new chief executive to take advantage of his experience running growing software businesses. The firm said he led portfolio company Workplace Answers LLC during years when it was recognized as one of the fastest-growing U.S. smaller businesses by Inc. magazine. Finrock exited Workplace in 2017, according to the firm's website.

Arcline Investment Management has acquired a majority interest in cell and gene therapy materials supplier Akron Biotechnology LLC. The growth-focused firm in San Francisco said the fresh capital will be used for product development and acquisitions by the Boca Raton, Fla.-based company.

People

T. Boone Pickens Jr., an oil prospector and pioneer in hostile takeovers whose folksy wit made him one of America's most recognizable business leaders, has died at age 91. Mr. Pickens rose to fame as founder and chief executive of Mesa Petroleum Corp., where he was an advocate for shareholder rights who liked to vilify the excesses of "Big Oil". A trained geologist from Oklahoma, he was little known outside of energy circles until 1968, when he made the first of a string of unsolicited bids for much-larger oil companies. He later claimed the idea for a hostile takeover came to him in the shower, after a friendly overture was turned down. "It has become cheaper to look for oil on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange than in the ground," he said at the time.

Blackstone Group Inc. has hired Raymond Chan as a managing director on its Blackstone Alternative Asset Management portfolio management and investment research team. He was most recently a managing director in the global portfolio solutions unit of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., having spent 15 years with the white-shoe Wall Street bank. The Blackstone unit's funds manage more than $10.5 billion in assets, including through a daily liquid mutual fund, which Mr. Chan will help oversee.

Good day. Two former investors from Lux Capital and IVP are seeking to raise a $300 million debut fund, WSJ Pro's Yuliya Chernova reports.

The fund from Renata Quintini and Roseanne Wincek would be significantly bigger than the average first-time fund of $102 million in 2018.

Meanwhile, real-estate owners are looking to compete directly with WeWork, The Wall Street Journal reports. It's the latest challenge for WeWork as it is preparing its initial public offering.

We challenges. Big landlords are launching direct competitors to WeWork, the Journal's Peter Grant reports.

Obsura deal. Travel and exploration website Atlas Obscura has built its brand by shining a light on little-known things. Now the company is looking to up that wattage with a major investment from home-sharing juggernaut Airbnb Inc., the Journal's Lukas I. Alpert reports.

Carney: Central Banks Can Fight a Downturn; Fed Could See More Dissents; Dimon Talks Zero Rates

Good day. Bank of England leader Mark Carney said he's confident that the world's top central banks have the tools they need to combat a normal type of economic downturn. But he added that those institutions would nevertheless benefit from fiscal help. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve could see more dissenting votes if it meets expectations with a quarter-percentage-point rate cut next week. In Europe, investors are paring back back their expectations for quantitative easing. And JPMorgan Chief Executive James Dimon said his bank is discussing how it might respond if interest rates fall to zero or lower.

Now on to today's news and analysis.

Top News

BOE's Carney: Central Banks Have Weapons to Fight Next Downturn

The world's major central banks still have the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/boes-carney-central-banks-have-weapons-to-fight-next-downturn-11568126242?mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb" to a normal economic downturn, Bank of England Gov. Mark Carney said, but added they would likely need some help from government spending and taxation policies if trouble did happen. The possibility of a slowdown has gone up around the world and downside risks to the outlook have increased, Mr. Carney said in New York.

JPMorgan CEO Dimon Raises Specter of Zero Rates

The biggest bank in the U.S. is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/jpmorgan-ceo-dimon-raises-specter-of-zero-rates-11568147683?tesla=y&mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb" for how to make money if interest rates in the U.S. drop to zero. James Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said at an industry conference the bank has begun discussing what fees and charges it could introduce if interest rates go to zero or lower.

Derby's Take: Powell May Score Himself a Hat Trick of Dissent

By Michael S. Derby

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell could face his biggest formal insurrection yet next week if the central bank lowers rates by a quarter percentage point as it is widely expected to do.

A vote to drop the overnight target rate range to between 1.75% and 2% could generate three dissenting votes. The last time that happened was the September 2016 Federal Open Market Committee meeting. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/derbys-take-powell-may-score-himself-a-hat-trick-of-dissent-next-week-11568194204?mod=djemCentralBanksPro&tpl=cb".

Other Developments Around the World

Streetwise: There's Too Much Negativity About Negative Rates

"European bankers are squealing in fear that they'll be stuck with even steeper negative interest rates by the European Central Bank this week. The banks quite rightly fret that lower rates hit their profits, and they want the ECB to help. To avoid trouble in future, it should," writes WSJ's James Mackintosh. "Negative rates are clearly bad for banks in principle, lowering lending rates while deposit rates remain stuck at zero. That squeezes profits. Worse, the ECB now thinks negative rates didn't even have that much effect on the economy or prices. Risking damaging the financial system for tiny moves toward its repeatedly missed inflation goal seems like a mistake."

Investor Hopes for Cheaper Money in Europe Dim

A month ago, investors were betting the European Central Bank would make a splash. Now they're not so sure. Economists broadly expect the ECB on Thursday to reduce its key rate by at least 10 basis points on Thursday.

But expectations for the size of the monthly bond-purchase program that might also be announced have been eroding, a move that has helped keep once free-falling bond yields in place this month.

U.S. Job Openings Cool in Slowing Labor Market

The number of job openings decreased in July from a year earlier for the second consecutive month, underscoring slowing demand for new workers, though opportunities remain plentiful for job seekers. Job postings fell 3% from a year earlier in July to 7.217 million after declining 2% in June, the Labor Department reported. Before June, job openings hadn't decreased year over year since early 2017.

Median U.S. Household Income Showed No Growth in 2018

American incomes remained essentially flat in 2018 after three straight years of growth, according to Census Bureau figures released Tuesday that offer a broad look at U.S. households' financial well-being. Median household income was $63,179 in 2018, an uptick of 0.9% that census officials said isn't statistically significant from the prior year based on figures adjusted for inflation.

Weak Swedish Inflation Pours Cold Water on Riksbank's Hike Plan

The weakness of Swedish inflation in August pours even more cold water over the Riksbank's forecasts for an interest-rate hike over the next six months and Capital Economics still thinks that policy makers will cut interest rates later this year. CPIF inflation, which excludes the direct effects of interest-rate changes, slowed from 1.5% in July to a 35-month low of 1.3% in August. The weakness of domestic activity is likely to keep a lid on underlying inflation pressures over the rest of this year and throughout 2020, Capital Economics adds. (Dow Jones Newswires)

Treasury Secretary Mnuchin Details Plans for Fannie, Freddie

The Trump administration plans to require Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to begin paying a fee for support from the Treasury Department in exchange for a change to the mortgage-finance companies' status that will allow them to retain their earnings, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday.

U.S. Presses for Strong Swiss Cryptocurrency Rules

The U.S. urged Switzerland to ensure its regulations governing cryptocurrencies are strong enough to prevent abuse, as the European banking hub prepares to host Libra, a digital currency proposed by Facebook. The U.S. Treasury, along with other government officials and central bank officials, have raised questions about the Libra currency, which Facebook proposed earlier this year as part of a digital-payments system it plans to base partly in Geneva, and take mainstream to its more than two billion users.

Hong Kong Stock Exchange Makes Offer for LSE

The operator of Hong Kong's stock exchange offered to buy London Stock Exchange Group PLC in a deal valued at nearly $37 billion. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd. said a combination would create a global leader in capital flows and financial data.

Commentary

Inequality Is Holding Back the U.S. Economy

"When it comes to money, America has always had winners and losers, but the widening gulf between the rich and the bulk of U.S. households may be making almost everybody worse off. That includes investors," writes WSJ's Justin Lahart. The 2018 median household income figure of $63,200 reported Tuesday by the Census Bureau "was basically even with what the adjusted data show for 1999. Considering that the U.S. economy grew by an inflation-adjusted 48% over the same period, that is more than striking. It reflects shifts in the economy by which upper-income tiers are capturing more of the economy's gains." Mr. Lahart adds that inequality may change how the economy works, citing Karen Petrou, who runs policy-analysis firm Federal Financial Analytics. "Rich people are less likely than others to spend additional income, for example, leading to reduced growth and inflation. And because the rich tend to invest that extra money instead, it can lead to increased asset prices," he writes.

What a Real Credit Crackdown Looks Like

"An emerging-market economy with a population of over a billion is recording its slowest growth rates in years, triggered by a crackdown on rampant nonbank lending. No, not that one," Mike Bird writes for the Journal. "India is demonstrating how a sharp squeeze on shadow finance credit from outside traditional banking can feed quickly through to an economic slowdown when the crackdown hits multiple key sectors at once. Other countries, particularly India's large and credit-driven neighbor to the northeast, should take heed."

Basis Points

Cyber Daily: Kaspersky Products Officially Banned; Waiting for Huawei Licenses; EU Staffs Up for Battle

Good day. Federal agencies and government contractors are now barred from using software and products developed by Kaspersky Lab under a rule that went into effect Tuesday. WSJ Pro's James Rundle breaks down what it means.

Also today: U.S. chip makers wait for permission to sell to Huawei; EU lines up tech enforcers; and U.S. tech firms and other companies urge Congress to create a federal privacy law, though probably not one as strict as Europe's GDPR.

U.S. Government Formalizes Kaspersky Ban

By James Rundle

Washington has formally barred federal agencies and contractors from using software developed by Russian cybersecurity company Kaspersky Lab.

What has happened?

The Defense Department, National Aeronautics and Space Administration and General Services Administration issued a rule, published Tuesday in the Federal Register, that formalizes an interim ban in place since 2017. That year, the Department of Homeland Security barred government agencies from using the Moscow-based company's products. Legal authority for the ban was included in the National Defense Authorization Act for 2018.

Who is affected?

All federal agencies, civilian and military. Federal contractors and subcontractors of all sizes are also bound by this rule.

Why is this happening?

The federal government is concerned that using Kaspersky Lab products introduces an unacceptable risk that Russian government or military personnel could use the software to access U.S. systems. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2017 that the Russian government has used the company's antivirus software to scan computers around the world for U.S. government documents.

What does Kaspersky say?

A spokesperson for Kaspersky told WSJ Pro Cybersecurity that the provisions in the National Defense Authorization Act "were unconstitutional, were based on unsubstantiated allegations, and lacked any public evidence of wrongdoing by the company."

How should companies respond?

A company of any size that deals with the federal government, even with nonsensitive systems, must immediately cease using Kaspersky software and remove it, the final rule states, in line with an interim rule adopted in July 2018. There are no grace periods. The federal government awarded contracts to more than 93,000 companies in both 2017 and 2018, the three agencies said, adding they expect the ban to affect thousands of companies, which are obliged to report any instances where the software is found.

Will it be difficult?

Removing software is a relatively trivial matter, said Chris Morales, head of security analytics at security firm Vectra AI Inc., but it can be an onerous process to select a new vendor. While there are alternatives to Kaspersky, most contractors would require testing and evaluation periods, he said.

Joseph Carson, chief security scientist at security firm Thycotic Software LLC, said that such changes can also result in server downtime, and in some cases, periods when company systems are open to hackers.

EU commissioner who targeted tech giants gets second term. The European Union official overseeing the regulatory push against Silicon Valley is poised to stay on the job for an unexpected second term a warning that the new administration here isn't backing down on global tech oversight, The Wall Street Journal reports.

Gasps: Incoming European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen 's decision to keep Margrethe Vestager as the competition chief while also giving her a new, wider portfolio to guide European rule-making related to the digital economy was met by audible gasps from staffers and journalists at a news conference Tuesday.

Remember that clawback? Ms. Vestager made a name for herself by imposing record antitrust fines on U.S. tech companies, including a total of $9.4 billion on Alphabet Inc.'s Google. She also ordered Ireland to claw back $15 billion from Apple Inc. in what the commission called unpaid taxes.

Chip makers still await clearance to sell to Huawei. More than two months after President Trump agreed to ease export restrictions on Huawei Technologies Co., the U.S. has yet to green-light any sales to the Chinese telecom giant, WSJ reports. The Huawei blacklist, which went into force May 16, cut U.S. chip makers off from a pipeline that enabled them to send $11 billion worth of components to Huawei last year.

No licenses yet: President Trump, meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, on June 29, agreed to ease the blacklist for cases that didn't involve national security. But the Commerce Department has yet to grant any licenses for restricted sales. U.S. chip makers stand to lose billions of dollars in revenue. A spokesman for the Commerce Department said it is reviewing applications from Huawei suppliers, which can require input from the Defense, State and Energy departments.

51 companies petition Congress for federal data privacy law. Chief executives of 51 technology firms want federal action on data privacy to supersede a collection of differing state laws, according to an open letter to Congress Tuesday. Local laws, plus requirements from regulatory bodies, make privacy compliance difficult for the companies, but skeptics question whether the firms would lobby to weaken any strict provisions, ZDNet reports.

Among the signers: Amazon, JPMorgan Chase, Walmart, American Express, AT&T, Dell and SAP.

AT&T Pressed on Growth Plans --- Investor says company hasn't articulated strategic rationale for Time Warner deal

By Joe Flint and Patience Haggin

When AT&T Inc. agreed to buy Time Warner nearly three years ago, it promised to create an entertainment and advertising behemoth that could take on Silicon Valley giants like Alphabet Inc.'s Google and Netflix Inc.

Now, the telecom giant is under pressure to deliver.

Elliott Management Corp., the activist investor that disclosed a stake in AT&T on Monday, said in a letter to the company that it has "failed to articulate a clear strategic rationale" for the $80 billion-plus Time Warner acquisition.

AT&T had told Wall Street and regulators that Time Warner -- which was re-christened WarnerMedia -- would help it launch into the streaming-video wars, boost its traditional wireless and pay-TV services and build up an advertising-analytics business that could benefit the TV industry broadly.

But Elliott said that when it comes to direct-to-consumer streaming, there is a "growing sense that AT&T doesn't have a plan," given recent shifts in strategy. And it said the departure of top Time Warner executives leaves the company without necessary media expertise at a critical moment in the industry.

"While it is too soon to tell whether AT&T can create value with Time Warner, we remain cautious on the benefits of this combination," Elliott said. The investment firm called for AT&T to focus more on execution, rather than acquisitions, and divest itself of any noncore assets across its business.

A lengthy antitrust battle with the Justice Department, which only came to a close in February, significantly slowed AT&T's ability to integrate Time Warner. In a statement, AT&T said Monday that it is already executing many of the actions outlined by Elliott.

One of the biggest priorities for AT&T is launching a new direct-to-consumer streaming service to compete with Netflix and other rivals. The company initially laid out plans to offer a three-tiered platform, with an entry-level option focused on movies and additional tiers with the premium HBO Now and Warner Bros. programming. AT&T initially said the service would launch in late 2019.

By this summer, the company had shifted to focus on a single offering, HBO Max. "This quick reversal has intensified the skepticism around WarnerMedia, its OTT [direct-to-consumer] strategy and the management of the business itself," Elliott said.

AT&T now says there will be a limited or "beta" launch late this year, with a broad commercial launch next spring, after rival offerings from Walt Disney Co. and Apple Inc. have already hit the market.

WarnerMedia executives counter that while there have been tweaks to the strategy, it isn't fair to say there is "confusion" and a "lack of plan," as Elliott claimed. The long antitrust battle against the government slowed the company down, the executives said, and AT&T plans to lay out its strategy at an investor meeting at the end of October.

WarnerMedia has unveiled a large number of original TV shows and movies for HBO Max as well as reacquiring key library content including reruns of the hit comedy "Friends." It hasn't yet announced a price for the service, but it is likely to cost slightly more than the $14.99 average price for HBO Now, a person familiar with the matter has said.

Disney earlier this year said its streaming service, Disney+, would launch in November and cost $6.99 a month. Apple TV+ will cost $4.99 a month starting Nov. 1, the company said Tuesday.

After prevailing in the antitrust fight, AT&T moved to break down the corporate walls and fiefs at WarnerMedia, leading to the exits of the top executives at the HBO and Turner divisions this spring. AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson had earlier said he wasn't looking to change the culture of WarnerMedia nor the leadership at key units.

The executive AT&T picked to lead WarnerMedia, John Stankey, has since emerged as the likely successor to Mr. Stephenson.

"For a content business now owned by a telecommunications company and under the direct supervision of a lifelong telecom executive, this lack of continuity in leadership presents a real concern for investors," Elliott said.

While some senior executives such as HBO head Richard Plepler have left the company, WarnerMedia has also brought in new management including Robert Greenblatt, former NBC and Showtime programming chief, as chairman of WarnerMedia entertainment.

On Tuesday, WarnerMedia unveiled a new distribution unit for its cable channels -- a continuation of the combining of the HBO and Turner units under one umbrella.

AT&T also said it would upend the $70 billion traditional television-advertising market, using its reams of data -- on everything from its DirecTV subscribers to where its customers take their phones -- to help advertisers target consumers with ads across their TVs and digital devices.

The company's plans put the spotlight on Xandr, the targeted advertising division created when AT&T acquired ad-tech marketplace AppNexus for about $1.6 billion in 2018. Cable and satellite TV operators have long promised marketers would be able to target TV commercials to individual homes, but the offering has been slow to catch on. AT&T's plan has faced hurdles, including privacy and regulatory concerns around how telecommunications and broadband providers may leverage customer data.

Meanwhile, the Federal Trade Commission is scrutinizing how AT&T and other internet-service providers use consumer data for advertising. The agency ordered AT&T's advertising subsidiary and other companies to provide information on their privacy practices for user data last month. AT&T said at the time that it would respond appropriately.

Venture investors Renata Quintini and Roseanne Wincek plan to raise about $300 million for their first fund together, according to people familiar with the situation.

Their firm, called Renegade Partners, will focus on investing in Series B rounds, one of the people said.

Ms. Quintini "https://www.wsj.com/articles/private-equity-analysts-2017-women-to-watch-venture-capital-1509370462?mod=searchresults&page=1&pos=1" a partner at Lux Capital, where she is now a venture partner and entrepreneur in residence, and before that she was a general partner at Felicis Ventures.

She has invested in companies including self-driving car company Cruise Automation Inc., which "https://www.wsj.com/articles/gm-closes-acquisition-of-cruise-automation-1463154595"General Motors Co. in 2016 for about $1 billion, and Dollar Shave Club, which "https://www.wsj.com/articles/unilever-buys-dollar-shave-club-1468987836". in 2016 for about $1 billion, and Dollar Shave Club, which Unilever PLC in 2016 for $1 billion. More recently Ms. Quintini has invested in wireless broadband company Common Networks Inc. and rare-disease startup RDMD Inc.

Ms. Wincek was a principal at IVP, where she focused on later-stage consumer and enterprise companies, and, before that, she was at Canaan Partners. She is currently an adviser at IVP.

She has invested in logistics startup KeepTruckin Inc., online education company MasterClass, beauty company Glossier Inc., real-estate company Compass and data analytics startup Looker Data Sciences Inc., which was acquired by Alphabet Inc. earlier this year "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-to-acquire-data-analytics-firm-looker-for-2-6-billion-11559829249".

Ms. Quintini declined to comment on the fundraising. Ms. Wincek couldn't immediately be reached for comment.

At $300 million, Renegade has an ambitious goal for a debut fund. The average amount raised by first-time funds in 2018 in the U.S. was about $102 million, according to the National Venture Capital Association.

In addition, new firms more commonly launch with a focus on seed investing, which usually requires less capital than later-stage deal making.

Renegade is rare among female-led venture firms for not focusing on seed deals. Two-thirds of female venture capitalists invest in early-stage startups, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/global-survey-of-women-in-venture-capital-shows-how-they-invest-11553538779" Global State of Women in VC analysis

Good day! Equity incentive awards are one of the more powerful management incentive tools in a private-equity firm's arsenal. By allowing founders and senior management to benefit from equity options in a portfolio company, owners aim to keep management's interests aligned with those of investors. How these options are structured can vary, as do the terms under which they are paid out. Occasionally, the payout, or lack thereof, of these equity incentive options becomes a point of contention between portfolio companies and members of their management teams.

This morning, WSJ Pro's Chris Cumming writes of one such dispute that prompted the former chairman and chief executive of Solera Holdings to file a suit against the private-equity backed automotive software company. In his lawsuit, Anthony Aquila alleges that Solera, which is backed by Vista Equity Partners, illegally withheld more than $100 million in stock options. In other news, L Squared has pledged $60 million to aerospace technology company Raptor Scientific, and oil and gas producer EP Energy is in talks with rival investor groups over restructuring billions of dollars in debt.

Finally, the deadline to submit your nominations for our Women to Watch list is just a week away. If you know of any dealmakers, fundraising professionals or limited partners worthy of recognition, be sure to submit your nominations below!

Now on to today's news...

Anthony Aquila, former chairman and chief executive of Solera, alleged the company is refusing him the stock options it agreed to issue him, on the grounds he violated an agreement not to hire Solera employees after leaving the company. Solera is majority-owned by Vista Equity Partners, which took the company private in an approximately $6.5 billion deal in 2016.

Shale executives are changing the words they use to talk up their prospects, in a linguistic evolution that broadly reflects the industry's efforts to shift from prioritizing growth to returning cash to increasingly disillusioned investors. The Wall Street Journal analyzed the transcripts of the earnings calls of 40 public U.S. shale companies with technical help from financial research firm Sentieo Inc. and found that fracking's buzzwords have changed significantly since 2015. Whereas top shale executives once frequently promised to "ramp up" production, these days they are more likely to assure investors they can deliver "free cash flow."

One of Wall Street's most powerful activist investors is challenging AT&T Inc.'s ambition to build a media conglomerate and is pushing the company to refocus on its telecommunications roots. Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. disclosed a $3.2 billion stake in AT&T, criticized its longtime CEO's acquisition strategy and called on the company to shed some assets.

Taking the pain out of expenses claims

Paris-based startupSpendesk says its software can save three days each month on reconciliation tasks alone

A common joke among bankers and lawyers is that their expenses systems are so labyrinthine, glitchy, time-consuming and punitive that they must have been designed to discourage staff from making any sort of claim.

Spendesk wants to change this. The Paris-based startup s goal is to  make spending at work as easy as it is in our private lives  by combining prepaid company cards   with pre-authorised individual limits, of course   with automatic receipt capture, automated expense reports and integration into companies  bookkeeping systems.

It has lofty ambitions to become the Revolut of expenses for small and medium-sized companies, and already claims to have 1,500 business clients including other early-stage startups such as Seedrs in the UK, Doctolib in France and Germany s Rent24.

On Monday the company announced it had raised  ¬35m in a series B funding round led by London-based Index Ventures, which invests in startups such as food-delivery app Deliveroo, Dropbox, payments group iZettle and Revolut.

Spendesk is not the only company targeting this market.Pleo similarly promises to  eliminate tedious paperwork  by offering digital cards, automated receipt catching and the ability to see all staff spending in real-time. Expensify is well-established in the US and more traditional incumbents such as Concur are improving their technology and user interface.

Spendesk has big plans though. Co-founder and chief executive Rodolphe Ardant, an ex-engineer, told theFinancial Times that after growing from 20 staff to 120 in the three years since the company was founded, he wants to hire another 100 staff in the next 12 months and triple revenue annually (although the company won t say what income it generates now.)

Part of the new  ¬35m  which adds to the  ¬10m raised initially  will be used to open offices in London and Berlin this year and fund expansions into Spain and Scandinavia.

 At the moment the processes to control spending are super tedious  &Most companies still manage spending like it s 1995, with archaic processes like shared company credit cards, petty cash or manual expense reports,  he says. He says his software can save three days each month on reconciliation tasks alone.

To use it, companies top up their accounts on the platform with cash, portions of which can then be authorised for use by staff.

To validate a payment  people just need to take a photo of the receipt and an expense report is automatically created and allocated to the right budget  &We remove the need for the employee to collect receipts and do all the legwork for reimbursements. 

Spendesk takes a monthly fee based on user numbers.

But what of the inherent contradiction in the business model: what company wants to make it easier for staff to spend money?

 Just because we are going to make the process easier, that doesn t mean people are going to spend more,  Mr Ardant says.  If you give staff for example an American Express card, things are much less transparent and companies don't have control. 

Spendesk s software should make it easier for companies to spot fraud, he says, because traditional manual-entry, Excel-based systems are wide open for abuse.

 No one can see if you were the one who paid for this receipt , especially if you re using a personal card and claiming it back, he says.  I have seen a lot of fraud in companies when someone has taken out a friend for lunch, the friend then pays the bill, but you take the receipt back after and claim for it again. 

 With our digital, real-time system people can be sure their staff were actually there paying the bill,  he says.

Doctors Sound an Alarm Over Leg-Stent Surgery; Johns Hopkins researchers analyzing Medicare data say they've detected physicians performing what look like unnecessary vascular procedures

Now that unnecessary heart-stent procedures happen significantly less often, doctors are flagging a new area of concern: unnecessary leg stents.

Some physicians are stenting leg arteries and removing plaque at alarming rates, these doctors say. The often-avoidable procedures could put patients at risk of complications and worsening disease.

Johns Hopkins researchers published a study in June in the Journal of Vascular Surgery analyzing national data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency that administers the Medicare program. The research "https://www.jvascsurg.org/article/S0741-5214(19)31176-0/fulltext" whose rates for conducting such procedures in patients newly diagnosed with leg pain were 14% or higher. The mean rate of all 5,664 physicians was 3.5%.

"We are very concerned about these outlier physicians and the harm they may be inflicting on patients," wrote Marty Makary, a professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and Caitlin Hicks, an assistant professor there, in a letter sent to CMS and the Society for Vascular Surgery this summer. "Some may represent a serious and immediate threat to public safety."

Dr. Hicks says performing unnecessary leg procedures like stenting can make vascular disease worse, creating blockage in narrow arteries or causing an artery to rupture. She says patients with early leg pain have a 1% to 2% risk of limb loss after five years. But aggressive procedures increase that risk to 5% to 10%.

Dr. Makary examines the practice of performing unnecessary vascular procedures in a chapter of his new book, "The Price We Pay," published Sept. 10. In it, he describes what seems to be the "predatory" practice of some doctors seeking out patients at health screenings in churches.

The doctor adds that no one without real leg symptoms should be screened for conditions in the legs that lead to stenting and ballooning, known as peripheral vascular interventions. "They might tell you we will only screen you if you are having symptoms, but who in the world doesn't have leg pain at some point?"

"Almost every 80-year-old in the U.S. has plaque in their leg artery and there is no clinical significance unless you have symptoms," he adds. "But some doctors will balloon and stent any plaque."

Kim Hodgson, president of the Society for Vascular Surgery (SVS), a professional association of vascular medical professionals, says the organization is concerned about the overuse of procedures highlighted in the letter from the Hopkins researchers. SVS guidelines recommend peripheral vascular interventions only after patients who have leg pain when they walk have failed medical and exercise therapy and have lifestyle-limiting symptoms.

The letter also lists 10 doctors paid by CMS who use atherectomy as the first intervention for peripheral artery disease in 100% of patients. Atherectomy is a procedure that many doctors say should be used selectively, since there's no conclusive data to support its effectiveness, Dr. Hicks says. The minimally invasive procedure often entails using a laser or other device to remove plaque from blood vessels.

"Of course there are rare situations when you need to do this, but to do it routinely is a clear-cut, egregious practice pattern," Dr. Makary says.

Dr. Hicks says the average rate of atherectomy as a first option was 55% among doctors paid by CMS. There were 114 out of 1,686 doctors with a 100% atherectomy rate and an additional 189 with rates above 90%. The lack of data around the procedure, combined with how much Medicaid reimburses for it, make it "a setup for overuse," she says.

Share Your Thoughts

Have you, or someone you know, had a leg stent? How has life been with it? Share your experience below.

Among vascular surgeons surveyed in their registry, the average rate of atherectomy is about 17%. "We recoiled when we saw 100%, because it goes against everything we know," Dr. Hodgson says.

CMS has several tools and programs to ensure that its providers are providing high-quality care, according to an agency statement. The agency also sends comparative billing reports to providers to allow them to compare their billing patterns on specific procedures to peers to hold them accountable. The agency didn't say if it is examining the issues raised in the letter.

There can be limitations with drawing conclusions from big data analyses, given the varying degree of health in different patient populations around the country.

Pranay Ramdev, a vascular surgeon in Florida, is among the doctors the researchers found to have a 100% atherectomy rate. He says atherectomy as a first-line treatment benefits his patients. He describes them as mostly elderly, with severely blocked arteries or with ulcers or gangrene, and possibly at risk of limb loss due to poor blood flow.

Dr. Ramdev agrees that some doctors perform unnecessary peripheral vascular procedures, including atherectomy. But he calls claims that atherectomy isn't effective "utter nonsense."

Other doctors say that the volume of these procedures is an inherent problem, as most people with these conditions can manage them with exercise and medication. Sridhar Chatrathi, an interventional cardiologist in Greenbelt, Md., raised the problem of unnecessary leg procedures and church health-fair screenings to Dr. Makary.

Dr. Chatrathi says he knows of at least six outpatient vascular labs in his area that do peripheral vascular interventions like stenting. But he says most leg pain isn't related to vascular disease.

"When you see this many labs in such a small geographical area, you know there's something fishy," he says.

SVS president Dr. Hodgson says patients who make positive lifestyle changes often never need a procedure or can forestall getting one by five to 10 years. This benefits them, because such procedures cause scarring in the blood vessels, which often results in the need for another procedure later. "So we like to start that clock ticking as late in life as possible," he says.

Dr. Makary is talking with the SVS about participating in the national "https://www.improvingwisely.org/" he oversees. The program, funded largely by Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the nonpartisan health nonprofit launched by the family the founded that Johnson & Johnson, uses CMS data to find outlier doctors. It teams with professional medical associations and confidentially shares information from its nationwide analyses.

The group's first campaign helped the American College of Mohs Surgery analyze the number of blocks of tissues surgeons removed during treatment for skin cancer. They sent letters to more than 1,000 Mohs surgeons informing them of their rates. Of the 53 outliers who received the letter, 83% reduced their rates. The $150,000 campaign resulted in "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31055597" after one year and $27 million two years later.

The Doctor Behind Improving Wisely

In his new book "The Price We Pay: What Broke American Health Care And How To Fix It," Marty Makary, a surgeon and professor at Johns Hopkins University, has several chapters that focus on the cost to patients and the health care system of unnecessary procedures. He is heading up a national campaign, Improving Wisely, to analyze outlier practice patterns.

Here are edited excerpts from a recent interview:

In your book you quote a statistic that doctors themselves say that one out of five procedures or services are unnecessary. Are patients being harmed by these unnecessary procedures?

Most doctors try to do the right thing. We don't want to create hysteria. But it's important to ask the right questions and often to get a second opinion knowing that a fraction of doctors are responding to a consumerist culture, maybe responding to the perverse payment incentives in our system, or they may not be up on the latest state-of-the-art care.

It's good for the public to know that while in many emergency situations you need to follow the advice of your doctor and not mess around, most of health care is elective and non-urgent and for those things it's important to educate yourself.

In the first chapter of your book you focus on what you describe as the almost predatory nature of doctors going after patients to do unnecessary vascular procedures. What procedures are they doing?

United States Preventive Task Force guidelines help doctors and patients navigate the epidemiological data. And for partial blockages or plaques in the leg arteries, the recommendation is pretty clear doctors should not be fishing for disease in patients without symptoms.

How are these doctors going after patients?

My team and I met with cardiologists from around the country asking them what they believe to be patterns of overuse in their field. To my surprise, they told me the leg is the new heart and that some doctors are screening patients for plaques in leg arteries even though most older Americans will normally have some small plaque.

I asked, are patients referred or do they seek out a cardiologist? One of the cardiologists told me, "No Marty, the doctors go to them." They go and offer free health screenings where these plaques are identified. I was blown away that some of these occur at churches. I couldn't believe that my profession was engaging in what appeared to be predatory screenings.

What is the Improving Wisely campaign?

The Improving Wisely program, proposed initially with a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, creates ways to measure appropriateness using practice patterns. Boundaries are set by experts in the field on what the patterns of overuse are, that can be measured.

So in the project people receive their doctor's level where they stand relative to their peers.

Tell us about the problem you identified with skin cancer doctors removing too much skin during surgery and how the Improving Wisely campaign was able to successfully combat that?

The impressive leadership of the American College of Mohs Surgeons decided to take on the issue of a pattern of overuse in skin cancer surgery. We generated reports for them and they mailed them out with a cover letter to doctors saying, "As a courtesy we're letting you know where you stand relative to your peers. There's no penalty for your performance but we hope that you will find it helpful."

I braced for backlash, but instead I was amazed to see that all of the feedback received was either grateful, neutral or appreciative, which speaks to the value of a physician-defined metric that can be used within the field.

What are some examples of other overdone medical procedures that you are tackling?

We are now using the Improving Wisely model to address polypharmacy among seniors in the United States, looking at the average number of medications a primary-care physician prescribes to their seniors. While variation is expected, there is a pattern of some doctors having their patients on over 20 medications.

What about spine surgery?

One opportunity is to apply a metric that spine surgeons have defined, which is the proportion of patients who have elective spine surgery in their practice where the patient has never had at least one physical-therapy visit in the year preceding the operation. When 0% of your elective spine operations for back pain are done without physical therapy in a high-volume practice, that's a surrogate marker of unnecessary back surgery.

Technology Is Banks' New Battleground; European banks are playing catch up with their American rivals in tech spending, particularly in cutting-edge areas like artificial intelligence

European banks are spending vast sums on technology but it may not be enough to defend against the incursions of bigger, richer American rivals.

U.S. lenders already "https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-u-s-banks-took-over-the-world-11567589403" in Europe. The big risk for the continent's banks is that slicker tech could give their American rivals a platform to make gains in lending to companies the Europeans' traditional stronghold.

This year, Europe's banks plan to make technology investments worth in aggregate $77 billion, according to consulting firm Celent. That compares with $105 billion for their U.S. rivals. Faster, more seamless trading systems have long been a priority, but tech spending has shifted across business lines and from back office to front office. It can cover everything from maintaining decades-old systems to cutting-edge artificial intelligence.

Unfortunately, European lenders are more focused on patching old systems. Less than a quarter of their budgets will be spent on new tech this year. U.S. rivals were at that level five years ago and now spend a third on innovation. J.P. Morgan, an early starter, will spend half of its annual $11 billion technology budget on innovation this year.

J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs and other American rivals cleaned up their balance sheets more quickly after the financial crisis, which gave them a head start on competitors in Europe. Their initial tech investments focused on modernizing legacy systems, building platforms to comply with new regulations and automating routine tasks.

Over time, more complex tasks have also been automated using artificial intelligence and machine learning. Since 2017, J.P. Morgan has used a software program to review commercial loans, which the company estimates saved 360,000 hours a year of lawyer and loan officer time.

European banks are behind in this process. Hampered by lower interest rates and profits, they have had less cash to spend. They have also contended with additional regulation most recently the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/large-gdpr-fines-are-imminent-eu-privacy-regulators-say-11556829079" and "https://blogs.wsj.com/cio/2019/06/28/the-digital-revolution-comes-for-banking/" regulation.

The Americans' early lead has in turn given them lower transaction costs and more flexible systems, adding to the challenge Europe's banks face as they enter another round of slowing growth and falling interest rates.

The digitization of financial services has brought banks everywhere face to face with new competitors. Amazon, Google and Apple are offering selected financial services to their customers, such as credit cards, payment services and inventory loans to Amazon marketplace sellers. But the tech giants are unlikely to want to become full-scale banks and risk an avalanche of regulation.

Small fintech companies are also developing new products, often without the regulatory burden that traditional lenders face. Banks on both sides of the Atlantic are using accelerator programs and other types of partnership to incorporate new fintech products into their offerings. While they may hit on a great new product, any competitive advantage is likely to be short-lived as customers will expect their bank to add that service soon and won't necessarily be prepared to pay for it.

In many cases, European banks may be better off eschewing this arms race, focusing their investment on core capabilities and only offering new products or services once they have proven popular with customers. That would make the most of their limited firepower, even if they linger behind their American rivals.

Still, Europe's banks need to defend their core turf of corporate lending to protect vital customer relationships. Ominously, the top five U.S. banks gained three percentage points of commercial-lending market share in Europe, Middle East and Africa between 2015 and 2017, according to consulting firm Bain & Co.

European banks may already spend more than they would like on technology, but investors shouldn't be surprised if they have to open their wallets even wider.

We need a moratorium on the use of facial recognition

T his summer will be remembered as the moment that facial recognition technology was, suddenly, everywhere. From British shoppers in King's Cross to Hong Kong protesters, people around the world have found themselves under the watchful scrutiny of artificial intelligence.

Last week a UK court found that police trials of facial recognition technology in Welsh public spaces did not contravene either human rights or data protection laws. This will come as a relief to British police forces which are keen to deploy the technology, despite the lack of a clear government mandate to do so. Yet the enthusiasm is difficult to square with the proven fallibility of current machines, which have been shown to be inaccurate, unreliable and biased. It often fails to do what it says on the tin that is, recognise faces, particularly if those faces belong to women and people of colour.

While the courts may have endorsed facial recognition technology, the British public do not. A new survey by the Ada Lovelace Institute found that 55 per cent of people wanted government restrictions on police use of the technology. Respondents were also uncomfortable with its commercial use only 17 per cent wanted to see facial recognition technology used for age verification in supermarkets, 7 per cent approved of its use for tracking shoppers and 4 per cent thought it was appropriate for screening job candidates.

When considering facial recognition technology, we need to debate not only what is lawful, but also what is ethical. In order to have that conversation, we should press pause on the further rollout of the technology. Companies should adopt a voluntary moratorium on using it. There is an impressive precedent for this in the insurance industry. In the late 1990s, predictive genetic testing was becoming cheap and accurate enough that it was clear it would become routine practice in diagnostic and healthcare. Efforts to sequence the human genome were accelerating, and "direct-to-consumer" genetic testing was just around the corner.

Because the law did not prohibit or limit it, insurance companies could have required customers to disclose the results of any genetic tests and increased their insurance premiums accordingly, or denied coverage altogether. This could have led to discrimination in the pricing or provision of health insurance, as well as life insurance, which in the UK was required to get a mortgage.

Rather than exploit this legal gap, the sector chose a different path. In 1998, the Association of British Insurers adopted a two-year voluntary moratorium on the use of genetic testing in the provision of insurance policies backing mortgages. This was extended in 2001 to include life insurance and critical illness cover. The moratorium was enshrined in an official agreement between the government and the ABI, binding 97 per cent of the UK insurance sector. After repeated extensions, the moratorium this year was formalised into an open-ended, voluntary code on genetic testing and insurance.

Companies developing, selling and using facial recognition technology should follow this praiseworthy example. Our research indicates such a move would have popular support. Most people do not want to see facial recognition in schools or on public transport. A large majority 70 per cent told us that companies should voluntarily agree not to sell facial recognition technology to schools, and half support a pause on sales to the police.

Given the current political climate, it seems unlikely that governments will intervene to limit the spread of this technology anytime soon. Courageous leadership by the private sector in the form of a voluntary moratorium would buy the space and time needed for genuine public discussion about what type of society we want to build.

ETFs With a Focus on Health-Care AI; Robo Global Healthcare Technology & Innovation is one of several new funds betting that aging populations will spark a technological revolution in health care

With aging populations around the world, rapid advances in health-care technology could boost some exchange-traded funds focused on the area.

That is what Travis Briggs, chief executive officer of Robo Global, is counting on. The firm recently launched an index that features names like Tabula Rasa HealthCare, a health-care software specialist, and Genomic Health Inc, which focuses on genetic research to detect cancer. The index is tracked by the new Robo Global Healthcare Technology & Innovation ETF (HTEC).

Technologies like artificial intelligence are poised for rapid growth in health care, Mr. Briggs says, with some estimating that health-care AI alone could grow from a business valued at about $2 billion in 2018 to $36 billion by 2025, he says.

"That has enormous benefits for patients and investors," he says.

Innovation in health-care technology has driven "a lot of private capital into these areas as investors want to get exposure to companies powering this technological revolution," says Neena Mishra, director of ETF research at Zacks Investment Research. We are likely in the early stages of this revolution, she says. She expects to see a number of other funds take a similar approach to HTEC by providing comprehensive exposure to health-care technology, though she notes that there is a range of health-care ETFs that incorporate a strong technological element, some focusing on certain areas within the broader sector.

State Street Global Advisors operates two such funds: SPDR S&P Biotech ETF (XBI) and SPDR S&P Health Care Equipment ETF (XHE). Matthew Bartolini, a managing director at SSGA and head of SPDR Americas Research, says that health care as a whole has been one of the worst-performing sectors in 2019, thanks to regulatory pressures around drug pricing, insurance and the opioid crisis, which have weighed on the pharmaceutical companies and service providers that dominate the sector.

However, health-care-equipment companies have performed better than the sector as a whole, benefiting from structural tailwinds like aging populations and the increased prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes and obesity, which have driven demand for medical devices, in-home monitors, implants and other means of long-term care.

"While regulatory scrutiny is likely to continue to weigh on other health care sector subindustries, equipment firms may continue to outperform given that their higher projected growth rates stem from structural demand," Mr. Bartolini says.

BlackRock Inc.'s iShares business recently launched its "megatrends" ETF framework, which clusters funds together as they relate to a range of key long-term trends. Demographic change and health-care innovation is an important part of this, says Jeff Spiegel, U.S. head of iShares Megatrend and International ETFs, with iShares Genomics Immunology & Healthcare ETF (IDNA) and iShares Robotics & Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (IRBO) included in the new framework.

The dynamic that investors should realize, says Mr. Spiegel: "By 2035, more people in the U.S. will be older than 65 than there will be people younger than 18."

This could have led to discrimination in the pricing or provision of health insurance, as well as life insurance, which in the UK was required to get a mortgage.

Rather than exploit this legal gap, the sector chose a different path. In 1998, the Association of British Insurers adopted a two-year voluntary moratorium on the use of genetic testing in the provision of insurance policies backing mortgages. This was extended in 2001 to include life insurance and critical illness cover. The moratorium was enshrined in an official agreement between the government and the ABI, binding 97 per cent of the UK insurance sector. After repeated extensions, the moratorium this year was formalised into an open-ended, voluntary code on genetic testing and insurance.

Companies developing, selling and using facial recognition technology should follow this praiseworthy example. Our research indicates such a move would have popular support. Most people do not want to see facial recognition in schools or on public transport. A large majority   70 per cent   told us that companies should voluntarily agree not to sell facial recognition technology to schools, and half support a pause on sales to the police.

Given the current political climate, it seems unlikely that governments will intervene to limit the spread of this technology anytime soon. Courageous leadership by the private sector in the form of a voluntary moratorium would buy the space and time needed for genuine public discussion about what type of society we want to build.

Signia Venture Partners Raises $85 Million for Third Fund; The early-stage venture firm looks to fund artificial-intelligence  technology in industries such as retail and media

Signia Venture Partners has raised $85 million for an early-stage venture-capital fund with a particular focus on startups building artificial-intelligence technology for traditional industries.

The fund, called SVP III, will target a variety of industries that can be affected by AI. Managing Director Sunny Dhillon said he is especially interested in the grocery and retail sectors as well as the media and entertainment industries.

For instance, startups offering e-commerce search optimization and computer vision technology that can inventory store shelves could be attractive as investment targets, Mr. Dhillon said.

The firm also is interested in startups using AI to detect and curb altered videos known as "deepfakes," Mr. Dhillon said. At the same time, he said he is interested in the positive uses of deepfake technology, which could be applied in the entertainment industry.

Signia's new fund, which closed in December 2018, comes amid strong investor interest in artificial intelligence.

Venture-capital investment in AI-focused startups rose to $4.9 billion across 139 deals in the second quarter of this year, from $2.6 billion across 153 deals in the second quarter of 2018, according to a PwC/CB Insights MoneyTree report. SoftBank Group Corp. also plans to focus on AI startups with its second technology megafund, which is "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-is-hot-and-softbanks-new-tech-megafund-will-add-money-to-burn-11565184767".

Signia's fund, its third investment vehicle, will aim to make around 20 investments of roughly $500,000 to $2.5 million each, Mr. Dhillon said. Signia's previous two funds raised $76.6 million and "https://www.wsj.com/articles/signia-venture-partners-puts-its-own-capital-behind-new-85m-fund-1474552802".

Signia, based in Menlo Park, Calif., has notched several notable exits since it launched in 2012. The firm was one of the largest seed investors in Cruise Automation, the autonomous-vehicle startup that was purchased by General Motors Co. in 2016. Signia also invested in FunPlus, a social gaming startup that sold to Chinese gaming conglomerate Zhongji Investment Holding Co. Ltd. "https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2014/08/19/zhongji-buys-major-assets-from-gaming-co-funplus-for-up-to-960m/", and Tenor Inc., which was acquired by Alphabet Inc. last year.

In conjunction with the new fund, Signia has promoted Linus Liang, previously a principal, to partner. In addition, Mr. Dhillon, a founder and previously a partner, has been named a managing director.

With the new fund, Signia plans to ramp up its sourcing of deals outside of Silicon Valley, Mr. Dhillon said. High valuations and the cost of living are among the reasons the firm wants to search for undiscovered talent and startups in locations such as Austin, Texas, Los Angeles and Orange County, Calif., Mr. Dhillon said.

"We want to find startups that are not so encumbered by legacy, which you find a lot of in the Valley," Mr. Dhillon said.

Signia has made six initial investments to date from its third fund, including leading a $2.5 million investment in Picap Inc., a startup that builds shared mobility software. The firm expects to invest the remainder of the fund over the next two years.

VC Daily: WeWork's Valuation Cut; AI-Focused Fund; Stripe to Make Loans; Proving Impact Funds' Impact

Happy Friday. We Co. is considering an IPO price that would value it at around $20 billion, the Journal reports. The fact that the WeWork parent could seek to go public at less than half the valuation of $47 billion in its last private round raises questions about how private investors had valued it.

Wall Street is skeptical about We Co.'s valuation, and prospective public investors' concerns aren't based solely on the struggles of other recent tech IPOs such as Uber and Lyft. There are longstanding unanswered questions about WeWork's business, which involves renting out office space, renovating it and chopping it up to rent out to other companies. Other real-estate companies in similar businesses have much lower valuations.

SoftBank Group added to the uncertainty about We's valuation when it bought shares in the company at two different prices early this year. The firm purchased newly issued shares at a $47 billion valuation, but it offered an unusually steep discount to existing employees and investors when it bought some of their shares at a valuation of just $23 billion.

Meanwhile, read on for news of a recent venture deal that involved WeWork this time as one of the funders.

And now on to rest of the news...

Immunity option. IFM Therapeutics LLC has granted Novartis an option to acquire its IFM Due subsidiary in an agreement worth up to $840 million, its second deal with Novartis this year, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/novartis-strikes-840-million-deal-with-ifm-therapeutics-11567723214?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc". The Boston-based immunotherapy company, whose shareholders include Atlas Venture, Abingworth and Novartis, runs its drug-development programs through subsidiaries that can be funded and sold individually.

Lending party. Payments company Stripe Inc. plans to start lending to some of its customers, building on the extensive data and relationships it has with them, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/stripe-joins-square-shopify-others-in-lending-to-small-businesses-11567726232?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc". With the launch of Stripe Capital, Stripe joins other payments and software providers such as Shopify Inc., which offers Shopify Capital, and Square Inc., with its Square Capital line, that offer loans to their small-business clients. Some venture investors believe the trend will grow, as nonlenders get into the lending game by underwriting their customers based on existing data, such as payments flows.

Prove the impact. Impact-investment firms used to face skepticism about whether they can make a profit. Now the challenge is proving they really deliver social or environmental benefits, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/impact-investing-boom-tests-firms-to-prove-positive-change-11567717701?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc". The popularity of ESG creates a "quality-screening issue," according to Nancy Pfund, founder and managing partner at DBL Partners, a venture-capital impact-investing firm. "I think there is a risk of folks getting into impact investing not because it's their number-one desire, but because it's a way they can raise a fund or get into deals," Ms. Pfund said.

WeWork backs furniture rental startup. The co-working provider has made an investment in furniture rental startup CasaOne, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/wework-invests-in-furniture-rental-startup-casaone-11567736432?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc". WeWork invested about $2 million, at a valuation between $100 million and $150 million, one of the people said. WeWork is also a customer of the Emeryville, Calif.-based startup, which is formally known as La Casa Ventures Inc. The investment was made as part of a $16 million financing round led by Silicon Valley venture firm Accel, one of the people said. Other investors in the round included commercial real-estate business Jones Lang LaSalle Inc. and Array Ventures. WeWork didn't respond to a request for comment.

Prudential To Acquire An Online Startup

Prudential Financial Inc. agreed to pay $2.35 billion for an online startup as traditional life insurers seek to reach digital-savvy customers who shop on the internet.

Executives of Prudential said Assurance IQ Inc., a three-year-old company based in Bellevue, Wash., can help it solve a decades-old problem bedeviling many of the biggest names in life insurance: selling to middle-class clients. The 144-year-old Prudential is the nation's largest life-insurance company by assets.

The deal is part of a trend in which traditional life insurers are pairing with what are known as insuretech firms to reach new audiences and benefit from data analysis driven by algorithms.

At the same time, venture-capital checks are being written to small companies in nearly every category of the insurance industry. SoftBank Group Corp. led a $300 million investment round in April for Lemonade Insurance Co., which sells renters' and homeowners' policies online. Clover Health, a San Francisco startup that sells Medicare Advantage health-insurance plans, raised $500 million in January.

Assurance sells life, health, Medigap and auto policies online, and it has agents available by phone to help consumers with buying decisions if they want a human to answer questions. The privately held firm currently offers products from more than 20 providers, not including Prudential.

The Newark, N.J., insurance giant plans to make money initially from the commissions and other fees that Assurance receives from providers, while adding its own products, including life insurance and annuities, to the mix over time.

"We think Assurance has cracked the code" to reach consumers whose business is typically too small to make it worthwhile for agents to seek, Prudential Chief Executive Officer Charles Lowrey said in an interview.

Assurance uses online advertising and other marketing to attract consumers to its online platforms. The company uses data science and machine learning to assess needs, guide customers to products they can afford and speed up the application process. Those comfortable with buying online can make a purchase that way, or the firm will route customers to an agent if preferred.

Prudential executives said Assurance can help ramp up sales to a wider selection of households while Prudential's network of financial advisers will continue focusing on more affluent clients.

Shares of Prudential rose 2.9% to $81.92 on Thursday. The broader insurance sector rallied on the outlook for longer-term interest rates.

Some Wall Street analysts cautioned that the $2.35 billion price tag seemed high but said the transaction diversifies Prudential away from the risks in its core insurance and retirement-income products by delivering a potentially fast-growing stream of fee income. Prudential said it would provide up to $1.15 billion in additional cash and equity if Assurance meets certain growth objectives.

Sales of individual life-insurance policies have fallen about 45% since the mid-1980s to hold steady in recent years at about 9.6 million policies annually, according to Limra, an industry-funded research firm.

Many life-insurance agents have left the business over the past couple of decades because of the difficulty of identifying potential buyers for low-cost, term-life insurance.

Assurance says its model overcomes this obstacle by linking potential buyers to agents, who can work remotely and with flexible hours. The agents earn lower commissions than if they prospected for customers themselves, said Michael Rowell, CEO of Assurance, but they have "higher, much higher productivity" because they aren't out hunting for customers.

But a lifeline for the company came from one of its investors, venture firm 8VC, as well as Silicon Valley Bank, which are providing an $8 million bankruptcy loan. The startup had raised $83 million from investors including 8VC and Y Combinator last year.

In late April, the FBI searched uBiome's San Francisco offices, and the Journal reported that authorities were focusing on whether the company used improper billing codes in claims and sought payment for unnecessary tests.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Sustainable fund. After years of quietly building a well-performing portfolio of sustainability and life sciences companies, 3x5 Partners is expanding through new fundraising and a larger team, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/sustainability-life-sciences-investor-3x5-doubles-team-amid-fundraising-11567631693?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc".

* The Portland, Ore.-based firm is aiming to raise about $125 million for its third fund. It has already held a first close on the fund, 3x5 Partners Fund III LP.

* Founded in 2011, with Tony Arnerich and Nicholas Walrod as managing directors, 3x5 has built a portfolio of about a dozen companies, such as water company Zero Mass Water Inc. and recently public drug company Allakos Inc. The firm has deployed about $300 million to date.

* Earlier this year, 3x5 doubled its managing director team by bringing on David Yeh to focus on sustainability deals and Joe Biller for life sciences. Mr. Yeh helped lead infrastructure and energy policy in the Obama administration. Before that, he was a venture investor at Al Gore's Generation Investment Management.

Chapter 11. Embattled lab-testing startup uBiome Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection Wednesday and put its assets up for sale after suspending testing of its clinical products, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/lab-testing-startup-ubiome-files-for-bankruptcy-11567610568?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc". The San Francisco-based company lined up an $8 million bankruptcy loan to keep its business open while it looks for a buyer. UBiome had been trying to build a business on testing patients' microbiomes based on emerging science that suggests microorganisms in the gut and other parts of the body can play a role in health. UBiome, whose investors included 8VC, Y Combinator, OS Fund and Dentsu Ventures, is under federal investigation over its billing practices, and laid off around half its workforce in July.

New board member. Office-space startup WeWork is adding its first female board member and unwinding a transaction over a trademark between the company and Chief Executive Adam Neumann, the Journal's Eliot Brown reports. WeWork, recently renamed the We Co., said in an amended IPO prospectus it would appoint Frances Frei, a professor of technology and operations at Harvard Business School, to the board after the completion of the IPO. It also said it would undo a transaction in which We bought the trademark to the word "We" from a company controlled by Mr. Neumann for just under $6 million.

Today's S-1. Vir Biotechnology Inc., an immunology company backed by large investors including SoftBank Group Corp.'s Vision Fund, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/softbank-backed-vir-biotechnology-discloses-ipo-plan-11567601672?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc". The company, founded in 2016, said it has raised $630.7 million from investors. ARCH Venture Partners holds a 27% pre-IPO stake, while SoftBank owns 21% ahead of the offering. Vir said it has assembled four technology platforms, focused on antibodies, T cells, innate immunity and small interfering ribonucleic acid, or siRNA.

Boston-based Acquia previously raised funding from investors including New Enterprise Associates, Split Rock Partners, Centerview Capital Technology, North Bridge Venture Partners, Sigma Partners and Tenaya Capital.

VC Funds

Global nonprofit Accion said its seed-stage investment vehicle, Accion Venture Lab, launched a new $23 million fund, in addition to a $10 million investment from Accion. Accion Venture Lab invests in fintech startups that provide products and services to help underserved communities world-wide.

Good day. LinkedIn's roundup of the top startups to work for includes a few private companies that have raised large venture rounds, as well as some newer names.

Several well-known consumer brands made the list, including delivery startup DoorDash, stock-trading service Robinhood, fitness startup Peloton and real-estate firm Compass. They were joined by other, perhaps less well-known names such as Snowflake Computing, industrial IoT startup Samsara and cannabis company Dosist. Hot startups such as credit card company Brex, self-driving startups Nuro, Zoox and Aurora also made the list, as well as scooter companies Lime and Bird.

LinkedIn used several criteria to select and rank the companies, including employment growth, interest in the company on LinkedIn and ability to attract talent from top companies.

And now on to the news...

In the News

All cash. Biotechnology startups are usually acquired for a combination of upfront cash and payments based on future succe. That isn't the case in Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s $950 million deal to buy startup Semma Therapeutics Inc., "https://www.wsj.com/articles/vertex-makes-another-aggressive-purchase-with-semma-11567553362?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc".

* Vertex is paying all cash to acquire Semma, a developer of potential cell therapy cures for Type 1 diabetes. Semma had raised about $150 million in venture capital from MPM Capital, F-Prime Capital Partners, Medtronic PLC, Novartis AG and others, according to Todd Foley, an MPM managing director who co-founded Semma in 2014 and served on its board.

* Pharmaceutical companies usually seek to reduce the risks of acquisitions by tying some of the payments to milestones, such as securing regulatory approval for a startup's drug. That is particularly true for early-stage biotechs whose treatments won't be on the market for years.

* Semma hasn't tested its therapies on humans yet, but in June it presented data from animal studies that illustrated their potential. If Semma's treatments can cure humans, the impact could be dramatic for patients and for companies that make insulin pumps, glucose monitors and other devices used to manage diabetes, Mr. Foley said.

Crypto lobby. Andreessen Horowitz is putting up a fight against Washington's cryptocurrency crackdown, the Journal's Dave Michaels and Alexander Osipovich report. In late May, at a private conference hosted by the firm for regulators and Treasury officials, Marc Andreessen compared cryptocurrencies to the early internet and said crypto could solve some of the internet's biggest challenges if Washington would adopt a less stringent form of regulation. The response wasn't accommodating, according to people who attended. J. Christopher Giancarlo, until recently chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, said he warned Andreessen Horowitz that crypto regulation couldn't be brushed aside. "Some of the things you learned from your older VCs, this won't transfer," he said.

Charitable luxury. Online luxury retail startup Olivela Inc. has raised $35 million in Series A financing, joining other startups with charitable business models in raising funding, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/e-commerce-startup-olivela-looks-to-combine-charity-with-luxury-11567594800?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc". Olivela offers an online retail website for luxury fashion and beauty products from brands such as Christian Dior SE and Fendi SRL. The company donates 20% of the proceeds for each purchase to charitable causes. Founder and CEO Stacey Boyd said the charitable-giving program gives Olivela a leg up because younger generations care more about supporting companies that help those in need.

New fund alert. Veterans of Versant Ventures and New Enterprise Associates have raised $225 million for the debut fund of Vensana Capital, a new venture- and growth-equity firm focused on medical technology, WSJ Pro's Brian Gormley reports. Justin Klein, who left NEA in December, and Versant's Kirk Nielsen are the managing partners of Minneapolis-based Vensana, which formed early this year. They closed Vensana Capital I LP in late July at its hard cap, Mr. Nielsen said.

Cell therapy. Achilles Therapeutics Ltd., a company developing cell therapies to fight solid tumors, said it has "https://www.wsj.com/articles/achilles-therapeutics-eyes-t-cell-therapy-for-solid-cancers-with-new-funding-11567519926?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc" ($121 million) in a second round of financing which it will use to progress two clinical trials. Proceeds from the investment will go to fund two human studies that will investigate T-cell therapy to target nonsmall cell lung cancer and melanoma. The British company said the Series B round was led by new U.S. investor RA Capital Management.

E-commerce bankruptcy deal. Loot Crate Inc., the "geek and gamer" subscription business backed by actor Robert Downey Jr.'s venture firm, plans to sell itself for more than $30 million to a creditor that will use the debt it is owed as currency. The proposed deal with a Money Chest LLC affiliate will be subject to rival bids in a potential auction supervised by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., "https://www.wsj.com/articles/bankrupt-loot-crate-gets-creditor-bid-of-more-than-30-million-11567549182?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc". Loot Crate's backers include Upfront Ventures, Breakwater Investment Management, Time Inc., M13 and Sterling.VC as well as Downey Ventures.

Crypto ETF. Crypto enthusiasts have been trying without much success to get regulatory approval for funds to bring bitcoin to investors. Two firms plan to use a workaround, the Journal's Paul Vigna reports. Van Eck Securities Corp. and SolidX Management LLC on Thursday plan to start selling shares in a limited version of a crypto exchange-traded fund. SolidX is backed by investors including Liberty City Ventures, Red Sea Ventures and Red Swan Ventures.

Exits

Cloudflare Inc., a provider of cloud-based networking and cybersecurity services, said it plans to sell 35 million shares in its initial public offering at an expected price of $10 to $12 apiece. At the midpoint of that range, the San Francisco company would have a valuation of about $3.23 billion. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cloudflare-estimates-ipo-terms-valuing-company-at-3-23-billion-11567524413?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc".

Satsuma Pharmaceuticals Inc. said it will sell 5 million shares in its initial public offering at an expected price of $14 to $16 apiece. At the midpoint of that range, the South San Francisco, Calif., company said it expects net proceeds of about $66.7 million, and a valuation of about $252.8 million.

IGM Biosciences Inc. said it will sell 7.8 million shares in its IPO at a price between $15 and $17 each. At the midpoint of the range, the Mountain View, Calif., company said it expects net proceeds of about $112.4 million.

Small-business lending platform Kabbage Inc. agreed to acquire Radius Intelligence Inc., a small-business data provider, for an undisclosed amount. Atlanta-based Kabbage is backed by investors including SoftBank Vision Fund, BlueRun Ventures and Reverence Capital. Radius, of San Francisco, counts 8VC, BlueRun Ventures, Founders Fund and Salesforce Ventures as investors.

Conversational marketing platform Drift acquired Giant Otter, a developer of artificial intelligence systems for understanding human behavior and language, for an undisclosed sum. Boston-based Drift is backed by CRV, General Catalyst and Sequoia.

VC Funds

Xiang He Capital closed its second dollar-denominated venture fund at $425 million, exceeding its $350 million target. Backers included consultants, university endowments, foundations, family offices, pensions and fund-of-funds from the U.S., Europe, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific. Founded in 2016, Xiang He Capital makes early and growth stage investments focused on internet, enterprise services, and artificial intelligence and big data in China.

DSG Consumer Partners raised $65 million for its third fund, according to a regulatory filing. The firm, with offices in Mauritius and Singapore, makes consumer-focused investments in India and Southeast Asia.

Banking & Finance: Credit Unions Go On Buying Spree For Small Banks

By Lalita Clozel

The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- Credit unions are buying small banks in record numbers, a trend that is prompting pushback from the banking industry.

Credit unions have acquired 21 U.S. banks since 2018, according to S&P Global Market Intelligence, compared with 12 purchases in the prior five years.

Bankers say the deals are proof credit unions are growing too aggressively given their not-for-profit business model. Credit unions say they are driven by the same market forces that have driven hundreds of bank mergers in recent years.

"We see opportunities to expand our network, bring in new products to the table, and get a good return on investment," said Brian Wolfburg, the president and chief executive of VyStar Credit Union in Florida, which closed its first bank acquisition in August.

Banks have complained for decades that credit unions, which have tax-exempt status, compete with an unfair advantage over financial products such as mortgages, credit cards and business loans while benefiting from weaker regulatory requirements. Banks have lost numerous battles to change regulation and tax treatment of credit unions. Credit unions say their growth helps them extend lower-cost loans and better deposit rates to more consumers.

"Credit unions serve the greater good, not the greater greed," said Dan Berger, the president and chief executive of the National Association of Federally-Insured Credit Unions, a trade group.

Credit unions, owned by member-customers, are exempt from corporate taxes and certain lending rules. But they also must serve lower-income households and limit customers to a restricted pool of people who generally work together or live near one another.

Credit union and bank tie-ups represent a tiny fraction of the consolidation happening in the industry. There were 187 mergers between credit unions approved in 2018, according to the National Credit Union Administration, compared with nine announced deals between credit unions and banks.

So far this year, credit unions have announced mergers with 12 banks.

Credit unions also are smaller overall, holding $1.5 trillion in assets in the first quarter of 2019, compared with $18 trillion for banks and thrifts.

Still, the deals illustrate how competitive credit unions have become, given their tax advantages, lack of shareholders and diminishing constraints on growth.

"The substantive mission-driven aspects of the credit union charter that are supposed to make them unique and justify many taxpayer benefits have eroded, if not ended," said Karen Shaw Petrou, whose firm Federal Financial Analytics Inc. published a June report on credit unions commissioned by the American Bankers Association.

Last year, Martin Steele hired an investment bank to field potential buyers for his $206 million-asset firm, The Bank of Washington.

Mr. Steele, the Seattle-area bank's president and chief executive at the time, said he received six offers. He chose the one from Sound Credit Union, in part because it was an all-cash bid and he worried the value of competing stock-based offers from banks could drop before a deal closed.

"I've got five friends who I'm saying no to, and I've got a credit union who I've never met before who I'm saying yes to," said Mr. Steele, who now serves as president and chief executive of First Sound Bank.

Laura Lee Stewart, president and chief executive of Sound Community Bank in Seattle, was one of the bidders that had an existing relationship with Bank of Washington. Ms. Stewart, who is also chairman-elect of the ABA, said the community will lose a tax-income source as a result of the deal.

"When an entity is in business doing the same thing and gets a free ride, that's bad public policy," she said. "And it's bad for communities."

Sound Credit Union, based in Tacoma, Wash., said the acquisition would allow it to expand its services to customers and grow to new markets.

"We believe that together, our combined knowledge and experience will better serve our members and communities," Don Clark, president and chief executive of the firm, said in a statement. He added that Sound Credit Union had paid $3 million in payroll, property and sales taxes in 2018.

Credit unions face limits to how they can structure the deals. They must ensure that the customers of the bank they are acquiring will fit into their field of membership and that they won't hit a business-lending limit as a result of the acquisition.

NCUA Chairman Rodney Hood said he plans to introduce a rule later this year to clarify credit unions' regulatory responsibilities when acquiring banks.

Credit unions should "make sure that they are acquiring a bank that comports with their existing field of membership and the lines of business they are operating in," Mr. Hood said in an interview. The NCUA and bank regulators generally need to approve these deals before they close.

To get around laws prohibiting credit unions from holding bank charters, many of the deals are structured as "purchase and assumptions," in which the bank empties out its loans and deposits and transfers everything over to the credit union.

The Property Report
Foreigners Pull Out Of Market --- Overseas investors fear U.S. commercial property has hit peak as they shift assets

A strong appetite among foreign investors for office buildings, apartments, malls and other real estate has in part fueled the long-running bull market in U.S. commercial property.

Now, amid a maturing property market cycle and rising uncertainties in geopolitics and the global economy, foreign investors have sold more U.S. commercial real estate than they bought in a quarter for the first time since 2013.

After years of amassing huge portfolios, investors from abroad sold $13.4 billion of property in the second quarter of 2019, according to data firm Real Capital Analytics. During the quarter, foreign investors purchased $12.6 billion of real estate.

European and Canadian investors have been active sellers recently, along with some high-profile investors from China.

"U.S. real estate is priced very high right now, and people think we're close to the top of the market," said Matt Posthuma, a partner in Ropes & Gray's asset management practice.

The waning appetite of foreign investors for U.S. property contrasts with their intensifying interest in other asset classes.

Foreign money managers still see U.S. assets as a haven and have been piling into U.S. stocks and bonds, buying nearly $64 billion in these assets in June, the largest sum since August 2018, according to data from the Treasury Department.

What's the difference? Compared with buildings, stocks and bonds are easier to buy and sell. If a recession hits, property owners may find it more difficult to sell their assets.

"For someone looking out three to five years, their investments may not be worth as much as they are today," Mr. Posthuma said. "That's the fear."

Some domestic investors in commercial property also are moving to the sidelines. Overall, sales volume of commercial U.S. property fell 9% in the first quarter of this year from one year ago and rose a modest 2% in the second quarter to $127 billion.

For decades, sovereign-wealth funds, insurers, pension funds and family offices across the world have sought assets in the U.S. to diversify their investments and seek steady returns. Many also are drawn to the market's relative stability, vast pool of consumers and deep and liquid market.

But, with the dollar strong, overseas investors unloading U.S. assets can chalk up foreign-exchange gains against weaker local currencies along with profits from higher prices. The strong dollar also means buying U.S. property has become more expensive for them.

Some investors are shunning investments in flood-prone areas, as rising sea levels and hurricanes amplify costs to mitigate damages, particularly in older buildings.

Finding good deals also has become trickier in the U.S. as a possible recession looms and other regional and economic trends -- including the impact of e-commerce on the retail sector -- cast a shadow over some property types.

One of the biggest foreign sellers during the second quarter was Ivanhoe Cambridge, the real-estate arm of Canadian pension fund Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec, which completed the sale of $2.2 billion worth of properties, according to Real Capital.

In the second quarter, Ivanhoe Cambridge sold two office towers in Seattle and its stake in Ritz Plaza, a 479-unit rental apartment building in Midtown Manhattan.

"It's investment discipline," said Sylvain Fortier, chief investment and innovation officer at Ivanhoe Cambridge. "When you reached the level you set out at the beginning, don't get greedy. Get out and recycle your money into something else."

The Quebec pension fund is focusing more these days on industrial real estate and less on other property types. Late last year, Ivanhoe Cambridge invested in IDI Logistics, an Atlanta-based developer and operator of warehouses.

In another megadeal in June, Singapore-based investment manager GLP agreed to sell a U.S. network of industrial warehouses, totaling 179 million square feet, to Blackstone Group LP for $18.7 billion, the largest private real-estate transaction ever. GLP has said it would keep a small footprint in the U.S. and is still looking to expand but didn't provide a timeline.

Overseas investors still interested in the U.S. real-estate market are also starting to structure their acquisitions differently.

They are choosing to invest in debt rather than equity, which is seen as a safer bet, if the economy slides closer to a recession.

They are also taking on more minority stakes to lower the chances of triggering a review by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., the country's national-security panel that vets foreign investment in U.S. businesses.

Last year, Congress expanded the authority of the panel, known as Cfius, which has hindered some real-estate transactions if they include land located near a military installation or other sensitive U.S. government property.

Business News: Psychedelic-Drug Treatments Draw Investors, Skeptics

Psychedelic substances are gaining legitimacy as a treatment for mental illnesses, prompting a handful of entrepreneurs and venture-capital investors to look for business opportunities in the nascent sector.

Still, veteran health-care investors say it is too early to jump into the market given the legal ramifications. Psilocybin, found in "magic mushrooms," has been decriminalized in countries including the Netherlands and Portugal, but remains illegal under U.S. federal law.

"We would not invest in something where we were also betting that the illegality would change," said Bryan Roberts, a partner at Venrock Associates, one of the oldest venture-capital firms in the U.S. "But we would absolutely invest in something that was utilizing some novel understanding of biology and generating new research into drug development."

Partners from Canaan Partners and New Enterprise Associates, both longtime health-care and life-science investors, said the sector isn't even on their radar.

Acceptance in the U.S. is growing. Denver effectively decriminalized psychedelic mushrooms in May and Oakland, Calif., followed in June. Research suggests psychedelics could help treat clinical depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and other conditions.

A few large, well-known startups based in Europe have attracted high-profile investors.

Germany-based ATAI Life Sciences AG is using a big-data approach to psychedelic-drug development. U.K.-based Compass Pathways Inc. last year received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to run clinical trials to test the use of psilocybin on patients with treatment-resistant depression.

ATAI is the largest investor in Compass. Collectively, the two companies have raised about $122 million from investors including billionaires Peter Thiel and Michael Novogratz.

But some investors and entrepreneurs believe there are many more opportunities to come, as no major pharmaceutical company is developing psilocybin-based drugs.

"There are a lot of reasons to believe this could be the next big thing," said Ronan Levy, who co-founded Field Trip Ventures Inc. this year to invest in startups developing compounds and therapy protocols with psychedelics. "There is a strong grass-roots movement, a general acceptance of the safety profile, and a growing acceptance of the therapeutic value."

Firms including Field Trip Ventures, Numinus and Tabula Rasa Inc. -- all based in Canada, where psychedelics are illegal at the federal level -- also say they believe interest from the private sector will help the push for drug-policy changes.

Numinus, founded this year, has acquired a clinic in Vancouver and is working with psychiatrists and therapists to design psychedelic treatment protocols as well as software to analyze efficacy.

Other companies are staying away from pushing legalization efforts or presenting their offerings as health care. Amsterdam-based Synthesis Retreats and Jamaica-based Atman Retreat, which operate in countries where psilocybin use is legal or decriminalized, run wellness retreats catering to people who haven't been diagnosed with clinical illnesses.

Good day. The impact of the U.S.-China trade war is widening, with more small businesses in the U.S., manufacturers in Asia and others feeling the effects as a new round of tariffs kicked in. Meanwhile, U.S. consumer spending and inflation picked up in July, but the prospects for continued strong spending ahead are less clear. And Australia's central bank left rates unchanged.

Now on to today's news and analysis.

U.S.-China Trade War's Global Impact Grows

The escalating trade war between the U.S. and China is rippling through the global economy, hurting confidence among U.S. small businesses, crimping trade among industrial giants in Asia and hitting export-oriented factories in Europe. On Sunday the U.S. imposed fresh tariffs of 15% on Chinese goods including clothing, tools and electronics. A round of retaliatory Chinese tariffs also took effect, targeting imports of U.S. soybeans, crude oil and pharmaceuticals. Beijing said on Monday it lodged a complaint with the World Trade Organization over the Trump administration's tariffs.

U.S. inflation rebounded in July on the back of strong consumer spending, the latest sign that price pressures are recovering from a slow start to the year that helped motivate the Federal Reserve to ease borrowing costs. The Fed's preferred inflation measure, the personal consumption-expenditures price index, rose a seasonally adjusted 0.21% in July from the prior month and 1.38% from July 2018, the Commerce Department said.

Commentary

Japan's Sales-Tax Increase Threatens a Labor-Market Miracle

"After a multiyear boom, Japan's job market may now be as strong as it's going to get. That's not good news, since tumbling unemployment hasn't yet generated solid wage growth, and the sales tax is set to increase to 10% from 8% in just a month's time," writes WSJ's Mike Bird, who calls the Oct. 1 tax rise a needless economic mishap. "The move is all but guaranteed to dent consumption again, and given the country's already-tenuous economic growth, could easily spark another recession. Rock-bottom interest rates mean that Japan's net interest spending is among the lowest of any advanced economy, and fiscal consolidation is unnecessary. With the labor market now looking like it may have reached its peak without generating stronger consumption, fighting the phantom threat of the country's high debt load is a mistake" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe shouldn't make again, Mr. Bird says.

Basis Points

* U.S. household sentiment fell in August from the earlier month amid concerns over a trade war. The University of Michigan on Friday said its final index of August consumer sentiment was 89.8, a drop of 8.6 points from July and the largest monthly fall since December 2012.

* The Canadian economy rebounded in the second quarter as one of the strongest export showings this decade offset a decline in business investment and soft household spending.

* India's economic growth slowed to a six-year low last quarter as debt problems at banks choked business and consumer spending in Asia's third largest economy.

Asset managers must clamp down on their pay

Has the fund management industry become a force for good in reining in executive pay? Evidence from the UK suggests that the upward march has moderated with last year's 13 per cent fall as a cause of celebration.

While votes on pay at annual meetings tend to receive more than 90 per cent shareholder approval, dialogue between investors and remuneration committees before the vote will have helped curb excess.

Two crucial questions are now being danced around. The first is whether institutional shareholders are really concerned about absolute pay levels and the gap between the top and the average worker. The second is whether a big driver of differences between the two bonus payments is justified.

The proof on absolute pay will be whether last year's reduction turns out to be more than a dip related to falls in equity markets. A report from the High Pay Centre, a think-tank that monitors pay in top roles, and Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, anHRindustry association, shows that it is too early to pronounce a downward trend. The median pay for FTSE 100 chief executives has been bobbling about in the 3.4mto4.2mrange since2010.

UK regulations on the pay gap, enacted in 2018, require large listed companies to report the ratio of chief executive pay to the median employee. The gap varied by sector, from 34 times in technology to 177 times in consumer goods last year, according to the report. Boards will have to refer to this ratio from next year in discussingexecutive pay.

The information will provide plenty of grist for commentary on fairness. To what extent will fund managers use it to influence board behaviour? Their own ratio will be much nearer the bottom of the range than the top, thanks to relatively flat hierarchies.

The less comfortable reason is that they have a lot of highly paid staff, including ones paid more than the chief executive. This jars with the changingworldfor activemanagers.

Fees have been driven down by competition from passive funds, lower returns. and transparency. The pressure is on to reduce costs, and staff are the biggest single one.

This brings us to the second difficult issue for the sector: bonuses. At Schroders, chief executive Peter Harrison's 6.17m of variable pay was 11 times his fixed salary   his bonus attracted a 12 per cent protest vote at the annual meeting.

Even at Legal & General Investment Management, which operates through passive funds and promotes so-called inclusive capitalism, senior managers' variable pay was 250 per cent of their fixed salary, according to disclosures to theFCA.

The cap for bankers under rules covering material risk takers is 100 per cent, or twice that with shareholder approval.

The cultural attachment to bonuses is rooted in the tradition of active management and the pursuit of alpha. This has the advantage of reducing fixed costs in a bad year. But while pay for performance will always have a place, separating out individual contribution, discounting for risk and choosing a timeframe for measurementremainproblematic.

The star culture can be seen as a feature of equity bull markets, where brilliant individuals dig into corporate accounts to gain an edge. In fixed income, with a narrower risk-reward trade-off, investment decisions more clearly involve a team, which draws onmacroandmicrosources.

Count in the growing cohort of technology experts, analysing data from satellites and natural language processing, and teamwork becomes vital for all asset classes. Are there any individual stars in the ETF market among those who devise screens to capture clients' values or who perfect tradingautomation? Another change has been the setting of non-financial goals for managers, such as executing group strategy and nurturing talent. But these are part of the job covered by base salary. The approach could be extended along the investment decision-making chain, recognising the broader dutiesof serving clients.

A final reason for the sector to rely less on variable pay is its sheer complexity. Bonuses are deferred and partly paid in shares or fund units whose value varies. They are subject to potential penalties and the discretion of remuneration committees . Valuing uncertain rewards is hard, and may even lead an individual to ask formore tocompensate.

The time has come for the sector to reviewitspayideology,makingsalary the most important element of the totalandflexing those totalsdown.

Hello. The CEO of a U.K. company, fooled by an AI-enabled impersonation of the voice of his boss, wired money to a bank account, letting scammers get away with about $243,000, WSJ Pro's Catherine Stupp reports. The incident early this year shows that hackers are picking up basic artificial intelligence technologies for cyberattack. Traditional cybersecurity tools weren't built to detect AI-enabled voice impersonation, experts say.

Also today: U.S. prosecutors look into more instances of alleged tech theft by Huawei; General Electric to build new tech for Pentagon to protect military information and other data; Mount Sinai patients get notice their personal information was exposed.

Fraudsters Use AI to Mimic CEO's Voice in Cybercrime Case

Scams using artificial intelligence are a new challenge for companies

By Catherine Stupp

Criminals used artificial intelligence-based software to impersonate a chief executive's voice and demand a fraudulent transfer of  ¬220,000 ($243,000) in March in what cybercrime experts described as an "https://www.wsj.com/articles/fraudsters-use-ai-to-mimic-ceos-voice-in-unusual-cybercrime-case-11567157402?mod=djemCybersecruityPro&tpl=cy&mod=djemCybersecruityPro&tpl=cy".

The chief executive of a U.K.-based energy firm thought he was speaking on the phone with his boss, the CEO of the firm's German parent company, who asked him to send the funds to a Hungarian supplier. The caller said the request was urgent, directing the executive to pay within an hour, according to the company's insurance firm, Euler Hermes Group SA.

Euler Hermes declined to name the victim companies.

Law enforcement authorities and AI experts have predicted that criminals would use AI to automate cyberattacks. Whoever was behind this incident appears to have used AI-based software to successfully mimic the German executive's voice by phone. The U.K. CEO recognized his boss's slight German accent and the tenor of his voice on the phone, said Rdiger Kirsch, a fraud expert at Euler Hermes, a subsidiary of Munich-based financial services company Allianz SE.

Several officials said the voice-spoofing attack in Europe is the first cybercrime they have heard of in which criminals clearly drew on AI. Euler Hermes, which covered the entire amount of the victim company's claim, hasn't dealt with other claims seeking to recover losses from crimes involving AI, according to Mr. Kirsch.

Scams using AI are a new challenge for companies, Mr. Kirsch said. Traditional cybersecurity tools designed to keep hackers off corporate networks can't spot spoofed voices. Cybersecurity companies have recently developed products to detect so-called deepfake recordings.

It is unclear whether this is the first attack using AI or whether there are other incidents that have gone unreported or in which authorities did not detect the technology in use, said Philipp Amann, head of strategy at Europol's European Cybercrime Center. Europol is the European police agency. While it is hard to predict whether there might soon be an uptick in cyberattacks using AI, Mr. Amann said hackers are more likely to use the technology if it makes attacks more successful or profitable.

Multistage attack

The attackers responsible for defrauding the British energy company called three times, Mr. Kirsch said. After the transfer of the $243,000 went through, the hackers called to say the parent company had transferred money to reimburse the U.K. firm. They then made a third call later that day, again impersonating the CEO, and asked for a second payment. Because the transfer reimbursing the funds hadn't yet arrived and the third call was from an Austrian phone number, the executive became suspicious. He didn't make the second payment.

The money that was transferred to the Hungarian bank account was subsequently moved to Mexico and distributed to other locations. Investigators haven't identified any suspects, Mr. Kirsch said.

It is unclear whether the attackers used bots to react to the victim's questions. If they did, it might have been even more difficult for law enforcement authorities to investigate, Mr. Amann said. A police investigation into the case has ended, Mr. Kirsch said. Europol wasn't involved.

Mr. Kirsch believes hackers used commercial voice-generating software to carry out the attack. He recorded his own voice using one such product and said the reproduced version sounded real.

A few software companies offer services that can quickly impersonate voices, said Bobby Filar, director of data science at Endgame, a cybersecurity company. "You don't need to be a Ph.D. in mathematics to use it." he said.

Another tactic hackers could use would be to stitch together audio samples to mimic a person's voice, which would likely require many hours of recordings. Security researchers demonstrated this technique at the Black Hat conference last year.

Attackers could use publicly available voice recordings to impersonate celebrities or executives.

"You can't go around and be silent the entire time. You're going to run into situations like this where you expose information that you never thought could be used against you," Mr. Filar said.

Applying machine-learning technology to spoof voices makes cybercrime easier, said Irakli Beridze, head of the Centre on AI and Robotics at the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute.

The UN center is researching technologies to detect fake videos, which Mr. Beridze said could be an even more useful tool for hackers. In the case at the U.K. energy firm, an unfamiliar phone number finally aroused suspicions. "Imagine a video call with [a CEO's] voice, the facial expressions you're familiar with. Then you wouldn't have any doubts at all," he said.

U.S. prosecutors probe Huawei on new allegations of technology theft. U.S. prosecutors are looking into additional instances of alleged technology theft by Huawei Technologies Co., The Wall Street Journal reports, citing people familiar with the matter, potentially expanding beyond existing criminal cases against the Chinese telecommunications giant. Among the situations being examined are episodes in which Huawei was accused of stealing intellectual property from multiple people and companies over several years, as well as how the company went about recruiting employees from competitors, these people said.

IP theft allegations: The new inquiries overlap with findings from a Wall Street Journal investigation in May that documented numerous allegations of intellectual property theft against Huawei throughout its history, these people said. They include alleged theft of smartphone-camera technology from a Portuguese multimedia producer and Huawei's practices of recruiting employees from rival companies, the people said.

Huawei said: At the time, Huawei said it is committed to complying with laws in global markets and has a track record of innovation. "We respect the integrity of intellectual property rights for our own business, as well as peer, partner and competitor companies," the company said. It couldn't be determined if new charges are being sought against the company. A Huawei spokesman declined to comment. A Justice Department spokesman also declined to comment.

Fraudsters Used AI to Mimic CEO's Voice in Unusual Cybercrime Case; Scams using artificial intelligence  are a new challenge for companies

Criminals used artificial intelligence-based software to impersonate a chief executive's voice and demand a fraudulent transfer of  ¬220,000 ($243,000) in March in what cybercrime experts described as an unusual case of artificial intelligence being used in hacking.

The CEO of a U.K.-based energy firm thought he was speaking on the phone with his boss, the chief executive of the firm's German parent company, who asked him to send the funds to a Hungarian supplier. The caller said the request was urgent, directing the executive to pay within an hour, according to the company's insurance firm, Euler Hermes Group SA.

Euler Hermes declined to name the victim companies.

Law enforcement authorities and AI experts "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ai-could-make-cyberattacks-more-dangerous-harder-to-detect-1542128667" AI to automate cyberattacks. Whoever was behind this incident appears to have used AI-based software to successfully mimic the German executive's voice by phone. The U.K. CEO recognized his boss' slight German accent and the melody of his voice on the phone, said Rdiger Kirsch, a fraud expert at Euler Hermes, a subsidiary of Munich-based financial services company Allianz SE.

Several officials said the voice-spoofing attack in Europe is the first cybercrime they have heard of in which criminals clearly drew on AI. Euler Hermes, which covered the entire amount of the victim company's claim, hasn't dealt with other claims seeking to recover losses from crimes involving AI, according to Mr. Kirsch.

Scams using AI are a new challenge for companies, Mr. Kirsch said. Traditional cybersecurity tools designed to keep hackers off corporate networks can't spot spoofed voices. Cybersecurity companies have recently developed products to detect so-called deepfake recordings.

It is unclear whether this is the first attack using AI or whether there are other incidents that have gone unreported or in which authorities didn't detect the technology in use, said Philipp Amann, head of strategy at Europol's European Cybercrime Center. Europol is the European police agency. While it is hard to predict whether there might soon be an uptick in cyberattacks using AI, Mr. Amann said hackers are more likely to use the technology if it makes attacks more successful or profitable.

The attackers responsible for defrauding the British energy company called three times, Mr. Kirsch said. After the transfer of the $243,000 went through, the hackers called to say the parent company had transferred money to reimburse the U.K. firm. They then made a third call later that day, again impersonating the CEO, and asked for a second payment. Because the transfer reimbursing the funds hadn't yet arrived and the third call was from an Austrian phone number, the executive became suspicious. He didn't make the second payment.

The money that was transferred to the Hungarian bank account was subsequently moved to Mexico and distributed to other locations. Investigators haven't identified any suspects, Mr. Kirsch said.

It is unclear whether the attackers used bots to react to the victim's questions. If they did, it might have been even more difficult for law enforcement authorities to investigate, Mr. Amann said. A police investigation into the case has ended, Mr. Kirsch said. Europol wasn't involved.

Mr. Kirsch believes hackers used commercial voice-generating software to carry out the attack. He recorded his own voice using one such product and said the reproduced version sounded real.

A few software companies offer services that can quickly impersonate voices, said Bobby Filar, director of data science at Endgame, a cybersecurity company. "You don't need to be a Ph.D. in mathematics to use it." he said.

Another tactic hackers could use would be to stitch together audio samples to mimic a person's voice, which would likely require many hours of recordings. Security researchers demonstrated this technique at the Black Hat conference last year.

Attackers could use publicly available voice recordings to impersonate celebrities or executives.

"You can't go around and be silent the entire time. You're going to run into situations like this where you expose information that you never thought could be used against you," Mr. Filar said.

Applying machine-learning technology to spoof voices makes cybercrime easier, said Irakli Beridze, head of the Centre on AI and Robotics at the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute.

The U.N. center is researching technologies to detect fake videos, which Mr. Beridze said could be an even more useful tool for hackers. In the case at the U.K. energy firm, an unfamiliar phone number finally aroused suspicions. "Imagine a video call with [a CEO's] voice, the facial expressions you're familiar with. Then you wouldn't have any doubts at all," he said.

Happy Friday. Using machine learning to help make venture-capital investment decisions is an attractive idea, since many investors' own companies often use the technology.

But machine learning doesn't actually work well for venture investing, according to Alessio Fanelli of 645 Ventures, because the information you need to perform such analysis, like revenue numbers, is hard to get hold of. In addition, machine learning relies on analyzing past patterns, and venture investing typically requires looking to massive changes or completely new platforms that aren't accounted for in past data.

New York-based 645 does rely on technology when scouting investments, but generally for simpler tasks, such as finding all the companies in a particular sector, Mr. Fanelli wrote. Several venture firms, including Correlation Ventures, Rocketship.vc and SignalFire, say they use machine learning and other related technologies to find and identify promising companies.

In the News

Muscular funding. Biotechnology venture capitalists recently have sold a trio of companies with potential treatments for muscle diseases, a sector where startups historically haven't attracted much funding, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venture-investors-score-with-muscle-disease-treatments-11567110479?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc".

* This week, Modis Therapeutics Inc. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/venture-investors-set-to-make-quick-returns-in-modis-therapeutics-sale-11566855736?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc" by Zogenix Inc. in a deal worth up to $400 million. Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. purchased Exonics Therapeutics Inc. in June for up to $1 billion, and Sarepta Therapeutics Inc. exercised an option to buy Myonexus Therapeutics Inc. in February, paying $165 million.

* Muscle diseases draw less attention than say heart disease or neurological disorders, but venture funding in the category has jumped recently, rising to a record $512.1 million in 2018 from $266 million the previous year, according to Dow Jones VentureSource.

* One reason: Venture firms and drug companies are investing heavily in treatments for rare genetic diseases. Several genetic diseases affect the muscles, and have limited treatment options.

Juul investigation. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating the marketing practices of e-cigarette startup Juul Labs Inc., the Journal's Jennifer Maloney reported, citing people familiar with the matter. FTC investigators are looking at whether Juul engaged in deceptive marketing, including by targeting minors or using influencers, some of the people said. Juul is minority-owned by Altria, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes. Tiger Global and venture-capital firm Tao Capital also hold stakes in the company.

California gig-worker law. Lyft and Uber offered a set of proposals to California lawmakers that they described as a compromise: a minimum wage of $21 an hour for time spent driving and picking up customers, a fund to pay for benefits such as paid sick leave, and the ability for workers to organize a group that could negotiate with numerous employers of drivers all together, rather than individually. They said if Assembly Bill 5, that would classify drivers for those and other similar companies as employees, becomes law and no other legislation addressing their concerns passes, the companies would put their resources behind a measure on next year's ballot featuring the proposals they are backing.

Latin America fund. Kaszek Ventures has raised $600 million for technology investments in Latin America. The firm closed on $375 million for early-stage fund Kaszek Ventures IV and $225 million for a later-stage vehicle, Kaszek Ventures Opportunity I. Both funds were oversubscribed, the firm said. Kaszek had sought to raise $500 million for the funds as one of several firms targeting Latin American startups, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/latin-american-venture-firms-angle-for-slice-of-global-funding-boom-11562954831?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc".

OpenGov Inc., a startup that offers budgeting software for local and state governments, has raised $51 million to continue its expansion into governments across the country, according to Chief Executive Zac Bookman.

Weatherford Capital Management and 8VC led the Series D round, while Andreessen Horowitz and others participated in the transaction, Mr. Bookman said in an interview on Wednesday.

OpenGov, based in Redwood City, Calif., has built a software platform that helps governments organize, display and track budget information. Roughly 2,000 U.S. governments and public agencies use the software.

The cloud-based software allows customers to manage annual budget cycles, manipulate large data sets, and create visuals and infographics to share on social media, among other capabilities.

Mr. Bookman said OpenGov helps governments operate more efficiently and save money by quickly revealing budgeting inefficiencies. The software can also improve local transparency if governments decide to share spending information publicly.

"This is the nitty-gritty catacombs back-office stuff," Mr. Bookman said. "But this is where our money goes."

Mr. Bookman added that governments choose to make more of this information public when using OpenGov because it is displayed in digestible user-friendly ways.

An example of a metric OpenGov could show is overtime spending by the local police department during summer months.

OpenGov customers include the Idaho State Controller's Office and the Illinois State Treasurer.

In August, the state of West Virginia began using OpenGov software to streamline financial reporting between the state and its municipalities.

Another startup, ClearGov, Inc., offers similar software and has raised roughly $5 million from investors including Kepha Partners.

In an email, ClearGov CEO Chris Bullock said the company's software can turn complex financial data into easy-to-understand infographics that residents can use to see how their tax dollars are being put to use and compare their own communities with others.

Meanwhile, numerous venture- and private equity-funded startups are targeting corporations, nonprofits and the education sector with similar software platforms focused on budgeting and financial analytics. Centage Corp., for example, has raised roughly $24 million from investors including TVC Capital, according to CEO John Murdock.

OpenGov will use the new capital to expand its product line and for research and development.

Mr. Bookman said the majority of OpenGov's existing investors also participated in the fundraising.

Thrive Capital a "https://www.wsj.com/articles/startup-that-got-a-seat-at-white-house-roundtable-is-part-owned-by-kushner-family-1500045800" and venture firm run by Josh Kushner, whose brother Jared is an adviser and son-in-law to President Trump didn't participate in the Series D round, Mr. Bookman said.

Mr. Bookman said OpenGov only works with state and local governments and has no intention of expanding to the federal government.

OpenGov has raised $140 million since it was founded in 2012. The startup's board includes Andreessen Horowitz co-founder and general partner Marc Andreessen; Joe Lonsdale, an 8VC founding partner and co-founder of data-analytics startup Palantir Technologies Inc.; and former CEO of Cisco Systems Inc. John Chambers.

ThoughtSpot Inc. has raised $248 million in late-stage funding, valuing the business data analytics company at $1.95 billion.

Lightspeed Venture Partners led ThoughtSpot's recent Series E round, with Sapphire Ventures and others participating in the deal.

The company's capital raise comes at a time when some of its peers have scored multibillion-dollar acquisitions

Companies such as Walmart Inc. and streaming service Hulu use ThoughtSpot's software to enable non-tech-savvy users to pull up business and financial analytics in much the same way people type questions into Google search bars.

For example, a retailer could ask, "How many Nike shoes did we sell in these three ZIP Codes last quarter," Chief Executive Sudheesh Nair wrote in an email.

ThoughtSpot's search tool incorporates artificial intelligence to guide users in formulating questions in ways that will yield the most accurate results. The AI-based search also can offer up data patterns that users didn't necessarily know to ask about, Mr. Nair added.

Hulu employs ThoughtSpot to measure whether a particular show drove subscriptions. The streaming service uses the software to make content decisions that could increase subscriber growth and reduce churn, ThoughtSpot spokesman Ryan Mattison said. De Beers Group uses ThoughtSpot to chart pricing trends in the diamond trade, Mr. Mattison added.

ThoughtSpot charges customers by the amount of data they input into the software, said Mr. Mattison. Other startups, including Wolfram Alpha LLC and Arcadia Data Inc., have developed similar enterprise data tools.

The enterprise data analytics sector has attracted investor interest and notched recent acquisitions as companies aim to squeeze business insights out of the data they collect.

Alphabet Inc.'s Google unveiled a deal in June to acquire Looker Data Sciences Inc., a business-intelligence software and big-data analytics platform, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-to-acquire-data-analytics-firm-looker-for-2-6-billion-11559829249" in cash. Looker has raised about $280 million from venture firms including Redpoint Ventures and First Round Capital.

That same month, Salesforce.com Inc. agreed to buy data-analytics platform Tableau Software Inc. "https://www.wsj.com/articles/salesforce-to-buy-analytics-platform-tableau-11560167718" in stock.

Revenue for business analytics services companies is expected to grow 12% this year to nearly $190 billion, according to a report in April by International Data Corp., a market intelligence firm.

Ravi Mhatre, a partner with Lightspeed, said ThoughtSpot's ability to give decision makers at companies the ability to drum up instantaneous insight is valuable, adding that ThoughtSpot's tools enable executives to generate customized data insights quickly.

Based in Sunnyvale, Calif., ThoughtSpot has raised $554 million since it was founded in 2012.

Peloton wants IPO investors to believe it can kill the gym

Route to becoming the Netflix of exercise is becoming more crowded

 One more effort 	. 	. 	. 	find that beat!  shouts Cody Rigsby, a Peloton instructor, from the 22-inch screen of one of the company s $2,245 exercise bikes.

The seven-year-old exercise company is now also trying to work investors into a lather after filing for an initial public offering later this year on the Nasdaq that it hopes will raise at least $500m.

Peloton s $4bn valuation, at the time of its last fundraise, rests on the idea that it does not just sell fashionable bikes, but that it is a media company, a Netflix of exercise, pumping out live and pre-recorded content to subscribers who believe it is a better proposition than gym classes.

The company says it produces more than 950 videos a month from its studios in New York and London, which can be watched not only on bikes but also on phones or its new treadmill. A subscription costs $39 a month in the US or 39 in the UK.

Frederic Court, founder of Felix Capital, which invested in Peloton when it first expanded out of the US in 2018, said that he had  never seen a company with so much customer love .

 There is so much enthusiasm from the user around the product. That is quite rare to see such a commitment. 

Peloton s growth has boomed, along with the wider fitness market. In September 2015, one year after it released its first bike, the company had attracted about 11,000 monthly subscribers.

Today, it counts 511,202, plus a further 102,000 subscribers to its digital boot camp, yoga and running classes who do not own a Peloton bike or treadmill, according to its prospectus. The group says it has so far only tapped a fraction of its addressable market, which it pegs at 67m households.

According to a 2018 report from the International Health, Racquet & Sportsclub Association, 183m people have gym memberships worldwide. Peloton is optimistic that a significant share of those members will swap their gym cards for a home bike or treadmill.

But its prospectus shows how expensive its marketing campaign has been, and while revenues more than doubled in the year to June 30   rising to $915m from $435m the year before   its losses rose nearly-four fold to $196m.

The listing also comes at a time when consumers are being flooded with fitness and wellness apps, hacks and memberships. Investors are wary that too much capital has flowed into the industry, allowing companies to pursue growth over profits. According to the most recent report from the Global Wellness Institute, the fitness and meditation industry was worth $595bn in 2017.

Peloton sees its main rivals as high end gyms and the likes of SoulCycle and Flywheel, which have both found cult-like followings for their high intensity cycling classes. It now has 2.4 times as many riders as SoulCycle, which pulled its own plans for an IPO, according to data from the analytics company Second Measure.

SoulCycle and its high-end gym operator owner, Equinox, were also recently hit by calls for a boycott because they are owned by Stephen Ross, the Donald Trump supporting property developer.

Peloton itself is locked in litigation after it used music in some of its beat-heavy fitness videos that music publishers allege were not properly licensed. When the company removed some of those classes from its catalogue, it encountered backlash from its riders.

It faces other companies encroaching on the fitness at home market. Mirror, for example, offers fitness classes beamed out of a mirror-like screen on your wall. It reached a $300m valuation in June. Zwift also offers a virtual cycling experience.

Paul Davies, head of leisure research at Mintel, has also warned that users outside of the US do not appear as keen on the company and roughly 98 per cent of Peloton s equipment sales have been in America.

 Awareness of Peloton is actually very, very low in the UK. There are a lot of people out there who probably aren t aware that you can pay for streamed workouts at home. I think part of this investment will be about boosting the brand,  he said.

John Foley, Peloton s founder who told the FT in a 2015 interview that it was  bone crushingly hard  to raise money ahead of its launch in 2014, wrote in the prospectus that Peloton  sells happiness .

But as the company identified in the risks to the business outlined in the S-1 filing, it will join a role call of lossmaking tech companies, including Uber, Lyft and Pinterest which could put investors off.

 We have incurred operating losses in the past, expect to incur operating losses in the future, and may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future,  it said.

But one source close to the company said that he did not think they would find it hard to attract investment.  To date they haven t struggled for investors,  they said.

The Securities and Exchange Commission is increasingly questioning public companies about compliance with U.S. sanctions as the nation's blacklist of individuals and entities grows.

The regulator has slowly ramped up comment letters to companies seeking more details about disclosures related to dealings in countries targeted by U.S. sanctions, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of regulatory filings and data compiled by consulting firm Audit Analytics Inc.

At least 42 companies received letters from the SEC last year regarding activity in areas subject to sanctions enforced by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control. That matches the 2017 total, which is up from an average of about 33 during the three years ending in 2016, according to Audit Analytics.

In recent months, the SEC has sent letters to companies such as PayPal Holdings Inc., Bank of New York Mellon Corp. and Chinese travel-services provider Ctrip.com International Ltd. with sanctions-related questions.

The SEC doesn't play an active role in penalizing companies for potential sanctions violations, but it does police companies' disclosures to ensure adequate reporting on business risks, said Scott Flicker, a partner at law firm Paul Hastings LLP in Washington, D.C.

"Companies make disclosures when they deem that information would be material for investment decisions, by current or potential investors," Mr. Flicker said. "Financial materiality is an important touchstone for disclosure, but it's not the only one."

The SEC regularly sends comment letters to companies with questions about disclosures made in securities filings. The letters usually focus on accounting practices, and can result in additional disclosures in future filings, revisions to previously filed disclosures, or a simple response with extra details that help the SEC better understand a disclosure. The back-and-forth between a company and the SEC stops once the regulator deems the matter resolved. The letters are typically made public about 20 days after a matter is resolved.

Sanctions-related letters comprise just a fraction of the SEC's comment letters, but the proportion of companies receiving them grew from 1.5% in 2014 to 4.5% in 2018, according to Audit Analytics. "They're interested in any possible violation of trade restrictions," said Don Whalen, the firm's director of research. "They probably want to make sure sanctions being placed on the countries are actually being honored."

The uptick coincides with "https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-sanctions-compliance-fines-hit-decade-high-11564057920", which have been used by the Trump administration to increase pressure on geopolitical issues or target suspected criminal behavior.

In 2018, almost 1,500 individuals or entities were added to the designation list, according to data compiled by Adam M. Smith, a partner at law firm Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP. That is more than twice the annual average over the previous 10 years.

BNY Mellon declined to comment on its SEC correspondence. Ctrip.com didn't respond to a request for comment.

PayPal, the San Jose, Calif.-based financial technology company, received a comment letter in July about its 2018 annual report, in which PayPal disclosed that it self-reported to OFAC suspicious transactions that might have violated U.S. sanctions.

The SEC asked PayPal to detail the countries related to the transactions and the extent of the company's contact with the countries. The regulator also asked PayPal to specify whether those contacts posed a material risk to investors. The correspondence was made public last week.

The SEC declined to comment beyond the letters.

The SEC said in its letters to PayPal that many investors, particularly institutional investors, have proposed divestments from companies that do business with U.S.-designated state sponsors of terrorism, and that PayPal should address the potential impact on the investor sentiment, including reputational harm.

Aaron Anderson, PayPal's chief accounting officer, responded to the SEC, writing that the transactions in question, which occurred between 2013 and 2016, were related to North Korea, Iran, Sudan and Syria countries that were under U.S. sanctions at the time of processing. He said in the letter that the revenue from the transactions and their volume were negligible to the company and that OFAC hasn't made a decision about whether it would treat the flagged transactions as potential violations, according to the response sent to the SEC by the company.

A Treasury Department spokeswoman declined to comment, saying the department doesn't speculate on possible sanctions violations or comment on possible or pending investigations.

"PayPal makes every effort to comply with laws and regulations in the markets where we do business around the world," a company spokesman said in an email for this article. "As exhibited by the company's track record of self-reporting and work to satisfy clarifying questions posed by the SEC, PayPal takes its regulatory and compliance obligations seriously."

The regulator and the company had a similar exchange in 2016 related to disclosures in PayPal's 2015 annual report, in which the company said it "https://www.wsj.com/articles/paypal-to-pay-7-7-million-to-u-s-over-alleged-sanctions-violations-1427312161" to OFAC in March 2015 to settle allegations that it processed transactions worth about $44,000 between 2009 and 2013 and had continued to cooperate with OFAC on additional self-reported transactions.

The SEC is looking closely at potential security risks, particularly those related to money-transfer and peer-to-peer payment businesses, said Moshe Katri, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. who follows PayPal.

"These are risks that come when you're processing billions of transactions," Mr. Katri said. "This is going to be a consistent pain point for all of these companies."

Canaan Partners Incubates, Leads $10 Million Seed Round for Fintech Startup Bond; The startup, led by former Twilio executive Roy Ng, will offer software to better integrate fintech providers with regional banks

Canaan Partners has led a $10 million seed investment in Bond Financial Technologies Inc., a prelaunch startup that the venture-capital firm began incubating earlier this year.

Bond is setting up a marketplace where companies seeking to offer new loans, debit cards and other financial products can find banks to act as official sponsors. It also has developed software that banks can use to manage and more easily access the data of their fintech clients.

It is rare for Canaan's technology-investment practice to incubate startups, according to Michael Gilroy, a partner at the firm who came up with the idea for Bond.

"For this stage it's absolutely a massive swing for us," Mr. Gilroy said.

Hedge-fund manager Coatue Management also invested in Bond, Mr. Gilroy said. Canaan had planned to write the full check but made room in the round for Coatue, he said. Coatue has been investing in late-stage private companies for years and recently set up a $700 million early-stage practice, The Information reported.

Mr. Gilroy recruited Roy Ng, previously president and chief operating officer of Mapbox Inc. and COO of Twilio Inc., as Bond's chief executive and co-founder. Bond's other co-founders are Matt Bradley, formerly vice president of machine learning at Synapse Financial Technologies Inc., and Yan Wu, who was head of data at Social Finance Inc., or SoFi.

Regulated regional banks in the U.S. have served as the backbone for many new fintech products, beginning with the wave of online lending a decade ago. But such partnerships have been cumbersome, Mr. Gilroy said.

In order for a startup to start offering deposit accounts, debit cards, loans and other financial products, it must work with a regulated bank.

For example, Bancorp Bank of Wilmington, Del., issues debit cards on behalf of mobile banking startup Chime, while Utah-based Celtic Bank issues loans for online lender Kabbage Inc.

Companies would use Bond's platform to send data about their fintech products and customers to partner banks. Banks would use Bond and the data it collects to qualify and sign up new fintech clients and to manage these relationships. Banks also could use Bond to pull information about its fintech clients for regulatory audits. Fintech companies, meanwhile, could use Bond to compare partner banks.

The need for better integration with banks is growing as companies in more industries, from ride-hailing to e-commerce and business software, seek to offer financial products or expand their suite of fintech services, Mr. Gilroy said.

Bond's services would compete to some degree with other venture-backed companies such as Cross River Bank, an FDIC-insured bank that focuses on working with fintech companies, and Synapse, which helps fintech companies launch various banking products.

Current solutions are lacking, Mr. Gilroy said, as another Canaan portfolio company found out. Accounting software startup ScaleFactor Inc., for example, has been trying to start lending to its customers, Mr. Gilroy said, because the company believes it can offer better loans based on the information it has about its customers. It has been working on a bank integration with Salt Lake City-based Celtic Bank.

"We went out and started engaging these banks 18 months ago, and we still don't have a product in the market yet," Mr. Gilroy said of ScaleFactor.

Bond is operating out of Canaan's San Francisco offices but is looking to move out shortly, Mr. Ng said. The company expects to have between 25 and 35 employees by the end of the year.

Mr. Ng said he hopes to have several banks on Bond's platform within a year. "I want to build a brand out there that not only banks and fintechs trust but also the regulators," he said.

Benjamin Lawsky, a former financial services superintendent for New York, is an adviser to Bond and has equity in the startup, Mr. Gilroy said.

The seed deal was the culmination of a long process, Mr. Gilroy said. "It's a lot more work than having a team come in and pitch you," Mr. Gilroy said about incubating a startup. On the upside, the firm holds a bigger stake in Bond than it would receive in a typical seed deal, he said.

Good day. At 500 Startups' Demo Day in San Francisco last week, startups in the accelerator's 25th batch showed off their offerings in areas such as fintech, education and e-commerce.

The companies hailed from 12 countries and included LucidAct Health, an AI assistant for nurses and case managers; Visionful, an AI-based service for real-time data on parking spots; and FitzyTV, an internet TV platform for recording streaming TV across multiple services. A relatively diverse group, 33% of this batch's startups were led by women and 40% of the founders identified as black or Latino/Latina.

Meanwhile, another enterprise startup is preparing to exit. Datadog Inc. revealed its IPO plans. The cloud monitoring startup, backed by Index Ventures, OpenView Venture Partners, Iconiq Capital and RTP Ventures, posted a healthy $198.1 million in revenue in 2018 and a net loss of just $10.76 million.

And now on to the news...

Index Ventures holds a 20% stake in Datadog, while OpenView Venture Partners owns 16%, Iconiq Capital controls 11% and RTP Ventures has an 8.2% stake. Amplify Partners and Contour Ventures earlier invested in the company, WSJ Pro previously reported.

AI in finance: Financial-services companies are embracing artificial intelligence. However, finance executives face challenges in deploying the technology, including potential government regulation, being able to explain how the technology makes a decision, and gaining an AI edge against competitors, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/reporters-notebook-financial-services-executives-offer-ai-lessons-11566552605?mod=djemVentureCapitalPro&tpl=vc". Financial-services executives, data scientists, vendors and others gathered in Midtown Manhattan for the Ai4 Finance conference to hear about the latest use cases and lessons from firms that have implemented AI systems.

Megvii Technology plans Hong Kong listing. China-based artificial intelligence company Megvii Technology Ltd. is planning an initial public offering, which will be the first such company to be listed on the Hong Kong bourse, if successful. Megvii, which counts Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Ant Financial and Lenovo Group Ltd. among its shareholders, has appointed Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan to manage the IPO, the company said in its draft prospectus filed to the Hong Kong stock exchange late Sunday.

The company counted Foundry Group, DFJ Growth, True Ventures, Khosla Ventures, Morgan Stanley and Walt Disney Co. among its investors.

Tech News

All the images above and in the story show products investigated by The Wall Street Journal.

Amazon has ceded control of its site. The result: thousands of banned, unsafe or mislabeled products. A Wall Street Journal investigation found 4,152 items for sale on Amazon.com Inc.'s site that have been declared unsafe by federal agencies, are deceptively labeled or are banned by federal regulators items that big-box retailers' policies would bar from their shelves.

YouTube channels are yanked for alleged disinformation campaigns in Hong Kong. Google pulled 210 YouTube channels from its platform, saying that they appeared to be part of a coordinated disinformation campaign in response to pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.

Google puts curbs on political debate by employees. Google issued new guidelines limiting employee discussion of politics and other topics not related to work, in a major shift for a company that has long prided itself on open debate and a freewheeling internal culture.

AI uses lots of energy. Training an artificial intelligence neural network can produce 17 times more carbon dioxide than an average American does in a year, and five times the lifetime emissions of the average car, according to researchers at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

Court freezes U.S. antitrust ruling against Qualcomm. A federal appeals court froze a ruling that Qualcomm Inc. had committed an array of antitrust violations, a boost for the chip maker that allows it to maintain its business practices for the time being.

Senior-housing company has high hopes for AI, other tech. Brookdale Senior Living Inc., one of the largest operators of senior housing in the U.S., is exploring the use of artificial intelligence, data analytics and voice assistants in improving care and quality of life for its residents.

U.S. companies on China: breaking up is hard. U.S. businesses say they cannot quickly upend their supply chains and stop doing business in China. Tech startups building hardware, many of which get crucial parts from China, are in a particularly difficult situation. "There is no other easily identifiable supplier or manufacturer for a lot of parts," said Eric Klein, a partner at venture-capital firm Lemnos.

Donald Trump said China was seeking talks for a trade deal on Monday, 24 hours after he appeared to suggest that he was having  second thoughts  about imposing further tariff increases.

 China called last night our top trade people and said,  let s get back to the table , so we ll be getting back to the table, and I think they want to do something,  he said on the margins of the G7 summit in the French coastal resort of Biarritz.

 I have great respect for the fact that China called   they want to make a deal. This is the first time I ve seen them where they really do want to make a deal, and I think that s a very positive step. 

The US president s apparent backtrack on Sunday prompted the White House to clarify that Mr Trump remains committed to the trade war, and his only regret was not raising levies higher.

The confusion added to global economic jitters. China s renminbi hit an 11-year low and markets dropped on Monday, after Wall Street fell sharply on Friday. But US stock futures erased their losses to trade higher following Mr Trump s comments, while European stocks opened moderately lower.

Mr Trump also announced the US and Japan reached a trade deal  in principle  on Sunday that would pave the way for more US farm exports while dropping the threat of increased tariffs on Japanese cars.

US companies are grappling with Mr Trump s order to find%20 an%20alternative ">find  an alternative  to doing business in China. But Republicans insist that Mr Trump s blunt-force trade posture will be an electoral asset in 2020. (FT, WSJ, Bloomberg)

Brussels to simplify budget rules

In what is set to be one of the most politically sensitive debates for the next European Commission, officials are planning a  substantial simplification  of the bloc s budget targets, which have come under fire for being impossible to enforce and overly flexible for governments that are in breach.

Viking curbs redemptions

Viking Global Investors, one of the largest US stock-picking hedge funds, will only allow allowed redemptions every two years, not annually, according to a letter reviewed by the FT, as hedge funds increasingly look to illiquid investments. Meanwhile, investment company JAB Holdings aims to raise as much as $8bn to extend its multiyear acquisition spree in the consumer sector. (FT)

Cities are saying  no  to 5G

The evidence suggests that if radio-frequency emissions have any effect on humans at all, it is on par with other  possibly carcinogenic  substances including coffee and pickles.

Shrinking cities

Global cities may be deeply plugged into the world economy, but that no longer guarantees population growth: Paris and New York are shrinking, while London is only sustained by births and international immigration.

Reconsidering Venus Williams

The elder Williams sister is ranked 52nd in the world. She last won a Grand Slam tournament 11 years ago. Sowhy does Venus Williams keep competing? In part, because her job has always been about more than winning: it was to change the game of tennis, and the place of women in sport. (NYT)

Index Ventures holds a 20% stake in Datadog, while OpenView Venture Partners owns 16%, Iconiq Capital controls 11% and RTP Ventures has an 8.2% stake. Amplify Partners and Contour Ventures "https://www.wsj.com/articles/DJFVW00120160112ec1cavucr" in the company, WSJ Pro previously reported.

In 2018, Datadog's net loss was $10.76 million, or 46 cents a share, compared with a loss of $2.57 million, or 13 cents a share, in the prior year as operating expenses more than doubled, according to the company's IPO prospectus. Revenue in 2018 was $198.1 million, up from $100.8 million in the previous year.

The company said it would list its shares on Nasdaq under the ticker symbol DDOG.

The New York company hasn't disclosed the number or price of shares to be sold. It said it intends to use proceeds to increase capitalization and financial flexibility, as well as for working capital, operating expenses, capital expenditures and potential acquisitions. The company said it doesn't intend to pay dividends.

Reporter's Notebook: Financial-Services Executives Offer AI Lessons; Takeaways from this week's Ai4 Finance conference in New York

Financial-services companies are embracing artificial intelligence, which International Data Corp. has called a game-changer for the industry.

However, finance executives face challenges in deploying the technology, including potential government regulation, being able to explain how the technology makes a decision, and gaining an AI edge against competitors.

Financial-services executives, data scientists, vendors and others gathered in Midtown Manhattan this week for the Ai4 Finance conference to hear about the latest use cases and lessons from firms that have implemented AI systems.

Among the key takeaways:

Watch for coming regulations. Wendy Callaghan, chief innovation legal officer and associate general counsel at American International Group Inc., said regulatory proposals and guidelines are emerging around AI that companies need to watch carefully. One piece of proposed legislation, the Algorithmic Accountability Act, calls for companies to conduct "impact assessments of highly sensitive automated decision systems." Ms. Callaghan said it's important for companies that might be affected by the law "start having the conversations around the internal governance that they'll need to provide explanations to regulators...that will then pave the way to be prepared for formal impact assessments, if that comes into play." She said another issue regulators are looking at is "human centricity," or keeping humans involved in some aspect of AI decision-making.

Deploy explainability tools. Chris Kovel, Morgan Stanley's head of wealth management analytics, intelligence and data technology, talked about the need for financial firms to be able to understand the factors driving algorithmic decisions, known as explainability. He said the company is using an open-source analysis tool called LIME to explain the recommendations made by an AI system dubbed Next Best Action, which guides its financial advisers on client engagement. Mr. Kovel said he's watching other explainability tools in the market. "[We've] got our eye on future models that we believe will have much more explainability." He also said he disagrees with the notion that AI will never be fully explainable. "Those aren't good answers for regulators. Those aren't good answers for our [financial advisers]. Those aren't good answers for our clients," he said.

Keep innovating. Richard Mathieson, a managing director at BlackRock Inc., which manages $6.84 trillion in total assets, said the company's quantitative trading unit gathers reams of data and analyzes them with natural language processing and machine learning to make investment decisions. He said the unit has learned a number of lessons since hiring its first data scientist roughly a decade ago. One is that innovation must be ongoing, and companies shouldn't rest on their laurels. "We place a huge amount of emphasis on research and innovation at the very, very heart of our investment process," he said. Still, no matter how much a company relies on technology, human expertise remains key, he added. Big data and machine learning are tools that can help answer investment questions, but human expertise and asking the right questions remains critical to developing new investment tools and assessing the results they produce.

Apple s big production numbers, EU to act on facial recognition, world s largest chip

FT subscribers can click here to receive tech news daily by email in the #techFT newsletter

Facebook risks being unfriended by its digital currencypartners, in the latest example of how regulatory pressures are intensifying for the social network.

Hannah Murphy and Shannon Bond in San Francisco reveal atleast three backers of its Libra project are privately discussing how to distance themselves from the venture.Two of the founding backers told the FT they were concerned about the regulatory spotlight and were considering cutting ties. Another backer said it wasworried about publicly supporting Libra for fear of attracting the attention of agencies who oversee itsown businesses. Lex says the 27 founders who plan to joinFacebook on Libra are right to have qualms.

On Wednesday, we reported Libra wasunder early scrutiny from the EU s antitrust regulators, according to two people familiar with the matter. The European Commission has sent out questionnaires to groups involved withLibra as part of a preliminary information-gathering operation, amid concerns the currency could unfairly disadvantage rivals. Meanwhile, the chairman of the US Federal Trade Commission told us Facebook s effort to integrate Instagram and WhatsApp more closely could stymie any attempt to break up the social media giant. Joseph Simons said all options were still on the table as the agency investigates Facebook for potential antitrust violations.

Separately, Richard Waters' Inside Business column argues this week that Facebook's planned Oversight Board, which would rule on whether Facebook applies its own content rules fairly, is doomed to failure. The social network has also launched a long-awaited privacy tool.  Off-Facebook activity will allow users to prevent third-party websites from passing on their data to the social network for targeted advertising, in a move that could dent its revenues.

The Internet of (Six) Things

1. EU set to offer protectionon facial recognition

As well as looking at the effects of Libra, Brussels is considering strict limits on facial recognition technology in an attempt to stamp out surveillance of European citizens. The European Commission is planning regulation that will give EU citizens explicit rights and limit  indiscriminate  use of facial recognition technology by companies and public authorities, senior officials told the FT. Brussels  initiative comes amid revelations about the use of the technology to monitor crowds in areas including London s King s Cross, which last week prompted an investigation from the UK s data protection watchdog.

2. Morning becomes expensive for Apple

Apple has committed more than $6bn for original shows and movies ahead of the launch of its new video streaming service, we revealed on Monday. The company has spent hundreds of millions of dollars alone on a star-studded series featuring Jennifer Aniston, Reese Witherspoon and Steve Carell called The Morning Show.

3. Physical stores fight Amazon with tech makeover

Bricks and mortar is building an alternative toAmazon, exposing its weakness in being a place to buy but not to have an experience. Stores are making better use of employees' downtime, getting them on iPads to chat with online shoppers as they use new tech services to remake retail. Elsewhere, mega-retailerWalmart has sued Tesla, alleging that its solar panels were responsible for fires at seven of its stores.

4. Deep Mind co-founder takes extended absence

Mustafa Suleyman, co-founder of UK-based artificial intelligence group DeepMind, has goneon extended leave. He had lost day-to-day responsibilities for its health unit, with Google shifting power to California, people close to the company told Madhumita Murgia.

5. Alibaba postpones HK listing

China's biggest ecommerce company has delayed its up to $15bnlisting in Hong Kong amid growing political unrest there, two people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.Alibaba held a board meeting before its latest quarterly earnings release last week, during which the board decided to postpone a listing that had been set to take place in late August, one of the people said.

6. World's biggest chipcreated to handle AI

While chip circuitry continues to get smaller, the slab of silicon, developed by Californian start-up Cerebras, has a surface area slightly larger than a standard iPad and is the only one cut from a 300mm circular silicon wafer, which is usually sliced intodozens. It's aimed at the market for computers helping to trainartificial intelligence networks.

Tech tools   Apple's forthcoming hardware

Apple is readying newhardware for the coming weeks and months, including  Pro iPhones, upgrades to iPadsand its largest laptop in years, according to Bloomberg. As well as three new iPhones to be unveiled at an event next month, also coming in 2019 will berefreshedversions of the iPad Pro with upgradedcameras and faster chips, an entry-level iPad with a larger screen, new versions of the Apple Watch, and the first revamp to the MacBook Pro laptop in three years, with a 16in-plus screen offered.

Start-up aims to help 1m people unlock secrets of genetic data

Technology

Color, a Silicon Valley health technology start-up whose backers include the venture capital company General Catalyst and Laurene Powell Jobs' Emerson Collective, has been hired to provide "genetic counselling" to potentially hundreds of thousands of Americans taking part in a US government research project.

The "All of Us" programme, launched last year by the National Institutes of Health, aims to collect data from 1m participants, looking for patterns in lifestyle, environment and biology that could explain the causes of disease and suggest new treatments.

Unlike some other big data programmes in healthcare, such as the UK Biobank, All of Us will enable people who provide their genetic data to learn what the researchers have discovered about their health.

The contract, worth up to $25m, allows Color to expand its remote counselling service to help participants and their families understand the secrets hidden in their genetic data and the healthcare options they have to tackle any increased likelihood of serious diseases.

Brad Ozenberger, the genomics programme director for the All of Us programme, said returning information to participants was one of its "core values".

"We've heard time and again that people are eager to get information back and learn more about themselves," he said. "We want to do right by all of our participants to get them the information they need and referrals for follow-up care, if appropriate." Investor interest in genetics start-ups has been piqued by the soaring sales of consumer genetic tests available on sites such as 23andMe and Ancestry, unearthing risks of serious disease or family secrets.

Color sells genetic testing packages including support for physicians and counselling to health systems, employers and research institutions. It was founded in 2013 by former Twitter executives Othman Laraki and Elad Gil, former cyber security engineer Nish Bhat and physician Taylor Sittler.

Mr Laraki, chief executive, said it was important to remember that genetic data held sensitive health information. He said the way the data had been used by "genetics hobbyists" had meant there were often not safeguards, including making counselling available so people could understand their results.

Color's five-year contract with the NIH begins with funding of $4.6m for the first year.

Since it opened in May 2018, All of Us has enrolled about 175,000 participants at a network of more than 340 recruitment sites across the US.

The programme, part of a broader government initiative in so-called precision health, aims to harvest data that includes information on 59 genes tied to risk of specific diseases for which there are established medical guidelines for treatment or prevention. Last week, the programme announced that more than 80 per cent of its participants so far were from groups that historically have been under-represented in biomedical research. The programme is working to connect them with care.

Groupon Finance Chief Leaves Amid Turnaround Efforts at Daily-Deals Company; Melissa Thomas will serve as interim CFO while the company conducts a search for a permanent replacement

Groupon Inc. is losing its chief financial officer in the midst of a turnaround effort aimed at leading the daily-deals company to sustainable growth.

The Chicago-based company, which connects consumers with local merchants by offering discounts on various goods, services and activities, said Thursday that CFO Michael Randolfi is resigning, effective Friday, to pursue another opportunity.

"The CFO was more than just a CFO," said Tom Forte, a senior research analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co. "His departure from the company is a significant loss."

Mr. Randolfi has been in the role since April 2016. His resignation comes amid attempts by Chief Executive Rich Williams to refocus the company once a fast-growing startup that expanded to hundreds of cities around the globe by targeting local commerce and higher-value customers.

Groupon"https://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2011/11/04/groupon-ipo-up-40-out-of-the-gate/" in 2011 and was once valued at $16.5 billion. Today, its market value is $1.42 billion, according to data provider FactSet.

At the end of July, the company reported falling profit and revenue for the second quarter due to fewer customers and lower traffic. Gross profit decreased to $292.1 million in the second quarter, down 9.7% from the prior-year quarter, while revenue fell 13.7% to $532.6 million.

"This is a fallen angel that still has a lot of bookings and revenue differentiating them from other internet darlings that shuttered," Mr. Forte said.

The company managed to reduce its quarterly loss to $40.2 million, lower than the $95 million loss it booked in the second quarter of 2018.

Groupon said it appointed Melissa Thomas as interim finance chief while it is searching for a successor. Ms. Thomas, who joined Groupon in 2017 as vice president of commercial finance, has served as chief accounting officer and treasurer since November 2018.

The company didn't immediately respond to a request for additional comment.

The new finance chief will be expected to help Mr. Williams on his mission to lead the company to better financial health and more visibility into its future revenue. A subscription model that was launched in the second quarter is supposed to help with that, Mr. Forte said. More visibility into Groupon's revenue could help the company's share price, as investors value being able to predict future income, Mr. Forte said.

Groupon's share price has fallen 22% since the beginning of the year. It was trading at $2.50, down 0.6%, in mid-day trading.

The company this month acquired a text and voice communications company that enables better communication between customers and merchants with the help of artificial intelligence, showing Groupon's attempts to improve customer service.

"The biggest challenge will be to maintain morale with a sluggish share price and to keep attracting talent," Mr. Forte said.

Good day. Y Combinator has always taught its companies how to build billion-dollar businesses, but for this year's batch of startups it also emphasized the mental health of its founders and how to make startups "a force for good" in the world, Chief Executive Michael Seibel said.

That included the first talk for this cohort given by two co-founders of Airbnb Inc., who discussed how to make their companies have a positive impact on the world.

In Silicon Valley, where "move fast and break things" has often been the mantra, these topics haven't been talked about as much in the past. But Y Combinator has an outsize impact on the Valley, so this emphasis could help change the focus of the industry, said one Y Combinator alumni-turned-investor at the firm's Demo Day event Tuesday.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Robot delivery wars: Starship Technologies Inc., a startup developing self-driving delivery robots, has raised $40 million to compete with some deep-pocketed technology companies that are ramping up development of similar technology, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/delivery-robot-startup-secures-40-million-11566306001".

* Starship will expand its service to roughly 100 university campuses over the next two years, Chief Executive Lex Bayer said. The startup currently offers meal delivery at roughly a dozen locations.

* Starship now has raised a total of $85 million, more than most of its privately held competitors, but it also faces technology giants such as Amazon.com Inc. and large food-delivery companies such as Postmates Inc.

Data-center market boom: Data centers are hot properties, even as many businesses are shedding them to shift their information-technology operations online, to the cloud, Angus Loten reports for the WSJ's CIO Journal. The warehouse-sized facilities that house racks of servers and other hardware can be costly and inefficient to manage. But some are being snapped up by data-center landlords, known as co-location service providers, which lease space in the facilities to cloud services offered tech companies. The rapid growth of cloud computing is heating up competition for new and used facilities and driving consolidation among data-center operators.

For YC Deals, Investors Keep Valuation Complaints to Themselves

Investors often complain that Y Combinator startups have high valuations relative to other similar startups. Still, those prices can vary widely, investors said at this year's Demo Day.

One Y Combinator startup was raising $1.5 million at a $10 million valuation, intending to grow slowly and not raise too much, the founder said. Another hot startup was raising $10 million at a $40 million valuation, according to two investors familiar with the deal.

A third startup that was very popular with investors was raising an uncapped note, according to two investors. That rare structure is a convertible note that has no price cap on its conversion to equity, meaning investors don't know the valuation at which they're investing.

Overwhelming investor demand makes Y Combinator startups command such high prices. Analysts at top venture firms run through the list of each batch of startups well before Demo Day, and firms pay top dollar to invest in advance, investors said.

NEW YORK An artificial-intelligence startup with a new influx of funding wants to make AI accessible to businesses that don't have data scientists on their teams.

"Our vision is to make every company an AI company," Sri Ambati, chief executive and founder of H2O.ai Inc., said Wednesday at the Ai4 Finance conference in Midtown Manhattan.

On Tuesday, the company said it raised $72.5 million in a round led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Ping An Global Voyager Fund, with continued investments from Wells Fargo & Co., Nvidia Corp. and Nexus Venture Partners.

H2O.ai, based in Mountain View, Calif., has raised a total of $147 million since it was founded in 2012.

The company sells software that helps businesses incorporate machine learning into their applications to make them more predictive. Its machine-learning platform is used by more than 18,000 companies, including Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., which uses it to price retail goods, and Capital One Financial Corp., which uses it to help detect fraud, Mr. Ambati said. The platform offers a set of tools that are designed to simplify AI for nonexperts, and can be used for a range of applications.

Walgreens and Capital One didn't respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.

Mr. Ambati, who often wears a driving cap, positions himself as a distinctive technologist who isn't afraid of mixing philosophy with business. In Wednesday's presentation, Mr. Ambati read a haiku and quoted T.S. Eliot and the ancient Chinese text "I Ching" to a room of about 250 listeners.

"The only renewable resource in the world is love, and love can break the barrier of time," he said, adding, "What is love really? It's about perfect comprehension. The more we learn about something, the closer we are to the truth."

In addition to founding H2O.ai, Mr. Ambati co-founded big-data analytics company Platfora Inc., which was "https://www.wsj.com/articles/workday-nabs-platfora-for-nearly-200m-1469232319".

H2O.ai licenses its products to companies and charges them based on the number of users. It has tripled its customers over the past year-and-a-half, Mr. Ambati said.

"Our mission is to create a diverse set of AI juggernauts," he said. "We want to empower a lot of entrepreneurs with AI."

Companies Bolster AI Governance Efforts; As AI use grows, businesses are adding new systems and executives to keep algorithms on the right track

Companies that use artificial intelligence are strengthening their standards for the technology, creating governance policies and hiring executives to make sure their algorithms meet ethical and regulatory requirements.

Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. and analytics software company Fair Isaac Co., creator of the widely used FICO credit score, are both rolling out in-house technology systems designed in part to track whether AI algorithms adhere to a set of standards. FICO is using blockchain for the project. And MassMutual recently named its first AI ethics and governance chief, responsible for implementing a new governance policy.

AI algorithms are becoming a core part of how companies function, used in automating repetitive tasks, improving customer service and more, said Jim Hare, research vice president for analytics and data science at Gartner Inc. But because algorithms can behave in unintended ways, he said, companies are trying to get a better grip on how they build and maintain them "to prevent AI gone wild."

"There's a risk aspect," Mr. Hare said. "If you deploy AI and it's intended to be used one way but gets used for whatever reason in the wrong way, or has unintended consequences, there's a brand reputation or even legal and financial risks in terms of exposure."

Companies building these systems may have industry-specific regulations such as fair-lending rules in finance that they want their algorithms to follow. They might also be anticipating "https://www.wsj.com/articles/cios-see-end-of-ai-gone-wild-in-congressional-hearings-11561586279", so they want detailed records on how their machine-learning models were developed and how they perform once deployed in the event an audit is needed.

The effort comes as corporate AI projects are on the rise. Gartner last month released a survey that found companies that were considered early AI adopters on average had four active AI projects, but respondents expected the number to double by next year and increase more than eightfold by 2022.

FICO and MassMutual both have dozens of data scientists producing scores of AI models annually. For example, FICO offers its banking clients machine-learning models that can determine if a credit-card transaction is likely to be fraudulent.

"When I'm building 200 or more models a year, I need consistency and I need to be able to review each and every model and call up how the model was built," said Scott Zoldi, FICO's chief analytics officer. "As practitioners, we need to make sure that they are understandable, that they make sense, that they're ethical and that they pass a level of review and scrutiny."

FICO, which has about 3,400 employees, has a 381-person data-science team that builds its AI tools.

For at least a decade, Mr. Zoldi said, the company has had AI compliance specialists who examine models for issues such as bias. But until recently, details about algorithms including who created them, what data they were trained with, release dates and performance metrics were recorded and managed through digital and paper documents.

To improve the process, FICO in February moved to a blockchain system. Best known as the record-keeping system behind cryptocurrencies, blockchain is a data structure that makes it possible to create and share a digital ledger of transactions among various parties. Data on blockchain is encrypted, unchangeable and always up-to-date for users.

For FICO, the blockchain system not only captures details of how algorithms were created, but also serves as a platform used to review and approve algorithms that meet its standards. For instance, the company requires that its models show the key relationships between variables driving its outcomes, such as those that lead it to approve or decline a credit-card transaction. Only those models that meet the transparency requirement can make it to client use.

MassMutual, which has 7,500 employees and roughly 50 data scientists, uses AI for various business cases, including models that help it determine insurance premiums by dividing applicants into risk classes.

Sears Merritt, its head of technology and data strategy and enterprise architecture, said MassMutual has some governance mechanisms in place, including systems that monitor algorithmic inputs and outcomes. But as the company continues to develop new AI products and services, he said it wants to make its standards more rigorous to meet or exceed possible future regulations.

To that end, Mr. Merritt said he and other executives last year drafted guidelines that touch on topics such as how the company's data are generated and how well its algorithms perform when making predictions or recommendations. MassMutual is developing a software system based on those guidelines that could include, for instance, setting limits on the false-positive rate for a predictive algorithm.

To oversee those efforts, the company in May tapped existing employee Kevin Fitzpatrick as its head of data and AI ethics and governance. He is expected to have a team of as many as 10 people by December, including a few AI ethics and governance consultants who will track how algorithms change over time and whether they adhere to governance policies.

In the future, Gartner's Mr. Hare expects large companies to increasingly hire "behavioral forensics" specialists whose duties include investigating AI systems that may have caused corporate or customer harm. He said the efforts by FICO and MassMutual are "really an early signal of something that's going to be much more transformative."

Computers and data scientists can unearth key themes missed by traditional research

Investment managers within the environmental, social and governance sector are looking to gain an edge by using artificial intelligence, a computer-driven discipline already employed by some of the world s most successful hedge funds.

Financiers say machines can go through vast reams of ESG data in a sector where information is often presented in incompatible ways because of the lack of reporting regulations.

 We know what data we need,  said Jennifer Wu, head of ESG investing at JPMorgan Asset Management, but  we are looking elsewhere to see where we can find it .

While some companies might not report on their carbon usage, for example, there are other ways to see what they are doing, Ms Wu said. By using AI to scrape for keywords in patent filings, JPMorgan can find companies that are linked to new low-carbon technology.

 If you think about textual data, nobody can read everything,  said Ravit Mandell, the chief data scientist at JPMorgan, who recently helped launch a so-called  Themebot  algorithm designed to identify relevant information from unstructured data.

Other companies are employing similar methods. By using a data science team, portfolio managers can access more granular information than is usually available from a third party, said Richard Nackenson, who runs a multi-cap fund at Neuberger Berman.

One example of how traditional analysis could miss key ESG themes can be seen in research into Ball Corporation, one of the largest manufacturers of aluminium cans in the US. Ball has scored poorly with ESG rating agencies because of its high energy usage, Mr Nackenson said. However, looking deeper into the company s ESG data and its products, Neuberger s data team saw an opportunity for future outperformance.

 Many people didn t recognise that over 75 per cent of the aluminium that has ever been produced is still in use today 	. 	. 	. 	In the long run it reduces energy consumption and pollution,  he said. Furthermore, consumer tastes and behaviour are changing as people become more aware of the environmental problems caused by plastics, and that is good news for a company like Ball, Mr Nackenson added.

Nevertheless, financiers warn there are still limits to what data science, and AI, can do.  By definition, since data is by its nature backward looking, so are the screens applied to it,  Lazard Asset Management pointed out in a recent research report.  If one assumes ESG data does imact stock prices, the implication is that historical data is already reflected in today s prices. 

When it comes to regulatory risk, AI may not be the most suitable tool for ESG analysis, added Sudhir Roc-Sennett, who is the head of thought leadership and ESG at the Vontobel Quality Growth fund.

 We look at large powerful companies which tend to be dominant players in their area,  he said.  [But] regulation can cause existential risk  	. 	. 	. 	and that s where the analysts have to talk to management and talk to competitors, lawmakers and lawyers. You need humans to search for red flags.

Juul raises $325m ahead of expansion drive

Tobacco

Juul Labs, the US ecigarette start-up, has raised $325m in fresh funding as it plans international expansion and faces growing scrutiny from politicians and regulators at home.

The cash was raised through a bridge financing structured as a convertible note, said three people familiar with the deal, a form of debt that start-ups sometimes use to raise money between equity sales. It adds to the billions of dollars Juul pulled in last year from private investors and Altria, the Marlboro maker, which paid $12.8bn for a 35 per cent stake in the company in December.

Tiger Global Management, which led an investment valuing the company at $15bn last July, participated in the new debt offering, one of the people familiar with the transaction said. The firm declined to comment.

Juul disclosed the fundraising yesterday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which said it had raised the money from four investors.

The ecigarette maker quickly rose last year to become one of the largest venture-backed US companies, worth more on paper than Airbnb, the home rental provider, and Palantir, the data analytics company. Altria valued the company at $38bn with its share purchase.

Extra cash could bolster Juul's efforts to sell its products outside of the US, where the company has been scrutinised for the uptake of its products among teenagers. This month it began selling an ecigarette in the UK that monitors vaping habits and requires users to undergo multiple age verification steps.

The authorities in San Francisco barred the sale of Juul and other e-cigarettes in June, becoming the first city to impose an outright ban to curb underage vaping. Juul, based in the city, has waged a lobbying campaign arguing that the ban will punish adult cigarette smokers trying to quit instead of preventing underage sales.

Ecigarette companies are expected to submit their products for Food and Drug Administration approval, which would allow them to be sold when the ban takes effect early next year.

Tech Executives Tap Employees for Ideas; Companies including Visa, UPS and Ernst & Young encourage rank-and-file workers to create new products or improve operations

Technology teams at large companies are moving beyond their traditional role in business support as their bosses encourage them to use their skills to develop marketable products and services.

The blurring of lines between IT and business groups reflects the fact that coding and the ability to analyze data are now central to product development. Tech teams at large corporations including credit-card giant Visa Inc. and logistics company United Parcel Service Inc. have developed new tools for employees and customers in the past few years.

Employees can get time, and sometimes money, to pursue projects that executives see as having strong market potential. Accounting firm Ernst & Young LLP this year gave a team of employees in Australia $100,000 to build a tool that uses automation to manage cybersecurity. It is currently being developed for client use.

"It's more important than ever for us to make sure the right ideas are bubbling up from people on the ground," said Jeff Wong, global chief innovation officer for Ernst & Young, which brands itself as EY.

Large organizations need to make an effort to adapt to change quickly, Mr. Wong said, where in the past, they could afford to wait to see how change affected the market.

At UPS, the rise of e-commerce and increasing global trade have spurred "unprecedented demand" for new ideas, said Juan Perez, the firm's chief information and engineering officer. Because employees understand customers, their ideas are helping UPS keep pace with competition and anticipate future needs, he said. "No matter what level you're in, we all have an obligation to keep thinking of ideas that make the business better," he added.

Mr. Perez encourages employees to come up with novel ideas and work with UPS's legal team to patent them. Six employees in Mr. Perez's IT group came up with a patented idea that was rolled out in 2017 called Preload Smart Scan.

The system uses Bluetooth-enabled electronic beacons in UPS delivery vehicles to notify workers if they have placed an item in the wrong vehicle, a problem that affects delivery timelines. The beacons send signals to scanners that read package labels, and the scanner notifies the employee if a package has been misloaded.

A patent developed by a UPS employee is owned by the company; Mr. Perez came up with 10 patents and has seven pending.

At Visa, all employees are allowed to spend 10% of their time pursuing new ideas that relate to the company's strategic objectives.

"Some of the most breakthrough innovations come from the front lines," said Rajat Taneja, the company's executive vice president of technology and operations, who helped spearhead the 10% program five years ago. Fostering a culture that enables significant innovation has never been more important, he added.

The company prides itself on letting employees test new ideas without a lot of bureaucracy, through hackathons and internal forums where employees can get real-time feedback.

Visa's employees have come up with 2,500 ideas to date, some of which have resulted in new capabilities for artificial intelligence, security and improving business processes, Mr. Taneja said.

One such idea resulted in a tool called Visa Transaction Controls, one of the most frequently used application-programming interfaces among Visa customers. APIs are pieces of software that enable apps, platforms and systems to connect with each other and share data.

The tool was developed by two employees in 2015. Visa customers, such as banks and small businesses, can integrate the tool into their apps to let cardholders set spending limits, receive transaction alerts and temporarily suspend accounts.

Homegrown innovation is particularly important for established companies, Mr. Taneja said. Being in a dominant position can lead to complacency. "If you aren't creating and incubating new ideas &someone else surely is," he said.

Peter Skyttegaard, senior research director at Gartner Inc., said innovation has been a popular topic of conversation among analysts and senior technology leaders in recent months. Older, more established enterprises are being forced to change more quickly because of increasing competition, he said: "Part of it is the fear of being disrupted."

Juvenescence Ltd., a British biotechnology business that is aiming to extend human life-spans, said it has secured $100 million in its latest fundraising, valuing the company at $500 million.

The company said that it is considering an initial public offering next year, most likely in the U.S.

In the Series B round, Juvenescence raised $10 million from Mike Cannon-Brookes, the founder of Atlassian Corp., through his investment company Grok Ventures. Another $10 million came from private investment company IPGL, owned by NEX Group founder Michael Spencer.

In the past year and a half, it has raised a total of $165 million.

Juvenescence invests in companies that research therapies to treat aging-related illnesses, with the aim of extending human longevity. Its largest investment to date is in AgeX Therapeutics Inc., a U.S. company that is working on using cell therapies to help regenerate human tissue. The next-biggest investment is in FoxBio, a joint-venture that is developing compounds to target the biological mechanisms behind aging.

Jim Mellon, chairman of Juvenescence, said that with this latest financing round Juvenescence raised more money than any comparable company.

"As the science of longevity becomes mainstream, we expect significant investor interest and at some point, we anticipate taking Juvenescence public to further accelerate our development," he said.

Proceeds of the round will be allocated to research, including using machine-learning to discover existing drugs that could be repurposed to extend life-spans, as well as into molecular and cell-therapy development.

Buyout group's interest in auditor coincides with pressure on Big Four

Permira is in advanced talks to buy a minority stake in Cogital in a deal that would value the challenger accountants firm at about 1bn, and comes as pressure builds on the Big Four to break up. The London buyout group's offer surpassed interest from rivals including BC Partners and PAI in Europe and TA Associates and Hellman & Friedman in the US, said people familiar with the auction.

Hg, Cogital's buyout group owner, is to keep a "significant" position in the company, said people briefed on the deal. A formal announcement could come this week, they said, but people following the process said the timing could slip and a deal was not guaranteed.

Groups involved in the auction, and Cogital, declined to comment.

Founded in 2016 from the merger of Nordic-based Azets and UK-based Baldwins and Blick Rothenberg, Cogital is led by John Connolly, former Deloitte UK chief executive.

The accountancy group's revenues exceeded 500m last year, as it posted 68m in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation.

The UK group has net debt of 343m, according to figures seen by the Financial Times. The majority of its business is from the Nordic region and the UK.

Cogital, which was set up as an alternative to the big accountancy firms, makes use of so-called smart technology and artificial intelligence to service its clients and self-service tools to help its customers process reports and invoices.

The accountancy group has more than 6,500 employees in eight countries and has corporate customers in 60 countries. Cogital has recently expanded partly as a result of the acquisition of smaller accountants, among them Wilkins Kennedy, a rival firm, in 2018.

The Cogital sale comes at a time when the big accountancy companies are facing the prospect of legislation that could force them to split up their UK businesses.

KPMG, PwC, EY and Deloitte the Big Four are facing pressure from politicians and regulators over worries about the quality of their audit work following a series of corporate failures and scandals involving groups such as Carillion, the outsourcer, and Patisserie Valerie, the caf chain.

Permira bought Duff & Phelps, a professional services group that competes with large accountancy firms, for $1.75bn in 2017.

Private equity's interest in Cogital has led to speculation that private equity groups could step up their interest in the sector.

Last year, several buyout groups approached KPMG about a proposed takeover of its UK restructuring business, but were rejected.

Technology
Tech Giants Flock to Toronto

TORONTO -- Silicon Valley is invading Toronto.

Intel Corp. has announced plans to build a graphics-chip design lab in Canada's largest city. Car-hailing service Uber Technologies Inc. will be opening an engineering hub. Google's parent, Alphabet Inc., proposed building a new Toronto campus as part of a sensor-laden "smart city" on the Lake Ontario waterfront, and Microsoft Corp. said it would expand its Canadian workforce by more than 20%.

There has been so much activity that Silicon Valley Bank, the Santa Clara, Calif., financier for some of the world's largest venture-capital firms and startups, opened an office here in March after 19 years of handling Canadian business from Seattle and Boston.

"There's a hell of a lot more going on up here than we appreciated," said Win Bear, head of business development for Silicon Valley Bank's Canada operation.

Technology companies are hiring more workers in Toronto, attracted by the region's diverse population of 6.4 million, a deep pool of skilled labor and cultural similarities to major U.S. cities such as San Francisco, New York and Chicago.

Many Canadians are wary of the influx. Some worry about the invasion of Big Tech, while others say U.S. businesses are crowding out domestic companies and siphoning some of the country's most valuable intellectual assets.

"We are squandering our future," said Jim Balsillie, former co-chief executive of BlackBerry Ltd., whose smartphones were once ubiquitous. Canada isn't benefiting from recent innovations local researchers have made in artificial intelligence, voice and image recognition and self-driving automobiles because they are employed by foreign companies that own the intellectual property, he said.

Patent lawyer Jim Hinton said foreign companies own about 70% of the roughly 1,600 AI and machine-learning patents filed by Canadians at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office since 2015.

Those concerns haven't stopped Canada's top officials from inviting big U.S. companies north. Last year, Justin Trudeau became the first Canadian prime minister to visit San Francisco in more than 70 years. During his visit, Salesforce.com Inc. said it would invest $2 billion in Canada over the next five years. It isn't clear how much of that sum Salesforce has invested already, and company representatives didn't respond to requests for comment.

AppDirect, a company that develops online stores for business-software applications, committed to hiring 300 people as part of a Canadian expansion. A spokeswoman said it is on track to hire at least 60 people in Canada since Mr. Trudeau's visit and expects to accelerate that pace in the coming years.

Those investments helped boost foreign investment in Canada's information and communications technology industries by 21% between 2017 and 2018, compared with a 3% decline a year earlier, according to Statistics Canada.

Privacy concerns are worrying some Canadians. A proposal by Google affiliate Sidewalk Labs to build a city "from the internet up" on Toronto's waterfront has become a flashpoint for critics concerned about how the company would handle data collected by sensors throughout the planned neighborhood.

Resident Julie Beddoes supports a volunteer-led group that is opposing the Sidewalk project. She also said that companies like Google are following a pattern that is familiar in Canada, where large U.S. companies come north and push out smaller, domestic firms. "I'm concerned the big bulldozing megacorporations coming in will make it harder for our younger people to start their own companies," she said.

Sabrina Geremia, head of Google's Canadian business operations, said the company employs more than 400 people in Toronto and roughly 1,200 in Canada, serving as an anchor tenant that attracts engineers and developers to the city. Many of those arrivals help expand the broader tech community by joining other companies or launching their own, she said.

A Cheap Pay Scale

Helps City's Profile

Toronto, North America's fourth-largest city, is cheaper than several large U.S. cities: Its computer engineers and programmers earn salaries that are on average $71,000 a year lower than their counterparts in San Francisco, according to recruiting platform Hired Inc.

By hiring in Toronto, companies can get around the Trump administration's tough immigration rules that have made it more difficult to hire foreign workers in the U.S.

Toronto is also benefiting from Canada's fast-track visa program and a universal health-care system that lowers companies' costs of providing employee benefits.

Those attributes helped propel the city to the final round of Amazon.com Inc.'s search for a second headquarters, the only non-U.S. city to make the cut. Though Toronto lost the bid, Amazon still opened a 113,000-square-foot office in the downtown core in December and said it would hire 600 new employees.

The links between San Francisco and Toronto have grown so tight that airlines added 139 flights between the cities in the past two years, according to travel data provider OAG.

SoftBank Bets on Loans for Fund

By Liz Hoffman and Bradley Hope

SoftBank Group is leaning on its employees, including Chief Executive Masayoshi Son, for cash as the firm rushes to raise an ambitious technology fund amid volatile markets.

The Japanese company plans to lend up to $20 billion to its employees to buy stakes in its second giant venture-capital fund, people familiar with the matter said. Mr. Son may account for as much as $15 billion of that amount, some of the people said.

It is an unusual setup that would doubly expose SoftBank to a startup economy that is starting to show cracks.

The window for initial public offerings, which appeared wide open early this year, may be closing as markets tumble and public investors grow weary of unprofitable startups.

At $20 billion, the employee pool would represent nearly a fifth of the money that SoftBank said in July it had lined up for its second Vision Fund, a successor to a $100 billion fund that launched in 2017 and is nearly spent.

Adding in its own contribution to the second fund of $38 billion, SoftBank could make up more than half of the money raised, far more than is typical for a fund sponsor.

A Vision Fund spokesman declined to comment.

SoftBank controls Sprint Corp. and other telecommunications companies. It launched its first fund with $60 billion in backing from government investment funds from Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi and quickly roiled the tech market by making huge investments in Uber Technologies Inc., WeWork, Chinese ride-hailing company Didi Chuxing Technology Co. and other companies, helping to drive up their valuations. The funds are supposed to tap the vision of Mr. Son, who has made huge profit on tech investments, and the new effort is expected to be focused on artificial intelligence.

SoftBank said it has $108 billion from investors including Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., the government of Kazakhstan and half a dozen banks.

Those commitments aren't binding and are being completed during a tumultuous stretch for startups, including some of the Vision Fund's largest investments.

Shares of Uber have fallen 30% since the company went public in May. The stock now trades below the roughly $35 level that SoftBank paid to acquire its stake, people familiar with the matter said.

WeWork, another big Vision Fund investment, filed last week to go public, disclosing losses that are enormous and growing fast, even by Silicon Valley standards.

The company will likely need large sums of cash for years as it builds out offices. This could affect WeWork's most recent $47 billion valuation, which one analyst called "very hard to swallow" in light of the company's huge losses.

Most investment funds simply give their employees a share of the profit as part of their compensation. Investors like to see such skin in the game.

But SoftBank is instead lending to staff -- it has about 400 employees -- to buy those stakes, charging around 5% interest and in most cases requiring little money down, said people familiar with the arrangement, which is likely to be completed in the coming weeks.

It did the same thing for the first fund, which now includes about $8 billion of employee money, those people said. The lending adds leverage to the Vision Fund's already risky investments and, if the fund struggles, would put SoftBank in an awkward position trying to collect from some of its most senior executives and could ultimately lose money.

Much of Mr. Son's wealth is tied up in his shares of SoftBank itself, which he could be forced to sell to repay the loans.

For that reason, loans to top executives must typically be explained to shareholders. The stakes also could be considered compensation, which companies must disclose annually for executives at the level of Mr. Son and Vision Fund CEO Rajeev Misra.

SoftBank executives believe the loans will better align its managers' interests with those of Vision Fund investors because the fund investments can be canceled if someone departs or is found to have done a reckless deal, people familiar with their thinking said.

Other investors in the fund include the government fund of Kazakhstan, which is likely to contribute about $3 billion, people familiar with the matter said.

Banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Standard Chartered PLC and Japan's Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. have signaled they are willing to invest several hundred million dollars apiece, which bankers view as a way to get hired on deals and IPOs for Vision Fund's roughly 75 portfolio companies.

SoftBank is negotiating with several pensions and insurers, including in Taiwan, for combined investments it hopes will exceed $30 billion, some of the people said. Taiwan's insurers are searching for higher-yielding investments to help them close the gap between promised payouts for older policies and returns they are getting on investments now.

But large-scale investments could be a stretch for them because Taiwanese regulations only allow them to put a fraction of their assets into riskier investments like venture capital.

Delta Sues Chatbot Provider Over 2017 Breach

By Catherine Stupp

Delta Air Lines Inc. is suing an artificial-intelligence company that powered a chatbot on the carrier's website, accusing it of lax cybersecurity that caused a 2017 data breach. The unusual lawsuit highlights the sensitive relations between companies that have been hacked and their business partners.

Companies rarely sue technology providers over data breaches because their contracts generally specify the level of third-party suppliers' liability and because the two partner firms typically end up settling out of court, cybersecurity lawyers said.

Delta's lawsuit, filed last week in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, alleges that chatbot provider [24]7.ai Inc. lacked basic cybersecurity safeguards while running the AI-powered service on Delta's website in 2017 and 2018. The suit also says [24]7 waited more than five months to inform the airline of the breach instead of telling it immediately, and did so using LinkedIn instead of official channels potentially violating the companies' contract. It couldn't be learned whether the contract between Delta and the chatbot provider had any unusual clauses.

William Bose, [24]7's senior vice president and acting general counsel, said the chatbot company intends to defend itself vigorously.

"This has been an ongoing issue between the companies and nothing new has arisen, except that Delta has chosen to litigate this matter," he said in an email through a spokesman. They declined to address specific allegations.

Delta and a lawyer representing the airline declined to comment.

The airline disclosed the incident last year and said credit-card details and other personal information from up to 825,000 customers were exposed.

Delta is seeking reimbursement from [24]7 for all costs related to the breach, totaling millions of dollars, according to the suit. The airline hasn't disclosed expenses from the incident in its financial filings.

Hackers Allegedly Modified Source Code

Privately held [24]7, founded in 2000 and based in San Jose, Calif., uses artificial intelligence to create customer-assistance products such as chatbots, consumer analytics programs and digital advertising services, according to its website.

The bot on Delta's website allowed customers to get information about purchasing tickets, changing itineraries and other requests, the lawsuit said. Hackers accessed [24]7's systems and modified source code, letting them scrape Delta customers' personal data and payment-card details from the airline's website, according to the suit.

The airline accuses 24[7] of failing to implement basic security controls such as requiring multifactor authentication for employees accessing source code and forbidding staff members from using the same login credentials, according to the complaint. Hackers modified the chatbot's source code using compromised credentials, then monitored activity on Delta's website and captured data that visitors entered there.

The breach wouldn't have happened if [24]7 had implemented "even basic access restrictions," the lawsuit said.

Companies' relationships with technology providers can come under scrutiny after a data breach. As Capital One Financial Corp. announced a breach in late July, it specified the problem wasn't caused by any security flaw in the cloud technology it uses. The bank has moved significant bank operations to Amazon.com Inc.'s cloud services over the past several years.

Delta's filing of the lawsuit nearly two years after hackers accessed customer data suggests that negotiations with [24]7 collapsed, lawyers said.

"You can't just come out with both barrels pointed because in the immediate aftermath of a security incident, everybody is trying to figure out what happened," said Linn Freedman, a partner at law firm Robinson & Cole LLP.

Some contracts state that technology suppliers must implement strong cybersecurity measures and have unlimited liability for breaches, said Ieuan Jolly, co-chair of the privacy, security and data innovations practice at law firm Loeb & Loeb LLP.

"When you have a large, sophisticated customer like Delta negotiating with a smaller vendor, the smaller vendor doesn't have much leverage to push back on these fairly stringent contractual security obligations," he said.

Requiring Immediate Notification

Delta said [24]7 violated contract provisions requiring it use adequate security measures, including encryption, to protect customer data.

New laws such as the European Union's 2018 General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act, which takes effect next year, increase pressure on companies to secure data. As a result, companies now seek higher limits on their technology providers' liability, Mr. Jolly said. Before the GDPR went into effect in May 2018, Mr. Jolly said he renegotiated around 100 contracts to increase the cap on technology suppliers' liability.

Delta alleges that [24]7's Mr. Bose already knew about the breach when he signed a document in February 2018 stating that the technology company would comply with the GDPR and would immediately inform Delta about data breaches.

Big Number

4.1 Billion

Estimated number of records breached in incidents reported in the first half of the year, according to research firm RiskBased Security.

More Cyber News

A website belonging to the European Central Bank shuts down after hack. The European Central Bank shut down a site that financial firms use to produce reports after hackers compromised subscriber data, Claims Journal reports. Attackers also injected malware onto the server to aid in phishing activities, according to the ECB, which is notifying affected individuals.

Instagram users have new tools to signal fake posts. Facebook Inc.'s photo site, in an effort to stem the spread of disinformation, created the capability for Instagram users to report possibly inaccurate content, Reuters reports.

U.S. Army's cyber program is hampered by talent shortage. The Government Accountability Office says trouble finding and retaining cybersecurity personnel is holding back plans to expand cyber warfare capabilities, FedScoop reports. The Army is increasing compensation to address its most acute shortage at the senior enlisted level. Several cyber units formed in recent months have few positions filled, including one with 30 individuals of 171 positions allocated.

Capital One cyber staff raised concerns before hack. Before a giant data breach at Capital One Financial Corp., employees raised concernswithin the company about what they saw as high turnover in its cybersecurity unit and a failure to promptly install some software to help spot and defend against hacks, according to people familiar with the matter.

Good day. A number of startups provide artificial intelligence-based tools to medical professionals and researchers, but fewer focus on giving individual consumers access to AI in making decisions related to their health.

Buoy Health Inc., which "https://www.wsj.com/articles/buoy-health-gets-15-million-for-digital-triage-technology-11565905851" in its Series B round, says its AI-based service can help consumers decide whether a trip to the emergency room is warranted. By inputting their symptoms onto the company's website, consumers, health plan members and employees of self-insured companies can gain insight into the type of care they need helping them decide, for example, if their abdominal pain is a cause for concern or likely just constipation.

Boston-based Buoy's focus on consumers, health insurers and self-insured employers distinguishes it from several other startups that instead provide AI tools to health-care professionals. These include HealthReveal Inc., backed by Flare Capital Partners and others, which uses AI to help physicians provide optimal care, and Emedgene Inc., which raised a $6 million led by Olive Tree Ventures earlier this year to ramp up sales of AI-based software that automates genetic interpretation, so geneticists don't miss vital bits of information revealed in a genetic test.

And now on to the news...

In the News

Autonomous trucking partnership: United Parcel Service Inc.'s venture-capital division, UPS Ventures, has acquired a minority stake in self-driving trucking startup TuSimple Inc., signaling the delivery company's continued push into autonomous driving, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/ups-ventures-invests-in-self-driving-trucking-startup-11565874002".

* UPS also will expand a partnership it began with TuSimple earlier in March for the startup to carry truckloads of goods between Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz., according to UPS Ventures Managing Partner Todd Lewis.

* The two companies are looking to add more routes to run self-driving tests in the Western U.S., said Chuck Price, chief product officer of TuSimple.

* Mr. Lewis said the collaboration with TuSimple is intended to help UPS figure out how it could implement fully autonomous trucks in its freight network.

About those losses: As WeWork heads toward an initial public offering, the office-space company faces a fundamental problem: Its losses are growing as fast as its revenue, the WSJ's Eliot Brown and Heather Somerville report.

WeWork's parent company, We Cos., whose main business is renting and remodeling offices to sublease to other companies, revealed in its IPO filing operating losses that ballooned 102% to $1.37 billion for the first six months of the year compared with a year earlier. This suggests the nine-year-old company isn't wringing out enough cost savings as it gets bigger. The lack of scaling is a potentially troubling sign for a company that has commanded a valuation more akin to a tech company than a real-estate firm.

Shasta Exits: Shasta Ventures will lose its second managing director this summer with the "https://www.wsj.com/articles/shasta-ventures-managing-director-nikhil-basu-trivedi-is-leaving-11565909715". Mr. Trivedi, who focused on consumer deals, is leaving soon after the exit of Doug Pepper, who focused on software deals. Menlo Park, Calif.-based Shasta is in the middle of raising money for its next fund, which is likely to shrink and focus on enterprise software, people familiar with its plans said.

Vegan Supply Chain: Motif FoodWorks Inc. hopes it can become a valuable partner to vegan-food producers by supplying the ingredients they need, "https://www.wsj.com/articles/motif-foodworks-raises-27-5-million-11565913599". Launched earlier this year out of synthetic-biology startup Ginkgo Bioworks Inc., Motif said it raised $27.5 million in a funding round led by General Atlantic. Motif aims to wedge its way into the sector by handling some of the most time-consuming and expensive parts of the food-development process.

Indoor farming's promise: Jonathan Webb's vision is to turn economically distressed eastern Kentucky into a high-tech agriculture capital of the country. He has no prior experience in farming, but he has managed to attract $97 million in project financing and a list of noteworthy partners for his startup, AppHarvest. Ultimately, he plans to spend $1 billion to $2 billion on greenhouses even if it takes a decade or two, the WSJ's Leigh Kamping-Carder reports.

Exits

Cloudflare Inc. disclosed paperwork for a planned initial public offering. The San Francisco-based cybersecurity company said it blocks 44 billion cyber threats from 20 million internet properties a day. In 2018, the company reported a loss of $87.2 million on revenue of $192.7 million, compared with a $10.7 million loss on revenue of $134.9 million the year before. New Enterprise Associates owns 20% of Cloudflare's shares, while Pelion Ventures, Venrock and Fidelity Management & Research hold smaller stakes. Cloudflare plans to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "NET." Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan are among the offering's underwriters.

VC Funds

Pear Ventures seeks to raise up to $155 million for its third main fund, according to a regulatory filing. No commitments have been received for the fund, Pear Ventures III LP, the filing indicates. Based in Palo Alto, Calif., Pear changed its name from Pejman Mar Ventures in 2016 when it announced a $75 million second fund. The firm makes early-stage investments from the pre-seed through Series A stages, according to its website. Active portfolio companies include on-demand delivery business DoorDash Inc. and mobile software development startup Branch Metrics Inc. Pear also was an investor in Guardant Health Inc., which went public in October 2018.

WeWork bond prices surge on buyback hopes. WeWork's debt is surging following the company's S-1 filing for a proposed IPO, as investors bet the company could retire bonds before they mature in 2025.

Hackers subvert security checks like the browser padlock. Recent attacks have shown that cybercriminals have co-opted techniques and toolsthat people commonly use to distinguish real communications and websites from fake ones, such as the padlock in a browser window.

Federal prosecutors accuse Capital One hacker of hitting dozens more targets. The woman charged with hacking into millions of Capital One Financial Corp. records hit more than 30 other targets, federal prosecutors said, significantly expanding the scale of what was already considered one of the largest heists of data stored in the cloud.

Advertiser Blacklists Hobble Publishers --- 'Bomb' and 'Trump' are among the words marketers insist not appear near ads online

Like many advertisers, Fidelity Investments wants to avoid advertising online near controversial content. As a result, the Boston-based financial-services company has a lengthy blacklist of words it considers off-limits.

If one of those words is in an article's headline, Fidelity won't place an ad there. Its list earlier this year, reviewed by The Wall Street Journal, contained more than 400 words, including "bomb," "immigration" and "racism." Also off-limits: "Trump."

Some news organizations have had difficulty placing Fidelity's ads on their sites, ad-sales executives said, because the list is so exhaustive and the terms appear in many news articles.

Big advertisers have been burned several times in recent years when their digital ads appeared next to offensive content, including fabricated news articles, hateful or racist videos on YouTube and pornographic material.

Such miscues happen, in part, because of the complexities of online ad-buying, where brands generally target certain kinds of audiences rather than specific sites or types of content. It has become clear to advertisers that one way to protect themselves is to stipulate types of web content they want to avoid, and ensure their partners -- digital ad brokers and publishers -- honor those wishes.

"Political stories are, regardless of party affiliation, not relevant to our brand," a Fidelity spokesman said in a written statement. The company also avoids several other topics that it says don't align with published content about business and finance.

Marketers have used blacklists for years to sidestep controversy. Airlines avoided articles dealing with airline crashes. Now those blacklists are becoming more sophisticated, specific and extensive, ad executives said.

Online news publishers are feeling the impact, from smaller outlets to large players such as CNN.com, USA Today-owner Gannett Co., the Washington Post and the Journal, according to news and ad executives.

The ad blacklisting threatens to hit publications' revenue and is creating incentives to produce more lifestyle-oriented coverage that is less controversial than hard news. Some new organizations are investing in technologies meant to gauge the way news stories make readers feel in the hopes of convincing advertisers there are options for ad placement other than blacklisting.

Consumer-products company Colgate-Palmolive Co., sandwich chain Subway and fast-food giant McDonald's Corp. are among the many companies blocking digital ad placements in hard news to various degrees, according to people familiar with those companies' strategies.

Some companies are creating keyword blacklists so detailed as to make almost all political or hard-news stories off-limits for their ads. "It is de facto news blocking," said Megan Pagliuca, chief data officer at Hearts & Science, an ad-buying firm owned by Omnicom Group Inc.

The use of lengthy keyword lists "is going to force publishers to do lifestyle content and focus on that at the expense of investigative journalism or serious journalism," said Nick Hewat, commercial director for Guardian News & Media, publisher of U.K.'s Guardian. "That is a long-term consequence of this sort of buying behavior." The Guardian has had some advertisers block words such as "Brexit," he said.

During the second quarter of this year, 177 advertisers that worked with ad measurement firm DoubleVerify Inc. blocked their ads from appearing on news or political content online, up 33% from the year-earlier period and more than double the 2017 total, the company said.

Integral Ad Science Inc., a firm that ensures ads run in content deemed safe for advertisers, said that of the 2,637 advertisers running campaigns with it in June, 1,085 brands blocked the word "shooting," 314 blocked "ISIS" and 207 blocked "Russia." Almost 560 advertisers blocked "Trump," while 83 blocked "Obama."

The average number of keywords the company's advertisers were blocking in the first quarter was 261. One advertiser blocked 1,553 words, it said.

The polarized political environment in the U.S. has put brands on heightened alert. Marketers are mindful of the backlash they can face on social media when customers feel they advertised alongside offensive content. One Twitter account, Sleeping Giants, publicized hundreds of brands that appeared on the right-wing news site Breitbart News Network following the 2016 presidential election, prompting widespread blacklisting of the site by advertisers.

Colgate-Palmolive is blocking online ad placements in news stories, according to people with knowledge of its ad strategy. "In general, our media buying goals are to advertise where people are most likely to be receptive to what we have to say," a Colgate spokesman said. The company said it looks for "opportunities more likely to fit with the brand's positive, optimistic message."

Subway said it has blacklisted 70,000 websites, including most hard-news outlets. The company wants to align with "positivity and the moments when our guests will be most likely to consider getting Subway," said Melissa Sutton, Subway's director of media services.

McDonald's currently is blocking hard news from its automated ad purchases in the U.S., according to a person familiar with its ad buying. "The first time your brand is damaged, it's not easily fixed," said Bob Rupczynski, senior vice president of marketing technology at McDonald's, during a recent ad conference in Cannes, France.

Hotel company Marriott International Inc. avoids buying digital ads near opinion or commentary news, according to a person familiar with its approach.

Alphabet Inc.'s Google has a long keyword blacklist for advertising its own products, which contains more than 500 words and phrases, including "privacy," "federal investigation," "antitrust," "racism," "FBI," "taxes," "anti-Semitic," "gun control" and "drought," according to a copy reviewed by the Journal. The list has made it difficult for at least one news publisher to place Google ads on its site, a person familiar with the matter said.

Blacklisting is cutting into the revenue of some online news publishers, even though they sometimes can replace blocked ads.

The audiences of many online publishers grew after President Trump launched his campaign -- the "Trump bump." At the same time, "they are losing revenue because some clients are using extensive keyword exclusion lists," said John Montgomery, executive vice president of global brand safety at GroupM, one of the world's largest ad-buying firms.

It is worrisome for the news business, a sector already taking a hit as advertising spending shifts to online ad giants Facebook Inc. and Google. Spending on newspaper print ads in the U.S. has fallen 32% over the past five years, according to estimates from Zenith, an ad-buying company owned by Publicis Groupe SA.

CNN.com, which is owned by AT&T Inc., said it deals with some advertisers whose blacklists exceed 1,000 words. Among the words advertisers most often wanted to avoid on CNN.com during the first half of the year were "shooting," "Mueller," "Michael Cohen" and "crash." The most-blocked term during the time period was "Trump," which was blocked 636,636 times, CNN said.

Some digital publishers said the push for brand safety amounts to indirect censorship. Vice Media told advertisers at a presentation in May that it will no longer allow brands to block 25 words, including "bisexual," "gay," "HIV," "lesbian," "Latino," "Middle Eastern," "Jewish" and "Islamic."

"Bias should not be the collateral damage of our much-needed brand-safety efforts," said Cavel Khan, senior vice president of client partnerships for North America at the Brooklyn-based media company, at the event.

Marketers became more aggressive about protecting their brands online after a 2017 article by the Times of London that carried the headline: "Big brands fund terror through online adverts." The article reported that ads from well-known brands were appearing on YouTube channels promoting hate speech or terrorism.

In the ensuing months, similar ad-placement problems plagued YouTube and other advertising platforms such as Facebook. Advertisers began taking a more cautious approach to digital advertising, enlisting the help of firms specializing in "brand safety," ad buyers said.

"What turned out to be a reaction to protect a brand from unsafe things that are mostly user generated content," on sites such as YouTube, ended up hurting media companies focused on producing real journalism, said Christine Cook, senior vice president and chief revenue officer of CNN's digital operations.

In automated ad buying, brands aim their ads not at specific websites, but at audiences with certain characteristics -- people with certain shopping or web browsing histories, for example. Their ads are matched in real time to available inventory in online ad marketplaces that can come from thousands of websites. That is why brands sometimes are surprised to find their ads on websites they wouldn't have chosen.

Ad-tech firms specializing in brand safety offer advertisers multiple ways to control their ad placements. Advertisers can block entire categories -- "politics" or "violence," say -- using classifications set up by brand-safety firms. They can avoid certain keywords that appear in an article or headline. And they can establish a blacklist of sites to avoid or a white-list of sites they deem safe.

Brand safety has become a big business on Madison Avenue. Some agencies have hired teams of people to monitor digital ad placements, and some marketers have hired brand-safety officers.

Ad-technology firm OpenSlate said so many companies have asked for help avoiding news and political content on YouTube that it developed an algorithm last year to identify channels focusing those areas. Mike Henry, OpenSlate's chief executive officer, said about one-third of its top 100 clients are currently avoiding news and politics on YouTube.

Some ad-sales executives said the technology used for brand safety is too blunt because it doesn't take into account the full context of how specific words are used in a news story or video. CNN.com and Gannett are creating technology intended to give advertisers a better way to assess a news story.

CNN.com said it is testing a new product dubbed SAM, for Sentiment Analysis Moderator, that uses machine learning to score its site's content for whether it will make readers feel "mostly negative," "somewhat negative," "neutral," "somewhat positive" or "mostly positive."

CNN tested the system by having it score 70,000 videos and articles, then having human editors review the content to see whether the technology worked. The company is testing the system with some advertisers who want to buy ads based on sentiment.

Allison Murphy, senior vice president for ad innovation at New York Times Co., said the company now offers several different ad-targeting options. "We can satisfy a brand that is fine with politics but doesn't want to be around President Trump," she said.

In May, representatives of several companies, including CNN.com, USA Today and the Journal met to discuss how they could work with ad agencies and measurement companies to devise a way to move the sector beyond keyword blacklists, according to people familiar with the meetings.

The "overreliance on long keyword blacklists has a real cost" to both publishers and brands, said Josh Stinchcomb, global chief revenue officer of the Journal and Barron's, both owned by News Corp. "To that end, we are building proprietary tools that ensure brand safety."

The Washington Post also is using new technologies that help advertisers gauge the context of stories.

Some news publishers, including CNN.com and USA Today, are producing and promoting more ad-friendly lifestyle, technology, business and sports content.

"If a client says to us, 'We are just really not comfortable with news,' unlike some of our competitors, we don't have to say, 'Let me talk to you about why you should run in news,'" said Michael Kuntz, chief operating officer of national sales at USA Today Network, which includes USA Today and more than 100 local news outlets.

Still, he said, "the future of the digital news space is heavily reliant on us continuing to change the perception around why news does not need to be a polarizing category."

Good day. Back in January 2018, WeWork hosted an event at the Theater at Madison Square Garden and handed out some $3 million in prize money. The New York event was hosted by Justin Baldoni, star of "Jane the Virgin," and capped by a performance by rapper Macklemore.

"Who'll pay for that?" asked WeWork's co-founder and Chief Executive Adam Neumann when he took the stage that evening. "Well, Masa will." He was referring to Softbank Group Corp.'s CEO Masayoshi Son.

He wasn't kidding.

The company's IPO documents show that Mr. Son's SoftBank owns WeWork's Creator Fund, which the company established "to promote our business through award programs." SoftBank has spent $51 million on these events so far, out of $180 million that the firm committed, the filing shows.

Another over-the-top soiree related to Mr. Neumann took place earlier this year. This time, it was the lavish launch of U.K. energy startup Faraday Grid in which Mr. Neumann personally invested 25 million. That company is now in insolvency.

Buoy Health Gets $15 Million for  Digital Triage' Technology; Startup aims to help individuals, employees, health plan members make better use of medical resources

Startup Buoy Health Inc. has collected $15 million in fresh capital to expand an artificial intelligence-based technology designed to help individuals use medical resources more effectively.

Several startups offer AI-based tools to medical professionals or researchers. These include companies such as HealthReveal Inc., which uses AI to help physicians provide optimal care. Boston-based Buoy instead focuses on consumers, health insurers and self-insured businesses and aims to serve as an AI-powered front door into the medical system.

Common aches and pains cause many people reflexively to go to the emergency room. Individuals can plug symptoms into Buoy's website and learn more about when they should seek medical care and the type of care they need.

For example, according to Buoy co-founder and Chief Executive Andrew Le, people frequently go to the emergency room because of abdominal pain. Buoy's system can lend insight into whether that pain is a concern or likely just constipation, Dr. Le said.

Buoy doesn't charge consumers, but it does sell its services to health insurers and businesses looking to improve health outcomes for their members or employees. Buoy's system also can help plan members or employees determine where to seek medical services that are covered by their insurance, Dr. Le said.

Buoy serves as a personal guide to the health-care system but doesn't render diagnoses or deliver medical care. It can, however, enable a handoff to medical care, according to Dr. Le. It could, for example, identify a telemedicine provider covered under a person's insurance and point the person to that service.

Buoy raised this Series B financing from Hambrecht Ducera Growth Ventures, which led the round, and F-Prime Capital Partners, Humana Inc. and Optum Ventures. It previously disclosed a $6.7 million Series A round in August 2017.
